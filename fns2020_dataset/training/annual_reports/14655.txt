Strategic report Governance Financial statements Positioning the Group for growth
Last year, we set out our strategy to restore revenue to growth 
in 2014 which would fund the necessary investment in product 
development and expansion of sales and marketing activities 
for the long term growth of the business. We highlighted that we 
had undertaken a radical reorganisation of the activities within 
Spirent with the key strategic objective of creating long term 
value by harnessing Spirent’s leading capabilities and talent 
and that this would take time to be fully reflected in the financial 
performance of the Company. 2014 was Eric Hutchinson’s first full 
year as Chief Executive. He and his new team have re-energised 
the Company and laid the foundations for future growth. 
It is pleasing to report that Group revenue increased by 11 per 
cent to $457.2 million (2013 $413.5 million) of which $18.6 million 
came from acquisitions made during the year. Revenue grew 
in all divisions and in all regions. This achievement was against 
a backdrop of some strong headwinds and changes in the 
markets that we serve, particularly in the third quarter. After 
achieving 16 per cent growth in revenue in the first half of 2014, 
we saw a significant slowdown in the second half in our service 
provider ecosystem in North America as a major customer 
reorganised and paused in its investment cycle. 
Chairman’s statement
Alex Walker

In 2014 we have laid  
the foundations for 
returning the Group 
to growth
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2014
6 Employees
Spirent is its employees. We have highly skilled and creative 
employees and as a communications technology company, 
our employees and their capabilities hold the key to the long 
term prosperity of the Company. I would like to thank all our 
employees for their hard work and commitment to the future 
success of the Group.
Dividends
The final dividend recommended is 2.21 cents per share 
compared with 2.01 cents per share in 2013. This brings the 
total dividend for 2014 to 3.89 cents per share compared with 
3.54 cents for 2013. The increase in total dividend per share is 
10 per cent. In sterling terms this also represents an increase 
in the distribution to our shareholders of 10 per cent.
Board changes
In February 2014, we welcomed Rachel Whiting to the Board 
as Chief Financial Officer. Ian Brindle, our Senior Independent 
Director, and Chair of the Audit Committee, was appointed to the 
Board in December 2006 and has signalled his intention to step 
down from the Board. We are in the process of recruiting his 
replacement and we are delighted to report that Sue Swenson 
has agreed to succeed Ian as Senior Independent Director. 
Outlook
Following the sharp slowdown in the United States at some of our 
customers in the third quarter of 2014, we saw a marked uplift in 
business at the end of the year. 
Whilst there continue to be near term uncertainties and volatility 
we expect to see an increased level of demand for our solutions 
and services as the year unfolds, which will result in a greater than 
usual second half weighting. This will be exacerbated by the later 
timing of the shipment of a major contract for hand-held test tools 
of $16 million in the second half of 2015 compared with $12 million 
shipped in the first quarter of 2014. 
The Board remains confident that further progress will be achieved 
during 2015 and that the Group will benefit from continued 
investment to create long term strategic value. We have a number 
of major new solutions that will be delivered to the market in the 
second half of 2015 and we will continue to pursue areas of 
opportunity to expand the markets we serve.
Alex Walker
Chairman
We also saw structural changes in the smartphone market and 
intense competition over a lower level of demand. Whilst the 
year-on-year increase in the second half slowed to 6 per cent, 
the fourth quarter saw strong demand with revenue up 9 per 
cent over the same period in 2013.
The growth in revenue has enabled us to fund the planned 
additional investment in product development and in sales 
and marketing that we highlighted in last year’s Annual Report. 
Innovation is at the heart of any technology company and 
Spirent invested $115.4 million in product development in 2014, 
an organic increase of 8 per cent over 2013. During the year, as 
part of Spirent’s continuing strategic investment programme, we 
released 85 new solutions and functionality which enhance our 
competitive advantage and spearhead future sales growth.
Additional investment of $12.9 million in sales and marketing, 
excluding the effect of acquisitions during the year, has enabled 
us to build on our customer relationships, drive development 
of and access to markets, and to gain market share.
Return on sales based on adjusted operating profit was 10 per 
cent for the Group, down from 12 per cent last year, reflecting the 
impact of the investment in the business to drive recovery and 
long term growth.
Basic earnings per share for the Group decreased in 2014 to 
3.35 cents per share (2013 5.10 cents). Adjusted basic earnings 
per share was 5.82 cents (2013 5.71 cents); this is before charging 
exceptional items, acquisition related costs, acquired intangible 
asset amortisation and impairment and share-based payment.
The Group’s free cash flow generation was $10.7 million in 2014 
(2013 $43.9 million), a cash conversion ratio of 0.5 times reported 
earnings (2013 1.3 times). The Company has no debt and cash 
balances were $99.8 million at 31 December 2014.
Acquisitions
Spirent made good progress in its strategy of acquiring new 
capabilities and technologies, completing a number of focused 
acquisitions during 2014 for a total consideration of $85.9 million 
funded out of Spirent’s existing cash resources. As a Board we 
evaluate each acquisition opportunity to ensure that it meets 
our strategic objectives as well as the financial hurdles set for 
investment. 
In February 2014 Spirent acquired DAX Technologies Corp. and 
also a majority stake of 58 per cent of Testing Technologies IST 
GmbH. In July, we acquired the assets of the Radvision Technology 
Business Unit and then finally in September Mobilethink A/S and 
its wholly owned subsidiary, Tweakker ApS. These acquisitions are 
discussed in the Financial review. All of our 2014 acquisitions are 
on track to deliver revenue and profit growth.
We very much welcome the employees of all these companies 
into the Spirent Group.

The changing requirements of mobile connectivity
Mobile connectivity is served by Spirent’s Wireless & 
Service Experience division and the Mobility business 
within Networks & Applications.
New trends in mobile voice, video, data and devices are 
coming at a time when consumers are using their mobile 
services in ways that previous generations did not, by 
constantly tapping the mobile networks. The industry is 
moving beyond debating the benefits of voice over LTE 
(“VoLTE”) to discuss strategies for deployment. According 
to research, worldwide VoLTE services revenue is expected 
to reach $6.8 billion by 2018, with a significant proportion 
coming from Asia Pacific. 
The opportunity for carrier Wi-Fi hotspots is heating up, 
as mobile operators position Wi-Fi as equivalent to mobile 
broadband. The overwhelming demand for mobile data services 
is making mobile operators seek ways to closely integrate 
Wi-Fi with the mobile network – either by offering carrier 
hotspots or by offloading some mobile data traffic to a Wi-Fi 
network. In 2015 we expect to witness Wi-Fi supporting the 
same service priorities as mobile broadband services. Infonetics 
Research predicts revenue to hit $3.0 billion by 2018 with a 
five-year compound annual growth rate (”CAGR”) of 42 per cent.
Market trends 
We are pursuing the many 
opportunities to grow that 
exist within our served 
and adjacent markets 
through a strategy of 
continued investment 
in product development, 
partnerships and 
acquisitions.
Market potential
We continue to grow our share of addressable markets 
covering Ethernet networks and services, cloud and 
virtualization, wireless and mobility, security, satellite 
navigation, and positioning and customer experience 
management and in 2014 we had a combined market 
share of 22 per cent across our primary addressable 
markets totalling $2 billion.

2014 was when the communications ecosystem surged ahead 
towards an age of hyper-connectivity with machine-to-machine 
(“M2M”) and the internet of things (“IoT”) leading the way. Starting 
with home security systems controlled via the smartphone to 
connected vehicles, M2M and IoT are transforming industries 
and creating tremendous opportunities. According to Infonetics 
Research, mobile M2M module-based solutions are most 
successful for use in cases that require mobility, rapid deployment 
and wide area coverage. Automotive, transport and logistics has 
many use cases with these requirements. Infonetics predicts that 
the mobile M2M modules market will grow from $2 billion in 2015 
to $4.5 billion in 2018. 
As service providers strive to do more than just offer larger 
pipes, their ability to leverage customer data becomes a key 
competitive advantage. Spirent entered this market with the 
acquisition of DAX technologies in 2014. According to Heavy 
Reading, while service providers do not have a dearth of data, 
they are nonetheless lacking actionable insight from that data. 
Using analytics, service providers are able to pierce through the 
mountain of data to get actionable insight that will help them 
increase revenues, reduce CAPEX, build customer loyalty and 
improve customer experience. The Heavy Reading report states 
that of the three identified business application categories, 
customer experience enhancement will grow the most – from 
$546 million in 2013 to $3.6 billion in 2020, with a CAGR of 
approximately 31 per cent.
Spirent’s portfolio of solutions gives us the unique ability  
to test, validate, and analyse communication networks, 
connected devices and emerging services in a world of 
expanding interconnectivity and complexity. Our focus on 
testing emerging wireless technology, automotive networking 
and M2M communications, as well as delivering customer and 
network analytics, allows us to meet the challenges of the 
changing communications ecosystem and the opportunities 
it presents.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements We saw many fundamental changes in the data communications 
industry in 2014, which in turn caused uncertainty and volatility in 
demand across all sectors, customer types and regions. Changes 
in technologies and deployment of virtual networks challenge 
established products and business models, but change also 
creates opportunity, driving new business for Spirent. Constantly 
evolving and developing data technologies demand new test 
methodologies and solutions, the lifeblood of Spirent’s business. 
There are a number of major themes which are driving these 
changes, and it is in these areas that we see significant 
opportunities for our business. We have divided these 
opportunities into six specific growth categories, as follows:
High speed Ethernet
One of the major themes for fundamental change in our industry 
is the continued exponential growth in network bandwidth. 
In particular, the transport of video across our networks has 
continued to create the need for faster networks. In 2015, 
we will see widespread deployment of 100G networks by 
the service providers and the trialling of 400G. 
Maintaining performance at these speeds requires precise 
equipment and sophisticated testing techniques. Spirent will 
continue to invest in its core products to help its customers 
meet these rapidly growing bandwidth demands.

Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2014
10 Analytics
There is more data than ever being generated on the network, 
at the cell site and on user equipment. Service providers are keen 
to analyse this data as it helps them improve customer retention, 
increase revenue and strengthen market share. Data analytics also 
improve information accuracy and increases operational efficiency, 
all of which leads to an enhanced experience for the service 
providers’ customers.
For customers trying to analyse the experience across their 
network, disparate data silos make it hard to get a complete view. 
Spirent’s Customer Experience Management (“CEM”) solutions 
bring together data from different silos, helping our customers 
to pinpoint and resolve problems fast. Additionally, our device 
analytics offerings improve decision making in all areas of the 
operator’s business, including marketing, sales, customer care 
and network infrastructure, and as input for targeted campaigns.
Adjacent markets
The acquisition of key protocols and test tools and solutions have 
reinforced our capabilities to assure the testing of the provision 
of connectivity for machine-to-machine, the internet of things, 
indeed, the internet of everything. 
Spirent has made inroads into providing new capabilities  
in automotive data and connected cars, again acquiring 
technologies during the year. These are laying the foundations 
for long term market expansion and diversification.
Our approach
The vision for Spirent is to be recognised as the leading expert 
in test methodologies for data communications. Spirent has the 
technical capabilities to satisfy the needs created by all of the 
above opportunities and is differentiated compared with other 
test and measurement suppliers in having such a wide portfolio of 
capabilities. Spirent exists to create solutions to solve customers’ 
problems, to reduce time to market, to ensure quality of service 
and of experience, to create value through more efficient and 
effective development engineering and operations and to optimise 
our customers’ capital expenditure and ensure their customers’ 
brand reputation is protected. The implementation of Agile 
software development, continuous integrated test optimization 
and automation by our customers is transitioning Spirent’s 
business to be consultative, to focus on the business case for the 
customer and to create test solutions and methodologies utilising 
all the capabilities across the Spirent portfolio and the integration 
of third party products and services. Nowhere is this more 
pertinent than in the move to NFV and SDN. The implementation 
of these technologies enables far more rapid system provisioning, 
to turn up new services, more effective utilisation of resources and 
lower costs to operators. Spirent has leading capabilities in virtual 
test methodologies, working closely with the innovators in this 
industry to develop test standards.
The dynamic nature of the markets which Spirent serves can be 
seen in this review. We are making investment decisions to target 
those areas which offer the most value to our existing and future 
customers. This in turn will deliver the best return on investment 
for the Company. Uncertainty and volatility are expected to 
continue through the near term followed by a renewed level of 
demand for services and solutions as the industry invests in the 
next wave of deployment.

Cloud and virtualization
Many parts of the service providers’ networks are being virtualized. 
This virtualization is causing the established ways of deployment 
of data technologies (through ever-increasing capital investment 
in complex hardware) to become a commoditised market. This, 
in turn, means that service providers, multiple service operators 
and internet service suppliers are significantly reorganising their 
business processes and seeking new ways to provide content to 
subscribers, beyond traditional data networks. The virtualization of 
networks, also referred to as software-defined networking (“SDN”) 
or network functions virtualization (“NFV”), is aimed at increasing 
the elasticity of network provisioning to provide on-demand 
service creation through a dynamic programmable network. 
It is blurring the boundaries that exist in current legacy networks. 
Spirent’s test solutions ensure that the performance of the virtual 
network can be assessed, the availability of the services can be 
ascertained, that the provision is secure and scalability can be 
measured. The emerging virtual network will need to coexist with the 
legacy network for an extended period of time. Here Spirent enables 
the emulation in laboratory modelling to be taken into the live network 
to provide continuous assurance in the hybrid virtual/physical world. 
Security
The concern over cyber security is ever present and becoming 
more challenging. The interconnection of devices, systems and 
networks that were never originally intended to be connected 
is creating new vulnerabilities for enterprise, government and in 
critical infrastructures. The constant availability of network services 
is the over-arching concern and cyber security threats, intrusion 
and denial of service attacks all impact on network availability. 
In this area, Spirent’s ability to provide realism in test traffic 
enables our customers to optimise the balance between defence 
and the continued service provision. Spirent has invested in the 
development of more realistic emulation of real-world traffic to 
test applications and security and will add more capabilities 
through 2015. 
In addition, Spirent has the technology to test satellite navigation 
vulnerability, not only to allow the strengthening of defences in 
navigation but also to test the resilience of systems that utilise 
satellite navigation time signals in critical systems. Security will 
be a major line of business for Spirent in the near future.
Mobility
Mobile communications continues to see rapid deployment of 
new high speed high density data communications. Existing 
revenue streams from telephony are altering with the deployment 
of digital technologies across all networks, wireline or wireless. 
The polarisation of the smartphone market is well documented 
as is the rise of new manufacturers challenging the position of 
newly dominant suppliers. Wireless carriers need to optimise their 
investment in the deployment of 4G LTE, Wi-Fi offload and small 
cell. They are also deploying digital voice through VoLTE, which 
in turn enables the provision of rich communication services. 
Interoperability challenges are now the main theme in this industry 
and Spirent has developed the world’s first test platform to enable 
interoperability test on device-to-device systems and on emulated 
network domains. Our leading capabilities in mobile infrastructure 
test are facilitating the rapid deployment of 4G LTE networks which 
allows wireless carriers to model traffic patterns in advance of 
significant capital expenditure, meaning they optimise their 
investment and provide the best quality of service to subscribers.

We innovate through the endeavours of our highly skilled and creative people 
who build on decades of experience. External inputs are also important both 
through our engagement with industry standards bodies and our close 
alignment with our customers who lead innovation in the industries we serve. 
Spirent has created a large body of intellectual property, patented and 
proprietary, so raising the barriers of entry to competition.
Customers 
The strong and lasting relationships we have with our customers are a 
fundamental element of Spirent’s business model. Spirent’s customers 
are some of the largest global telecommunications corporations, and 
maintaining and expanding these close relationships are vital to 
Spirent’s reputation and success.
We also strive to provide our customers with the highest possible quality of 
support and service. We work very closely alongside our customers and this 
gives us a deep understanding of the challenges they face and means that we 
focus on bringing the right solutions to market at the time when our customers 
need them most.
Financial discipline
To underpin our strengths and ensure that Spirent has the financial 
flexibility to be able to invest for the future, both organically and through 
strategic acquisition, we maintain strong internal controls and a robust 
balance sheet with a significant cash balance and no debt.

Business model
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2014
12 Value-creation
Spirent’s value proposition is based on providing our 
customers with easy-to-use solutions for testing and 
measuring their complex systems. We have a broad 
portfolio of test solutions which span the entire product 
lifecycle from concept to commercial availability, 
delivering efficiency and that enable development 
engineers to make better use of their scarce resources. 
Our customers attain key value-creation through using our 
solutions to: 
 –reduce the time taken to get their products and systems 
to market;
 –gain competitive advantage and maximise revenue;
 –ensure the quality of their products, systems and services;
 –protect their brand reputation; and
 –increase the efficiency of their operations through the 
automation and utilisation of data that optimises their 
activities and capital expenditure. 
Our solutions enable customers to test the security of their 
systems, networks and processes in a world where cyber 
attacks, denial of service and falsification of positioning data 
are increasing every day.
Much of Spirent’s revenue comes from follow on business 
with customers who have worked with us for many years. 
This is a result of a combination of our ability to innovate to 
meet their needs and our emphasis on providing first class 
professional service and support. All of the above, with 
the optimal utilisation of our own resources, supports the 
sustainability of the high gross margins Spirent achieves. 
Annual support and maintenance fees and royalty income are 
further important sources of continuing revenue for Spirent. 
Most of our manufacturing is outsourced to sub-contractors 
and our business is not capital intensive; hence the conversion 
of earnings into cash is typically high for the business, which 
gives Spirent the capacity to reinvest organically through 
product development, by the acquisition of technology, or 
through access to new served markets.

18 4. Benchmark study reveals VoL TE 
outperforms both 3G circuit switched 
voice and Skype
With OTT services such as Skype being readily available to mobile 
users, the driver behind VoLTE deployment is the opportunity for 
wireless carriers to provide a guaranteed quality of service for voice 
services on their LTE network. A study validated that, although both 
VoLTE and Skype support HD Voice, VoLTE-specific features 
deliver a much higher quality service to the mobile user. 
“Although conceptually I understood the potential benefits of 
VoLTE, it wasn’t until we analysed the results that we collected 
with Spirent that I truly appreciated the incremental benefits 
that VoLTE offers.” Michael Thelander, President of Signals 
Research Group. 
In this study, Spirent Nomad was used to measure call quality 
and to control and capture performance data. Spirent Quantum 
was used to measure power consumption, current drain and 
the implied battery life. Spirent Datum was used to simulate 
real-world data usage.

Testing ESA’s Galileo
When complete, Galileo, Europe’s Global Navigation Satellite 
System (“GNSS”), will join GPS, GLONASS and other systems in 
providing positioning services across the world.
Thales Alenia Space has been involved with the delivery of the 
European Space Agency’s (“ESA”) Galileo programme to assist 
with the development of the Galileo receivers.
“The Spirent solution was selected because it met our very 
demanding quality and performance criteria. And since taking 
delivery of the simulator in our labs it has met our expectations 
and worked very well.” Tiziano Sassorossi, Program Manager at 
Thales Alenia Space.
A Spirent Multi-Constellation Simulator was chosen to meet the 
company’s unique testing needs. This solution provided accuracy, 
flexibility and reliability allowing the ongoing development of 
Europe’s GNSS. Galileo is a joint initiative between the European 
Space Agency and the European Commission.

Spirent monitors growth in revenue  
as this shows how successful Spirent 
has been in expanding its markets  
and growing its customer base. 
The goal is to achieve year-on-year top-line growth and 
revenue for the Group increased in total by 11 per cent 
in 2014. Excluding acquisitions growth was 6 per cent. 
All of our divisions grew revenue in 2014, despite a 
background of much change in our industry.
Our revenue growth demonstrates all the aspects of 
our strategy; our success in expanding our markets 
both organically and through acquisition; maintaining 
technology leadership; and our strong relationships 
with our customers, all of which ensure that we 
continue to win and maintain business.

The goal is to achieve year-on-year growth and 
despite revenue growth adjusted operating profit fell 
to $46.0 million. Gross margin was maintained at 
69 per cent of revenue however, as announced in 
2013, Spirent stepped up its investment in product 
development, sales and marketing and support 
services which grew organically by $24.4 million. 
Adjusted operating profit is a direct consequence

Return on sales was lower at 10 per cent as a result 
of the planned increase in investment and the effect 
of the overheads in the acquired businesses of 
$12.9 million. For 2015 the aim is to improve the return 
through good cost management; however, Spirent 
must also remain mindful of the need to invest for 
future growth.
This is a measure of how successful we are in

Cash generation is a measure of the 
quality of Spirent’s earnings. The aim 
is to achieve a high conversion of 
earnings into cash. 
Cash conversion was lower in 2014 at 0.5 times (2013 
1.3 times) reported earnings. This was a consequence 
of a number of factors, including:
 – large increase in working capital with higher activity 
skewed towards the end of 2014; and
 – high capital investment which includes cost of new 
improved leasehold facilities of $9.5 million on the 
expiry of the previous leases.
Having strong free cash generation reflects 
Spirent’s ability to generate funds for future 
investment. It allows us to maintain financial 
strength and flexibility.
The Board has identified the following 
key performance indicators (“KPIs”) to 
measure the Group’s strategic progress. 
Spirent’s strategy focuses on medium to long term growth and 
therefore its achievement cannot just be measured by looking 
at performance in 2014 compared to the prior year; trends over 
a number of years must also be considered. KPIs relate to 
continuing operations only.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements The principal risks and uncertainties which the directors believe 
are currently faced by the Spirent Group are discussed below 
together with the actions which have been developed to mitigate 
the effects.
It is not possible to identify every risk that could affect the 
business and the actions described below to mitigate those risks 
cannot provide absolute assurance that the risk will not occur 
or adversely affect the operating or financial performance of 
the Group. 
The Board has classified the principal risks by the impact the risk 
would be expected to have on the Group should it occur, and the 
anticipated likelihood that that risk may occur using the following 
classifications:
Impact High/Medium/Low
Likelihood of occurrence Likely/Possible/Unlikely
Likelihood of occurrence is based on qualitative factors such as 
past experience and current market conditions. Impact is based 
on the estimated degree of change in KPIs. The Board’s view of 
the change in likelihood of occurrence and/or in the impact on 
the Group (combined) of each risk compared with the prior year 
has also been provided.
Strong risk management underpins  
everything we do
Like all businesses, Spirent is exposed to a number of risks and 
uncertainties. These risks may arise from internal factors, but 
some will be a result of external factors over which the Group 
has little or no direct control. It is the effective management of 
these risks that supports Spirent in delivering on its strategic 
objectives, safeguards the Group’s assets and, over time, will also 
enhance shareholder value. The process to identify and manage 
the principal risks and uncertainties of the Spirent Group are an 
integral component of the internal control system and are 
described below. 
Further information on Spirent’s internal control systems can be 
found in the Directors’ statement on corporate governance. 
Risk management structure
The risk assessment process starts in the businesses where 
up-to-date risk registers are maintained as an integral part of 
the normal operating and control procedures. Each business 
identifies its key risks and nominates a risk owner. The impact 
and the likelihood of occurrence of each risk is ranked, which 
assists the Group Executive Committee in assessing the 
importance of each risk to the Spirent Group as a whole. 
Once risks have been assessed an appropriate risk mitigation 
response is determined for each risk identified. The individual 
businesses are required to update their risk registers as new 
or emerging risks are identified.
The Audit Committee reviews and monitors the Group’s risk 
process and reports to the Board on its effectiveness. Risk is 
considered by the Audit Committee at least three times per 
year, at which time risk registers for both the Group and the 
material business units within the Group are reviewed by the 
Committee. The Audit Committee challenge and debate the 
risks with reference to risk tolerance and appetite, as set by the 
Board. Progress made and any further actions to be taken 
regarding mitigation plans, as well as any changes to the risk 
profile, are discussed in detail.

24 The Board has identified the following principal risks, each of which is discussed below:
Risk Potential impact Mitigation actions
Macro-economic 
Spirent is a global business exposed to the 
current world economic conditions, over which it 
has no control. The business is also exposed to 
government spending priorities, principally in the 
United States. 
Deterioration in economic conditions may lead to 
a reduction in the level of demand for Spirent’s 
products and services and cause customers to 
delay their purchasing decisions.
The Group closely monitors both market and 
geographic trends in order to respond to changes in 
demand and be in a position to take timely 
actions to protect profitability where possible.
In addition, Spirent has a large number of 
geographically diverse customers, which mitigates 
the impact.
Technology change
Spirent sells complex solutions in industries that 
are characterised by rapid technological changes. 
Keeping at the forefront of these key future 
technologies is critical to our success and to ensure 
that we remain competitive in our markets.
It is critical that our product development 
investment is directed at the right areas to 
enable Spirent to develop those solutions that our 
customers need in a timely manner.
Spirent’s success is dependent in part on 
proprietary technology which may be infringed 
by others, inadvertently or otherwise. Protecting 
the Group’s proprietary technology is important 
to enabling Spirent to compete successfully.
If product development investment does 
not keep pace with the speed of change in 
technology, or if it is not directed at the right key 
areas, our competitive position and financial 
performance will suffer. 
If Spirent’s solutions take longer to develop than 
anticipated or longer to develop than our 
competitors then our competitive position and 
financial performance will also suffer. 
Intellectual property claims can result in significant 
defence costs, and may affect Spirent’s ability to 
market its products.
All Spirent’s businesses work very closely 
with customers and remain focused on 
their requirements. 
Each business makes investment decisions 
specifically related to their solutions portfolio 
based on market needs. This happens through our 
formalised Gate Process that has been in place for 
many years. 
Spirent continues to make a significant investment 
in product development. In 2014 the investment was 
increased to $115.4 million in order to underpin 
organic growth initiatives. 
Spirent has active intellectual property protection 
programmes in place to obtain appropriate 
intellectual property protection in a cost-
effective manner.

Customer dependence
The Group sells its solutions and services to a 
wide range of companies and seeks to continually 
expand its customer base. In 2014 no one customer 
accounted for 10 per cent or more of Group 
revenue although the top 10 customers 
represented 35 per cent of Group revenue. In some 
of our markets certain customers have a dominant 
market share, which makes doing business with 
these customers critical to the success of our 
business.
In addition, many of the companies with which 
we do business are some of the largest global 
telecommunications corporations and therefore 
meeting our development obligations, producing 
high quality products, and in an appropriate 
timescale, are vital to Spirent’s reputation 
and success.
Changes in our major customers’ priorities in 
technology investments can also have a significant 
impact on their spending on Spirent products by 
those in the customers’ supply chain.
The industry continues to experience consolidation 
which can disrupt the spending patterns of those 
customers affected.
Loss of one or more of Spirent’s major customers 
could have a significant impact on Spirent’s 
financial results.
Significant failings in either quality or being able to 
deliver in the appropriate timescale could cause 
long lasting damage to Spirent’s reputation and 
relationships.
Customer consolidation could result in delays in 
spending thereby reducing demand for Spirent’s 
solutions and services, and also reduce the 
potential number of customers to whom those 
solutions and services could be sold.
Changes in our customers’ technology investments 
can result in reduced spending on our existing 
solutions before customers, and those in the 
supply chain, ramp up spending on new 
technologies.
Spirent’s strong customer relationships are critical 
as is providing innovative solutions which meet 
customers’ needs and Spirent’s emphasis on 
providing professional service and support. 
Many customers have worked with the Group 
for a number of years.
One of the Group’s strategic objectives is to 
deepen our customer relationships. We place 
engineers on-site with our customers and 
undertake site surveys of the use, and intended 
plans for the use, of test solutions in their business. 
We seek to establish thought leadership in our 
industry through participation in standards 
bodies and industry forums, which in turn creates 
additional links with customers. Our strategy is to 
play a key part in the ecosystem of supply in our 
served markets by aligning with early adopters 
of technology and with chip developers.
Competition
All Spirent’s businesses operate in highly 
competitive markets which experience rapid 
technological changes. Establishing and 
maintaining technological differentiation in 
our solutions is key to our success.
The Group faces competition from new market 
start-ups as well as the more established and 
well-resourced companies.
Industry consolidation amongst our direct 
competitors may bring about a shift in 
competitive advantages.
Actions by competitors and increased competition 
can bring about pressure on Spirent’s gross 
margin. These factors could also affect Spirent’s 
competitive position, thereby reducing revenue 
and consequently affecting financial results.
The Group’s broad solution portfolio, market-
leading capabilities and customer focus continue 
to address this risk.
Spirent aims to maintain market-leading positions 
through significant investment in the development 
of differentiated products.
Competitor activity is closely monitored with a view 
to maintaining clear differentiation based on 
Spirent’s products, services and global reach.

26 Risk Potential impact Mitigation actions
Acquisitions
A key element of Spirent’s strategy is to acquire 
new capabilities and technologies, and this may be 
through acquisition.
Integration of acquisitions can be a complex 
process and the results expected from acquisitions 
may not be achieved due to problems encountered 
in integration, changes in market conditions or 
sometimes deficiencies arising in the due 
diligence processes.
Underperformance by acquisitions will impact 
the Group’s results and may lead to impairment 
of goodwill and/or intangible assets.
During 2014 Spirent has completed five 
acquisitions, details of which are provided 
in note 32 of Notes to the consolidated 
financial statements.
Rigorous strategic and financial evaluations of all 
acquisition opportunities are carried out. Detailed 
financial and commercial due diligence are 
performed. The Board will only authorise 
transactions after all due diligence has been 
successfully completed and where the financial 
hurdles are within the agreed guidelines.
Integration plans and processes are carefully 
considered prior to acquisition.
The Board reviews post-acquisition performance.
Business continuity
Operational risks are present in the Group’s 
businesses. These risks include the risk of failed 
internal and external processes and systems, 
human error and external events, such as a 
natural disaster. For example a significant 
portion of our communications operations 
are located in California which has in the past 
experienced natural disasters, including 
earthquakes and wildfires.
Contract manufacturers are used for the 
manufacture of a substantial amount of Spirent’s 
products. The major contract manufacturer is 
located in Thailand.
The incidence of cyber security crime is on the 
rise. Spirent is dependent on its information 
technology systems for both internal and 
external communications as well as for its 
day-to-day operations.
A significant natural disaster could disrupt the 
Group’s ability to conduct business and adversely 
impact revenue and operating results.
Disruption or financial problems of contract 
manufacturers or limitations in the manufacturing 
capacity at contract manufacturers could either  
limit supply or increase cost.
If a cyber attack were to be successful it could 
result in loss of data, confidential information and 
damage to Spirent’s intellectual property, causing 
major disruption to the business.
An important component of Spirent’s corporate 
governance is its integrated risk management 
strategy and its regular self-assessment of 
risks encompassing all business units.
IT disaster recovery plans are in place for all 
core business systems and ensure that the wider 
operations are all fully covered. In addition, the 
Group’s largest manufacturing sub-contractor has 
worldwide multiple sites and comprehensive 
business continuity plans. 
Regular meetings are held with contract 
manufacturers and an on-site presence 
is maintained. To minimise the effect on supply 
that could be caused by disruption at contract 
manufacturers there are contingency plans in 
place to transfer manufacturing to other locations.
A cyber security and cybercrime diagnostics 
review has been performed during 2014. A new 
next-generation firewall has been installed 
which provides a high level of protection to 
the network.
Our people
Spirent is its employees, so attracting and retaining 
highly qualified and skilled employees is essential 
in enabling the Group to deliver on its strategy and 
to the success of the business.
Intense competition is faced for personnel from 
other companies and organisations and the loss of 
key employees, the failure to attract and retain 
other highly skilled employees, or the failure to 
adequately plan for succession may impair 
Spirent’s ability to run and expand the business 
effectively.
Investing in people is at the core of the Group’s 
strategy. The aim is to find, keep and engage the 
highest calibre of employees and encourage their 
contribution and development. An environment 
that fosters innovation and collaboration is critical 
to Spirent’s success, as is ensuring incentive plans  
are competitive. 
Succession planning for senior posts in the 
Company is regularly reviewed by the Board.
Appropriate career paths and internal recognition 
programmes are developed for both technical and 
non-technical staff. Further information on our 
employees is provided in Resources and 
relationships on pages 41 to 43.
The risks associated with achieving Spirent’s strategy are also considered in “Our strategy” on pages 14 and 15.

Operational review
Market conditions
The growth of video and other bandwidth-intensive services 
once again drove the requirement for faster networks, with 100G 
Ethernet deployments under way and many more expected in 
2015, along with an increase in trials of 400G Ethernet. We also 
saw 100G Ethernet push into data centers, expanding beyond its 
presence in core routers. 4G LTE network roll outs and the 
proliferation of applications and services continued to contribute 
to the rapid growth in mobile data as well as in signalling traffic. 
As 4G LTE coverage increased, deployment of VoLTE and other 
IMS-enabled services began in earnest in North America, and are 
expected to continue globally into 2015 and beyond. Access 
networks evolved with Wi-Fi offload solutions and deployment of 
the latest Wi-Fi technologies. Virtualization remained a major 
trend across all our markets. Service providers and their vendors 
continued to intensively explore how SDN and NFV can best be 
utilised to accelerate delivery of products and services. As a 
result, at least one top-tier service provider reorganised and 
paused its capital spending, with the associated impact on its 
vendors, while it undertook an organisation-wide investigation 
into a software-driven network based on SDN and NFV. In the 
applications and security space, 2014 saw numerous high profile 
attacks and breaches, from large retailers to media companies 
and financial institutions. These showcased the intense need to 
prevent cyber intrusions and led to a sharp rise in spending on 
cyber security by enterprise, government and large service 
providers. Along with the widespread adoption of Agile 
development processes has come the growth in “DevOps”, 
in which development engineers and operations participate 
together, from design to product test and support. Spirent’s ITO 
solutions are playing a key role in helping to automate these 
increasingly complex environments, reducing costs and 
accelerating time to market.
Revenue
Revenue in Networks & Applications grew by 4 per cent to 
$221.5 million from $213.4 million in 2013, with a book to bill 
ratio of 103 (2013 105).
On the back of the 4G LTE and VoLTE development trends 
identified above, we saw an increase in revenue for our mobility 
solutions in 2014. There was also growth in our high speed 
Ethernet solutions for service providers and data centers, 
revenue in our application and security market was flat, while 
our virtual solutions grew at triple digit rates. Support services 
revenue was 9 per cent up compared with 2013. Our ITO & 
Solutions business saw strong growth from professional services 
and from innovative continuous integration solutions for 
Agile development environments. From a regional perspective, 
revenue was down slightly in North America and APAC and up 
strongly in EMEA. 
Profitability
Operating profit before exceptional items was down to 
$7.6 million from $13.2 million in 2013. Increased investment of 
$13.6 million in product development, sales and marketing and 
support services offset gross margin from revenue growth. 
Gross margin increased to 68.3 per cent (2013 68.0 per cent) of 
revenue. Exceptional items of $2.3 million were charged for 
reorganisation expenses.

28 We think about the 
next big thing after 
the next big thing.
As bandwidth demand continues to grow, Ethernet speeds 
increase and the migration to virtual environments forges 
ahead, the need remains to deliver optimal performance, 
scalability and security.
Spirent is at the forefront of delivering innovative test 
solutions for the development of technologies such as 
400G Ethernet, long before they are implemented in a live 
environment. We are committed to delivering a flexible, 
scalable test architecture and efficient lab management to 
an emerging generation of cloud service providers and 
their vendors.
Product development
Spirent continued to expand its leadership in virtual, SDN and 
NFV, launching first to market SDN capabilities for service 
providers on Spirent TestCenter, helping to ensure a smooth 
migration to SDN while achieving optimal performance. In the 
mobility space, we announced expanded VoLTE and IMS test 
capabilities and new Wi-Fi test capabilities for our Landslide 
solution, together with a Landslide Virtual solution. Spirent 
made further contributions to advancing ultra-high bandwidth 
networking with release of a new high density 100G test solution 
supporting the latest-generation CFP4 optical transceiver 
interface. We also announced new MX2 modules for 10/40G 
Ethernet testing with best-in-class performance and realism, 
enabling enhanced reliability and security testing. In Applications 
and Security, we launched multiple enhancements to the 
Avalanche solution, including fuzzing, and the Avalanche NEXT 
solution won a 2014 Best of INTEROP award. Spirent announced 
the first fully integrated test solution to support the emerging 
industry standard for automotive Ethernet, reflecting the 
evolution of in-vehicle networks to support increasingly 
sophisticated electronics, including driver assistance 
technologies, infotainment systems and connected cars.  
Our ITO & Solutions business announced Velocity (a 2014 Best  
of INTEROP award finalist), a virtual lab environment that helps 
validate SDN/NFV technologies and deployments, helping 
customers accelerate time to market and reduce the costs 
associated with traditional virtual and physical test beds.
Strategy
For 2015, we will focus our investments to align with the 
continued rapid growth in network bandwidth requirements, in 
the virtualization of networks and in mobile access. We will grow 
our leadership in virtual, SDN and NFV, addressing not only our 
core network equipment manufacturer and service provider 
customer base, but also the new opportunities presented by 
“white box” vendors, cloud and virtualization specialists and 
software vendors, and a new generation of cloud service 
provider. For mobility, we will invest to address the development 
of software-centric evolved packet core networks and leverage 
our investment in VoLTE and Wi-Fi as these services roll out 
globally. Our applications and security test focus is on cyber 
security and the challenges of migrating to the cloud for 
enterprise, government and solution vendors, applying Spirent’s 
key strengths of realism and performance at scale. As the drivers 
for faster networks continue to intensify, Spirent will build its 
leadership in 100G Ethernet networking. Spirent was the first test 
and measurement vendor to show a working test solution for 
400G Ethernet, and we plan to continue our key role in enabling 
high speed Ethernet technologies and the associated industry 
standards. We will expand our ITO & Solutions business to 
address the opportunities presented by automation, DevOps, 
virtualization test and lab management, positioning Spirent as a 
trusted partner throughout our customers’ project lifecycle.

Market conditions 
In our Wireless & Service Experience markets, the economic 
pressure on top-tier global smartphone vendors continued into 
2014, a year characterised by local smartphone vendors’ market 
share gains in key growth markets such as China and India. 
However, Spirent benefitted from the development phase of 
important 4G LTE services and the focus on user experience of 
those services, especially VoLTE and other IMS-enabled services 
such as Rich Communication Suite (“RCS”). 2014 saw the first 
large scale VoLTE and RCS roll outs in North America, with global 
deployments following in 2015 and beyond as LTE coverage 
becomes ubiquitous. Enhancements to 4G technology (“LTE-
Advanced”) such as carrier aggregation were also widely 
deployed to improve performance, spectrum utilisation and 
coverage. 4G network build-outs continued apace in China and 
impressive subscriber growth followed, with China Mobile 
claiming more than 90 million 4G subscribers by the end of the 
year. The importance of wireless M2M connectivity continued to 
rise as the internet of things became a reality and began to 
change the way in which people live, from smart homes to 
connected vehicles. In our Positioning markets, applications 
grew for multi-GNSS technologies, such as BeiDou with GPS 
and GLONASS, and were a significant driver for both government 
and commercial customers, including the emerging “wearable” 
technology sector. The growing concern over the vulnerability 
of GNSS receivers to interference, including jamming and 
spoofing (attempting to deceive a GNSS receiver by 
broadcasting counterfeit GNSS signals), is becoming an 
important market driver.
Revenue
Wireless experienced modest growth in its mobile device test 
markets as a result of strength in 4G carrier ecosystems in China, 
and continued worldwide investment in 4G LTE technologies and 
services, especially in VoLTE. Service Experience also grew, 
primarily in North America, as a result of expanding its portfolio  
to include more services for device vendors. Positioning also 
saw modest growth year-on-year, with a strong performance 
in commercial markets due to the launch of innovative new 
solutions that took market share being offset by government 
spending restrictions in some regions. The former Radvision 
TBU acquired by Spirent in July contributed $4.2 million in 
revenue, and Testing Technologies IST GmbH $2.3 million. 
Overall revenue was up by $10.9 million to $178.6 million from 
$167.7 million in 2013 giving an organic revenue growth rate of 
3 per cent for this division. Book to bill ratio grew to 102 from 
101 at the end of 2013. 
Profitability 
Operating profit before exceptional items was $24.0 million 
compared with $33.8 million in 2013, as high gross margin on 
the increased revenue was more than offset by the increase 
in investment in product development, sales and marketing and 
support services of $9.4 million. Gross margin was 68.0 per cent 
compared with 69.4 per cent in 2013 due to product mix. 
The resulting return on sales reduced to 13.4 per cent compared 
with 20.2 per cent in 2013. Exceptional reorganisation costs of 
$0.9 million were charged in 2014.

30 We think about the 
internet of everything.
Smartphones have become ubiquitous, and Spirent plays 
a major role in ensuring the performance of these devices 
and the services they enable, yet to date only a tiny 
fraction of all the “things” in the world that could be 
connected to the internet have been.
With a broad and deep expertise in wireless connectivity 
and services, Spirent is well positioned to advance 
the development of wireless machine-to-machine 
communications that underpins the “internet of things”, 
accelerating its deployment in everything from smart 
homes to connected vehicles. 
in smartphones and M2M devices. With the deployment of 
services such as VoLTE and RCS, legacy test solutions are no 
longer able to support the associated increases in complexity, 
interoperability challenges and time to market requirements. To 
address this evolving need, in September Spirent announced its 
Elevate Test Framework, a powerful network of resources 
designed to address the wireless industry’s increasingly complex 
testing challenges and scale demands. Elevate’s unique open 
test architecture disrupts the status quo in test and measurement, 
with its ability to evaluate device, service and user experience 
performance in the lab earlier in the development lifecycle and 
generate meaningful analytics that can be shared across global 
development teams. Elevate also incorporates the ProLab test 
suite, an asset acquired with Radvision’s TBU. ProLab is a widely 
accepted solution in the industry which leverages the Radvision 
TBU team’s expertise in voice and video over IP, including VoLTE. 
We launched an Acoustic Verification System, the industry’s first 
bench-top system that enables operators to incorporate 
sophisticated acoustic speech analysis into their forward and 
reverse device logistics processes, driving substantial cost 
savings and an improved user experience. The business also 
launched Quantum, an automated system for measuring and 
driving improvements in the battery life of mobile devices under 
typical consumer use cases, as well as a new IP analytics 
capability for improving the user experience of VoLTE and other 
IP-based services. Our Positioning business significantly 
extended its industry leadership with the launch of the GSS9000, 
a high-end multi-GNSS solution which offers unrivalled 
performance, flexibility and cost-effectiveness.
Strategy
The strategy for Wireless & Service Experience centres around 
radically reducing time to market for new devices and services for 
its global customers and ecosystems while helping to ensure the 
highest quality and user experience. Spirent Elevate, the unique 
toolsets from Spirent’s Developer Tools (formerly Radvision TBU) 
business, and recent additions to its powerful portfolio of GNSS 
platforms are all examples of Spirent’s capability to help its 
customers reduce time to market for their products and services. 
Spirent is building leadership in testing the user experience of 
converged services and the devices that support them, including 
video, data and voice (such as VoLTE and voice over Wi-Fi) across 
the entire lifecycle, from development to initial deployment to 
issues that arise over the lifetime, including device returns. The 
addition of powerful analytic capabilities enabling customers to 
gain new insights into test data and correlate user experience 
metrics with IP-layer performance metrics accelerates the 
resolution of issues and improves the user experience.

Market conditions 
Overall service provider spend remained cautious. With 
investment in legacy now almost at a standstill, major carriers 
shifted their focus to research and evaluation of virtualization  
and how best to evolve their networks to incorporate its benefits. 
These trends resulted in a pause in investment in traditional 
probes by some key customers and early stage growth in 
demand for virtualized solutions. The rapid growth of video 
services and mobile subscriber data led to the need for more 
Ethernet “pipes” in backbone networks, increasing pressure to 
move to higher Ethernet speeds and better data analytics. 
Continued growth in the complexity of networks and services, 
coupled with intense competition between service providers  
and the fear of customer churn, has led to greater emphasis on 
customer experience management and on the value of big 
data analytics. It has also driven demand for powerful yet 
easy-to-use tools that technicians can employ to help manage 
the increasingly complex end point of the network: the 
customer’s home. Mobile operators struggle to keep abreast of 
the capabilities and technical requirements of the ever-expanding 
pool of new devices and OS versions coming onto their networks. 
To maintain a consistent, cost-efficient service and maximise 
their top-line, they are moving beyond device management to 
obtain intelligence on the limitations and potential of every 
device on their network. Spirent acquired Mobilethink in 
September 2014 to enable it to address this trend. 
Revenue
Overall revenue was up strongly by $24.7 million to $57.1 million 
in 2014, compared with $32.4 million in 2013. $12.6 million of 
this growth was organic, while the CEM business, acquired 
from DAX Technologies in February, contributed $10.1 million, 
growing its business at a major US service provider. The Device 
Intelligence business, acquired as Mobilethink in September, 
contributed $2.0 million in revenue in 2014. For our core Service 
Assurance business, field test revenue was particularly strong 
as we delivered a large 2013 order to a major North American 
service provider for a new version of our Tech-X Flex product. 
A second, larger order was placed in December by the same 
customer for delivery in the second half of 2015. The book to 
bill was 104 due to the large field test order and CEM projects 
awaiting completion.
Profitability
Adjusted operating profit was $20.7 million compared with 
$9.0 million in 2013 as a result of the significantly increased 
revenue. Gross margin was 76.2 per cent compared with 
77.8 per cent in 2013. The resulting return of sales increased 
to 36.3 per cent compared with 27.8 per cent in 2013.
Product development
We shipped a new version of our Tech-X Flex field test product 
that supports the latest generation of Wi-Fi technology (802.11ac) 
and in-home networking standard (MoCA 2.0), and incorporates 
new network data performance test methodologies. Current 
development work on field test solutions is focused on 
incorporating additional test methodologies and further 
improving ease of use, enabling use by technicians of all skill 
levels. In response to the increasingly important role played by 
SDN and NFV in cable and telecom operator networks, Spirent 
also announced Spirent TestCenter Live Virtual Probe which is,  
as the name suggests, a virtualized distributed Ethernet probe.  
Spirent Communications plc

32 We think about finding 
things that others don’t.
Today’s greater emphasis on customer experience 
management means finding and resolving issues more 
quickly, preferably before your customers are even aware 
of them.
Spirent is developing powerful yet easy-to-use tools 
to help manage the increasingly complex networking 
environment in the customer’s home. Our customer 
experience management software helps operators 
find network issues before their subscribers do, while 
our device intelligence tools help them seamlessly 
manage the exploding number of devices coming 
onto their networks.
In conjunction with the Spirent TestCenter Live Ethernet services 
platform, it allows operators to extend performance management 
to all points of their network, as well as to respond to the rapidly 
changing demands of new virtual environments and today’s 
fast paced network operations conditions. Our CEM business 
released new capability for LTE.
Strategy
The complexity of today’s networks and services and fierce 
competitive environment result in the need for service providers 
to assure the user experience of services end-to-end. Spirent 
aims to enable its customers to radically reduce time to resolve 
user experience degradation through end-to-end visibility and 
real-time automation and response. It will accomplish this by 
combining the Ethernet and in-home service assurance assets 
from Spirent’s core Service Assurance business with the analytics 
and CEM systems from the DAX Technologies acquisition and the 
device intelligence capabilities from the Mobilethink acquisition. 
As a result, Spirent will be able to assure networks and services 
at all layers of the protocol stack and to employ its analytics and 
CEM expertise to find and resolve user experience issues more 
quickly and efficiently. Spirent’s device intelligence and new 
predictive capabilities within its CEM systems will enable service 
providers to identify issues before subscribers are even aware of 
them, helping to maximise service revenues and minimise 
subscriber churn. Spirent enables its customers to get the turn-up 
of new services right first time, ensuring that they work at the 
bearer and transport layers and also at the increasingly complex 
end point of the network, the subscriber’s home, through 
Spirent’s unique field test offerings. We will also expand the 
scalability and cost-effectiveness of the solutions offered by our 
CEM business, expanding its analytics capabilities to applications 
across the Spirent portfolio. This will enable customers to 
correlate user experience metrics with IP-layer performance 
metrics to accelerate the resolution of issues and improve the 
user experience.

Rachel Whiting
Chief Financial Officer
Our strong balance 
sheet has enabled us 
to invest for the future 
both organically and 
through acquisition.
Revenue 
Group revenue increased by 11 per cent compared with the prior 
year to $457.2 million (2013 $413.5 million). The Group’s 2014 
acquisitions contributed revenue of $18.6 million during the year 
and excluding this effect the organic increase in revenue was 
6 per cent. Trading improved towards the end of the year in all 
divisions, after a slow third quarter, as our customers released 
capital budgets and some of the new product launches gained 
traction. The structural changes in Spirent’s markets and the 
consequential caution some of our customers are understandably 
exhibiting in their investment plans have delayed revenue growth 
in 2014. However, Spirent’s 2014 investments were focused on 
building on the many opportunities that exist in our markets. 
Spirent had some major successes in 2014 and market conditions 
and performance in each of Spirent’s divisions are discussed in 
the Operational review.
Excluding the effect of acquisitions order intake grew by 3 per 
cent compared with 2013 and the book to bill ratio was above 
100, at 103 (2013 105). Both orders and revenue grew organically 
in all divisions. In Service Assurance revenue of $12.0 million was 
recognised in the first half from a large field test order received 
in 2013, and a follow on order of $16.2 million was booked in the 
fourth quarter of 2014 for delivery in the second half of 2015.
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2014
34 Cost of sales and operating expenses
Gross margin reduced slightly to 69.2 per cent (2013 
69.4 per cent) due to product mix and the increased investment 
in support services. 
In the 2013 Annual Report Spirent announced that it would 
make an additional investment of around $33 million in product 
development, sales and marketing and support services for 
future growth. The actual amount invested was an additional 
$24.4 million excluding acquisitions, or 5 per cent of revenue: 
$3.2 million for support services (included in cost of sales); 
$8.3 million for product development; and $12.9 million for sales 
and marketing. Our investment was mainly in our core markets 
focusing on virtual test solutions and cyber security and to also 
to fund new initiatives such as automotive. 
Administration expenses were $41.4 million in 2014 compared 
with $39.6 million in 2013 before charging the following items 
(which are added back for the purposes of the calculation of 
adjusted operating profit):
 –exceptional items of $4.1 million (2013 $3.8 million);
 –acquired intangible asset amortisation and impairment of 
$13.7 million (2013 $8.4 million) which reflects a pro-rata 
amortisation charge for the 2014 acquisitions; 
 –acquisition related costs of $3.8 million (2013 nil); and
 –a share-based payment charge of $0.7 million (2013 credit 
of $1.2 million). 
Total reported administration expenses were $63.7 million 
compared with $50.6 million, after charging the items above.
The 2014 acquisitions have added a total of $12.9 million to 
reported operating expenses in the year.
It is planned to maintain the underlying rate of investment in 
product development in 2015 and to increase the investment 
in sales and marketing by approximately $7 million. This will 
support new product releases, build on the global opportunities 
provided by the 2014 acquisitions and enable us to implement 
a new customer relationship management software platform 
to enhance operational effectiveness.
Geographically, the United States is our largest market 
accounting for 51 per cent of Group revenue. Revenue increased 
by 8 per cent period-on-period in this region. Asia Pacific 
amounts to 31 per cent of Group revenue and increased by 8 per 
cent over 2013 primarily due to strong activity in China driven by 
the China carrier ecosystem. Europe represents 14 per cent of 
Group revenue and was 29 per cent up as we saw recovery after 
a difficult 2013. The rest of the world represents the remaining 
4 per cent.

acquisition related costs, acquired intangible asset amortisation 
and impairment and share-based payment (“adjusted operating 
profit”), which is the measure of profit the Group uses to evaluate 
performance, decreased by 8 per cent to $46.0 million compared

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Exceptional items and intangible asset impairment
In 2014, following dynamic changes in Spirent’s markets and 
the need to ensure that the Group is investing in the right areas 
to maximise its potential, Spirent undertook a series of steps 
to reallocate resources in its worldwide operations at a cost 
of $4.1 million. The annualised cost savings from these actions 
is $12 million of which we have reinvested $5 million, giving 
a net saving of $7 million.
In 2013 the Group undertook a review of its organisational 
structure on the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer 
at an exceptional cost of $3.4 million and also incurred abortive 
acquisition costs of $0.4 million.
In 2014 an intangible asset impairment charge of $1.0 million has 
been incurred in respect of the development asset arising on 
the acquisition of NetGend. The asset had been acquired at a 
pre-production stage and, although the intention is to use this 
technology to enhance Spirent’s solutions, the extent and the 
means by which this will be achieved had not been determined 
at 31 December 2014 resulting in an impairment charge.
Corporate costs
Corporate costs are those expenses which cannot be attributed 
to the Group’s operating segments and comprise the costs of 
the Board and other corporate activities. These costs were 
$6.3 million (2013 $5.9 million) before exceptional items of 
$0.7 million (2013 $2.2 million) for the year. 
Currency impact
The effect of fluctuating exchange rates is relatively minimal as 
the Group’s revenue and profits are primarily denominated in 
US dollars or US dollar-linked currencies.
Finance income and costs
Finance income for 2014 was $0.4 million compared with 
$0.9 million in 2013. Surplus funds are held principally in the 
United Kingdom and in the United States and earn market rates 
of interest which remain negligible. 
Finance costs were nil in 2014. They were $0.9 million in 2013, 
which was the defined benefit pension plan interest cost.
Tax
For the Group taxable profits principally arise in the United States. 
The tax charge for the Group in 2014 was $3.5 million (2013 
$6.4 million), representing a current year effective tax rate of 
22.0 per cent (2013 25.8 per cent) of pre-tax profit, excluding a prior 
year tax credit of $1.8 million (2013 $3.7 million). The effective tax 
rate is lower in 2014 as a result of the geographic mix of taxable 
profit as well as the effect of Research and Experimental tax credits 
in the United States. At 31 December 2014 deferred tax assets 
amounting to $20.5 million (31 December 2013 $18.3 million) have 
been recognised on the balance sheet. At 31 December 2014 there 
are deferred tax assets amounting to a tax value of $17.1 million 
(31 December 2013 $17.7 million) which remain unrecognised.
For 2015 it is expected that the effective tax rate will be in the 
region of 25 per cent.
Earnings per share
Adjusted basic earnings per share was 5.82 cents compared with 
5.71 cents for 2013. There were 611.2 million (2013 640.6 million) 
weighted average Ordinary Shares in issue. Basic earnings per 
share was 3.35 cents for 2014 compared with 5.10 cents for 2013.

Financial risk management
The key objective of the Group’s treasury department is to 
manage the financial risks of the business and to ensure that 
sufficient liquidity is available to the Group. All treasury activity 
operates within a formal control framework. The Board has 
approved treasury policies and guidelines and periodically 
reviews treasury activities. Additionally, it is the Group’s policy 
that speculative treasury transactions are expressly forbidden.
Spirent’s financial risk management objectives and policies and 
its exposure to risks are discussed in note 26 of Notes to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Acquisitions
The following acquisitions were completed in 2014:
 –The business of DAX Technologies Corp. (“DAX”) for a cash 
consideration of $36.9 million which completed on 19 February 
2014. DAX is a leading provider of customer experience 
management solutions and is reported within the Service 
Assurance division.
 –A majority stake of 58 per cent in Testing Technologies IST 
GmbH (“Testing Tech”) for a cash consideration of Euro 
1.8 million ($2.4 million) on 20 February 2014. The company 
develops and markets standardised and customer-specific 
software-based testing tools which support the development of 
mission-critical products and workflow steps. Testing Tech also 
participates in the connected vehicle market which will facilitate 
Spirent’s progress in this market. The minority stake of 42 per 
cent of the share capital is the subject of a put and call option 
which is exercisable between 1 January and 31 March 2016. 
The consideration is based on the 2015 performance of Testing 
Tech and set at a minimum amount of Euro 1.4 million, the option 
has been assigned a fair value of Euro 2.2 million ($2.7 million). 
This acquisition is reported within the Wireless & Service 
Experience division.
Financial review

Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2014
36 The cash generated has been utilised to pay dividends to 
shareholders and for the return of capital through the share 
buyback programme. In 2014 a final dividend for 2013 and 
an interim dividend for 2014 totalling $22.2 million (2013 
$22.2 million) were paid. Share repurchases during the early part 
of 2014 have resulted in a cash outflow of $16.4 million (2013 
$54.7 million). Cash consideration for acquisitions amounted to 
$85.9 million.
Defined benefit pension plans
The Group operates two funded defined benefit pension plans 
which are in the United Kingdom. Both of these schemes were 
closed some time ago to new entrants and the main plan now has 
fewer than ten active members. 
The accounting valuation of these plans at the end of 2014 
was a net deficit of $13.7 million compared with a net deficit of 
$2.5 million at 31 December 2013 and was based on the latest 
triennial actuarial valuation at 1 April 2012. The increase in the 
deficit is mainly a result of changes in the underlying assumptions, 
principally the discount rate, net of a rise in the value of the assets.
The Group has also reported a liability of $0.8 million 
(31 December 2013 $0.8 million) in respect of United Kingdom 
unfunded plan liabilities.
Capital structure 
Spirent’s policy on capital structure is to maintain a strong 
balance sheet to support operational flexibility and fund 
investment for long term growth. 
In 2014 the Company repurchased 9.7 million Ordinary Shares 
at a cost of $15.6 million (2013 29.2 million at a cost of 
$55.5 million). All shares repurchased were cancelled. No further 
buybacks are currently planned.
Dividend
The Board is recommending the payment of a final dividend 
for 2014 of 2.21 cents (1.43 pence) per Ordinary Share which, 
with the interim dividend of 1.68 cents (0.99 pence) per Ordinary 
Share paid in September 2014, brings the full year dividend to 
3.89 cents (2.42 pence) per Ordinary Share. The dividend is  
covered 1.5 times by adjusted earnings. This is an increase of 
10 per cent over the full year dividend for 2013 of 3.54 cents per 
Ordinary Share.
Subject to approval by the shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting, the final dividend will be paid on 8 May 2015 to Ordinary 
shareholders on the register at 6 March 2015. Payment to ADR 
holders will be made on 18 May 2015.
 –On 31 July 2014 Spirent completed the acquisition of the assets 
of Radvision’s Technology Business Unit (“TBU”), the part of the 
Radvision business responsible for delivering industry-leading 
developer solutions, for a cash consideration of $25.9 million. 
The business unit is based in Tel Aviv, Israel, and offers a 
complete development and test suite for voice and video 
over IP communications, including VoLTE. This acquisition is 
reported within the Wireless & Service Experience division.
 –On 12 September 2014 Spirent acquired Mobilethink A/S 
(“Mobilethink”) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Tweakker ApS 
(“Tweakker”) for a cash consideration of $20.1 million. 
Headquartered in Aarhus, Denmark, Mobilethink is a provider 
of mobile device management, device analytics and intelligence 
solutions for mobile operators. This acquisition is reported 
within the Service Assurance division.
In addition, Spirent acquired the net assets of NetGend LLC 
in September, a Texas based entity, for a cost of $1.0 million. 
Acquisition expenses of $3.8 million, which have been expensed, 
were incurred in relation to these transactions. 
Financing and cash flow
The Group remains cash generative, and this gives Spirent the 
financial flexibility to invest in organic growth, pursue strategic 
acquisitions and pay sustainable dividends to shareholders. 
Cash and cash equivalents were $99.8 million at 31 December 
2014 compared with $216.2 million at 31 December 2013 with no 
debt. Cash and cash equivalents are held as cash on demand or 
in short term bank deposits and 57 per cent of the balance was 
denominated in US dollars. 
Cash generated from operating activities was lower in 2014 at 
$48.9 million (2013 $73.5 million) as the activity was skewed 
to the end of the fourth quarter resulting in an increase in working 
capital of $6.7 million for the year (2013 reduction of $12.1 million). 
This working capital increase is expected to unwind during the 
first quarter of 2015. Free cash flow conversion represents 
0.5 times (2013 1.3 times) reported earnings. 
Free cash flow is set out below:
$ million 2014 2013
Cash flow from operations 48.9 73.5
Tax paid (7.2) (6.1)
Cash inflow from operating activities 41.7 67.4
Interest received 0.6 0.8
Net capital expenditure (31.6) (24.3)
Free cash flow 10.7 43.9
Net capital expenditure was higher by $7.3 million than in 2013. 
This increase was due to the move to new improved leasehold 
facilities in the United States on the expiry of the previous lease 
terms at a cost of $9.5 million. For 2015 capital expenditure is 
expected to be in the region of $20 million.

successful health and safety management programme and 
appropriate resources are made available for this purpose.
The Chief Financial Officer is the director nominated by the Board 
to have responsibility for the health and safety performance of the 
Group. No major health and safety issues were reported by the Chief 
Financial Officer to the Audit Committee and Board during the year.
The health and safety risk profile of the Group remained low during 
2014. The main risks of the Group continue to be based around final 
test and assembly of products and working environment issues such 
as ergonomics and repetitive strain injury. The acquisitions made 
during 2014 had a similar risk profile to the existing Group.
The Group continued to have very low accident rates in 2014 and 
no incidents required any hospitalisation.
The Group Health and Safety Policy places responsibility for the 
management of health and safety on local management who are 
supported by local external advisers where necessary. It is the 
Group’s policy that each business unit should have a senior 
individual designated as being responsible for ensuring the business 
unit conforms to local statutory health and safety regulations as well 
as the Group Policy. An annual questionnaire on health and safety 
performance is completed by our business units and any issues 
are addressed and resolved. Independent external reviews of the 
Company’s health and safety performance are conducted 
periodically at selected business units. Regular designated health 
and safety awareness training programmes are also carried out.
Environmental
Sustainability remains an important issue for the Group. The 
strategy was reviewed and updated in 2014 to ensure Spirent 
continues to manage all material sustainability issues and to 
direct the programme of action for the coming years. Whilst 
compliance with environmental legislation and our sustainability 
policy remain a key priority, our focus on opportunities and 
innovation has yielded good results, particularly at the Low 
Carbon Centre of Excellence at Paignton, and in innovation in 
product design and functionality in the Elevate Test Framework.
Growth in revenue and property estate in 2014 has seen a 5 per

Products
Elevate Test Framework – sustainability improvements through 
innovative product design
The Elevate Test Framework represents a radical innovation in 
how Spirent products are designed. Elevate breaks the “box” 
model by separating hardware from software, organising 
elements into a network of test resources that not only delivers 
faster and more efficient testing, but also significantly reduces 
energy use, heat, noise and product footprint.

Through network functions virtualization, it has been possible 
to develop a small, lightweight device with a market-leading 
footprint. The new Spirent WTS122 network emulator operates 
in standalone mode for R&D testing and is used as the main 
component of the new Spirent 8100 Q100 system for carrier 
acceptance testing. The Q100 has reduced energy use and heat 
output by 69 per cent compared with the previous B200 model, 
at 10 per cent of the weight and 2 per cent of the total size. 
Further environmental performance improvements have been 
achieved in the Elevate solution for IMS/RCS/VoLTE as hardware can 
be scaled independently from software, allowing the Q100 series 
to support multiple handsets requiring fewer, smaller test devices. 
The 200W Q100 system reduces the power per handset tested by 13 
times compared with the four B200 units required to test 4 handsets.
Q100: 69% reduction in power from B200

Compliance statements
The Group’s business units comply with the Waste Electrical and 
Electronic Equipment Regulations 2013, the Batteries Directive 
and the California Electronic Waste Recycling Programme. New 
products are designed to meet the Restriction of Hazardous 
Substances Directive (“RoHS”), also known as Directive 2011/65/
EU, even though Spirent Communications’ hardware products are 
classified as Category Nine (Monitor and Control Equipment) 
and are therefore currently out of scope with the RoHS Directive. 
Measures are in place to ensure Spirent Communications’ 
hardware products will be in compliance with the RoHS Directive 
at such time as they are brought in to scope. 
The Group is not directly required to comply with or report under 
Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the US Conflict Minerals 
Law. However, it has robust procedures to ensure that it would 
be in compliance if it were brought in within the scope of 
this legislation.
Sustainability strategy 
In 2014, the key update to the Group’s sustainability strategy 
is to expand from a programme of eco-efficiency and legal 
compliance, and to also understand and help address customers’ 
sustainability challenges.
Our work with external consultants led us to revise our 
sustainability strategy, which now has four key strands:
 –Minimise our environmental impacts from our properties;
 –Provide our people with the skills and resources to address 
sustainability issues effectively;
 –Incorporate sustainability thinking into products, through;
 –innovation in product design and manufacture; and
 –new products and services to address customers’ 
sustainability challenges; and
 –Minimise sustainability impacts from the supply chain.
2014 performance and trends
During 2014 we have made progress across all areas of 
our sustainability strategy, in particular in the property and 
product design areas.
We have continued to drive sustainability into our property estate, 
installing further retrofit technologies at the Low Carbon Centre 
of Excellence in Paignton and incorporating best practice in the 
design and fit-out of our new site in Liberty Canyon, California. 
We have also undertaken site energy audits at our Beijing sites.
Property
Paignton – Low Carbon Centre of Excellence
Since designating our Paignton site as the Group’s Low Carbon 
Centre of Excellence in 2012, we have made significant 
reductions in the site’s energy and carbon footprint through 
technology and behavioural change. 
The majority of the site’s energy needs are met from grid 
electricity, and as such the focus has been on energy reduction 
programmes. From the 2011 baseline, purchased electricity has 
reduced by 27 per cent at Paignton. This has been achieved 
through a programme of staff awareness and technology 
investment. 
In May 2014, voltage optimisation equipment was installed and 
ceiling insulation laid in the office areas. Although the labs, the 
key energy-using areas at Paignton, have been extended, there 
was an 11 per cent year-on-year reduction in total energy use, 
including a 44 per cent reduction in gas use from 2013.
The site Green Team has continued to run energy reduction and 
environmental awareness programmes as an integral part of the 
sites ISO 14001:2004 certified management system.
Although energy usage on-site decreased between 2013 and 
2014, the site’s associated carbon emissions increased by around 
8 per cent, from 171 tonnes CO
2
e to 184 tonnes CO
2

Annual Report 2014
40 The Group will be required to comply with the Energy Savings 
Opportunity Scheme (“ESOS”) Regulations 2014 and has put 
measures in place to meet its obligations in 2015.
Procurement 
Almost all products continue to be produced by external contract 
manufacturers and the environmental performance of suppliers 
is monitored through audits and surveys. Our largest contract 
manufacturer was responsible for 66.4 per cent of our production 
in 2014 and they have an ISO 14001 certified environmental 
management system, alongside an extensive carbon reduction 
programme. The table below shows their emissions performance 
for the last two years for which data is available.

Greenhouse gas emissions
Carbon emissions are a material sustainability issue for the 
Group and we remain committed to reporting emissions and 
taking action to combat climate change. The Group once again 
responded to the Carbon Disclosure Project in 2014, completing 
both the Climate Change and Supply Chain questionnaires for 
the calendar year 2013.

Methodology
We have reported on all of the emission sources required 
under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic report and Directors’ 
Report) Regulations 2013. These sources fall within our 
consolidated financial statements. We do not have responsibility 
for any emission sources that are not included in our consolidated 
financial statements. 
We have used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (Revised Edition), data gathered to fulfil our 
requirements under these Regulations, and emission factors 
from the UK Government’s GHG Conversion Factors for Company 
Reporting 2015.
2015 programme
The work programme for 2015 will focus on the four strands of 
the Group’s sustainability strategy:
Property
A pilot programme to test automatic energy metering technology 
will be undertaken at Paignton in early 2015, which will be rolled 
out across major sites during the year. Continued efforts to 
incorporate energy efficiency technology and practices will be 
made across the Group’s estate, with particular consideration to 
new sites.
Products
Analysis of product sustainability will be undertaken and a 
programme to assess and improve performance will be 
examined. Opportunities to make sustainability improvements 
to existing and future products will also be explored.
Procurement
A programme to determine the key impact areas in the Group’s 
supply chain will be undertaken and initiatives to reduce 
pollution, energy and material use will be introduced.
People
A programme to further engage staff across the Group on 
sustainability issues will be undertaken, and opportunities 
to expand the participation in sustainability initiatives will 
be reviewed.
Targets and objectives
A target reduction of 5 per cent has been set for Group energy 
use, carbon emissions and an intensity metric of carbon emitted 
per million dollar of revenue. All three will be assessed against 
the baseline year of 2014. 
Our employees
As a business which relies on our employees to drive the 
understanding development, and sales of complex technologies, 
Spirent understands that its future growth is directly tied to the 
motivation and drive of our people. Accordingly we strive to 
recruit, train, develop and retain the best talent in our industry. 
It is imperative to our future success that Spirent is a company 
that people want to work for as well as do business with, and 
our employees lie at the heart of making that happen.
Our 1,700+ talented employees, working in 33 locations in 
17 countries, provide a matchless competitive advantage for us, 
creating innovative products for our customers. To sustain our 
competitive advantage and bring together this culturally diverse 
group of employees, Spirent has built a global culture based on 
four values: being creative, competitive, customer focused and 
collaborative. These values form the foundation of Spirent’s 
ability to inspire innovation and drive a competitive spirit in 
our business.
To attract, keep and grow our people, we regularly review our 
benefits, retention, development programmes and career growth 
opportunities. Our efforts continue to bear positive fruit, with 
global voluntary turnover at 8 per cent compared to an industry 
average of 12.4 per cent (Radford Trends Report – Technology 
edition, Q4 2014).

Rewarding our people
Our compensation and benefit schemes are aligned with performance 
and are regularly benchmarked to ensure that Spirent rewards 
employees competitively in each country in which we operate.
Spirent believes in sharing its success with its employees, with all 
employees participating in some form of variable compensation 
tied to the achievement of key goals such as revenue growth 
and profitability: Growth Sharing Plan for individual contributors 
through managers; Sales Commission Plan for sales employees; 
and Management Incentive Plan for senior managers and above.
Another way in which we reward and recognise excellence is 
through our Global Recognition Programme, which provides 
Spot, Excellence and Executive Awards. These awards are 
one-time cash incentives as recognition for exemplary 
contributions that demonstrate one or more of our key values.
In addition, we provide project-based incentives to recognise 
and reward employees for extraordinary work on critical projects. 
Growing our talent
We recognise that our competitive advantage can only be 
maintained by developing our own talent internally as well as 
recruiting the best skills from outside of our organisation.
In 2014 we continued to develop our Employee Value Proposition in 
order to clearly communicate our brand to current and prospective 
employees, and thereby retain and attract the best people. Spirent 
is large enough to provide a wide range of career possibilities, but 
small enough for individuals to be noticed and recognised; we offer 
an ideal environment for people to unleash their innovative spirits 
and collaborate to discover the future together.
Throughout 2014, we continued to support education by offering 
internships and work experience programmes that not only help 
students develop professional knowledge, but also to provide 
future talent for our entire organisation. In 2014 Spirent offered 
36 internships in the United States, seven in Europe and 42 
in Asia.
Our challenging work environment inspires innovation, 
with continuous learning as an essential part of our human 
resources philosophy.
In 2014 employees in all regions participated in courses designed 
to enhance our ability to service the customer and to create 
innovative, leading products. Leadership bench strength was 
developed through various programmes including 360 degree 
feedback, succession management, organisational and individual 
accountability, and financial acumen. Our career development 
emphasises tailored, flexible pathways that give employees the 
opportunity to explore their potential in the right direction and at 
the right speed.
Employee engagement
Spirent regularly canvasses its employees’ views on a range of 
matters related to their employment in both formal and informal 
ways. In 2014, Spirent conducted one of its regular all-employee 
surveys to gauge the level of employee satisfaction in the 
business. The participation rate was good at 77 per cent. We aim 
to identify the key drivers of increased employee engagement, 
and based on the survey results, drivers of employment 
engagement continued to be learning and development, 
leadership and direction, culture and collaboration. The feedback 
from the survey is distilled to actionable tasks, which we expect 
will enhance our employees’ experience. In addition to the more 
formal survey, informal meetings are regularly held between 
many of Spirent’s senior management team and small groups of 
employees, with the aim of sharing perspectives among a broad 
cross-section of our team members.
Diversity
Diversity means understanding and reflecting the community 
in which we operate, building loyalty with our colleagues and 
customers. Age, gender, ethnicity, physical appearance, religion, 
education and beliefs are all valued and everyone has the 
opportunity to contribute to our success as a business and fulfil 
their potential. Our aim is to ensure that all our employees are 
respected as individuals. We have a diverse employee population 
and believe that this variety of backgrounds, experience, beliefs, 
personalities, knowledge skills and ideas helps to deliver the 
innovation and creativity necessary for us to succeed.
The Group is committed to providing equality of opportunity 
to all existing and prospective employees without unlawful 
discrimination on the basis of religion, disability, gender, age, 
marital status, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity or any other 
protected status.

564.7 tonnes of waste from coastlines and inland waterways 
in California alone.
In total, Spirent made charitable cash donations of $84,333 
during 2014.

Disabled persons
Disabled persons, whether registered or not, are accorded 
equal opportunities when applying for vacancies, with due regard 
to their aptitudes and abilities. In addition to complying with 
legislative requirements, we are committed to ensuring that 
disabled employees are fairly treated in respect of training and 
career development and promotion. With regard to employees 
who become disabled during the course of their employment, the 
Group is supportive and will take all reasonable steps to ensure 
that they can remain in employment wherever practicable.
Community
Spirent encourages employees to participate in charitable 
programmes within their communities, supporting their efforts 
financially in some cases, but also in North America and Europe 
through a Voluntary Time Off policy, which allows employees 
to donate up to two working days each year to a charitable 
organisation close to their hearts.
Making a commitment to our local communities takes many forms 
at Spirent, from donating books to the Johns Hopkins Children’s 
Center to joining with the United Way of Monmouth County in 
their continuing work to help rebuild families’ homes around 
New Jersey in the wake of Superstorm Sandy.
Competitive
Engage and develop our 
employees to relentlessly 
out-execute the competition 
every time, whilst maintaining 
the highest ethical standards.
Creative
Innovation that inspires our 
customers, our customers’ 
customers, our employees 
and shareholders.
Customer focused
Dedicated to every customer’s, 
every employee’s and every 
shareholder’s success.  
 
Collaborative
One global team, sharing 
knowledge, ideas, technology, 
resources and talents to 
achieve and sustain  
profitable growth.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Dear Shareholder, 
As I mentioned in my Chairman’s introduction, this has been a year 
of significant activity under the leadership of Eric Hutchinson, our 
Chief Executive Officer. The Board has been working to support the 
business by ensuring that the appropriate investment and structures 
are in place to position the business to achieve its strategic plan.
The Board seeks to build and maintain good governance 
structures and thereby appropriately manage risk in the business. 
Our goal is to achieve the returns our shareholders expect. 
As such, the Board continues to be committed to high standards 
of corporate governance and fully supports the principles laid 
down in the UK Corporate Governance Code. The corporate 
governance reports which follow set out the activities of the 
Board and its Committees and explain how we operate.
I look forward to meeting any shareholders who can join us at our 
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) in May and extend my thanks 
to you all for your continued support as we look forward to the 
year ahead.

Reporting Council in September 2012, which applies to financial 
years beginning on or after 1 October 2012 (the “Code”) and 
the updated UK Corporate Governance Code issued in 
September 2014 (the “New Code”), which applies to financial 
periods beginning on or after 1 October 2014, both of which are 
available at www.frc.org.uk.
This Report describes how the principles of the Code are applied and 
reports on the Company’s compliance with the Code’s provisions.

except for Code Provision D.1.5 in relation to Eric Hutchinson’s 
fixed term contract as reported in last year’s Annual Report. This 
has now been replaced with a standard 12 month rolling contract 
as described more fully in the Report on directors’ remuneration 
on page 68. The Board also considers that it complies with 
certain aspects of the New Code to the date of this Report and 
is working towards full compliance by the next reporting cycle.
Directors’ statement on 
corporate governance
Board activities during 2014
At each Board meeting, the Chief Executive Officer presents an 
update on the performance, strategy and business issues 
across the Group and the Chief Financial Officer presents a 
detailed analysis of the financial performance of the business 
units. Senior executives below Board level attend relevant parts 
of Board meetings in order to make presentations on their areas 
of responsibility; this gives the Board access to a broader group 
of executives and helps the directors make assessments of the 
Group’s succession plans. The Board has a rolling programme of 
visits to business unit locations to deepen its appreciation of the 
different opportunities and challenges that each unit faces.
Leadership
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for its 
decision which was reviewed and updated during the course of the 
year. The Board’s primary responsibility is to promote the long term 
success of the Company by creating and delivering sustainable 
shareholder value. The Board seeks to achieve this through setting 
out its strategy, monitoring its strategic objectives and providing 
oversight and direction to the management team. The Board 
considers the impact of its decisions on wider stakeholders, 
including employees, suppliers and the environment.
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2014

Strategic report Governance Financial statements page 42. The Board has not set any specific aspirations or quotas 
in respect of gender diversity. However, the Board recognises 
the benefits of diversity, of which gender is one aspect, and 
it will continue to ensure that this is taken into account when 
considering any particular appointment, whilst ensuring 
appointments are made on merit and ability to enhance 
the performance of the business.
Independence
The independence of each director is reviewed on appointment 
and at least annually. The Board determined that the 
non-executive directors are each independent in character and 
judgement, save for the Chairman who was deemed independent 
by the Board at the date of his appointment. None have been 
employed by the Company previously in any capacity or have 
any material business relationship with any Group company. 
Non-executive directors at Spirent receive no remuneration 
from the Company other than their fees (detailed in the Report 
on directors’ remuneration on page 68), and each non-executive 
director has confirmed that they do not represent any significant 
shareholder in the Company. No individual or group of individuals 
dominates the Board’s decision making and the Code requirement, 
stating that at least half of the Board (excluding the Chairman) 
should comprise independent non-executive directors, is satisfied.
Senior Independent Director
The role of Senior Independent Non-executive Director (“SID”) 
provides a sounding board for the Chairman and an intermediary 
for the other non-executive directors, if needed. The SID is also 
available to meet with shareholders upon request if they feel that 
they have concerns which contact through the normal channels 
of the Chairman or an executive director has failed to resolve or 
for which such contact would be inappropriate.
Our current SID, Ian Brindle, will reach the nine-year anniversary 
of his appointment to the Board in December 2015 which will, in 
terms of the UK Corporate Governance Code, mean that he will 
cease to be considered independent. As explained on page 51, 
the Nomination Committee is in the process of recruiting a new 
non-executive director and Mr Brindle has agreed to continue in 
role until that process is completed. As such, he will seek 
re-election at the 2015 AGM.
When Mr Brindle steps down from the Board, Sue Swenson has 
been asked by the Board to become the SID subject to her 
re-election at the 2015 AGM.
Biographical details for each of the directors are set out on pages 
44 and 45 and can also be found on the Company’s website at 
http://corporate.spirent.com/About-Us/Our_Board_of_Directors 
Division of responsibilities
There is a clear division of responsibilities at the Company 
between the running of the Board, undertaken by the Non-
executive Chairman, and the executive responsibility for the 
running of the Company’s business, which is in the hands of the 
Chief Executive Officer. This division of roles is reviewed and 
approved by the Board annually.
As Chairman, Alex Walker presides over the Board and is 
responsible for its leadership and overall effectiveness. In doing 
so he encourages and helps to maintain an effective working 
relationship between the executive and non-executive directors.
As Chief Executive Officer, Eric Hutchinson has responsibility for 
the day-to-day management of the Company’s business and the 
implementation and delivery of the Board strategy. 
This separation of roles enhances the independent oversight of 
executive management by the Board and more closely aligns the 
Board with shareholders. It also means that no one individual 
within the Company has unfettered powers of decision.
Composition of the Board
At the date of this Report, the Board comprises a non-executive 
Chairman, four independent non-executive directors and two 
executive directors.
The Chairman and the Non-executive directors contribute 
entrepreneurial leadership and external expertise and 
experience in areas of importance to the Company, such as 
strategic investments, corporate finance, general finance and 
corporate governance. They also contribute independent 
challenge and rigour to the Board’s deliberations, and assist in 
the development of the Company’s strategy, scrutiny of the 
performance of management in meeting agreed goals and 
targets, and satisfying themselves of the integrity of the 
Company’s internal controls and risk management systems. 
The Board believes that all of the directors devote sufficient time 
and attention as is necessary in order to perform their duties.
The Chairman holds regular discussions with the non-executive 
directors without the executive directors present to ensure a free 
and frank exchange of views on the effectiveness of the 
executive directors and senior management.
Spirent’s Group policy is to hire the best candidates for all 
positions at all levels throughout the business, irrespective of 
gender, including candidates at Board level. With two female 
directors, namely Rachel Whiting and Sue Swenson, 29 per cent 
of the current Board is female. Further information and statistics 
on gender diversity can be found within our CSR statement on

Notes
1 Rachel Whiting was appointed to the Board on 1 February 2014.
2 Duncan Lewis and Tom Maxwell were unable to attend an ad hoc meeting of the Board as they conflicted with meetings already in their diary for other 
listed companies. Both directors received all papers relating to the meeting and had the opportunity to discuss issues arising directly with the Chairman. 
Both directors appointed Alex Walker as their proxy for the duration of the meeting.
3 Sue Swenson did not attend that part of the Nomination Committee meeting which considered her election by the other non-executive directors to the role 
of SID.
Board procedures
During 2014, eight Board meetings were held. The agenda is set 
by the Chairman together with the Chief Executive Officer and all 
members of the Board are supplied in advance with appropriate, 
clear and accurate information in a timely manner covering matters 
which are to be considered. All of the directors are free to seek 
clarification or elaboration of the information provided from 
the management team if they feel it to be necessary. Minutes 
of meetings are circulated to all Board members and, subject 
to their agreement, approved at the following Board meeting.
Board performance evaluation
Every year, the Board and its Committees (Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration) evaluate their performance in accordance with 
Code Provision B.6.1. In 2012, the evaluation was conducted by 
Useful Thinking Ltd (Useful Thinking Ltd has no other connection 
with the Company). Following the internal review undertaken in 
2013, the Board focused on the following during 2014:
 –continuing to review and advance strategic planning;
 –providing more opportunities for non-executive directors to 
meet with executives and senior managers below Board 
level to assist in the identification of internal talent for 
succession planning;
 –building greater visibility and connection with the business units 
to develop a mutual understanding of roles and challenges; and
 –strengthening the Board with the appointment of additional 
non-executive directors in order to ensure orderly succession 
for appointments and to ensure progressive refreshing of 
the Board.
During 2014, the Board assessed its own effectiveness through an 
internal Board evaluation. The 2014 evaluation was facilitated by 
the Chairman, assisted by the Company Secretary. All directors 
completed a questionnaire, followed by meetings with the 
Chairman to discuss views in more detail and consider training and 
development needs. Committee effectiveness was also assessed 
separately. Results were presented to the Board and the following 
areas for improved effectiveness were identified:
 –further develop understanding of strategic positioning and 
competitive issues facing the Group in view of ongoing changes 
in our industry;
 –obtain further insight into performance metrics on acquisitions 
and organic investments;
 –continue to focus on strengthening the Board with non-
executive directors with specific industry sector and relevant 
geographic business knowledge; and
 –gain greater visibility on depth of management bench strength 
below Board level given changes to the management team 
in 2014.
The SID met with the other independent non-executive directors 
on 11 November 2014, in the absence of the Chairman, to assess 
the Chairman’s effectiveness. After considering and discussing the 
tasks undertaken by the Chairman during the period under review, 
the independent Non-executive Directors agreed that Mr Walker 
gave appropriate time and commitment to his role as Chairman 
of the Company and was effective in that role throughout 2014. 
In line with Code Provision B.6.2, it is anticipated that the 2015 
review will be conducted by an external provider.
Directors’ conflicts
Procedures are in place for the disclosure by directors of 
any interest that conflicts, or may possibly conflict, with the 
Company’s interests and for the appropriate authorisation to be 
sought if a conflict arises in accordance with the Company’s 
Articles of Association. In deciding whether to authorise a conflict 
or potential conflict of interest only non-interested directors (ie 
those that have no interest in the matter under consideration) will 
be able to take the relevant decisions. In taking such a decision 
the directors must act in a way they consider most likely to 
promote the success of the Company and may impose such limits 
or conditions as they see fit. The Board has reviewed the 
procedures in place and considers that they continue to operate 
effectively. There were no actual or potential conflicts of interest 
which were required to be authorised by the Board during 2014 
or to the date of this Report.
Service contracts and letters of appointment
The terms of executive directors’ service contracts are disclosed 
in the Report on directors’ remuneration on pages 55 to 71. 
Directors’ interests in the shares of the Company are disclosed 
on page 59.
Executive directors’ service contracts and non-executive 
directors’ letters of appointment are available for inspection 
at the Company’s registered office and will be available at the 
2015 AGM.

Shareholder engagement
The Board is committed to maintaining good communications 
with shareholders. The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and 
Chief Financial Officer have regular dialogue with individual 
institutional shareholders in order to develop an understanding of 
their views which is then discussed with the Board. All directors 
are offered the opportunity to meet with major shareholders to 
listen to their views and executive directors receive regular 
reports prepared by an independent capital markets advisory 
firm which provides comprehensive information relating to the 
Company’s major shareholders.
Presentations are made to analysts, investors and prospective 
investors covering the full year and half-year results and the 
Company seeks to maintain a dialogue with the various 
bodies which monitor the Company’s governance policies and 
procedures. Also, in October 2014, the Company held an Investor 
and Analyst Day at which senior executives presented updates 
on the markets in which Spirent operates.
The Strategic report on pages 1 to 43 details the financial 
performance of the Company as well as setting out the risks 
it faces.
The Company is always keen to hear the views of its private 
shareholders and we encourage them to use our shareholder 
mailbox at investor.relations@spirent.com for detailed enquiries 
and to access our website at http://corporate.spirent.com/ for our 
Company reports and business information.
Any concerns raised by shareholders or their representatives, 
whether expressed directly or through voting patterns at the 
Company’s AGM, are discussed by the directors and an 
appropriate response given either specifically to the concerned 
party or, if it is felt to be of wider benefit, made available to all 
shareholders via the Company’s website.
Annual General Meeting
The Company’s AGM will be held at 1pm on Tuesday 5 May 2015 
at the offices of UBS at 100 Liverpool Street, London EC2M 2RH.
At the AGM, the Chief Executive Officer gives an update on the 
positioning and outlook for the Company. Shareholders are 
invited to ask questions formally during the meeting and to follow 
up these discussions with directors on a one-to-one basis 
afterwards. The Chairmen of each of the committees of the Board 
will be in attendance and all directors will be available to respond 
to questions at the AGM.
The Board looks forward to welcoming all our shareholders to our 
2015 AGM and to updating them on our business developments.
Re-election of directors
Non-executive directors are appointed on three-year terms in 
accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association.
In accordance with Code Provision B.7.1, all directors are also 
subject to election or annual re-election by shareholders at 
the 2015 AGM. The Board recommends to shareholders the 
re-appointment of all directors who are retiring at the 2015 
AGM and who are offering themselves for re-election. The 
Board believes that they are all effective directors of the 
Company and demonstrate the appropriate level of 
commitment in their respective roles.
Company Secretary
In October 2014, Angus Iveson joined Spirent as Company 
Secretary & General Counsel, releasing Rachel Whiting to focus 
entirely on her role as Chief Financial Officer. The Company 
Secretary is responsible for advising and supporting the 
Chairman and the Board on corporate governance matters as 
well as ensuring that there is a smooth flow of information to 
enable effective decision making. All directors have access to 
the advice and services of the Company Secretary and can take 
independent professional advice in respect of their duties, at the 
Company’s expense.
Induction and development
On appointment, directors undertake a structured induction 
programme, in the course of which they receive information 
about the operations and activities of the Group, the role of the 
Board and the matters reserved to its decision, the Group’s 
corporate governance practices and procedures and their duties, 
responsibilities and obligations as directors of a listed public 
limited company. This is supplemented by visits to key locations 
and meetings with, and presentations by, senior executives. 
Training for directors is available as required and is provided 
mainly by means of external courses, internal computer-based 
training, briefings from specific consultants or in-house 
presentations. In addition, directors’ knowledge of the legal and 
regulatory environment is updated through the provision of 
information by the Group’s advisers and by means of regular 
updates from the Company Secretary & General Counsel.
New directors are encouraged to take advantage of opportunities 
to meet with major shareholders and attend presentations to 
analysts where possible.
Directors’ indemnification
In accordance with its Articles of Association, the Company has 
granted a qualifying third party indemnity, to the extent permitted 
by law, to each director. The Company also maintains directors’ 
and officers’ liability insurance.
These provisions are qualifying third party indemnity provisions 
as defined in section 234 of the Companies Act 2006. Neither 
the Company’s indemnity nor the insurance provides cover in 
the event that a director is proven to have acted dishonestly 
or fraudulently.
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2014
50 The current Board composition in relation to non-executive 
directors at 31 December 2014 in terms of length of service 
and current term is set out below.
There is a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the 
appointment of new directors to the Board under which the 
Committee interviews suitable candidates who are proposed 
either by existing Board members or by an executive search firm. 
The search for candidates is conducted, and appointments made, 
on merit, against objective criteria and with due regard for the 
benefits of diversity. When the Committee has found a suitable 
candidate, the Committee proposes the appointment to the whole 
Board, which retains responsibility for all such appointments.
Careful consideration is given to ensure that proposed 
appointees for non-executive roles have enough time available 
to devote to the role and that an appropriate balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience on the Board is maintained. When 
discussions relate to the appointment of the Company Chairman, 
the SID chairs the Committee.
During 2014, the Committee appointed JCA Group to begin 
a search process for new non-executive directors in order 
that there be an orderly succession in place to both refresh 
the balance of the Board’s skills, experience, independence and 
knowledge and to find suitable candidates to step into specific 
roles, such as the chairing of the Audit Committee. JCA Group 
has no other connection with the Company.
Diversity
The Board is committed to the merits of diversity in all its forms 
at Board level and throughout the Group. Although neither the 
Nomination Committee nor the Board has set specific targets 
or objectives for diversity, the benefits of a diverse Board are 
reviewed prior to the commencement of recruitment processes 
at all levels. Currently women represent 29 per cent of the Board 
and the Nomination Committee continues to focus on encouraging 
diverse skill sets, capabilities and experience, recognising that 
directors from different geographical and cultural backgrounds 
may enhance the performance of the Board.

necessary skills, knowledge, experience and diversity. The 
Nomination Committee aims to hire the best available 
candidates, irrespective of age, gender, ethnicity, physical 
appearance, religion, education or beliefs.
The full terms of reference of the Committee are available at 
http://corporate.spirent.com/Governance/Board_Committees or 
from the Company Secretary at the registered office.
Composition of the Committee
At the date of this Report, the Nomination Committee comprises 
the Company Chairman, who also acts as Committee Chairman, 
and four independent non-executive directors.
Committee activity in 2014:
 –the appointment of Rachel Whiting as Chief Financial Officer 
and to the Board; and
 –planning for Board succession, with particular attention to 
a replacement of the Chair of the Audit Committee.
Priorities for 2015:
 –concluding the search process for new non-executive directors; 
and
 –continuing the management of succession planning of  
non-executive directors and senior management.
Succession planning and appointment of directors
Succession planning takes place at Board and senior 
management level to ensure that the Group is managed by 
executives with the necessary skills, experience and knowledge. 
The Board has a role to play in overseeing the development of 
management resources in the Group. Specifically, the Board 
wants to see depth and quality in management and robust 
processes are in place to help the Board in this task.
After a period of adjustment and internal reorganisation following 
the promotion of Eric Hutchinson from the role of Chief Financial 
Officer to Chief Executive Officer, the Committee reviewed the role 
of Chief Financial Officer and generated a set of criteria upon 
which to base recruitment. As an internal candidate, Rachel 
Whiting was already well known to the Board and Committee, 
however, in order to validate her skills and experience against the 
criteria, the Committee appointed Spencer Stuart to carry out a 
benchmarking process on her suitability for the role. On receiving 
a formal report substantiating her suitability for the role of Chief 
Financial Officer, the Committee was pleased to unanimously 
recommend her appointment as Chief Financial Officer and to the 
Board. Spencer Stuart has no other connection with the Company.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Dear Shareholder,
On the following pages we set out the Audit Committee’s Report 
for 2014.
The principal aims of the Committee are to support, with diligent 
oversight, the maintenance and development of a strong control 
environment across the Group and to ensure the integrity of the financial 
information provided to our shareholders in the context of a business with 
ambitious plans and a growing global footprint. We believe that strong 
and effective risk management and control procedures underpin 
Spirent’s ability to execute and implement its strategy. 
Our aspiration is not just to respond to changes, but to support 
and challenge management to develop controls as they 
anticipate future opportunities and risks. 
Whilst the Board is responsible for the preparation of an Annual 
Report that is fair, balanced and understandable, the Committee 
supports the Board in meeting that responsibility and ensuring 
the integrity of the Group’s financial statements. As a result of 
the Committee’s work during the year, it has concluded that the 
processes and controls in place are appropriate and provide 
positive assurance to the Board.
Ian Brindle
Chairman of the Audit Committee
26 February 2015
Fair, balanced, understandable
In making its recommendation to the Board that the Annual Report, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, the Committee applied its robust 
governance arrangements, which include:
 – comprehensive Group and subsidiary accounts processes, with written 
confirmations provided by business unit management teams on the 
health of the financial control environment;
 – reviews of the Annual Report undertaken at different levels of the Group 
and by the senior management team that aim to ensure consistency and 
overall balance;
 – external audit review;
 – clear guidance and instruction of the disclosure requirement provided 
to contributors;
 – inclusion of a new additional written confirmation that information 
provided has been done so on a fair and balanced basis and provides 
the information necessary to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy;
 – additional scrutiny by senior management including focused review 
of risk registers; and
 – additional committee reviews of the draft Annual Report in advance 
of final sign-off in the context of the revised Code provision.
Final sign-off of the Annual Report is provided by the Board, on the 
recommendation of the Committee.
Audit Committee
Responsibilities
The Board has delegated to the Audit Committee responsibility 
for overseeing the financial reporting, internal risk management 
and control functions and for making recommendations to 
the Board in relation to the appointment of the Company’s 
external auditor.
The full terms of reference of the Audit Committee are available 
at http://corporate.spirent.com/Governance/Board_Committees 
or from the Company Secretary at the registered office.
Composition of the Audit Committee
At the date of this Report, the Audit Committee comprises four 
independent non-executive directors, one of whom acts as 
Committee Chairman.
The Board considers that two members of the Audit Committee, 
Ian Brindle (who acts as Committee Chairman) and Tom Maxwell, 
provide recent, significant and relevant financial experience.
The Company’s external auditor, the Chairman, Chief Executive 
Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Group Vice President, Finance, 
Head of Financial Reporting and Company Secretary, who is 
Secretary to the Committee, were in attendance at each meeting 
of the Audit Committee.
In addition, the Audit Committee gives each of the Company’s 
external auditor and the Group Vice President, Finance the 
opportunity to meet without management present.
Committee activity in 2014
The Audit Committee’s activities principally related to financial 
reporting, internal control and risk management and the 
external audit. In addition, the Audit Committee considered 
other specific matters such as the Group’s approach to IT controls 
and cyber security.
Financial reporting and significant issues
During the year, the Audit Committee:
 –reviewed the full year and half-year financial statements, 
interim management statements, key accounting policies and 
significant financial reporting judgements contained therein 
(with particular reference to the critical accounting assumptions 
and judgements as set out in Note 2 of the consolidated 
financial statements on pages 83 to 88) and recommended the 
financial statements to the Board for approval;
 –reviewed whether the Annual Report taken as a whole is fair, 
balanced and understandable and formed an opinion thereon 
prior to recommending it to the Board;
 –reviewed and considered assumptions in relation to the going 
concern basis for preparation of financial statements;
 –reviewed the external auditor’s report on the interim review 
and year end audit and management’s responses to the issues 
raised; and
 –reviewed the treatment of purchase price allocation for 
acquisitions during the period.
The Committee Chairman reports any significant findings or 
identified weaknesses to the Board.
Significant financial issues considered
The Audit Committee has reviewed each of the following key 
significant financial risks by:
Ian Brindle
Chairman of the Audit Committee
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2014
52 Internal control
During the year, the Audit Committee:
 –monitored and reviewed internal control and risk management 
systems;
 –reviewed and approved the internal audit programme for 2014;
 –reviewed the Company’s Whistleblowing Policy and anti-bribery 
and corruption procedures; and
 –reviewed regular reports on taxation, treasury operations, 
health and safety and cyber security.
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system 
of internal control and risk management and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. The Board, assisted by the Audit Committee, has 
reviewed the effectiveness of this system and this review did not 
reveal any significant issues or weaknesses. The Board confirms 
that this system of financial, operational and compliance controls 
and risk management was in place throughout the year under 
review and up to the date of approval of this Report.
The primary aim of the Group’s internal controls is to operate 
a system which is appropriate to the business and which can 
support the Group in delivering its strategic objectives, safeguard 
the Group’s assets and, over time, enhance shareholder value. 
The system is designed to identify, evaluate and manage the 
significant risks faced by the Group rather than to eliminate the 
risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. This is in accordance with the Guidance 
on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting issued by the Financial Reporting Council 
in September 2014. The Group consists of a limited number of 
entities and the Board and Audit Committee continue to consider 
that currently there is no need for a dedicated internal control 
and risk management department.
As disclosed in the “Principal risks and uncertainties” section 
on pages 24 to 27, the Group Risk Owners and their executive 
management review the key risks facing the business. The Group 
Risk Owners, which include representation from each of the key 
business areas, are currently:
 –Chief Executive Officer;
 –Chief Financial Officer;
 –Executive Vice President, Networks & Applications;
 –Executive Vice President, Wireless & Service Experience;
 –Group Vice President, Finance; and
 –Company Secretary & General Counsel.
The Group Risk Owners meet with each business unit periodically to 
challenge and debate the assessment of risk within each business 
unit, who then submit local risk registers for analysis and ranking 
together with Company-wide risks to form a robust corporate risk 
register. This corporate risk register is then presented to the Audit 
Committee three times each year. Actions arising from the Audit 
Committee’s review of the corporate risk register can then be fed 
back to the business units for their management.
Day-to-day responsibility for effective internal control and risk 
management and monitoring rests with senior management at 
business unit level. The Group Vice President, Finance attends 
all Audit Committee meetings to report on internal control and 
risk management and to apprise the Committee of any control 
weaknesses, control failings and risks, their impact and the 
actions taken to deal with the issues. The Group Vice President, 
 –Reviewing papers and management updates;
 –Holding discussions with management and key finance 
staff to challenge assumptions made;
 –Debating alternative treatments;
 –Receiving periodic reports on key areas of judgement;
 –Discussing with external auditor; and
 –Considering analysts’ presentations to assess for 
inconsistencies or areas of bias.
Revenue recognition
The Committee is aware that the potential complexity of 
accounting, as well as the pressure on management to meet 
certain targets, may result in inappropriate recognition of revenue 
and associated balances. Additional training and a programme of 
awareness-raising has been rolled out across the business units, 
as part of their audit procedures agreed with the Committee 
Ernst & Young LLP (“EY”) would examine the allocation of 
revenue and review specific large and complex transactions 
to ensure that revenue has been recognised appropriately.
Tax accounting
The Committee recognises that by operating in a number of 
jurisdictions with differing tax regulations, there is a risk that the 
Group may incorrectly recognise tax charges in the income 
statement for the period and in deferred tax assets. The Committee 
noted that EY would be performing a detailed review of the deferred 
tax recognised and tax provisions to ensure the appropriateness of 
tax disclosures in the Group accounts as part of their audit review.
Acquisition accounting – PPA and opening balance sheets
The Committee acknowledges that the five acquisitions 
completed during 2014 were of varying complexity, with the 
acquisition of Testing Tech in particular requiring estimates to 
be made as regards the put and call options over the non-
controlling interest. The Committee noted that for all acquisitions 
management performs a purchase price allocation exercise and 
assesses the intangible assets to be recognised in the acquisition 
accounting based on judgements around future revenue and 
profit generated by the entity and identification of the potential 
intangible assets. Management also sought advice from external 
experts when dealing with complex judgements.
Acquisition accounting – Goodwill
The Committee considers that management’s assessment of 
goodwill in the acquired business units is not overstated but, in 
the light of the limited headroom, in particular in the Device 
Intelligence and Service Experience units, has asked management 
to monitor the situation closely and report to them regularly.
The Committee noted that EY had included these areas of 
significant risk in the Auditor’s Report on pages 75 to 77 of 
this Annual Report and was satisfied with the results of the 
procedures followed.
The Group Vice President, Finance is responsible for ensuring 
that the finance department employs a level of management 
and specialists appropriate for maintaining financial records and 
processes that provide financial information that is relevant, reliable, 
complies with the applicable laws and regulations, and is distributed 
both internally and externally in a timely manner. A review of the 
consolidation and financial statements is undertaken by senior 
management to ensure that the financial position and results of the 
Group are appropriately reflected. All financial information published 
by the Group is subject to the approval of the Audit Committee prior 
to it being approved by the Board.

continued
statement risk, including the audit approach for these areas 
in some detail. The areas of significant risk are identified on 
pages 52 and 53. The Committee reviewed and appropriately 
challenged the basis for these before agreeing the proposed 
approach and scope of the external audit identified.
EY prepared a detailed report of their audit findings, which was 
presented to the Committee at its meeting in February 2015. 
The findings were reviewed and discussed in detail by the 
Committee, in particular in relation to the areas that had been 
highlighted at the planning stage. As part of the review, the 
external auditor was questioned and challenged by the 
Committee about the work undertaken, its findings and what 
key assumptions had been made during the audit, especially 
with regard to the key areas of audit risk identified.
Prior to recommending their re-appointment as external auditor, the 
Committee considers EY’s independence and objectivity in the light 
of relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements, specifically 
in the light of the Competition Commission’s investigation into the 
market for statutory audit services for large companies and also 
the EU’s review of the audit services market. Although EY or its 
predecessor firms have been the Company’s auditor for more than 
25 years, the firm periodically changes its audit partners at Group, 
divisional and country level, in accordance with professional and 
regulatory standards, in order to protect independence and 
objectivity and provide fresh challenges to the business. Such 
changes are carefully planned to ensure that the Company 
benefits from continuity of staffing without incurring undue risk 
or inefficiency. Karl Havers was appointed as EY lead audit partner 
in 2011 and a new divisional partner has been attached to the 
Networks & Applications business for the 2014 audit.
The Committee noted the introduction of audit tendering 
provisions in the September 2014 UK Corporate Governance 
Code and the applicable date by which the external audit should 
be put out to tender. The Committee continues to consider on an 
annual basis if the audit should be put out to tender ahead of the 
date when this becomes compulsory, but confirms that there are 
no contractual obligations that restrict the Company’s current 
choice of external auditor.
Policy on non-audit services
The Committee’s responsibility to monitor and review the 
objectivity and independence of the external auditor is supported 
by a policy relating to the provision of non-audit services, by the 
external auditor. Taking into account relevant ethical guidance 
this policy precludes a number of non-audit services, including 
services relating to the accounting records and financial 
statements, internal audit, IT consulting, legal and investment 
services and other services deemed by regulators to be 
precluded. The Committee believes the issue of non-audit 
services is linked to external auditor independence and 
objectivity. That said, the Committee accepts that certain work 
of a non-audit nature may be best undertaken by the external 
auditor. The policy is reviewed and financial limits for the 
provision of non-audit services, including audit-related fees, 
tax-related fees and other fees, are set on an annual basis (2014 
$0.6 million (2013 $0.6 million)). Any amounts in excess of this 
limit must be approved in advance by the Audit Committee.
The Committee considers that notwithstanding the non-audit 
services provided during the year totalling $0.2 million 
(2013 $0.2 million), EY’s objectivity and independence 
as external auditor was not impaired.
Finance, is independent of any business unit and is therefore able 
to provide an objective view and continual assessment of the 
effectiveness of internal control and risk management throughout 
the Group. Detailed updates on specific areas, such as cyber 
security or business continuity, are provided by the Group Vice 
President, Finance at the Committee’s request.
Risk management
The Board and Audit Committee consider that having the 
following key elements in place are critical to underpinning the 
overall internal control environment:
Operating structure and controls
An organisational structure with clear operating procedures, 
defined lines of responsibility and delegated levels of authority.
Financial control structure 
A comprehensive strategic planning, financial control and 
budgeting system which is properly documented and 
regularly reviewed.
Ethics Policy 
A policy that sets standards of professionalism and integrity for 
all employees and operations. The Ethics Policy includes sections 
relating to bribery and corruption to ensure that all of Spirent’s 
systems, controls and training comply with the anti-bribery and 
corruption legislation in the countries where we operate and that 
a culture of prevention and detection of all forms of bribery and 
corruption is in place.
Whistleblowing Policy 
A whistleblowing procedure whereby employees may report, in 
confidence, suspected wrongdoings. 
Acquisitions and divestments 
A disciplined due diligence process and post-acquisition 
integration programme.
External audit
During the year, the Audit Committee:
 –reviewed the policy on the engagement of EY to supply 
non-audit services; and
 –reviewed and recommended to the Board the re-appointment of 
EY as external auditor and approval of their fees, in particular in 
light of the UK Corporate Governance Code’s recommendations 
regarding the tender of the external audit contract.
The Committee places great importance on ensuring that high 
standards of quality and effectiveness are maintained within the 
external audit process. It considers a number of areas in relation to 
the external auditor: their performance in discharging the audit and 
interim review of financial statements, their independence and 
objectivity, and their re-appointment and remuneration.
Consideration of the effectiveness of the external auditor also 
forms part of the Audit Committee’s performance evaluation 
questionnaire and is discussed regularly with management to 
enable prompt feedback to be given.
The Company’s external auditor, EY, provided the Committee 
with their plan for undertaking the year end audit at the 
Committee meeting in November 2014. This highlighted the 
proposed approach and scope of the audit for the year and 
identified the areas of significant risk and other financial

54 Report on directors’ remuneration
or misleading reporting. In order to ensure that the Company’s 
executive directors are subject to these provisions, as required 
by the UK Corporate Governance Code applicable to the 2015 
period, the Committee will not make any awards to either Eric 
Hutchinson or Rachel Whiting until after shareholders have 
been given the opportunity to approve the extended EIP. Similar 
malus and clawback provisions will also be applied to the 
executive directors’ annual cash incentive for 2015 and beyond.
The Committee is aware of a developing view among investors 
that would see a holding period of two years following the 
vesting of awards under long term incentive plans, and will 
engage with key shareholders towards the end of 2015 to 
gather their input prior to seeking shareholder approval of a 
new long term incentive plan at the 2016 AGM;
 –We have approved stretching annual cash incentive targets for 
the executive directors and quarterly cash incentive targets for 
senior management, then monitored and reviewed performance 
against those targets; 
 –We have reviewed the Committee’s terms of reference in the 
light of the updated UK Corporate Governance Code issued 
in 2014;
 –The UK Employee Share Purchase Plan (“UK ESPP”), which is 
an HMRC-approved share incentive plan available to all UK 
employees, including executive directors, was approved by 
shareholders in 2005 for a period of ten years. The UK ESPP 
has being operating successfully since November 2010 
alongside similar all-employee share purchase plans around 
the world and provides an opportunity for employees to 
become shareholders, which the Committee wishes to 
encourage. The Committee therefore seeks shareholder 
approval to continue to operate the UK ESPP.
On behalf of the Committee I hope that you find this Report 
comprehensive, clear and informative.

Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
26 February 2015
Dear Shareholder,
As Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased 
to present our Remuneration Report for the year ended 
31 December 2014.
This Report has been prepared on behalf of the Board by the 
Remuneration Committee and has been approved by the Board.
Last year we introduced a number of changes to our Directors’ 
report on remuneration and we were pleased with the levels of 
shareholder support shown for our Remuneration Policy and 
report at the 2014 AGM (see page 62). We do not propose any 
changes to our shareholder-approved Remuneration Policy this 
year but we have made some refinements to our practices in 
line with the move towards compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code published in 2014 and developing 
best practice.
As a Committee, we continue to believe it is essential that 
directors’ remuneration is aligned with the Company’s strategic 
framework, the interests of shareholders and the external 
competitive market.
Committee activities in 2014
 –In order to retain his services beyond May 2015, Eric 
Hutchinson’s fixed term contract has been replaced with a 
12 month rolling contract in compliance with the Company’s 
Remuneration Policy. By removing the fixed term nature of his 
appointment, the Company returns to full compliance with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code 2012;
 –The Employee Incentive Plan (“EIP”), the share incentive plan 
used to make awards to selected employees, including 
executive directors, on a discretionary basis, was approved by 
shareholders and introduced in 2005 for a period of ten years. 
The Committee has reviewed best practice both in our industry 
and market-wide in this area and, in the light of the continuing 
developments arising from the 2014 UK Corporate Governance 
Code and guidance published by institutional investors, has 
decided that the interests of shareholders would be best served 
by seeking an extension to the operating period of the EIP for 
one additional year.
While seeking this extension on broadly the same terms as the 
existing plan, the Committee has however introduced malus 
and clawback provisions. This will enable unvested or vested 
EIP awards to be withheld in certain circumstances where there 
has been found to be misconduct by an individual or there has 
been a requirement to restate financial results due to inaccurate

Compliance statement
This Report on directors’ remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2014 has been prepared on behalf of the Board by the 
Remuneration Committee in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 and the relevant sections of the Companies Act 2006 and meets the requirements of the 
Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority. The Report also describes how, except with regard to Eric Hutchinson’s service 
contract, as more fully described on page 68, the Board has complied with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
issued in September 2012 during the period under review.
The Report is presented in two parts: the Directors’ Annual Remuneration Report and the Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
The Directors’ Annual Remuneration Report sets out details of how our remuneration policy was implemented for the year ended 
31 December 2014 and how it will be applied for the year ended 31 December 2015. At the 2015 AGM to be held on 5 May 2015 the 
Directors’ Annual Remuneration Report on pages 56 to 63 will be put to an advisory shareholder vote.
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy was approved by a binding vote at the 2014 AGM and became effective on 24 April 2014. 
For ease of reference, we are including the Policy in this year’s Report on directors’ remuneration. Cross-references to page numbers 
have been updated but other than that the Policy is the same as stated in the 2013 Report on directors’ remuneration; in accordance 
with the reporting regulations, the illustrations of the application of the remuneration policy on page 70 are the same as included in 
that 2013 report.
Directors’ Annual Remuneration Report 2014
Statement of implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2015 (unaudited)
Information on how the Company intends to implement the Directors’ Remuneration Policy in 2015 is set out below.
The Committee has continued to monitor the executive Remuneration Policy, having regard to evolving market practice whilst also 
seeking to ensure that there is continuity to the structure of executive pay. Accordingly, the existing Remuneration Policy and 
fundamental structure of the executive remuneration package remains largely unchanged and the overall quantum of the annual 
and long term incentive opportunity has not increased.

Annual performance incentives
During 2014, cash incentives were only available to executive directors on an annual basis, with a maximum total cash incentive 
available for Eric Hutchinson and Rachel Whiting of 150 per cent and 75 per cent of base salary respectively.
Growth targets in the Company’s order intake and EPS, representing 80 per cent and 20 per cent of the incentive respectively, 
determined the maximum incentive which could be earned in respect of the annual incentive element. The targets, with minimum 
performance thresholds of 7.71 cents EPS growth and order intake of $476.2 million, were not achieved and therefore no cash 
incentive awards were earned by the executive directors. In the prior year, targets were also not achieved, with no awards earned.
Total pension entitlements
Eric Hutchinson receives a taxable cash allowance in lieu of pension of 20 per cent of base salary. For 2014, the allowance paid 
was £80,000 ($132,000 at an average exchange rate of $1.65:£1) (2013 £69,233 ($108,000 at an average exchange rate of $1.56:£1)). 
Rachel Whiting receives a taxable cash allowance in lieu of pension of 14 per cent of base salary. For 2014, the allowance paid was 
£32,083 ($52,938 at an average exchange rate of $1.65:£1).

Payments to past directors
Bill Burns stepped down as Chief Executive Officer on 3 September 2013. His termination payments were as set out in his service 
agreement and as disclosed in previous Reports on director’s remuneration. He received one month’s base salary ($60,000) as pay 
in lieu of notice and received 11 months’ base salary ($660,000) in ten equal monthly instalments of $66,000 each commencing in 
December 2013; however, this was subject to set-off for any base salary earned from alternative employment during the 12 month 
period following termination on 3 September 2013 (the “Severance Period”), leading to a reduction in the monthly payment from 
$66,000 to $51,416 for the months after April 2014. Monthly COBRA premium payments of $1,840 were also payable for the duration 
of the Severance Period but were also subject to a set-off for health insurance provided by an alternative employer during the 
Severance Period and therefore these payments ceased after April 2014. During 2013 the Company paid $8,000 in respect of 
Mr Burns’ legal fees. All outstanding unvested share awards granted to Mr Burns’ lapsed on termination, however, the Committee 
exercised its discretion under the Plan Rules of the EIP to allow Mr Burns vested and unfettered share awards to continue to be 
exercisable during the 12 month period following termination as these awards had been retained by Mr Burns as part of his 
shareholding to meet the Committee’s shareholding guideline for executive directors. On 19 February 2014 Mr Burns exercised 
this remaining award of 374,000 EIP stock appreciation rights granted at a base price of 50.5 pence on 7 November 2008. 
The applicable fair market value of 104.6 pence resulted in a gain of £202,334.00 ($335,923.07).
Payments for loss of office
There were no payments for loss of office during the year under review other than those payments to Bill Burns set out above.
Non-executive director fees
Details of fees paid to non-executive directors in 2014 and 2013 are as follows:

Shareholding guidelines for executive directors
The Committee believes that to further align their interests with those of shareholders, executive directors should have a significant 
shareholding in the Company equivalent to at least 100 per cent of their base salary in the form of shares and unfettered share 
incentive awards which may be built up over time following appointment as an executive director. The table below sets out the 
holdings of the executive directors who served during the year at 31 December 2014:

An explanation of each share plan and its operation is given in Note 29 to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Group and Note 14 to the parent 
Company financial statements.
1 Key to share plan and type of award: 
EIP SAR – 2005 Employee Incentive Plan Stock Appreciation Rights. 
EIP PS – 2005 Employee Incentive Plan Performance Shares awarded as conditional share awards.
2 The awards of EIP Performance Shares granted on 23 March 2011 were due to vest on 23 March 2014. However, after the testing of performance conditions 
attached to these awards, the Remuneration Committee confirmed that the performance condition thresholds had not been met, resulting in the lapsing of 
the awards in full.
3 There is no exercise price payable for a Performance Share upon vesting. Further details on Performance Shares are provided above.
4 Awards which have passed the date first exercisable have vested and are unfettered, having passed the relevant performance conditions.
5 The market price on date of grant is the price of an Ordinary Share at the close of business on the day before the date of grant.
6 Rachel Whiting was appointed to the Board on 1 February 2014; some of the awards shown were awarded prior to her appointment as Chief Financial Officer.
Scheme interests awarded during the year
In 2014, the Committee approved an award of Performance shares to Mr Hutchinson and Mrs Whiting equivalent to 125 per cent and 
60 per cent of base salary respectively.
Policy for Performance shares granted in 2014
The performance conditions for Performance shares awarded in 2014 under the EIP are calculated over a three-year performance 
period as set out in the following table:
50 per cent of award:

 over the performance period (%) Proportion of Performance Shares vesting (%)
Below 15 0
15 30
Above 15 and below 30 On a straight line basis between 30 and 100

In determining TSR for the Company, share prices will be averaged over the 90 day period immediately prior to, and at the end of, the 
performance period.
SARs and share options
The performance condition for SARs and share options, where awarded, would continue to be based on the rate of growth in the 
Company’s EPS over the three-year performance period.

Share interests vesting during 2015
Awards which are due to vest on 21 March 2015 and are subject to an EPS performance condition have not passed that condition and 
will lapse on that date.
Awards which are due to vest on 21 March 2015 and are subject to a TSR performance condition will have that performance condition 
tested on 21 March 2015.

performance of the Company can be fairly compared, and that the FTSE TechMARK 100 Index provides a particularly representative 
collection of comparator companies.

62 Remuneration Committee
Responsibilities
The Committee is responsible for determining all elements of the 
remuneration of the Chairman, executive directors, Company 
Secretary and senior executives of the Group, reviewing 
remuneration policy and overseeing the operation of the 
Company’s share incentive plans.
The full terms of reference of the Committee are available at 
http://corporate.spirent.com/Governance/Board_Committees or 
from the Company Secretary at the registered office.
Composition of the Committee
At the date of this Report, the Remuneration Committee 
comprises four independent non-executive directors, one of 
whom acts as Committee Chairman. The Company Secretary 
serves as Secretary to the Committee. All members are 
considered independent within the meaning of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”).
Advisers to the Committee
During the year the Committee also consulted with the 
Company’s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial 
Officer and the Company Secretary & General Counsel but not 
on matters relating to their own remuneration.
Kepler Associates Limited, who were appointed by the 
Committee some years ago, provided the results of TSR testing 
to determine the vesting of share incentives.
Kepler Associates Limited is a member of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group and complies with its 
voluntary Code of Conduct in respect of the provision of 
remuneration consulting services, details of which can be found 
at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com and has no other 
connection to the Company. The Committee considers them to 
be independent in their approach.
The fees paid to Kepler Associates Limited to carry out work 
during 2014 for the Remuneration Committee totalled £2,850 
(2013 £17,460) and were based on time and materials.
Directors’ Remuneration Policy (unaudited)
Our Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the 
Company’s 2014 AGM held on 23 April 2014 with 99.02 per cent 
of all votes cast in favour. Accordingly, it had a binding effect on 
the Company from that date. 
The Committee is satisfied that the refinements do not provide 
for any additional payments above those permitted in the 
approved policy, are in line with best practice and are in the 
interests of shareholders.
Components of executive director remuneration
The Committee’s policy is to set remuneration levels which 
ensure that executive directors are fairly and responsibly 
rewarded in return for high levels of performance. The 
remuneration policy set by the Committee aims to encourage a 
performance-based culture which reinforces behaviour that will 
lead to the continued long term successful development of the 
business, is sufficient to attract, retain and motivate high calibre 
executive directors and senior managers and aligns their 
interests with those of shareholders. The Committee believes 
that the aims of the policy are achieved by ensuring that a 
significant proportion of total remuneration is linked to the 
achievement of stretching corporate and individual targets 
both in the short and long term.

annually, with changes effective 
from 1 January
Salaries are typically set after 
considering the salary levels in 
companies of a similar size and 
complexity, the responsibilities of 
each individual role, progression 
within the role, individual 
performance and an individual’s 
experience and with regard to salary 
levels in the country in which the 
executive resides. Our overall policy, 
having had due regard to the factors 
noted, is normally to target salaries 
at the median market level
Salary levels for current incumbents 
for the 2015 financial year are:
Chief Executive Officer 
£400,000 per annum
Chief Financial Officer  
£250,000 per annum
Salaries may be adjusted and any 
increase will ordinarily be (in 
percentage of salary terms) in line 
with those of the wider workforce 
having particular regard to the 
increases in the country in which the 
individual resides
Increases beyond those granted to 
the wider workforce (in percentage 
of salary terms) may be awarded in 
certain circumstances, for example 
where there is a change in 
responsibility, progression in the 
role, experience or a significant 
increase in the scale of the role and/
or size, value and/or complexity of 
the Group
Individual and business 
performance are considered when 
determining salary levels, together 
with experience, scope of 
responsibility and salary increases 
of employees in the country of 
residence of the director
Benefits
To provide market levels of benefits 
on a cost-effective basis
To support personal health 
and wellbeing
May include private health cover 
for the executive and their family, 
life insurance cover, typically up 
to four times annual base salary, 
permanent health insurance and 
a car allowance
Other benefits may be offered from 
time to time broadly in line with local 
market practice in the country of 
residence of the executive director 
Global relocation support and any 
associated costs or benefits may 
also be provided if considered by 
the Committee to be appropriate 
and reasonable to meet the 
requirements of the business
Private healthcare benefits are 
provided through third party 
providers and therefore the cost to 
the Company and the value to the 
director may vary from year to year
It is intended that the maximum 
value of benefits offered will remain 
broadly in line with market practice

Annual incentive
To reward and incentivise the 
achievement of annual financial and 
strategic goals
The performance measures are 
selected to align the strategy of 
the business with shareholder 
value-creation
Measures and targets are set 
annually, payments are determined 
by the Remuneration Committee 
after the year end based on 
performance against those targets
The annual incentive is payable 
in cash
On target opportunity of 100 per 
cent of base salary for Chief 
Executive Officer subject to a cap 
of 150 per cent of base salary 
On target opportunity of 50 per cent 
of base salary for Chief Financial 
Officer subject to a cap of 75 per 
cent of base salary
The Remuneration Committee may, 
in exceptional circumstances, 
amend the payments should this 
not, in the view of the Committee, 
reflect overall business performance 
or individual contribution but they 
would not exceed the maximum 
opportunity set out above
For 2015, the annual incentive is 
based on financial targets only, 
reflecting the focus for the Group. 
Future annual incentives may be 
based on a mix of financial and 
individual business objectives with 
the majority of the weighting being 
given to financial metrics
A sliding scale between 0 per cent 
and 100 per cent of the maximum 
incentive applies for achievement 
between threshold and maximum 
performance under the 
annual incentive
The exact measures, weightings 
and targets are determined by the 
Remuneration Committee each year 
taking into account the Group’s key 
strategic priorities and the approved 
budget for the year
Long term incentives
To incentivise executives to achieve 
enhanced returns for shareholders
To encourage long term retention of 
key executives
To align the interests of executives 
and shareholders
Discretionary awards of conditional 
awards, nil cost options or stock 
appreciation rights (“SARS”) may be 
granted annually as a percentage of 
base salary. Vesting is based on 
performance measured over three 
years. The performance period 
normally starts at the beginning of 
the financial year in which the grant 
is awarded in respect of EPS 
conditions or shortly before the 
date of award in respect of 
TSR conditions
Limits of 250 per cent and 125 per 
cent of base salary for awards of 
SARs and Performance Shares 
respectively
Limit of 250 per cent of base salary 
for combined awards where one 
Performance Share is equivalent to 
two SARs or share options
Award levels and performance 
conditions are reviewed before each 
award cycle to ensure they remain 
appropriate. If employment ceases 
during a performance period, 
awards may be tested on a pro rata 
basis under certain “good leaver” 
circumstances at the discretion of 
the Remuneration Committee

Performance conditions for awards under the Employee 
Incentive Plan (“EIP”)
The Committee reviews the appropriateness of performance 
parameters for each award under the EIP and sets stretching 
performance conditions in the light of the Company’s current 
and expected performance over the vesting cycle.
2015 Policy on share incentive awards
The Committee expects to approve an award of Performance 
Shares to Eric Hutchinson and Rachel Whiting equivalent to 
125 per cent and 60 per cent of annual base salary respectively.
Performance conditions for awards expected to be made in 2015
Having reviewed the performance parameters for awards under 
the EIP, the Committee has determined that for awards to be 
made in 2015, the following parameters are appropriate:
Performance Shares
The performance conditions for Performance shares will be 
calculated over a three-year performance period as set out 
in the following table:
50 per cent of award:
Growth in EPS
1
 over the  
performance period (%)
Proportion of Performance  
Shares vesting (%)
Below 15 0
15 30
Above 15 and below 30 On a straight line basis
between 30 and 100
30 or above 100
Note
1 EPS means Adjusted Basic Earnings per Share after expensing of 
share-based payments.
50 per cent of award:
Absolute TSR
Proportion of Performance  
Shares vesting (%)
Up to 25% growth 0
At 25% growth but  
below 65% growth
On a straight line basis 
between 30 and 100
At or above 65% growth 100
In determining TSR for the Company, share prices will be 
averaged over the 90 day period immediately prior to, and at the 
end of, the performance period.
SARs and share options
The performance condition for SARs and share options, where 
awarded, would continue to be based on the rate of growth in the 
Company’s EPS over the three-year performance period.
Growth in EPS
1
 over the  
performance period (%)
Proportion of SARs/share  
options vesting (%)
Below 15 0
15 30
Above 15 and below 30 On a straight line basis 
between 30 and 100
30 or above 100
Note
1 EPS means Adjusted Basic Earnings per Share after expensing of 
share-based payments.
Shareholder approval for EIP
At the 2005 AGM, shareholders approved the operation of the 
EIP for a period of ten years subject to further approval being 
required on the use of new issue shares or any material changes 
to the plan. In order to undertake a full review of incentive 
arrangements across the Group during 2015, the Board will be 
seeking shareholder approval at the 2015 AGM to extend the 
operation of the EIP for a period of one year. This would be with a 
view to consulting with shareholders prior to seeking approval of 
a new long term incentive plan at the 2016 AGM.
In order to comply with the revised Code published in September 
2014 and applicable to our 2015 reporting period, the EIP has 
been amended to include provisions which permit the Committee 
to reduce unvested or, in the case of options, unexercised awards 
in the event of employee misconduct or where there has been 
a requirement to restate financial results due to inaccurate or 
misleading reporting. Where an award has vested, the Committee 
has discretion to require that the participant return any shares 
received or an equivalent cash amount. Any awards made in 
2015 to executive directors will be made after the 2015 AGM, 
thereby including these provisions.
Approach to recruitment remuneration
In the event that the Company recruits a new executive 
director (either from within the organisation or externally), when 
determining the appropriate remuneration arrangements, the 
Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors, 
(including but not limited to quantum, the type of remuneration 
being offered and the jurisdiction which the candidate was 
recruited from) to ensure that arrangements are in the best 
interests of both the shareholders and the Company without 
paying more than is necessary to recruit an executive of the 
required calibre.
The Committee would generally seek to align the remuneration 
package offered with our Remuneration Policy outlined in the 
table above. However, the Committee retains discretion to 
make proposals on hiring a new executive director which are 
outside the standard Policy. In the first year of appointment, the 
Committee may offer additional remuneration arrangements that 
it considers appropriate and necessary to recruit and retain the 
individual. Such remuneration may be in the form of cash or 
share-based awards which may vest immediately or at a future 
point in time. Vesting may be subject to performance conditions 
selected by the Committee.
The Committee may make awards on appointing an executive 
director to “buy-out” remuneration arrangements forfeited on 
leaving a previous employer. In doing so the Committee will take 
account of relevant factors, including any performance conditions 
attached to those awards, the form in which they were granted 
and the time over which they would have vested. Generally 
buy-out awards would be made on a comparable basis to 
those forfeited.
In the event of recruitment, the Committee may also grant an 
award to a new executive under Listing Rule 9.4.2 which allows 
for the granting of awards, specifically to facilitate, in unusual 
circumstances, the recruitment or retention of an executive 
director, without seeking prior shareholder approval.
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2014
67
Strategic report Governance Financial statements The maximum level of variable pay which may be awarded to new 
executive directors would normally be in line with the maximum 
level of variable pay set out in the policy table on pages 64 to 66 
but in any event would be limited to 400 per cent of base salary, 
excluding any buy-out awards.
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded 
in respect of the previous role may either continue on its original 
terms or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment.
When recruiting non-executive directors, the remuneration 
arrangements offered would normally be in line with those 
paid to existing non-executive directors, details of which are 
set out below.
Service contracts
Executive directors
In normal circumstances, it is the Company’s Policy that service 
contracts for executive directors have no fixed term and are 
capable of termination on no more than 12 months’ notice from 
either the Company or the executive director. It is intended that 
this policy would also apply to new appointments of executive 
directors. Following the termination of Bill Burns’ service 
agreement on 3 September 2013, the Board determined that in 
order to provide certainty and stability, it was in the best interests 
of promoting the long term success of the Company not to 
comply with Provision D.1.5 of the Code with regard to the length 
of service agreements for executive directors. The Company 
therefore entered into a fixed term contract with Eric Hutchinson 
for two years, which was due to expire on 31 May 2015. 
In order to retain Mr Hutchinson’s services beyond the expiry 
date, in December 2014 Mr Hutchinson entered into a new 
12 month rolling contract which is in compliance with the 
Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the 2014 
AGM. Accordingly, the Company is now in full compliance with 
the Code.
Both Eric Hutchinson and Rachel Whiting currently have a service 
agreement with Spirent Communications plc, and, being UK 
residents, both their contracts are in line with UK employment 
practice and are governed by the laws of England. Rachel 
Whiting’s service agreement, dated 1 February 2014 may be 
terminated on 12 months’ notice from the Company and six 
months’ notice from Mrs Whiting. Eric Hutchinson’s service 
agreement dated 8 December 2014 may be terminated on 
12 months’ notice from the Company and six months’ notice 
from Mr Hutchinson.
The Company recognises that its executive directors may, from 
time to time, be invited to become non-executive directors of 
other companies and that such appointments can broaden their 
knowledge and experience, to the benefit of the Company. At the 
date of this Report, neither Eric Hutchinson nor Rachel Whiting 
holds any such external positions.
The service agreements of the executive directors are available 
for inspection on request and will be available for inspection at 
the 2015 AGM.
Report on directors’ remuneration

Non-executive directors
All non-executive directors have a letter of appointment with the 
Company for a period of not more than three years, subject to the 
Company’s Articles of Association. However, since 2011 and in 
accordance with the Code, all directors stand for re-election at 
each AGM.
Details of individual appointments are as follows:

Sue Swenson 1 February 2012 2015 AGM
Alex Walker 22 December 2006 2015 AGM
Both Mr Brindle and Mr Walker were elected to the Board 
on 22 December 2006, and so will be reaching their ninth 
anniversary of appointment before the 2016 AGM. Mr Brindle 
will be seeking re-election at the 2015 AGM in order to assist with 
the handover to a new Chair of the Audit Committee. Mr Walker, 
although not required by the Code to meet the same level of 
independence as the Chairman, will be seeking re-election at 
the 2015 AGM.
The letters of appointment of non-executive directors are 
available for inspection on request and will be available for 
inspection at the 2015 AGM. An example of a letter of 
appointment for a non-executive director is available on the 
Company’s website at http://corporate.spirent.com/Governance 
Remuneration policy for non-executive directors
The Board aims to recruit high calibre non-executive directors, 
with broad commercial, international or other relevant 
experience.
The Company’s Remuneration Policy with regard to fees for 
non-executive directors, including the Chairman, is to pay fees which 
are in line with market practice for companies of a similar size and 
complexity. Fees for the non-executive directors are normally 
reviewed by the Board once every three years and were last 
reviewed on 1 January 2015, having been frozen since 1 January 
2008. It was determined that the basic annual fee for non-executive 
directors would remain at £40,000 per annum for 2015. Fees for the 
Chairman, which are determined by the Remuneration Committee, 
would remain at £160,000 per annum for 2015, having been frozen 
since 1 January 2009. The Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees each receive additional fees of £11,000 and £9,000 per 
annum respectively. As explained on page 48, the Board has asked 
Sue Swenson to become the new Senior Independent Non-
executive Director when Ian Brindle steps down from the Board. 
At such time as Sue Swenson becomes the Senior Independent 
Non-executive Director, she will receive an additional fee of 
£7,500 per annum in recognition of the increased time commitment 
of this role. 
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2014
68 Fees for non-executive directors and the Chairman will be 
reviewed again for the period effective 1 January 2016 onwards.
Non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in cash 
incentive or share incentive arrangements and their service does 
not qualify for pension or other benefits. No element of their fee 
is performance-related.
When recruiting non-executive directors, the remuneration 
arrangements offered will generally be in line with those set 
out above.
Exit payment policy
The Committee is committed to ensuring that it does not pay 
more than is necessary when executives leave the Group and 
its policy on exit payments is and will continue to be in line 
with market practice in the country in which the executive 
director resides:
 –Service contracts contain provisions for the removal of the director 
without compensation for not performing their duties to the 
standard required by the Board or material misconduct;
 –Payment in lieu of notice may be paid under service contracts 
if the relevant notice period is not given to the director or if, 
having received notice from the director, the employer does 
not wish him/her to serve it;
 –Unless provided for in the service contract, the Company would 
seek to apply practical mitigation measures to any payment 
of compensation on termination, for example by reducing 
payments to reflect payments received in respect of alternative 
employment, taking into account all relevant circumstances;
 –Service contracts do not contain provision for additional 
compensation on termination following a change of control 
(as detailed in the Change of Control provisions set out on 
page 73);
 –Service contracts do not contain provision for liquidated 
damages of any kind;
 –Service contracts contain appropriate provisions to protect the 
legitimate interests of the Company with respect to preventing 
any terminated director from working in a business which 
competes against the Company; and
 –Incentives:
 –Cash incentives: unless otherwise provided in the service 
contract, to be consistent with market practice in the country 
in which the executive resides, executives are not entitled to 
accrued cash incentives payable following termination;
 –Employee Incentive Plan (EIP): Leaver provisions were approved 
by shareholders when they approved the EIP. Unvested awards 
will generally lapse at the point of exit. Participants who leave 
due to special circumstances including redundancy, ill-health, 
injury or disability, retirement, death, the Participant’s employing 
company ceasing to be under the control of the Group, a transfer 
of the undertaking in which the Participant works and any other 
reason, if the Committee so decides in general or in any 
particular case may be considered ‘good leavers’ under the EIP 
Plan Rules. In such circumstances, performance conditions are 
assessed by the Committee at the point of exit by testing the 
performance conditions up to the date of exit for TSR 
performance and to the end of the most recent financial period 
for EPS performance. Vesting is then pro-rated for time and 
vested awards may be exercised within 12 months following the 
date of termination of employment.

Illustrations of the application of our Remuneration Policy in 2015
The charts below show an illustration of the proportion of total remuneration made up of each component of the Remuneration Policy 
and the value of each component.
Three scenarios have been illustrated for each executive director:
Minimum performance –Fixed remuneration
1
 –No cash incentive
2
 – No vesting under the Employee Incentive Plan
3
On target performance  –Fixed remuneration
1
 – 100 per cent of target cash incentive paid
2
 – 65 per cent vesting under the Employee Incentive Plan
3
Maximum performance  –Fixed remuneration
1
 – 150 per cent of target cash incentive paid
2
 – Full vesting under the Employee Incentive Plan
3
Notes
1 Fixed remuneration comprises salary and benefit provision as set out in the policy table.
2 Cash incentive is annual bonus for 2015 as set out in the policy table.
3 Vesting of awards under the Employee Incentive Plan assumes full vesting for awards subject to EPS performance conditions for on target and maximum 
performance. The share price is assumed to increase in line with the implied price earnings ratio at 31 December 2014. For awards subject to Absolute TSR 
performance conditions, vesting is assumed to be 30 per cent for on target performance and 100 per cent for maximum performance. The share price is 
assumed to increase in line with the performance condition required under each scenario. Depending on share price performance, the actual outcome may 
be different.

70 Consideration of employee remuneration arrangements 
elsewhere in the Group 
When setting the policy for directors’ remuneration, the 
Committee has regard to the pay and employment conditions 
elsewhere within the Group, particularly in the jurisdictions in 
which the executive directors are based. The Committee is kept 
informed on a regular basis of salary increases for the general 
employee population and takes these into account when 
determining salary increases for executive directors. No salary 
increase has been awarded for the role of either Chief Executive 
Officer or Chief Financial Officer for 2015.
While the Committee does not directly consult with employees as 
part of the process of reviewing executive pay, the Committee 
does receive updates and feedback on employee engagement 
surveys and all-employee pay increases and takes these into 
account when reviewing executive pay. An employee 
engagement survey was undertaken in 2014 and the results 
reviewed by senior management.
Further details of employee remuneration arrangements can be 
found in the “Our employees” section on pages 41 to 43 of this 
Annual Report.
Consideration of the views of shareholders in setting 
Remuneration Policy
The Committee is mindful of the views of shareholders in 
determining appropriate levels of remuneration and in 
ensuring that shareholder and director interests are aligned. 
The Committee is committed to an ongoing dialogue with 
shareholders and seeks shareholder views when any significant 
changes are proposed to remuneration arrangements. In 
particular, the Committee consulted with major shareholders 
regarding the appropriate performance measures for awards 
granted under the Employee Incentive Plan in both 2010 and 
2013 and will continue to do so when changes are proposed to 
ensure both shareholder and director interests are aligned. 
In particular, the Committee will be consulting key shareholders 
in relation to the development of a new long term incentive plan 
prior to seeking approval by shareholders at the 2016 AGM.
Dilution
The Committee is strongly committed to managing shareholder 
dilution in a responsible manner. No new shares were issued 
during the year, with all vesting and exercises of share incentives 
being satisfied by the transfer of shares held by the Company’s 
Employee Share Ownership Trust (“ESOT”). At the date of this 
Report, the ESOT holds 0.7 million Ordinary Shares for the 
purpose of satisfying the exercises of current and future awards 
by employees and former employees of the Group. Overall 
shareholder dilution resulting from the Company’s share 
incentive plans (on a rolling ten-year basis) has fallen by 0.6 per 
cent when comparing the positions at 31 December 2014 (8.3 per 
cent) and 31 December 2013 (8.9 per cent). The overall number of 
share incentives outstanding has risen by 1.2 million during the 
year to 6.6 million at 31 December 2014 (2013 5.4 million).
Legacy matters
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Remuneration 
Policy, authority is given to the Company to honour any 
commitments entered into with current or former directors 
(such as the payment of pension or the unwinding of legacy 
share schemes) that have or will have been disclosed to 
shareholders in remuneration reports before this Policy takes 
effect. Details of any payments will be set out in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration as they arise.
Committee discretion
The Committee has powers delegated by the Board under which 
it operates. In addition, it complies with rules which have either 
been approved by shareholders (the Employee Incentive Plan) or 
by the Board (annual cash incentives). These rules provide the 
Committee with certain discretions which serve to ensure that 
the implementation of the Remuneration Policy is fair both to the 
individual director and to shareholders, taking overall performance 
and the position of the Company into account. The Committee also 
has discretions to set components of remuneration within a range 
from time to time. The extent of such discretions are set out in the 
relevant rules or in the maximum opportunity and performance 
metrics sections of the Policy Table.
In addition, the Committee requires discretion to deal with 
genuinely exceptional or unforeseen circumstances. This form 
of discretion will only be applied in the best interests of the 
Company and when, in the view of the Committee, it would be 
disproportionate to seek specific approval from shareholders in 
general meeting. It is intended that this discretion be used only 
in the event of changed circumstances or strategy that has not 
been provided for in the Remuneration Policy.
The Remuneration Committee will not exercise discretion to 
reward failure and will report on any exercise of discretion that 
changes the amount of remuneration paid in any year.
On 3 April 2014, the Remuneration Committee announced that 
following discussions with shareholder representatives, the 
Committee wished to clarify that any additional cash or share-
based awards offered on recruitment of an executive director 
which may fall outside the policy statement on pages 60 to 62 
of the Annual Report 2013 would be performance-related and 
would therefore be regarded as variable remuneration and fall 
within the Company’s standard 400 per cent cap.
The Remuneration Committee can confirm that no discretion was 
used either during the period or to the date of this Report and 
that it does not envisage any cash payment being offered which 
could be construed as a “golden hello”.

the Company prior to dealing in its securities.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between

any contract of significance between itself or any subsidiary 
undertaking and a controlling shareholder.
Powers for issue of new shares
During the year to 31 December 2014 and to the date of this 
Report, no new Ordinary Shares have been allotted as a result of 
the exercise of options and rights pursuant to the Company’s 
share incentive plans.
At each AGM, the directors seek authority to allot shares for cash 
and to disapply pre-emption rights within prescribed limits. At the 
2015 AGM, authority will be sought to allot new Ordinary Shares 
up to a nominal value of £6,797,132, which is equal to 
approximately 33.3 per cent of the Company’s issued share 
capital as at 6 March 2015.
Return of capital
The Company was first authorised to repurchase up to 14.99 per 
cent of its own issued Ordinary Shares, within certain limits and 
as permitted by the Company’s Articles of Association, at the 
2006 AGM. This authority has been renewed at each subsequent 
AGM, reducing to 9.99 per cent at the 2010 AGM and subsequent 
AGMs. The authority from the 2014 AGM remains valid until the 
earlier of the 2015 AGM or 30 June 2015. Since the Company 
began returning capital to shareholders in May 2006, a total 
of £270.2 million has been returned, through the repurchase 
of 397.6 million Ordinary Shares.
During 2014 9.7 million Ordinary Shares, each with a nominal value 
of 3⅓ pence were repurchased for an aggregate consideration of 
$15.6 million and cancelled immediately following repurchase. This 
represents 1.6 per cent of the Company’s issued Ordinary Share 
capital at the beginning of 2014.
The Company will seek authority to repurchase up to 9.99 per 
cent of its own Ordinary Shares at the 2015 AGM to facilitate any 
further return of capital if the Board concludes that it is in the best 
interests of shareholders to do so.

Share capital
The Company has a single class of share which is divided into 
Ordinary Shares of 3⅓ pence each. Each Ordinary Share carries 
one vote and all of the Ordinary Shares rank pari passu. There 
are no special control rights relating to any of the Ordinary 
Shares. At the date of this Report, 611.7 million Ordinary Shares 
of 3⅓ pence each had been issued which are fully paid up and 
are listed on the London Stock Exchange. The Company also 
operates a Level 1 American Depositary Receipt (“ADR”) 
programme with each ADR representing four Ordinary Shares. 
The ADRs trade on the US over-the-counter market and BNY 
Mellon is the authorised depositary bank for the programme. 
Further details on share capital are set out in Note 28 to the 
consolidated financial statements and Note 14 to the parent 
Company financial statements.
The rights, including those relating to voting, obligations and 
any restrictions on transfer relating to the Company’s Ordinary 
Shares, as well as the powers of the Company’s directors, are

The Company has established two employee benefit trusts in 
connection with the operation of the Company’s share incentive 
plans: the Spirent ESOT and the Spirent Sharesave Trust (“SST”). 
The trustees of both trusts have waived their right to receive 
dividends on any Ordinary Shares held by them except for a 
nominal amount of 1 pence other than for those Ordinary Shares

Rachel Whiting
Chief Financial Officer
26 February 2015
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Report on directors’ remuneration, the consolidated financial 
statements of the Group and the financial statements of the 
parent Company.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law they are 
required to prepare the consolidated financial statements of the 
Group in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union (“EU”) 
and have elected to prepare the parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles and applicable law.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group are required 
by law and IFRSs to present fairly for each financial period the 
financial position and performance of the Group; the Companies 
Act 2006 provides, in relation to such financial statements, that 
references in the relevant part of that Act to financial statements 
giving a true and fair view, are references to their achieving a 
fair presentation.
The parent Company financial statements are required by 
law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
parent Company.
In preparing each of the consolidated financial statements of the 
Group and parent Company financial statements, the directors 
are required to:
 –select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
 –make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 –state for the audited consolidated financial statements of the 
Group whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
 –state for the parent Company financial statements whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the parent Company financial statements; and
 –prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume the Group and the parent 
Company will continue in operational business for the 
foreseeable future.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above 
requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Group and the parent Company 
and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, for the Group, Article 4 of the 
International Accounting Standards (“IAS”) Regulation. They have 
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent 
and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Directors’ responsibilities statement
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2014
74 reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information 
in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information 
that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course 
of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
We identified the following risks that have had the greatest effect 
on the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team:
 –revenue recognition in relation to correct allocation to 
components for multi-element contracts and appropriate 
cut off; 
 –tax accounting, as the Group operates in a number of 
jurisdictions with different tax regulations and available 
credits, there is an increased risk of non-compliance with local 
tax regulations which may result in an understatement of tax 
provisions and liabilities including those arising from penalties 
and charges. In addition, there is a risk that inappropriate use 
of brought forward tax losses and volatility in forecast sales 
may result in incorrect recognition and risks around 
recoverability of deferred tax assets; and
 –acquisition accounting, as there have been a number of 
acquisitions in 2014 for which the value of consideration is 
significant this has been an area of audit focus in the current 
year. The assessment around the purchase price allocation 
of goodwill and intangible assets involves judgment around 
future revenue and profit generated by the entity and the 
identification of the potential intangible assets. The acquisitions 
are of varying complexity and there is a risk around the 
incorrect accounting of contract terms. In addition there is an 
assessment to be made with regards to the opening balance 
sheets acquired and there is a risk that required adjustments 
are not made or that they are incorrect. Lastly there is 
judgement involved in forecasting future cash flows and 
underlying assumptions in relation to current and past 
acquisitions to support their carrying value and thus there 
is a risk that goodwill could become impaired.
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and 
performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of 
misstatements on our audit and on the financial statements. 
For the purposes of determining whether the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement we define materiality as the 
magnitude of misstatement that makes it probable that the 
economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person, 
relying on the financial statements, would be changed or 
influenced. We also determine a level of performance materiality 
which we use to determine the extent of testing needed to 
reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the 
aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements 
exceeds materiality for the financial statements as a whole.
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined 
a magnitude of uncorrected misstatements that we judged 
would be material for the financial statements as a whole. We 
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
 –the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2014 and of the group’s profit for the year 
then ended;
 –the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
 –the parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice; and
 –the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
We have audited the Group financial statements of Spirent 
Communications plc for the year ended 31 December 2014 
which comprise the Consolidated income statement, the 
Consolidated balance sheet, the Consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income, the Consolidated cash flow 
statement and the Consolidated statement of changes in equity, 
the related notes 1 to 33 and the parent Company balance sheet 
and the related notes 1 to 18. The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in the preparation of the parent Company 
financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 74, the directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the Group financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility 
is to audit and express an opinion on the Group financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
Independent auditor’s report to the 
members of Spirent Communications plc
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2014
75
Strategic report Governance Financial statements The way in which we scoped our response to the risks identified 
above was as follows:
Revenue recognition:
 –we have carried out audit procedures on revenue in relation 
to sales contracts specifically focusing on the service element 
of multiple element sales contracts as well as contracts with 
separate components consisting of hardware and subsequent 
software upgrades;
 –we have carried out audit procedures on specific large and 
complex transactions together with a sample of regular 
transactions at each location;
 –we have carried out audit procedures on deferred revenue and 
other revenue associated balances to ensure they have been 
recognised in accordance with Group accounting policies and 
IFRS; and
 –we have carried out audit procedures on cut off in relation to 
revenue recognised close to the year end and with particular 
focus in China and India which might be caused by import 
challenges, including direct confirmations of customers where 
considered necessary.
Tax accounting:
 –assessment of the consistency and robustness of tax 
provisions, particularly in the light of any expected resolution of 
older issues and changes in local regulations; and
 –we have challenged management’s assessment of future profit 
forecasts, and the underlying assumptions and we have 
assessed the utilisation of unrecognised brought forward losses 
to calculate the recognition of deferred tax assets.
Acquisition accounting:
 –we have challenged management’s assessment of control, 
to ensure the decision to fully consolidate the acquiree 
is appropriate;
 –we have reviewed management’s purchase price allocation and 
challenged the underlying assumptions; this included a review 
of external valuation experts, employed by management, 
and meeting with management and these experts to discuss 
the results; 
 –we have carried out audit procedures over the opening balance 
sheet as well challenging the adjustments made;
 –we have reviewed the sale and purchase agreements to ensure 
the acquisitions have been accounted for in accordance with 
the contract terms; and
 –we have reviewed management’s annual impairment review in 
relation to the acquisitions made for indicators of impairment 
challenging management’s underlying assumptions. 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion:
 –the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006; and
 –the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
determined planning materiality for the Group to be $1.65 million 
(2013 $2.25m), which is 5% of profit before tax adjusted for 
non-recurring items for the year ending 31 December 2014. 
Non-recurring items relate to exceptional items and acquisition 
related costs. We note that planning materiality has decreased 
from the prior year due to a reduction in profit before tax. On the 
basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of 
the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement is that 
overall performance materiality for the Group should be 75% 
of planning materiality, namely $1.2 million (2013 $1.7m). Our 
objective in adopting this approach is to ensure that total 
detected and undetected audit differences do not exceed our 
planning materiality of $1.65 million for the financial statements 
as whole. This provided a basis for determining the nature, 
timing and extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying 
and assessing the risk of material misstatement and determining 
the nature, timing and extent of further audit procedures.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the 
Committee all audit differences in excess of $0.09m (2013 $0.1m) 
and differences below that threshold which, in our view 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light 
of other relevant qualitative considerations.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Following our assessment of the risk of material misstatement to 
the Group financial statements, we have scoped in 12 locations 
which represent the principal business units within the Group’s 
three reportable segments; Networks & Applications, Wireless & 
Service Experience and Service Assurance and account for 95% 
of the Group’s total net assets and 89% of the Group’s profit 
before tax. The number of locations has increased from 10 in 
the prior year due to the acquisitions made. For the remaining 
locations, we performed other procedures to confirm there 
were no significant risks of material misstatement in the 
Group financial statements. 
The audit work at the 12 locations was performed at a materiality 
level calculated by reference to a proportion of Group materiality 
appropriate to the relative scale of the business concerned.
Detailed instructions were sent to all auditors in these locations. 
These instructions covered the significant areas that should be 
addressed by the component team auditors (which included the 
relative risks of material misstatement detailed above) and set out 
the information to be reported back to the Group audit team. The 
Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned 
visits that has been designed to ensure that senior members of 
the audit team including the senior statutory auditor visit certain 
material or high risk locations on a rotational basis. In addition for 
all in-scope locations, the component audit teams participated 
in the Group team’s planning event including discussion of fraud 
and error. Telephone meetings were also held throughout the 
year with all in-scope locations to monitor audit progress, audit 
quality and to assess which items required direct involvement 
from the Group team. The Group audit team attended all local 
close meetings. We also required detailed reporting on audit 
results and audit procedures on higher risk areas and performed 
reviews of local audit work of high risk area working papers 
on revenue recognition, whilst all work on tax and acquisition 
accounting was performed at Group level.

Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2014
82 Notes to the consolidated  
financial statements
1. Corporate information 
The Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 were authorised for issue by the Board of directors 
on 26 February 2015. Spirent Communications plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. 
The Company’s Ordinary Shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
As required by the European Union’s (“EU”) IAS Regulation and the Companies Act 2006, the Group has prepared its consolidated 
financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the EU and issued by 
the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). 
The Company has elected to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards. These are 
presented on pages 116 to 129 and the accounting policies in respect of the Company are set out on pages 117 to 119.
2. Significant accounting policies 
Accounting convention
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis apart from certain financial instruments that have been 
measured at fair value.
Going concern
At 31 December 2014 the Group had cash balances of $99.8 million and no debt.
The directors have reviewed the detailed financial projections for a period of 12 months from the date of this report and the business 
plans for the 2016 and 2017 financial years. They have also considered the principal risks and uncertainties that the Group face and 
its current financial position and are satisfied that the Group has adequate financial resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future, a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report. Accordingly, the going concern basis 
continues to be used in the preparation of the financial statements.
New accounting standards
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been adopted by the Group with no significant 
impact on its consolidated results or financial position.
International Accounting Standards (“IAS/IFRS”)
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
IAS 32 Amendments to IAS 32 – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
IAS 39 and IFRS 9 Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 9 – Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting
IFRIC 21 Levies
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries made up to 
31 December each year. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company, 
using consistent accounting policies. Principal subsidiaries and divisions are listed on page 129.
Subsidiary undertakings are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is 
exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the entity.
Results of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated 
from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. 
The separable net assets, including intangible assets of newly acquired subsidiaries are incorporated into the consolidated 
financial statements based on their fair values at the effective date of control.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations and goodwill
A business combination is a transaction or other event in which an acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses. 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
At acquisition date the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including intangible assets, are measured at their fair values. 
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest 
in the acquiree. Non-controlling interests are measured at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2014

Strategic report Governance Financial statements 2. Significant accounting policies continued
Acquisition costs are expensed and included in administration costs.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries, representing the excess of cost over the net fair value of the net assets acquired, 
is capitalised as an intangible asset. Goodwill is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill is subject to an annual review for impairment. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related 
cash-generating units monitored by management. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying 
amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Separately identifiable 
intangible assets such as patent fees, licence fees, trademarks and customer lists and relationships are capitalised on the balance 
sheet only when the value can be measured reliably, or the intangible asset is purchased as part of the acquisition of a business. 
Such intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight line basis. The carrying value of intangible assets 
is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
Product development
Research expenditure is recognised in the year in which it is incurred. Intangible assets arising on the Group’s various product 
development projects are recognised only if the recognition criteria of IAS 38 “Intangible Assets” are met. 
Product development costs are expensed as incurred until the technological feasibility of the product under development has 
been established. Technological feasibility in Spirent’s circumstances occurs when a working model is completed. For software 
development technological feasibility is not established until the process of developing the software is complete. After technological 
feasibility is established, additional costs are capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life.
At 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 no amounts have met the recognition criteria.
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment. Depreciation is not 
provided on freehold land. Depreciation is provided to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of all other assets over their 
estimated useful lives on a straight line basis at rates which take into account commercial conditions at their location. Usual asset 
lives are as follows:
Freehold buildings 50 years
Plant and machinery 3 to 8 years
Fixtures, fittings and equipment
 Building installations 20 years or lease period if less
 Fittings and equipment 3 to 8 years
 Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years
 Business systems software 4 years
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the 
carrying value may not be recoverable.
Impairment of assets 
Intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment at each reporting date where 
there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are assessed at least 
annually. When an impairment test is performed, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of the net present 
value of the expected cash flows (value in use) of the relevant cash-generating unit or asset and the fair value less cost to sell. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Where the carrying amount of an 
asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment 
losses are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Where an impairment loss has been recognised against an asset, it may be reversed in future periods where there has been a change 
in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised, but only to the 
extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation 
or amortisation, had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years. Such a reversal is recognised in the income statement. 
This does not apply for goodwill, for which an impairment loss must not be reversed in any circumstances. 
Leases 
Operating leases are leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset and are not 
finance leases. Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.

financial statements

Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value, after provisions for obsolescence. Cost includes all 
costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition, being the full manufacturing cost on a first-in-first-out 
basis, including all attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recorded when the Group has a present, legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, for which it is 
probable that the Group will be required to settle by an outflow of resources and for which a reliable estimate of the amount of the 
obligation can be made. Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. 
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision shall be the present value of the expenditures 
expected to be required to settle the obligation. 
Foreign currencies 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the Group’s presentation currency. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the rates ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. All exchange differences are taken to 
the consolidated income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are measured in terms of 
historical costs using the exchange rate at the date of the initial transaction.
The functional currencies of the Group’s operations are principally US dollar, sterling or euro. On consolidation the assets and 
liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated into the Group’s presentation currency at exchange rates ruling at the 
balance sheet date. The results of foreign operations are translated into US dollars using average rates for the period. The exchange 
differences arising on retranslation are classified as a separate component of equity, the translation reserve. Such translation 
differences are recognised as part of the profit or loss on disposal should an operation be disposed of. The Group has elected to 
apply the exemption in IFRS 1 “First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards” which allows the cumulative 
translation differences for all foreign operations to be deemed to be zero at the date of transition to IFRSs, being 1 January 2003. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument.
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are stated at original invoiced amount less an appropriate allowance for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts. Such allowances are based on an assessment of debtor ageing, past experience or known 
customer exposures.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits which usually have 
an original maturity of three months or less. For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents 
consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above. There are no bank overdrafts.
Trade payables
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at the original invoiced amount. 
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Spirent Communications plc Ordinary Shares 
held by the Group are classified in equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost and included as a deduction from retained 
earnings. Consideration received for the sale of such treasury shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the 
proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to retained earnings. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage exposures arising on receipts and payments in foreign 
currencies relating to firm commitments. 
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the contract is entered into, 
and are subsequently re-measured to fair value at each reported balance sheet date. The fair value of forward foreign currency 
exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. The 
Group has not adopted the hedge accounting rules. Consequently all gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are taken 
to the income statement.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts. 
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2014

Strategic report Governance Financial statements 2. Significant accounting policies continued
Retirement benefits
The Group operates two funded defined benefit pension plans which are in the United Kingdom, all other pension plans are defined 
contribution in nature. For the defined contribution plans the amount charged to the income statement is the employers’ contributions 
paid or payable during the year.
For defined benefit pension plans full actuarial valuations are carried out every three years using the projected unit credit method, 
and updates are performed at each balance sheet date. Re-measurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of 
changes to the asset ceiling (if relevant) and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the balance 
sheet liability or asset with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. 
Re-measurement recognised in other comprehensive income will not be reclassified to profit or loss. Past service cost is recognised 
in profit or loss in the period of plan amendment. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the 
period to the net defined benefit pension liability or asset, taking account of any changes in the net defined benefit pension liability 
during the period as a result of contribution and benefit payments. Defined benefit pension costs are categorised as:
 –service cost (including current service cost, past service cost and gains and losses on curtailments or settlements);
 –net interest expense or income; and
 –re-measurement.
The Group presents the first two components of defined benefit pension costs in profit or loss. 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group, the revenue can be reliably measured and 
when the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership. In addition, revenue is only recognised 
when collectability is probable. 
For the sale of services, revenue is recognised in accounting periods in which the service is rendered. Revenue from maintenance 
contracts is recognised over the period of performance on a straight line basis.
Revenue from product sales of hardware and software is recognised at the time of delivery and acceptance and when there are 
no significant vendor obligations remaining. It is not until acceptance has occurred that the risks and rewards of ownership are 
transferred to the buyer. Terms of acceptance are dependent upon the specific contractual arrangement agreed with the customer.
Revenue from sales or usage-based royalties is recognised as the subsequent sale or usage occurs.
Contractual arrangements are accounted for as two or more separate transactions only where the commercial substance is that 
the individual components operate independently of each other, because they are capable of being provided separately from one 
another and it is possible to attribute reliable fair values to every component. To the extent that a separate component comprises 
a product sale of hardware or software, revenue is recognised as described above. Revenue is recognised on other components 
as the Group fulfils its contractual obligations and to the extent that it has earned the right to consideration. 
Employee benefits 
When an employee has rendered services to the Group during an accounting period, short term benefits expected to be paid 
in exchange for those services are recognised in the same accounting period. 
Share‑ based payment
The Group operates various equity-settled share-based compensation plans and accounts for these awards in accordance with 
IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment”.
The fair value of these awards is recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period together with 
a corresponding change in equity. The fair value is measured using the Hull-White trinomial model by reference to the share price, 
and taking into account the terms and conditions of the award, excluding non-market vesting conditions, at the date the awards 
were granted. The charge is reassessed at each balance sheet date to reflect the expected and actual levels of vesting, due to 
achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions. Awards where vesting is conditional upon satisfying a market condition or 
non-vesting condition are treated as vesting irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition has been satisfied.
The Group has an employee share trust for the granting of certain share incentives to employees. Shares in the Group held by the 
employee share trust are treated as treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.
Tax
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement 
except to the extent that it relates to items in other comprehensive income or equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable for previous years.

financial statements

Spirent Communications plc

86 2. Significant accounting policies continued
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
 –where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill (taxable temporary differences only) or of an asset or 
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable 
profit or loss; 
 –in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related 
asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Dividends paid
The interim dividend is included in the financial statements in the period in which it is paid, and the final dividend in the period it is 
approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.
Critical accounting assumptions and judgements
The preparation of financial statements requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect items reported. Such 
estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best knowledge of current facts, circumstances and future events, actual 
results may differ, possibly significantly, from those estimates. The areas requiring a high degree of judgement or where assumptions 
and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are discussed below. 
Business combinations and goodwill
The fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on a number of assumptions and judgements by 
management. In establishing the fair value of intangible assets recognised at acquisition and their estimated useful lives the Group 
considers each entity acquired. Valuation estimates are used to determine the fair values of intangible assets and this includes 
estimation of future cash flows, weighted average cost of capital, external royalty rates and useful lives. 
The Group tests annually by cash-generating unit whether goodwill has suffered impairment and more frequently when events or 
circumstances indicate that the current carrying value may not be recoverable. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units 
have been determined based on value in use calculations which require the use of estimates and assumptions. These are described 
in note 14.
Defined benefit pension plans
The pension cost and the defined benefit pension obligation of the Group’s defined benefit pension plans are based on a number 
of selected assumptions; these include the discount rate, inflation rate, salary growth and longevity. Differences arising from actual 
experience or future changes in assumptions will be reflected in future periods. The effect of changing these assumptions 
is described in note 10.
Revenue recognition
For revenue recognition purposes contractual arrangements are accounted for as two or more separate transactions only where the 
commercial substance is that the individual components operate independently of each other, because they are capable of being 
provided separately from one another and it is possible to attribute reliable fair values to every component. Management exercises 
a degree of judgement in setting the criteria used for determining when revenue which involves several elements should be 
recognised and the fair values allocated to each element.
Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in a number of tax jurisdictions and judgement is applied in determining the worldwide 
provision for income taxes. There are many transactions for which the final tax determinability is uncertain. For example liabilities 
are recognised for anticipated tax audit issues based on whether additional taxes are likely to be due based on the facts and 
circumstances known at the time the financial statements are prepared. Where the final outcome differs from the amounts that 
were initially recorded the differences will be recorded in the future period in which the determination is made.
Deferred taxes
The extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognised is based on current forecasts and estimates prepared by management. 
A change to these forecasts and estimates could result in a different recognition outcome. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are 
disclosed in note 22.

4. Operating segments
The Group’s organisational structure is based on differences in the products and services offered by each segment and information 
regularly reviewed by the Group’s Chief Executive Officer, its chief operating decision maker, is presented on this basis. The Group’s 
operating segments follow this structure.
The Group’s reportable operating segments are Networks & Applications, Wireless & Service Experience and Service Assurance. 
The Group evaluates segment operating profit before exceptional items, acquisition related costs, acquired intangible asset 
amortisation and impairment and share-based payment. Finance income and finance costs are not allocated to the reportable 
segments. Corporate is not an operating segment and costs are separately reported and not allocated to the reportable segments. 
Information on segment assets and segment liabilities is not regularly provided to the Group’s Chief Executive Officer and is therefore 
not disclosed below.
The principal activities of each of the reportable operating segments are as follows:
 –Networks & Applications develops innovative solutions for functional, performance and security testing of next-generation networks

Defined benefit plans
i) Characteristics and risks associated with the Plans
The Group sponsors two funded defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom: the Spirent Communications plc Staff Pension 
& Life Assurance Plan (“Staff Plan”) and the Spirent Communications plc Retirement Cash & Life Assurance Plan (“Cash Plan”). These 
plans are funded and have full UK HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) tax-exempt approval. Both schemes are administered by a 
trustee board which is comprised of representatives from the employer, member nominated trustees and an independent trustee. 
The trustee board operates in accordance with the Trust Deed and Rules of each Plan and acts in the interests of all of its members.
 –The Staff Plan is the Group’s most significant plan, and it provides its members with retirement benefits based on their final salary 
and length of service. The Staff Plan was closed to new entrants on 1 October 2002.
 –The Cash Plan is primarily a defined contribution arrangement, although there are some legacy defined benefits (Old Section) 
that have been valued for the purpose of these accounts in accordance with IAS 19 “Employee Benefits”. Members who left service 
before 1992 are entitled to a cash lump sum on retirement that is based on their salary and length of service. Members of the 
Old Section are entitled to defined contribution benefits, but with an underpin based on salary and length of service.
There is also a United Kingdom unfunded plan, which consists of a contractual obligation for the Group to top up certain former 
employees’ benefits whose salaries exceeded the statutory earnings cap.
As with a vast majority of similar arrangements in the United Kingdom, the Group ultimately underwrites the risks relating to the 
defined benefit plans. These risks include investment risks and demographic risks, such as the risks of members living longer 
than expected.
The plans hold a large proportion of their assets in equity. Strong future equity returns would be expected to reduce the Group’s 
future cash contributions (and vice versa).
Expected contributions to the defined benefit plans in 2015 are $4.4 million. This includes the contributions agreed with the funded 
plans’ trustees in accordance with UK legislation. Following the triennial valuations as at 1 April 2012, the Group has agreed to pay 
the following contributions in order to clear the funding deficit as assessed by the trustees’ independent actuary.
 –Staff Plan: $4.1 million per annum from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2019, plus a further contribution of up to $3.9 million by July 2016 if the 
plan remains in deficit.
 –Cash Plan: $0.3 million per annum from 1 July 2013 to 31 March 2015.
If the contributions currently agreed are insufficient to pay the benefits due, the Group will need to make further contributions.
ii) Amounts in the financial statements
The assets and liabilities on the balance sheet are as follows:

f) The key financial assumptions 
The assumptions used for both plans using a weighted average were as follows:
2014 2013
% %
Inflation – RPI 2.9 3.3
Inflation – CPI 1.8 2.2
Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.0 3.1
Rate of increase for pensions in payment pre 2001 service 3.6 3.6
Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2001 to 5 April 2005 service 2.8 3.1
Rate of increase for pensions post 5 April 2005 service 2.0 2.2
Rate of increase in deferred pensions 1.8 2.2
Rate used to discount plan liabilities 3.6 4.5
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements. The assumptions 
are such that a member currently aged 65 (2013 aged 65) will live on average for a further 23.5 years (2013 23.5 years) if they are 
male and for a further 25.7 years (2013 25.6 years) if they are female. For a member who retires in 2034 (2013 in 2033) at age 65 
(2013 age 65) the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 24.4 years (2013 24.3 years) after retirement if they 
are male and for a further 26.8 years (2013 26.7 years) after retirement if they are female. 
iii) Amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows
The approximate impact to the past service liabilities of changing these main assumptions is as follows: 
 –Reducing the discount rate by 0.1 per cent per annum would increase past service liabilities by $4.1 million. 
 –Increasing RPI inflation by 0.1 per cent would increase the plans’ liabilities by $1.7 million.
 –Increasing the life expectancy of a member by one year (by modifying the standard mortality tables using an appropriate scaling 
factor) would increase past service liabilities by $11.7 million. 
There will also be an impact on the future service cost but given the small active population in these plans this is likely to 
be insignificant.

The sensitivity figures have been calculated to show the movement in the defined benefit obligation for each assumption change in 
isolation, and assuming no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date and may not be representative of the actual 
change as the changes in assumptions may not occur in isolation.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 15 years (2013 15 years).
Defined contribution plans 
United Kingdom 
The Group maintains defined contribution pension plans for employees in the United Kingdom. Employer contributions into these 
plans for 2014 were $1.2 million (2013 $1.4 million). 
United States 
The Group maintains a defined contribution pension plan for employees of its United States subsidiaries. This plan, also known as a 
401(k) Plan, allows employees to defer a percentage of their salary for retirement. The investment choices offered by the plan are a 
selection of diversified mutual funds offering a broad mix of investment return potential with varying levels of risk. In aggregate, the 
Group’s contributions to the US plan totalled $3.7 million for 2014 (2013 $3.3 million). Total assets in the defined contribution plan at 
the end of 2014 were $222.5 million (2013 $204.6 million). There were no defined benefit plans in the United States in 2014 or 2013.
Other jurisdictions 
Outside the United Kingdom and the United States employees are provided with pension arrangements determined in accordance 
with approved local practice and regulations. These arrangements are defined contribution plans. Total employer contributions for 
2014 in respect of these plans amounted to $1.2 million (2013 $0.9 million).
Total employer contributions to defined contribution plans were $6.1 million (2013 $5.6 million).

The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations were:
 –revenue growth rates;
 –gross margin;
 –operating expenses;
 –discount rate; and
 –growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the five-year period covered by management’s projections.
The cash flows are derived from the most recent financial budgets for the next financial year, as approved by the Board, and the 
Group’s three year strategic plan. Cash flows for years four and five are then extrapolated based on long range plans. Cash flows in 
subsequent years have been extrapolated using a steady 2.0 per cent growth rate for Developer Tools, as this is considered to be a 
more mature business, and 2.75 per cent for all other CGUs (2013 2.75 per cent for all CGUs) which management estimates to be the 
approximate average long term growth rate for the industries in which these units operate. 
The discount rate applied to the cash flows is based on Spirent’s weighted average cost of capital by taking the risk free rate for 
ten-year government bonds and making an adjustment to reflect the increased risk of investing in equities. In making this adjustment, 
the inputs required are the equity market risk premium, beta, and the risk adjustment applied to reflect the risk of Spirent relative to 
the market as a whole. The discount rate is adjusted to reflect the systematic risk of the specific CGU, taking into account the relative 
size of the CGU and the territories in which it operates.
The cash flows have been discounted using the following pre-tax discount rates:
2014 2013
% %
Networks & Applications 14.3 13.8
Wireless & Positioning 14.5 13.8
Service Experience 17.1 13.8
Testing Technologies 14.7 –
Developer Tools 13.5 –
Customer Experience Management 17.5 –
Device Intelligence 16.0 –
For Spirent the key factor in the cash flow forecasts is the ability to forecast revenue. All CGUs operate in the data technology market 
and generate a high gross profit (gross margin); consequently changes in revenue can have a significant impact on the operating profit 
and cash flows. Revenue growth rates used in the projections are based on management’s estimate of growth in the markets served 
and take into account historic levels of growth, expected future developments in products and technology, industry forecasts and 
macro-economic conditions in the territories in which the CGUs operate. As Testing Technologies, Developer Tools, Customer 
Experience Management and Device Intelligence were all acquired in 2014, management has also considered the detailed projections 
and information that was prepared during the due diligence processes and the post-acquisition performance to date. Gross margin 
and operating expenses are based on historical values adjusted for the effect of revenue growth and recent acquisitions. 
The recoverable amount of each CGU was calculated on a value in use basis and was in excess of its carrying value, and 
consequently no impairment has been recognised.

Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions 
The directors believe that no reasonable possible change in any of the key assumptions used in isolation would cause the value 
in use of the Networks & Applications, Wireless & Positioning, Testing Technologies, Developer Tools and Customer Experience 
Management CGUs to fall below carrying value.
The headroom on the Service Experience and Device Intelligence CGUs was $6.3 million and $1.3 million, respectively. 
Revenue growth is projected to be higher in year 1 than the growth experienced in 2014 for the Service Experience CGU as 
management has invested in infrastructure and undertaken new initiatives during 2014 to position this product line for growth 
in 2015 and beyond. In addition, new product launches are expected to benefit 2015.
The Device Intelligence CGU is projecting significant revenue growth in year 1 in line with the acquisition plan. The strategy behind 
this acquisition was to combine Spirent’s multiple offerings in solutions to target a larger global customer base and the acquisition will 
also benefit from the sales channels available in the Spirent Group. 
Sensitivity analysis around the key assumptions has indicated that for these CGUs, the following changes in assumptions (in isolation) 
would cause the value in use to fall below the carrying values:
Year ended 31 December 2014
change required to trigger impairment
Service Experience
Forecast revenue

10.5% decrease
Long term growth rate 4.0 percentage point decrease to -1.3% 
Discount rate 1.8 percentage point increase to 18.9%
Device Intelligence
Forecast revenue
1
4.7% decrease
Long term growth rate 1.2 percentage point decrease to 1.5%
Discount rate 0.7 percentage point increase to 16.7%
Note
1 Cumulative effect of a decrease in revenue in year 1 and continuing to apply the forecast growth rates to subsequent years.
In 2013 there were no reasonable possible changes that would have led to impairment.
Intangible asset impairment
An intangible asset impairment charge of $1.0 million has been incurred in respect of the R&D asset arising on the acquisition of 
NetGend. The asset had been acquired at a pre-production stage and, although the intention is to use this technology to enhance 
Spirent’s solutions, the extent and the means by which this will be achieved had not been determined at 31 December 2014, resulting 
in an impairment charge. Following this impairment the recoverable amount of NetGend was nil.
The impairment charge has been expensed to administrative expenses in the income statement.

exercise of share incentives.
Deferred tax assets on temporary differences of $5.8 million arising in the rest of the world (2013 $4.7 million) have not 
been recognised.
The Group has tax losses arising in the United Kingdom of $56.4 million (2013 $65.1 million) that are available for offset against 
suitable future taxable profits. A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these losses as their future recovery 
is uncertain. United Kingdom tax losses can be carried forward indefinitely. In total deferred tax assets amounting to $17.1 million 
(2013 $17.7 million) have not been recognised.
The Group also has capital losses carried forward of $1,284.3 million (2013 $1,366.6 million) for which no deferred tax asset is 
recognised on the balance sheet. These capital losses have no expiry date.

Future changes in tax rates
The UK current tax rate was reduced from 23 per cent to 21 per cent with effect from 1 April 2014. Under the Finance Act 2013, the UK 
current tax rate will reduce to 20 per cent with effect from 1 April 2015. This will reduce future tax rates accordingly. These reductions 
in the current tax rate were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013.
In line with these rate changes, deferred tax assets and liabilities being realised or settled before 1 April 2015 have been based on the 
existing 21 per cent rate; those being realised or settled after 1 April 2015 have been based on a rate of 20 per cent.

Put option 2.7 –
In relation to the acquisition of Testing Technologies IST GmbH in 2014 the minority stake of 42 per cent of the share capital is the 
subject of a put and call option which expires on 31 March 2016. The consideration is based on the 2015 revenue performance of 
Testing Tech and set at a minimum amount of Euro 1.4 million.
A financial liability of Euro 2.2 million ($2.7 million) has been recorded to reflect the fair value of the exercise price of the option, 
measured at recurring fair value through profit and loss and considered to be categorised within level 3 as no observable market data 
is available. 
The fair value of the put option over the non-controlling interest has been measured using discounted cash flows with inputs derived 
from the projected financial performance in accordance with the agreement. 
An increase or decrease in the projected financial performance used in the put option measurements by 10 per cent would increase 
or decrease the liability by $0.2 million.

Group’s liquidity requirements.

The Group enters into derivative transactions, forward foreign currency exchange contracts, for the management of the Group’s 
foreign currency exposures when deemed appropriate. These derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value; however, 
the fair values at 31 December 2014 and 2013 were immaterial to these accounts.
The key objective of the Group’s treasury department is to manage the financial risks of the business and to ensure that sufficient 
liquidity is available to the Group. All treasury activity operates within a formal control framework. The Board has approved treasury 
policies and guidelines and periodically reviews treasury activities. Additionally, it is the Group’s policy that speculative treasury 
transactions are expressly forbidden.
a) Market risk 
The main types of market risk that affect the Group are interest rate risk and exchange rate risk.
Interest rate risk 
The Group has no external debt and has limited exposure to interest rate risk.
The Group’s excess funds are principally held in the United Kingdom and the United States and invested in on-demand or short term 
bank deposits. It therefore has some exposure to interest rate risk arising on changes in sterling and US dollar interest rates.
Cash and cash equivalents, long term cash on deposit and forward foreign currency exchange contracts are the Group’s financial 
instruments which are exposed to interest rate risk.
Short term bank deposits and forward foreign currency exchange contracts mature within three months. The financial instruments 
bear the following interest rates: 
2014 2013
Effective 
interest rate 
% $ million
Effective

Fixed deposits 0.24 5.0 0.27 44.1

Notes to the consolidated  
financial statements
continued 
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2014
106 26. Financial instruments and financial risk management continued
Interest rates on financial instruments classified as fixed rate are fixed until the maturity of the instrument. All fixed rate deposits 
mature within three months after which date they will be exposed to floating rates of interest.
At 31 December 2013 $0.1 million was held in a blocked trust account and was earning interest of 0.44 per cent. The maturity of the 
deposit was three months; at maturity the interest rate was reset. 
Interest receivable for the year was $0.4 million (note 7) (2013 $0.9 million) and is under the effective interest method. 
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above table are non-interest bearing and are therefore not 
subject to interest rate risk.
A movement of 25 basis points in interest rates based on levels of investment at 31 December 2014 would increase or reduce interest 
income and equity by $0.2 million (2013 $0.5 million).
Exchange rate risk 
Currency exposures arise from trading transactions undertaken by the Group in foreign currencies and on the translation of the 
operating results and net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
The Group has the majority of its operations in the United States and presents its consolidated financial statements in US dollars. 
The Company’s functional currency is sterling and its share capital is denominated in pounds sterling; the Group also has operations 
in Europe and Asia and therefore its results and assets and liabilities are affected on translation by movements in exchange rates in 
relation to the US dollar. The Group does not enter into instruments to hedge the translation exposure of the operating results or net 
assets of its overseas subsidiaries since these are considered accounting and not cash exposures.
The Group undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. 
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters using forward foreign currency exchange contracts. 
The main exposures arise in relation to US dollar receivables and cash balances held by non-US operations. Group treasury, by 
means of forward foreign currency exchange contracts, carries out transaction hedging. A 10 per cent appreciation or depreciation 
of sterling and euro against the US dollar would increase or reduce profit before tax by $1.1 million (2013 $0.8 million) based on the 
balance at the reporting dates.
b) Credit risk 
Investment counterparties are subject to pre-approval by the Board with pre-approved limits set for each bank to avoid any 
concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum credit exposure at the balance sheet date under financial instruments in relation to cash and bank deposits is equal 
to the carrying value of $99.8 million (2013 $216.3 million).
Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for 
uncollectable amounts where appropriate. Trade receivable exposures are managed in the business units where they arise. 
Allowance is made for bad and doubtful debts based on management’s assessment of the risk taking into account ageing profile, 
experience and circumstance.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk attributable to its trade receivables as the exposure is spread over a large 
number of customers with no one customer accounting for more than 10 per cent of total Group revenue. The maximum credit 
exposure at the balance sheet date in relation to trade receivables is equal to the carrying value of $107.8 million (2013 $90.0 million).

The composition of trade receivables at 31 December is as follows: 
2014 2013
$ million $ million
Neither impaired nor past due 68.2 59.9
Past due but not impaired:
 Less than 30 days overdue 20.5 15.5
 30 to 60 days 7.9 5.1
 Over 60 days 11.2 9.5
Trade receivables 107.8 90.0
The Group closely monitors amounts due from customers and performs activities such as credit checks and review of payment 
history and has put in place appropriate credit approval limits. Based on these procedures management assessed the quality of those 
receivables that are past due but not impaired as low risk.
The movement on the receivables provision during the year is given in note 19. The value of impaired trade receivables is $1.1 million 
(2013 $1.0 million). For all other financial assets the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount.
c) Liquidity risk 
The Group’s objective is to ensure that there are sufficient sources of funding to meet projected requirements. Its operations are 
financed through cash and cash equivalents held centrally and cash generated from operations.
At 31 December 2014 the Group had cash and cash equivalents of $99.8 million (2013 $216.2 million) of which $94.8 million 
(2013 $170.9 million) is available on demand and $5.0 million matures within three months (2013 $45.3 million on one months’ notice 
or matures within three months).
During 2014 the Group generated $41.7 million of cash from operating activities (2013 $67.4 million) and considers that with current 
cash resources, no debt and positive cash flow from its operating activities it has adequate resources available to it to remain in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Group has entered into forward foreign currency exchange contracts all of which mature within three months. The gross 
settlement amounts of these contracts are as follows:
2014 2013
$ million $ million
Sale of US dollars against sterling 6.3 3.5
The Group is debt free and does not have loans payable. Financial liabilities are trade and other payables, the majority of which are all 
due to be settled within one year, and provisions (note 25). In addition, the Group has a liability in respect of a put and call option with 
a fair value of $2.7 million which will be settled in 2016 (see note 24).
The Group does not have any other material financial contractual commitments.
d) Fair value of financial instruments 
The carrying value of all financial assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value although the amounts at 31 December 2014 and 2013 were immaterial.
The fair value of currency derivatives is determined by reference to forward foreign currency exchange rates for contracts with similar 
maturity profiles, and is therefore determined to be a level 2 financial instrument as its value is based on observable market inputs.
e) Capital management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to support its business and maximise shareholder value. The Group’s 
capital is its total shareholders’ funds.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions. During 2014 and 
2013 the Company has been operating an on market share repurchase programme. In 2014 the Company repurchased 9.7 million of its 
Ordinary Shares at a cost of $15.6 million (2013 29.2 million at a cost of $55.5 million). No further share buybacks are currently planned.
Spirent’s policy on the payment of dividends to shareholders is to maintain a sustainable dividend.

b) Equity and reserves
The nature and purpose of each reserve within equity is as follows:
i) Share premium account: this reserve records the consideration premium for shares issued at a value that exceeds their nominal value;
ii) Capital redemption reserve: this reserve arises in relation to share capital cancellation;
iii) Other reserves: share capital, share premium account and capital redemption reserve are translated into US dollars at the rates 
of exchange at the balance sheet date and the resultant exchange differences are included in other reserves; and
iv) Translation reserve: this reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements 
of foreign subsidiaries.
Investment in own Ordinary Shares
At 31 December 2014, the ESOT held 0.7 million Ordinary Shares (2013 0.9 million Ordinary Shares) to satisfy awards under various share 
incentive plans. At 31 December 2014, the SST held 0.5 million Ordinary Shares (2013 0.5 million Ordinary Shares) to satisfy awards 
made to United Kingdom based employees under an all employee share scheme. The market value of own Ordinary Shares held in trust, 
being in total 1.2 million Ordinary Shares (2013 1.4 million Ordinary Shares), at 31 December 2014 was $1.4 million (2013 $2.5 million).
Capital redemption reserve
During 2014 the Company cancelled 9.7 million Ordinary Shares (2013 29.2 million Ordinary Shares) that had been the subject of 
the on market share repurchase programme, and transferred $0.5 million (2013 $1.5 million) to the capital redemption reserve.
Share repurchase
During 2014 the Company repurchased 9.7 million (2013 29.2 million) Ordinary Shares on market at a cost of $15.6 million 
(2013 $55.5 million) which were subsequently cancelled.

Share buyback obligation
On 23 December 2013 the Company entered into an irrevocable agreement with UBS Limited to purchase Ordinary Shares up to 
a maximum value of $18.2 million at no more than 105 per cent of the average market value of a share for the five business days 
immediately preceding the day on which the share is purchased, with the maximum number of shares acquired on any dealing day 
not to exceed 250,000 shares, from 2 January 2014 to 26 February 2014, on their behalf. This agreement entered into in respect of 
share buybacks during the close period has been recognised as a financial liability of $18.2 million at 31 December 2013.
As at the close of business on 26 February 2014, 9.7 million shares had been repurchased under this buyback programme at an 
average price of 97 pence per share for a total consideration of $15.6 million. The remaining liability expired at close of business 
on 26 February 2014.

Description of employee share plans
Discretionary plans
2005 Employee Incentive Plan (“EIP”)
The EIP, which was approved by shareholders and introduced in 2005, is available for selected employees, including executive 
directors, on a discretionary basis.
Under the EIP, the Company is able to grant share options, including HMRC-approved options, share settled stock appreciation rights 
(“SARs”) and Performance Shares. No price is payable on the grant of an award.
In normal circumstances, EIP awards vest three years following the date of grant provided the relevant performance conditions 
have been met. For share options and SARs, the performance conditions relate to the Company’s earnings per share (“EPS”). 
For Performance Share awards made prior to 2011, performance conditions related to Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”). For awards 
made since 2011, performance conditions relate to the Company’s EPS and TSR.
Further information on the performance conditions for EIP share incentives is set out in the Report on directors’ remuneration on 
pages 55 to 71.
Options and SARs granted under the EIP expire on the tenth anniversary of their grant unless they have previously lapsed or 
been exercised.
Spirent Stock Incentive Plan (“SSIP”)
The SSIP is now closed for new awards and has been replaced by the EIP referred to above.
The SSIP was introduced in 2000. This discretionary plan was primarily targeted at US employees with grants normally determined 
by reference to the seniority and contribution of the individual, together with the performance of the relevant business and prevailing 
local market practice. Grants were also permitted to selected newly hired and promoted employees on a monthly basis. Under the 
SSIP, the Company was able to grant share options and share settled SARs. No price was payable on the grant of an award.
Most awards made pursuant to the SSIP vest over four years, provided that the participant remains in employment. Vesting is not 
normally subject to a performance condition and awards become 25 per cent exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of grant 
and thereafter in equal tranches on a monthly basis over a further 36 months. Any award not exercised by the seventh anniversary of 
the date of grant will lapse.
The vesting of some SSIP awards were subject to the Company meeting EPS growth targets over the vesting periods. All outstanding 
awards have now passed their EPS performance conditions and remain exercisable until they expire on the seventh anniversary of 
their respective grant dates.
SARs granted under the EIP and SSIP will deliver the appreciation value (ie the increase in market value of an Ordinary Share over 
the base price of the SAR) in the form of Ordinary Shares. This “SARs approach” helps the Company manage its dilution headroom 
more efficiently as only the SAR gain needs to be funded. Using a SARs approach, it is not possible to determine the precise level 
of dilution until the SARs are exercised. At 31 December 2014, 3.6 million EIP SARs with an average base price of 116 pence were 
outstanding and no SSIP SARs remained outstanding (2013 2.8 million EIP SARs and 0.1 million SSIP SARs with an average base price 
of 127 pence and 60 pence respectively). During 2014, 0.5 million EIP and SSIP SARs were exercised resulting in the transfer from the 
ESOT of 0.2 million Ordinary Shares (2013 1.1 million Ordinary Shares were issued or transferred on the exercise of 1.6 million EIP and 
SSIP SARs).
1995 Executive Share Option Scheme (“ESOS”)
The ESOS is now closed for new grants and has been replaced by the EIP referred to above.
Under the ESOS awards of share options, including HMRC-approved options, were on a discretionary basis. No price was payable 
on the grant of an option and no options were granted at a discount to the market price.
The normal exercise period for options granted under the ESOS is between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant. 
Options awarded under the ESOS were subject to the achievement of an EPS performance condition before they could be exercised. 
All outstanding options have now passed their EPS performance conditions and remain exercisable until they expire on the tenth 
anniversary of their respective grant dates.
All Employee plans
UK Employee Share Purchase Plan (“UK ESPP”)
The UK ESPP, which is an HMRC-approved share incentive plan, was approved by shareholders in 2005 and is available to all UK 
employees. The UK ESPP offers four ways to provide Ordinary Shares to employees: free shares, partnership shares, matching shares 
and dividend shares. The UK ESPP operates in conjunction with a trust, which holds the shares on behalf of participants.
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2014

Strategic report Governance Financial statements 29. Employee share plans continued
In November 2010, the Company commenced making invitations to all UK employees to acquire partnership shares on market using 
deductions from payroll.
US Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“US ESPP”)
The US ESPP was initially approved by shareholders in 2000, with amendments being approved by shareholders in 2005 and 2011. 
The US ESPP enables the Company to invite all US employees to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company on market using 
deductions from payroll. In November 2010, the Company commenced making six-monthly invitations to employees. 
The US ESPP also enables the Company to grant eligible US employees the right to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company using 
the proceeds of a savings contract. If such a grant were made, when joining the US ESPP, participants would enter into a 12 month 
contract to save up to 15 per cent of base salary subject to an individual limit of $1,000 per month. No grants of this nature have been 
made since 2003.
Global All Employee Share Purchase Plan (“GAESPP”)
The GAESPP was initially approved by shareholders in 2001 with amendments being approved by shareholders in 2005 and 2011. 
The GAESPP enables the Company to invite employees in countries other than the US or UK to acquire Ordinary Shares in the 
Company on market using deductions from payroll. In September 2011, the first such invitation was made to all employees in Canada, 
Hong Kong, France and Germany and subsequent invitations have been made on a six-monthly basis since 2012.
The GAESPP can also be operated on similar terms to the US ESPP above, with participants entering into a 12 month contract to save 
up to 15 per cent of base salary subject to an individual limit. No grants of this nature have been made since 2003.
2005 Sharesave Scheme 
The 2005 Sharesave Scheme was approved by shareholders in 2005 and was introduced following the expiry of the Savings 
Related Share Option Scheme. The scheme is an HMRC-approved Save-As-You-Earn scheme open to all UK employees, subject to 
a qualifying service period. No price is payable on the grant of an option. The option exercise price is calculated by reference to the 
middle market closing price of an Ordinary Share on the business day prior to the beginning of the invitation period, discounted by up 
to 20 per cent at the Board’s discretion. Options are normally exercisable within six months of the third, fifth or seventh anniversary of 
the contract commencement date as elected by the option holder at the start of the contract. No invitations have yet been made 
under this scheme.

All schemes are equity-settled.
4.0 million share incentives were granted during 2014 (2013 3.3 million). The fair value of share incentives has been estimated as at 
the date of grant using the Hull-White trinomial model. The following table gives the assumptions made in arriving at the share-based 
payment charge and the fair value: 
2014 2013
Weighted average share price (pence) 97.1 129.1
Weighted average exercise price (pence) 46.6 73.3
Weighted average fair value (pence) 47.8 59.0
Expected volatility (%) 34–38 33.0
Option life (years)
 Performance shares 3 3
 Options and SARs 10 10
Suboptimal exercise factor 1.5 1.5
Risk free rate (%) 2. 1–2.8 1.6
Dividend yield (%) 1.7 1.3
The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the previous two 
years which management considers to be the period which is likely to be most representative of future volatility. The risk free rate 
is calculated by reference to UK government bonds.

32. Business combinations
The following acquisitions were completed in 2014. There were no acquisitions in 2013. 
DAX Technologies Corp. (“DAX”)
The assets of DAX were acquired for a cash consideration of $36.9 million on 19 February 2014. DAX is a leading provider of 
customer experience management solution software that enables mobile and wireline service providers to understand and quantify 
services as experienced by their customers. DAX is reported within the Group’s Service Assurance division.
Converging multi-technology 3G and 4G LTE networks and services, such as VoLTE, require the use of big data analytics to fully 
understand the customer experience. The acquisition of DAX will enable Spirent to combine measurements and data from its 
solutions in the lab and in live networks, delivering high value solutions and expertise that help its customers deploy and manage 
complex new networks and services faster and more effectively.
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2014, DAX contributed $10.1 million of revenue and $3.7 million of profit before tax 
to the results of the Group before charging $0.7 million of acquisition related costs and $2.9 million of acquired intangible asset 
amortisation. If the combination had occurred at the beginning of the financial year revenue of $10.5 million and profit before tax 
of $3.4 million would have been included in the Group result before $0.7 million of acquisition related costs and $3.3 million of 
acquired intangible asset amortisation.
The goodwill arising of $23.8 million consists largely of the synergies and economies of scale expected from the combination of the 
entities together with intangible assets not qualifying for separate recognition such as workforce in place. The goodwill recognised 
is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Radvision Technology Business Unit (“TBU”)
On 31 July 2014 Spirent completed the acquisition of the assets of Radvision’s TBU for a cash consideration of $25.9 million. 
The Radvision TBU offers a complete test suite for voice and video over IP communications, including VoLTE, expanding Spirent’s 
leading portfolio of VoLTE solutions to address needs from early development through to deployment. The Radvision TBU pioneered 
the introduction of voice and video over IP with a range of embedded technologies and test solutions, combining unique expertise in 
signalling, multimedia and IMS. Used by developers of mobile chipsets, mobile devices and communications infrastructure, as well 
as service providers worldwide, the Radvision TBU’s solutions have helped enable the majority of today’s voice and video over 
IP deployments. The Radvision TBU is reported within the Wireless & Service Experience division.
VoLTE testing is already a critical element in many of Spirent’s test solutions. Spirent’s customers’ transition from circuit-switched 
voice networks to all-IP networks presents huge opportunities for VoLTE and RCS services on mobile devices. The addition of 
Radvision’s TBU will expand Spirent’s test solution portfolio to meet the needs of customers, from early in the development 
cycle right through to deployment, helping to save development time and cost.
Spirent Communications plc

Strategic report Governance Financial statements 32. Business combinations continued
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2014, the Radvision TBU contributed $4.2 million of revenue and $0.5 million of profit 
before tax to the results of the Group before charging $1.9 million of acquisition related costs and $0.5 million of acquired intangible 
asset amortisation. If the combination had occurred at the beginning of the financial year revenue of $11.7 million and profit before tax 
of $2.9 million would have been included in the Group result before charging $1.9 million of acquisition related costs and $1.2 million 
of acquired intangible asset amortisation.
The goodwill arising of $19.0 million consists largely of the synergies and economies of scale expected from the combination of the 
entities together with intangible assets not qualifying for separate recognition such as workforce in place. The goodwill recognised 
is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Mobilethink A/S (“Mobilethink”)
On 12 September 2014 Spirent completed the acquisition of 100 per cent of the share capital of Mobilethink and its wholly owned 
subsidiary, Tweakker ApS (“Tweakker”) for a cash consideration of $20.1 million. Headquartered in Aarhus, Denmark, Mobilethink is a 
provider of mobile device management, device analytics and intelligence solutions for mobile operators. Tweakker is a cloud-based 
mobile device configuration solution specifically targeted at Mobile Virtual Network Operators (“MVNOs”). Mobilethink’s solutions 
allow operators to correctly detect mobile devices, configure them for data usage, analyse device population trends, and run 
marketing campaigns with the goal of increasing average revenue per user. This acquisition is reported within the Service 
Assurance division.
Hosted and cloud-enabled device intelligence solutions give operators and MVNOs the ability to significantly improve subscriber 
service experience. The acquisition of Mobilethink, combined with Spirent’s extensive portfolio of mobile device performance and 
CEM solutions, will help drive Spirent’s overall growth with additional recurring revenue potential.
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2014, Mobilethink and Tweakker contributed $2.0 million of revenue and a $0.3 million 
loss before tax to the results of the Group before charging $0.6 million of acquisition related costs and $0.7 million of acquired 
intangible asset amortisation. If the combination had occurred at the beginning of the financial year revenue of $7.6 million and 
profit before tax of nil would have been included in the Group result before charging $0.6 million of acquisition related costs and 
$2.4 million of acquired intangible asset amortisation.
The goodwill arising of $11.5 million consists largely of the synergies and economies of scale expected from the combination of the 
entities together with intangible assets not qualifying for separate recognition such as workforce in place. The goodwill recognised 
is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Other acquisitions
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2014, other acquisitions contributed $2.3 million of revenue and $0.5 million of profit 
before tax to the results of the Group before charging $0.6 million of acquisition related costs, $0.2 million of acquired intangible 
asset amortisation and $1.0 million of intangible asset impairment. If the combination had occurred at the beginning of the financial 
year revenue of $2.6 million and a profit before tax of $0.6 million would have been included in the Group result before charging 
$0.6 million of acquisition related costs, $0.2 million of acquired intangible asset amortisation and $1.0 million of intangible 
asset impairment.
Testing Technologies IST GmbH (“Testing Tech”)
On 20 February 2014 Spirent completed the acquisition of 58 per cent of the Ordinary Share capital of Testing Tech which was in 
private ownership, for a cash consideration of Euro 1.8 million ($2.4 million). The company develops and markets standardised and 
customer-specific software-based testing tools which support the development of mission-critical products and workflow steps. 
Testing Tech also participates in the connected vehicle market which will facilitate Spirent’s progress in this market. This acquisition 
is reported within the Wireless & Service Experience division.
The minority stake of 42 per cent of the share capital is the subject of a put and call option which expires on 31 March 2016 (note 24).

NetGend LLC (“NetGend”)
On 15 September 2014 Spirent completed the acquisition of the net assets of NetGend, a Texas based entity, for a cash consideration 
of $1.0 million. Deferred consideration is payable based on revenue generated during the four-year period commencing in 2015. 
The fair value of the deferred consideration has been estimated as immaterial. NetGend provides a scalable and flexible application 
performance testing platform that runs on both cloud infrastructure and hardware and its results are reported within the Networks 
& Applications division.
The goodwill arising on these other acquisitions of $2.3 million consists largely of the synergies and economies of scale expected 
from the combination of the entities together with intangible assets not qualifying for separate recognition such as workforce in place. 
The following table summarises the consideration paid and the assets and liabilities acquired at the acquisition date. Since the

Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified for measurement of derivative financial 
instruments at fair value and in accordance with applicable UK law and UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“UK GAAP”).
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. 
As the Company is included in the consolidated financial statements, made up to 31 December each year, it is not required to present 
a separate profit and loss account as provided by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. Information on fees for non-audit services 
in respect of the parent Company accounts have not been disclosed as the Company prepares Group accounts which disclose 
information on fees for non-audit services on a consolidated basis.
Cash flow statement
The Company is exempt under the terms of FRS 1 “Cash Flow Statements” from the requirement to publish its own cash flow 
statement, as its cash flows are included within the consolidated cash flow statement of the Group.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. The carrying value 
of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not 
be recoverable.
Purchased goodwill, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of assets acquired, is written off on a straight line basis 
from the date of acquisition over 20 years, being its anticipated useful life.
Tangible assets
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land. Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of all other assets, less residual value, 
on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives at rates which take into account commercial conditions at their location. 
Usual asset lives are as follows:
Freehold buildings 50 years
Plant and machinery 3 to 8 years
Fixtures, fittings and equipment
 Building installations 20 years or lease period if less
 Fittings and equipment 3 to 8 years

The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable.
Investments
Fixed asset investments, including investment in subsidiaries, are stated at cost and reviewed for impairment if there are indications 
that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease on a straight line basis.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value. Cost includes all costs in bringing each product to 
its present location and condition, being the full manufacturing cost on a first-in-first-out basis, including all attributable overheads 
based on a normal level of activity. Net realisable value represents the selling price less further costs to be incurred to completion 
and on sale.
Trade and other debtors
Trade debtors, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance 
for any uncollectable amounts. An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. 
Bad debts are written off when identified.
Provisions
Provisions are recorded when the Company has a present, legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event for which it is 
probable that it will be required to settle by an outflow of resources and for which a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation 
can be made. Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision shall be the present value of the expenditures 
expected to be required to settle the obligation.

1. Significant accounting policies continued
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Company, the revenue can be reliably measured 
and when the Company has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership. In addition, revenue is only 
recognised when collectability is probable.
For the sale of services, revenue is recognised in accounting periods in which the service is rendered.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. 
All exchange gains and losses are taken to the profit and loss account.
Product development
Expenditure is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Company uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage exposures arising on receipts and payments in foreign 
currencies relating to firm commitments.
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the contract is entered into, 
and are subsequently re-measured to fair value at each reported balance sheet date. The fair value of forward foreign currency 
exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. The 
Company has not adopted the hedge accounting rules. Consequently, all gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are taken 
to the profit and loss account.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts.
Pensions
The Company operates two funded defined benefit pension plans. All other plans are defined contribution in nature where the 
amount charged to the profit and loss account is the contributions paid or payable during the year.
For defined benefit pension plans full actuarial valuations are carried out every three years using the projected unit credit method, 
and updates are performed at each balance sheet date. The cost of providing benefits under these plans is determined separately for 
each plan, and attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period (to determine current service cost), and to the current and prior 
periods (to determine the present value of defined benefit obligations).
Past services are recognised in the profit and loss account on a straight line basis or immediately if the benefits have vested. When 
a settlement (eliminating all obligations for benefits already accrued), or a curtailment (reducing future obligations as a result of a 
material reduction in the plan membership or a reduction in future entitlement) occurs, the obligation and related plan assets are 
re-measured using current actuarial assumptions and the resultant gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account during 
the period in which the settlement or curtailment occurs.
The interest element of the defined benefit pension plan cost represents the change in present value of plan obligations resulting 
from the passage of time and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening present value of the benefit obligation, 
taking into account material changes in the obligation during the year.
The expected return on plan assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of the year of long term market returns on 
plan assets, adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions received and benefits paid during the year. 
The difference between the expected return on plan assets and the interest cost is recognised in the profit and loss account as 
finance costs or finance income.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets, experience adjustments on 
liabilities and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised immediately in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2014
118 1. Significant accounting policies continued
The defined benefit pension plan asset or liability in the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation (using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds denominated in the same currency and 
whose term is consistent with the estimated term of the obligation). Fair value is based on market price information and, in the case 
of quoted securities, is the published bid price. The value of a net pension benefit asset is restricted to the sum of any unrecognised 
past service costs and the present value of any amount the Company expects to recover, by way of reductions in the future 
contributions or refunds from the plan that have been agreed by the trustees.
Treasury shares
Spirent Communications plc Ordinary Shares held by the Company are classified in shareholders’ equity as treasury shares and are 
recognised at cost and shown as a deduction from retained earnings. Consideration received for the sale of such Ordinary Shares is 
also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to retained earnings.
Employee benefits
When an employee has rendered service to the Company during an accounting period, short term benefits expected to be paid in 
exchange for that service are recognised in the same accounting period.
Dividends paid
The interim dividend is included in the financial statements in the period in which it is paid, and the final dividend in the period it is 
approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.
Share‑ based payment
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are 
granted. The fair value is determined using the Hull-White trinomial model.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised as a cost to the Company or as an addition to the cost of investment in the 
subsidiary in which the relevant employees work, over the vesting period of the equity-settled transactions with a corresponding 
adjustment to reserves. Any payments received from the Company’s subsidiaries in respect of these share-based payments result in 
a reduction in the cost of investment.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other vesting 
conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been 
modified. In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as 
measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not yet 
recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award and designated 
as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the 
original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The Company has an employee share trust for the granting of certain share incentives to employees. Shares are held by the 
employee share trust, treated as treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.
Tax
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable represents the amount expected to be paid or recovered in respect of taxable profit for the year and is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided on an undiscounted basis on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet 
date except as referred to below. Amounts provided are calculated with reference to tax rates that are expected to apply in the 
periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable 
profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not provided on gains on the disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, unless there 
is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned. Provision will not be made where it is considered more likely than not that 
the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only when the replacement assets are sold.

3. Pensions
Defined benefit plans 
The funded defined benefit pension plans are in the United Kingdom and comprise the Spirent Communications plc Staff Pension & 
Life Assurance Plan (“Staff Plan”) and the Spirent Communications plc Retirement Cash & Life Assurance Plan (“Cash Plan”). The Staff 
Plan is the Company’s most significant plan. There is in addition an unfunded plan. 
The valuation used for these disclosures has been based on a full assessment of the liabilities of the plans as at 1 April 2012. The 
present values of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and any past service costs were measured using 
the projected unit credit method.
i) The key financial assumptions
The assumptions used for both plans were as follows:
2014 2013
% %
Inflation – RPI 2.9 3.3
Inflation – CPI 1.8 2.2
Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.0 3.1
Rate of increase for pensions in payment pre 2001 service 3.6 3.6
Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2001 to 5 April 2005 service 2.8 3.1
Rate of increase for pensions post 5 April 2005 service 2.0 2.2
Rate of increase in deferred pensions 1.8 2.2
Rate used to discount plan liabilities 3.6 4.5
Expected rate of return on plan assets (weighted for both plans) 3.4 4.6
Spirent Communications plc employs a building block approach in determining the long term rate of return on plans’ assets. Historical 
markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital 
market principles. The assumed long term rate of return on each class of asset is set out within this note. The overall expected rate of 
return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return of each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the plans. 
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements. The assumptions 
are such that a member currently aged 65 (2013 aged 65) will live on average for a further 23.5 years (2013 23.5 years) if they are 
male and for a further 25.7 years (2013 25.6 years) if they are female. For a member who retires in 2034 (2013 in 2033) at age 65 
(2013 age 65) the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 24.4 years (2013 24.3 years) after retirement if they are 
male and for a further 26.8 years (2013 26.7 years) after retirement if they are female. 
The approximate impact to the past service liabilities of changing these main assumptions is as follows:
 –Reducing the discount rate by 0.1 per cent per annum would increase past service liabilities by £2.6 million.
 –Increasing the RPI inflation assumption by 0.1 per cent would increase the plans’ liabilities by £1.1 million. 
 –Increasing the life expectancy of a member by one year (by modifying the standard mortality tables using an appropriate scaling 
factor) would increase past service liabilities by £7.5 million. 
There will also be an impact on the future service cost but given the small active population in these plans this is likely to 
be insignificant.

gains and losses is £31.9 million loss (2013 £22.1 million loss). The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension plan 
deficit recognised on 1 January 2003 and taken directly to equity of £41.9 million in the Company is attributable to actuarial gains and 
losses since inception of those pension plans. Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and

Expected cash contributions for 2015 for these plans are £2.8 million.
The above plans are funded and have full UK HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) tax-exempt approval. Certain members, 
whose salaries were in excess of the HMRC statutory earnings cap, had their benefits increased through unapproved unfunded 
arrangements, to the level that would otherwise have applied in respect of basic salary only. The Company has contractually 
agreed to pay the additional retirement benefits itself and a provision is made in respect of this obligation in the balance sheet at 
31 December 2014 of £0.5 million (2013 £0.5 million). This represents the actuarial value, as confirmed by the Company’s pension 
advisers, of the unapproved benefit entitlements accrued at that date. The value is assessed and reviewed on a market value basis 
in line with the main plan valuation and adjusted each year. There were no experience gains or losses on the unfunded plan in the 
period from 2010 to 2014.

Cancelled during the year (9.7)
Issued and fully paid Ordinary Shares of 3⅓ pence each at 31 December 2014 611.7
During 2014 and 2013 no Ordinary Shares were transferred from the Spirent Sharesave Trust (“SST”) to satisfy options exercised 
under the UK all employee share schemes and in 2014 0.2 million Ordinary Shares were transferred from the Spirent Employee Share 
Ownership Trust (“ESOT”) to satisfy options exercised under the Spirent Stock Incentive Plan and 2005 Employee Incentive Plan 
(2013 1.4 million Ordinary Shares). 
There has been no material increase in the issued Ordinary Share capital, whether by exercise of share incentives or otherwise, 
between 31 December 2014 and 26 February 2015, the date on which these financial statements have been signed.
Investment in own Ordinary Shares
At 31 December 2014, the ESOT held 0.7 million Ordinary Shares (2013 0.9 million Ordinary Shares) to satisfy awards under various 
share incentive plans. At 31 December 2014, the SST held 0.5 million Ordinary Shares (2013 0.5 million Ordinary Shares) to satisfy 
awards made to United Kingdom based employees under an all employee share scheme. The market value of own Ordinary Shares 
held in trust, being in total 1.2 million Ordinary Shares (2013 1.4 million Ordinary Shares), at 31 December 2014 was £0.9 million 
(2013 £1.5 million).
Capital redemption reserve
During 2014 the Company cancelled 9.7 million Ordinary Shares (2013 29.2 million Ordinary Shares) that had been the subject of 
the on market share repurchase programme and transferred £0.3 million (2013 £1.0 million) to the capital redemption reserve.
Share repurchase
During 2014 the Company repurchased 9.7 million Ordinary Shares on market at a cost of £9.4 million (2013 29.2 million Ordinary 
Shares at a cost of £34.9 million). All shares repurchased in 2014 and 2013 were subsequently cancelled. 
Share buyback obligation
On 23 December 2013 the Company entered into an irrevocable agreement with UBS Limited to purchase Ordinary Shares up to 
a maximum value of £10.9 million at no more than 105 per cent of the average market value of a share for the five business days 
immediately preceding the day on which the share is purchased, with the maximum number of shares acquired on any dealing day 
not to exceed 250,000 shares, from 2 January 2014 to 26 February 2014, on their behalf. This agreement entered into in respect of 
share buybacks during the close period was recognised as a financial liability of £10.9 million.
As at the close of business on 26 February 2014, 9.7 million shares had been repurchased under this buyback programme at an 
average price of 97 pence per share for a total consideration of £9.4 million. The remaining liability expired at close of business on 
26 February 2014.
Employee share plans 
The Company operates a number of employee share incentive plans which are described in note 29 of Notes to the consolidated 
financial statements. The following share incentives over Ordinary Shares under these plans have been granted and remain 
outstanding, held by employees of the parent Company.

15. Share-based payment
The total charge/(credit) for the year relating to employee share-based payment plans is as follows:
2014 2013
£ million £ million
2005 Employee Incentive Plan 0.2 (0.3)
All schemes are equity-settled.
The fair value of share incentives has been estimated as at the date of grant using the Hull-White trinomial model.
The following table gives the assumptions made in arriving at the share-based payment charge and the fair value:
2014 2013
Weighted average share price (pence) 101.3 129.1
Weighted average exercise price (pence) 12.2 54.7
Weighted average fair value (pence) 61.8 65.1
Expected volatility (%) 34.0 33.0
Option life (years)
 Performance shares 3 3
 Options and SARs 10 10
Suboptimal exercise factor 1.5 1.5
Risk free rate (%) 2.8 1.6
Dividend yield (%) 1.7 1.3
The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the previous two 
years which management considers to be the period which is likely to be most representative of future volatility. The risk free rate is 
calculated by reference to UK government bonds.
16. Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 8 “Related Party Disclosures” in relation to disclosing transactions 
with its subsidiaries.
17. Subsidiaries

but eventually planned to consist of 35 satellites. Service was launched in China during 
2011, with plans to provide service globally by 2020.
Carrier Aggregation A technique used in 4G mobile communications that allows expansion of the effective 
bandwidth delivered to a mobile user terminal by concurrent utilisation of resources across 
multiple radio carriers.
Cloud A variety of computing concepts that involve a large number of computers connected 
through a real-time communication network such as the internet. Often used in reference to 
network-based services served up by virtual hardware, simulated by software running on 
one or more physical machines.
Continuous Integrated Test Optimization A practice in software development environments that employ continuous integration, in 
which code is built automatically and tests are run against a specific build, providing 
feedback to developers in a shorter timeframe to allow coding issues to be fixed or code 
changes to be rolled back to ensure stable code. 
Data Center A centralised location where computing resources critical to an organisation are maintained 
in a highly controlled environment.
Ethernet A family of networking technologies originally developed for local area networks, which 
migrated to metro area networks and eventually became the dominant standard in wireline 
networks worldwide.
Evolved Packet Core An integrated IP-based mobile transport network with the ability to support 2G, 3G and 
LTE coexistence.
Fuzzing A software testing technique commonly used to uncover security vulnerabilities in software, 
operating systems or networks by inputting large amounts of invalid, unexpected or 
random data to the system in an attempt to make it crash.
Global Navigation Satellite Systems (“GNSS”) The standard generic term for satellite navigation systems that provide autonomous 
geo-spatial positioning with global coverage. GNSS allows users’ receivers to determine 
their location to within a few metres by employing a triangulation technique that uses 
information from multiple satellites.
Global Positioning System (“GPS”) A global navigation satellite system operated by the United States government for 
determining a user’s location and height at any point on the earth’s surface. A receiver uses 
minute differences in measured time signals from clocks on satellites to calculate these 
positions and altitudes.
GLONASS A global navigation satellite system operated by the Russian Federation. Deployment 
began in 1976 and, although the system fell into disrepair in the 1990s, full global service 
was restored in 2011.
Internet of Everything (“IoE”) An extension to today’s internet that builds on the compound impact of connections among 
people, processes, data, and things, where each is intended to amplify the capabilities of 
the other three. This global connectedness is expected to create additional value as 
“everything” comes online.

134 Internet of Things (“IoT”) A network of physical objects or “things” embedded with electronics, software, sensors and 
connectivity to enable data exchange with the manufacturer, operator and/or other 
connected devices. Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing 
system but is able to interoperate within existing internet infrastructure.
Internet Protocol (“IP”) The primary network protocol used on the internet and on other network devices to 
facilitate and control the flow of data.
Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystem (“IMS”) A standardised next-generation architecture for telecoms operators who want to provide 
mobile and fixed multimedia services.
Intrusion An incident of unauthorised access to data or an automated information system.
Jamming The intentional emission of radio frequency signals to interfere with the operation of GNSS 
receiver by saturating it with noise or false information.
Long Term Evolution (“LTE”) An advanced wireless data communications technology standard (sometimes called “4G”) 
which is an evolution of 3G UMTS standards. In addition to a new wireless interface 
specification, LTE uses a simplified flat IP-based network architecture.
LTE-Advanced An evolution of LTE technology, specified in 3GPP Release 10 and later specifications, 
regarded by some as the first true 4G technology.
Machine-to-Machine (“M2M”) A technology that enables automated wireless (or wired) communication between 
mechanical or electronic devices.
Network Functions Virtualization (“NFV”) An initiative to provide a new network production environment which lowers cost, raises 
efficiency and increases agility by hosting network functions previously carried out by 
proprietary, dedicated hardware on virtual machines running on industry-standard 
commodity hardware.
Rich Communication Suite (“RCS”) Also known as Rich Communications Services, RCS is a platform intended to enable mobile 
network operators to deliver integrated communication services, beyond voice and SMS, 
over all-IP networks, including instant messaging or chat, live video and file sharing, across 
any device on any network.

coverage in dead zones within a macrocell (the coverage area of a traditional cellular base 
station) and extra network capacity by offloading mobile data traffic from macrocells.
Software Defined Network (“SDN”) An approach to networking in which control is decoupled from hardware and given to a 
software application called a controller.
Spoofing An attempt to deceive a GNSS receiver’s estimate of its position or time by broadcasting 
counterfeit GNSS signals, structured to resemble a set of normal GNSS signals, or by 
rebroadcasting genuine signals captured elsewhere or at a different time.
Virtualization  Technologies designed to provide a layer of abstraction from the physical characteristics of 
computing resources to simplify the way in which other systems, applications, or end users 
interact with those resources.
Voice over LTE (“VoLTE”) A standards-based scheme adopted by the GSMA, the cellular industry’s association, to 
provide voice service over data-only LTE networks. VoLTE’s use of an IP Media Subsystem 
enables voice to be offered as part of a rich communications solution, integrated with 
services such as messaging, live video sharing and file transfer.
Wi-Fi  A mechanism that enables devices such as personal computers, video game consoles, 
smartphones or digital audio players to exchange data wirelessly over a computer network 
and connect to network resources, such as the internet. Coverage ranges from a few rooms 
to several square miles, depending on the number of access points used.

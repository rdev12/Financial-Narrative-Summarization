This has been a year of 
significant change, in 
which we have made large 
investments in the Group’s 
future, maintained our 
profits and grown  
our discretionary funds 
under management.
Profit before tax has risen marginally to 
£10.6m, in line with expectations. Earnings 
per share have risen to 69.01p.
The board is recommending a final dividend 
of 19.0p per share which, if approved by 
shareholders, will result in total dividends for 
the year of 26.0p. This represents an increase 
of 16% over the total dividends paid last year 
of 22.5p per share. The final dividend will be 
paid on 28 October 2014 to shareholders 
who are on the register at the close of 
business on 26 September 2014.
Richard Price joined us as a non-executive 
director in August. He is a former partner in 
KPMG and brings us the benefit of his 
considerable experience and expertise in the 
financial services industry.
DPZ Capital Limited (‘DPZ’) became part of 
the Group in April 2014 and now forms part 
of Brooks Macdonald International, based in 
Jersey. This acquisition added £360m of 
discretionary funds under management and 
brings further scale and skill sets to our 
existing offshore offering. After the year end 
we completed the acquisition of Levitas 
Investment Management Services Limited 
(‘Levitas’), further expanding our Funds 
business and also our exposure in the 
growing field of pensions fund 
management, largely stemming from the 
Government’s auto enrolment initiative.
Our discretionary funds under management 
grew strongly over the year and as at  
30 June 2014 totalled £6.55bn (2013: 
£5.11bn), a rise of 28%. Net of the DPZ 
acquisition this represents a rise of over 
21%, compared to the WMA Balanced 
index that grew by 6.2% over the year.
As well as this increase in discretionary funds 
under management we also saw growth in 
all parts of the Group. Advisory assets 
increased to over £450m (2013: £348m), 
property assets under administration grew 
to £1.13bn (2013: £1.04bn) and third party 
assets under administration grew to £200m 
(2013: £140m).
In addition to the acquisitions mentioned 
above the Group has continued to grow 
organically with a combination of strong 
new business flow and by providing risk 
adjusted returns for our clients. We expect 
to continue to invest in the future of the 
business – in further development of our IT 
systems and in our investment and wealth 
management process. The strength of our 
brand and the professionalism of our staff, 
coupled with the continued investment in 
the business to which I have referred, enable 
us to look forward with confidence.

Chief Executive’s review
Introduction
After the considerable changes within the 
industry in recent years, this has been a year 
where the business has continued to evolve, 
we have invested in the future and grown 
funds under management and 
administration. We have maintained profits 
and positioned the Group for a return to 
profit growth despite increased costs. The 
growth in funds and changes have only 
been possible with the hard work and 
dedication of all our staff. In addition we 
continue to receive considerable support 
from professional intermediaries both in and 
outside the UK and I would like to thank 
them for the confidence they have shown in 
the Group.
Funds under management
Our discretionary funds under management 
rose to over £6.5bn, a rise of over £1.4bn 
over the year. This represents an increase of 
28.2% supported by the DPZ acquisition and 
investment markets. Investment performance 
across the Group accounted for 6.5% over 
the year (£330m), DPZ 7.0% (£360m) and 
net new business 14.7% (£750m).
We have seen growth in each of our 
investment services. Our Bespoke Portfolio 
Service (‘BPS’) is our core private client 
offering and is offered on and offshore with 
the principal source of business being 
referrals from professional advisers. Our 
Managed Portfolio Service (‘MPS’) is 
available either as a portfolio or as a unit 
and after a period of margin pressure I am 
pleased to report that pricing appears to 
have stabilised. This service has principally 
been marketed onshore but we will, post 
the DPZ acquisition, be marketing this to 
professional intermediaries offshore. Clients 
include private individuals, trusts and 
charities and both our MPS and BPS 
offerings are benefiting from the increasing 
popularity of Self-invested Personal  
Pensions (SIPPs) and other money purchase 
pension arrangements.
Our Funds business has grown to £518m in 
funds under management (2013: £390m) 
and continues to gain momentum. 
We are now also managing over £1.1bn of 
discretionary assets offshore including the 
recently acquired DPZ funds. This has 
grown net of the acquisition by over £180m 
over the last financial year. In addition we 
have over £450m of advisory assets, all of 
which are based offshore.
Braemar Estates, our specialist property 
manager, continues to grow and now has 
property assets under management of 
£1.13bn (2013: £1.04bn).
Our UK Financial Planning income grew by 
65% to £3.8m (2013: £2.3m).
Industry background
Eighteen months after the introduction of 
the Retail Distribution Review (‘RDR’) in the 
UK, it is worth commenting on the changes 
that the wealth management industry has 
undergone. The legislation was introduced, 
amongst other things, to improve 
transparency, the stability of financial 
institutions and competition for clients. We 
were and remain supportive of these 
objectives but RDR has led to significant 
industry changes. We have had to invest 
heavily in systems, reissue application forms 
to all our clients and change the pricing of 
our MPS proposition. The costs of regulation 
have risen very significantly but we have 
embraced these changes and are now 
positioned to continue to grow the business 
in the new regulatory environment. 
“In a year of continued 
change the Group has  
made good progress 
particularly in the growth 
of our discretionary funds 
under management”

Chief Executive’s review
Strategies for growth
We continue to focus on our core strategies 
for growth: organic, service and 
performance development and on-going 
investment in the business.
Our organic growth revolves around 
working with professional intermediaries, 
principally financial advisers, trust 
companies, and private client legal and 
accountancy practices. This remains a 
critical area for growth for the business and I 
am pleased to report that we now work 
with more than 670 professional 
intermediary firms covering Asset 
Management on and offshore, Funds and 
Financial Consulting. Over the last year we 
have also expanded our reach with 
professional intermediaries offshore and this 
will remain an area of focus during 2014 
and beyond.
In addition we continue to grow our brand, 
recruit high quality staff and invest in our 
trainee programme. We have in the last year 
made several senior appointments including 
our Head of Investment Services (David 
Lewis-Irlam) and Head of Group Governance 
(Simon Broomfield) and seven new trainee 
appointments as well as six trainees 
qualifying. We now have over 80 investment 
managers, 30 consultants and 17 trainees. 
Organic growth has been geographically well 
spread. With the opening of our office in 
Leamington Spa last year (and openings in 
York and Taunton in recent years) we now 
have a much stronger regional footprint 
across the UK. This allows us to provide a 
strong local service as well as providing a 
nationwide service where needed by larger 
firms of professional intermediaries. Linked to 
this is where we work closely with a number 
of strategic partners and I am pleased that 
we now have 15 (2013: 12) Strategic 
Alliances (which refer significant amounts of 
business into our discretionary offering).
We continually look to improve our service 
offering and performance development. 
Over the last year we have entered into a 
new partnership (North Row Capital LLP) 
and as result launched the IFSL North Row 
Liquid Property Fund; we have enabled our 
AIM investment service to be distributed via 
professional intermediaries; we are 
launching our offshore MPS proposition; we 
continue to invest in risk monitoring tools 
for investment portfolios and to expand our 
research capabilities. Investment 
performance for our clients remains strong, 
particularly for low, low-to-medium and 
medium risk client mandates, in which the 
vast majority of our clients sit. We also 
believe the opportunity for SIPPs and the 
management of pension funds to be 
another opportunity for the Group and this 
remains an area of focus onshore.
We made two acquisitions during the year. 
We completed the acquisition of DPZ in 
April and its integration into Brooks 
Macdonald International (‘BMI’) continues 
apace. As well as adding scale to our 
international presence DPZ bring specific 
MPS and fixed interest skill sets. I would like 
to take this opportunity to thank the teams 
in BMI and DPZ for all their hard work in 
making this happen. 
At the end of July (post the year end) we 
completed the acquisition of Levitas 
pursuant to the purchase of the option in 
December 2013. Levitas has two risk-rated 
funds specifically designed for the employee 
benefits market. At the time of completion 
Levitas funds totalled £89.4m and this 
dovetails with our belief in the significant 
opportunity around auto enrolment and the 
growth of personal pension provision.
We have continued to be recognised 
externally with a series of awards over the 
last year and as a people business I was 
delighted that we were again recognised as 
being in the Sunday Times Top 100 Medium 
Sized Companies to Work For. I am pleased 
to report that the Group has been identified 
as the only discretionary fund manager to 
achieve the highest level of Defaqto (an 
independent, financial research company in 
the UK) Star and Diamond Rating in all four 
categories of discretionary management 
(MPS, Bespoke, Funds and Platforms).
Summary and outlook
The amount of change in the financial 
services industry has not slowed down and 
we have been quick to adapt where 
necessary. This has required investment of 
both capital and a huge amount of hard 
work for all members of staff. In a year of 
continued change the Group has made 
good progress particularly in the growth of 
our discretionary funds under management.
Markets have been supportive, particularly 
in the first half of the calendar year and our 
outlook for investment returns remains 
cautiously optimistic, balancing economic 
recovery and the end of quantitative easing 
against the potential rise in UK interest rates. 
We will continue to invest in systems 
development and remain optimistic for new 
business flows. After a year of flat profits we 
expect to return to profit growth. New 
business has started the year well and the 
Board remains confident for the future of 
the Group.

Principal activities
The Group is an integrated wealth management group offering a range of fee-based bespoke advice and services principally to private 
high-net-worth individuals, charities and trusts. The Group offers the services through six principal companies and operates out of ten UK 
based offices giving broad geographic coverage and two offshore offices in Jersey and Guernsey.
Results and cash position
The Group has seen continued revenue growth in the year with an 
increase of 9% to £69.13m (2013: £63.16m), despite pressure on 
pricing in some parts of the Group. The Group is also in a period of 
significant IT investment in order to enhance the services we offer 
clients and to realise operational efficiencies across the business as a 
whole. In line with the increasing regulatory requirements of the 
financial services industry generally we are also investing further in 
our corporate governance, risk and compliance departments. 
Statutory pre-tax profits for the year increased marginally to £10.6m 
(2013: £10.4m) and basic earnings per share increased by 5% to 
69.01p (2013: 65.88p).
Cash flow from operating activities as detailed in note 23 increased 
4% to £13.7m (2013: £13.2m) and, subject to approval by 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, a final dividend of 
19.0p per share will be paid on 28 October 2014 to shareholders on 
the register at 26 September. This makes total dividends for the year 
of 26.0p (2013: 22.5p), which is an increase of 16%.
The Group had no borrowings at 30 June 2014 (2013: £nil) and, in a 
year of considerable investment as detailed in the consolidated 
statement of cash flows on page 24, closing cash balances were 
maintained at £18.1m (2013: £18.4m). As disclosed in note 22 there 
are amounts due within one year of £8.3m in respect of the deferred 
consideration on the acquisitions of DPZ Capital Limited, JPAM Limited 
and Brooks Macdonald International. On 31 July 2014 the company 
exercised its option to acquire Levitas (see note 34) and made the initial 
payment of £0.7m under the terms of the agreement. Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Brooks Macdonald Group plc

Strategic report
Strategy and outlook
A key part of the strategy for the Group remains to grow the 
business both organically and through strategic investments to 
supplement and complement existing parts of the Group. The 
Group has made the recent acquisition of DPZ Capital Limited (see 
note 9), a wealth management business based in Jersey and, on  
31 July 2014, exercised an option to acquire 100% of the share 
capital of Levitas Investment Management Services Limited (see 
note 34). The Group also made an investment in North Row Capital 
LLP during the year (see note 14), which manages a fund providing 
investors with liquid exposure to the global real estate market. Each 
of these transactions has enhanced the range of services and 
strengthened the offering of the Group. 
There has been continued development and investment in the IT 
systems across the Group together with an increasing cost in 
relation to our regulatory and compliance responsibilities. These 
specific cost areas, together with other investments in staff and 
general infrastructure, have resulted in a year of static profits for the 
Group, but whilst we will continue to invest in our systems 
development we expect to return to profits growth next year. 
BMAM, BMI and BMF - discretionary 
investment management
The investment management service principally provides 
discretionary investment management to private investors, charities 
and trusts. Despite considerable changes within the industry we 
have continued to grow funds under management (‘FUM’) which is 
one of the main key performance indicators (‘KPIs’) of the Group. In 
April 2014 we made the acquisition of DPZ Capital Limited (see 
note 9) in Jersey, but we have additionally grown FUM organically 
(including net new business and investment growth) by over £1bn 
during the year. The detailed movement in FUM over the year is 
shown below.
BMAM, BMI and BMF Funds under management (£m)
At 1 July 2013 5,110
Inflows – net new discretionary business* 750
  – acquired through DPZ Capital Limited 360
  – investment growth 330
At 30 June 2014 6,550

Total net growth 28.2%
* Includes clients leaving and capital or income withdrawals of larger than £50,000 
for Bespoke Portfolio Service and larger than £20,000 for Managed Portfolio Service
It has been another year of considerable growth for Brooks 
Macdonald Funds, as part of the increase in the table shown above, 
with total FUM increasing significantly to £518m (2013: £390m) at 
30 June 2014, an increase of 33%. This growth was achieved both 
organically through the net new investment in the existing seven 
funds, as well as by the investment in North Row Capital LLP, which 
manages the IFSL North Row Liquid Property Fund that was 
launched in February 2014 and has contributed £16m to the year 
end total of FUM.
A large proportion of the new organic business comes from 
professional intermediaries with whom we have worked over a 
number of years. As well as introducing discretionary management 
funds they also introduce to other parts of the Group and are 
another KPI. The number of introducing firms has increased to 670 
(2013: 544) at 30 June 2014.
BMFC and BMRSI
BMFC, the UK based financial consulting business, had a strong year 
of growth with revenue increasing by 65% in the year to 30 June 
2014 to £3.81m (2013: £2.32m). The business delivers both 
fee-based financial planning to high-net-worth individuals and 
employee benefits consultancy to small and medium sized 
employers throughout the UK. It saw growth across both areas with 
revenue starting to flow from “auto enrolment” advice resulting 
from the Pensions Act 2008. BMFC is in a period of investment with 
additional staff and systems to enable it to take opportunities 
presented by auto enrolment and the cost of this investment 
resulted in a loss for the year. Annual Report & Accounts 2014
7
Brooks Macdonald Group plc
Strategic report
BMRSI had a year of consolidation and is now starting to look at 
international pension opportunities in a number of jurisdictions and 
is repositioning the service in Jersey and Guernsey. 
Braemar Estates
Braemar Estates has continued its growth in the property 
management sector winning further mandates and the value of 
assets under administration as at 30 June 2014 was £1.13bn (2013: 
£1.04bn), an increase of 9% in the year. 
Corporate governance
The principal board committees are the Audit, Remuneration and 
Risk and Compliance committees, all of which have specific terms of 
reference which are periodically reviewed and approved by the 
Board. These terms of reference are available on the Group website.
Audit Committee
The members of the Audit Committee are three of the non-executive 
directors: Christopher Knight, Colin Harris and, since his appointment 
on 1 August, Richard Price. On 8 September 2014 Richard Price was 
appointed Chairman of the committee in succession to Christopher 
Knight. The board is satisfied that all members of the committee have 
recent and relevant financial experience.
The committee met five times during the year ended 30 June 2014. 
As well as being responsible for reviewing the external audit 
arrangements with regard to compensation, scope and period of 
office, the committee also considers the accounting policies of the 
Group and the significant issues and judgements in connection with 
regulatory financial reporting.
The committee reviews the audit control memorandum and the 
audit engagement letters and has discussions with the auditor 
without management present.
Risk and Compliance Committee
The Group’s risk management framework is embedded throughout 
the organisation. Individual business units adhere to documented 
business processes, which are monitored by the Group’s compliance 
and risk functions. Monitoring output is reported to business 
managers and identified risks are reported to business-level risk 
committees. Each risk committee is responsible for reviewing 
identified risks and implementing procedure reviews and mitigating 
action as necessary. Business-level risk committees report up to the 
Risk and Compliance Committee.
The membership of the Risk and Compliance Committee is made up 
of the Group’s four non-executive directors and is chaired by Colin 
Harris. As necessary, the committee meetings are also attended by 
senior business managers and relevant key staff including the Chief 
Executive, Finance Director, other members of the Group Board, 
heads of various business units and the head of departments for 
compliance, risk and group governance.
During the year ended 30 June 2014 the committee met on seven 
occasions. Its principal responsibilities include overseeing the current 
risk exposures of the Group, reviewing the risk assessment 
processes, assessing material breaches of risk limits and the 
adequacy of proposed remedial action and reviewing client 
complaints.
The Group has made some changes to its governance and risk 
management functions. The Risk and Compliance department has 
been divided into two separate departments, which together with 
the Legal department, reports to a new Head of Group Governance. 
These changes allow the Compliance, Risk and Legal departments to 
operate independently of and provide an effective check on each 
other whilst ensuring efficient communication and appropriate 
sharing of information between them. Apart from these structural 
changes, the risk management framework remains broadly the same 
as for the previous year.
The principal risks assessed by management as having a potential 
material impact on the Group are detailed below, together with the 
principal means in which these risks are mitigated.
Financial risks
The Group’s principal financial risks relate to credit risk, liquidity risk 
and market risk and the measures and policies for the management 
of those risks are set out in note 30 to the consolidated financial 
statements. Further details on capital management processes can be 
found in note 31. Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Brooks Macdonald Group plc
8
Mitigation
This risk is minimised by ensuring the Group maintains a culture of 
high ethical and professional standards whilst focussing on delivering 
a first class service to all of our clients. The Group maintains separate, 
independent risk and compliance departments, which ensures 
conformity with the regulations of the Financial Conduct Authority,  
as well as relevant statutes, in all of our dealings with our clients.
Mitigation
The Group monitors compliance with existing regulations and any 
impending changes in regulations in order to assess the impact on 
the business and to ensure that the Group has sufficient resources to 
implement any necessary changes.
Mitigation
To minimise this risk, the Group continues to invest in its employees 
and monitors developments in the marketplace in which it operates 
to ensure that the Group continues to offer a wide range of services. 
Recruitment policies are designed to attract high quality staff and 
the Group regularly reviews and benchmarks its remuneration 
packages and contractual arrangements in order to retain and 
motivate staff. The Learning & Development team, as part of 
Human Resources, provides structured training plans in order to 
ensure all staff continue to develop their careers within the Group.
Mitigation
New ICT projects are regularly reviewed and appraised at board 
meetings in order to ensure that the Group continues to develop 
and maintain its ICT capabilities. As well as our regional offices 
providing back up facilities for our London offices, we have a fully 
tested disaster recovery plan which would facilitate remote 
working capabilities.
Impact
The Group has a growing reputation as a provider of high quality 
investment and wealth management services. There is a risk that 
significant damage to reputation could lead to the loss of existing 
clients as well as impacting on the ability to gain new clients, which 
would lead to a fall in financial income. Such risk could arise from 
events such as poor investment performance, poor client service or 
regulatory censure.
Impact
The sector in which the Group operates is heavily regulated and any 
breach of regulations could lead to fines or disciplinary action 
against the Group or its staff.
Impact
Our business is dependent on client relationships with our staff. 
Operating in a competitive market there is a risk of loss of  
existing clients due to poor performance or service, a failure to 
respond to changes in the market place, or the loss of key 
investment professionals.
Impact
A key part of the high quality service delivered to clients is 
facilitated by a flexible and robust internal ICT infrastructure.

Risk and Compliance Committee (continued)
Non-financial risks
The significant non-financial risks faced by Group have been reviewed by the committee, who believe they remain broadly the same as in 
previous years and are as follows:
Strategic report Annual Report & Accounts 2014
9
Brooks Macdonald Group plc
Strategic report
Mitigation
Due diligence takes place prior to the commencement of any 
outsourcing or supply, to maintain a robust procurement process 
and good contract governance. We have completed a review of key 
outsourcing partners across the Group and have in place procedures 
to regularly assess the performance of such suppliers as well 
identifying suitable and viable alternatives.
Mitigation
Portfolio performance, valuations and risk profiles are monitored by 
management, allowing issues to be identified and mitigated as they 
arise. The Group has in place BITA Monitor portfolio risk oversight 
tools to assist with supervising portfolio management. The Group 
has completed a re-papering exercise for all of its Managed Portfolio 
Service clients and is well advanced in a similar exercise for all other 
discretionary clients in order to agree the suitability of their 
individual portfolios.
Impact
Operational risk is the risk that the Group suffers a loss of 
business resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, 
people and systems or from the failure of outsourcing partners 
or external suppliers.
Impact
There is a risk that portfolios will not meet their investment 
objectives which could result in the Group suffering loss of 
business. There is a risk on the suitability of portfolios for clients 
and where the suitability responsibility lies between a professional 
introducing the client and the group company.

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Diane Seymour-Williams (Chair), Christopher Knight and Colin Harris. The committee (in 
consultation with the Chief Executive) determines the specific remuneration packages for each executive director and certain senior 
executives including base salary, annual bonus, long-term incentives, benefits and terms of employment. The committee is also responsible 
for setting the broad parameters for the annual base salary review across the Group and reviews all awards made under various long-term 
incentive schemes operated across the Group.
In response to shareholders’ feedback in 2013 the committee has decided that the directors’ remuneration report will be subject to a 
shareholder vote at the Annual General Meeting on 27 October 2014.
Remuneration policy
Brooks Macdonald recognises the importance of its employees to the success of the Group and consequently the remuneration policy is 
designed to be market competitive in order to attract, retain and motivate high-calibre individuals. External third party data is used to 
validate rather than to benchmark the total reward.
The remuneration policy, which applies to directors and employees of the Group, is based on the following key principles:
• designed to encourage the retention of staff through deferred variable compensation, where appropriate; 
• the need to provide a market competitive balanced package of benefits;
• differentiation by merit and performance;

Remuneration Committee (continued)
Remuneration policy (continued)
The current remuneration package for an executive director has four main elements: basic salary and benefits, profit-related bonus, 
long-term equity based incentives and pension. The total reward is designed to include a balance of fixed and variable pay with an element 
of deferral.
Basic salary
Basic salary is paid monthly in cash through payroll determined by the committee and any changes are implemented from 1 July each year 
or when an individual changes position or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels the committee considers salaries throughout the 
Group and information on comparable AIM-listed and financial services companies and firms provided by advisers to the committee. The 
views of the Chief Executive are taken into consideration when setting the salary of other directors. 
The base salaries of executive directors were increased on 1 July 2014 by a total of 2.6% compared to an overall average increase for all 
employees of 3.7%. The non-executive directors’ salaries were similarly reviewed and increased on average by 9.3% with the approval of 
the board to reflect their additional responsibilities and commitments as the Group grows. 
Annual profit-related bonus award
Awards to executive directors and some other senior employees of the Group of profit-related bonuses are made from a pool of profits of 
15-25% of the Group pre-tax profit after the payment of all bonuses to all other staff. The committee determines the overall size of the pool 
based on the performance of the Group against a number of key performance indicators including the growth in profits, the movement in 
funds under management, various internal client service metrics and the performance against budget of each of the operating divisions. 
The total payment to executive directors, including the amounts deferred into shares, represented 10.0% (2013: 10.9%) of Group pre-tax profit.
Awards to individual executive directors are determined by the committee following recommendations from the Chief Executive, taking into 
account a number of financial and non-financial factors. These are intended to give a broad assessment of the annual performance 
objectives of each director, including the results of the business, investment performance, net new business, management of risks facing the 
Group and cost control within each individual’s area of responsibility. 
The Remuneration Committee has decided that 20% of the bonus awarded will be made in shares deferred for a period of three years under 
a Long Term Incentive Scheme (‘LTIS’). In addition, directors may choose to defer a further amount of any bonus awarded, up to a 
maximum of 20%, making 40% in total, into shares under the LTIS. The scheme has performance conditions attached to the deferred 
award, requiring a minimum growth in the diluted earnings per share of the Group of 2% per annum above the increase in the Retail Price 
Index (RPI) over the three year period.
Benefits
The executive directors receive a range of benefits on a similar basis to other employees of the Group. Benefits available include private 
healthcare, life assurance, critical illness cover and permanent health insurance as well as interest free season ticket loans as disclosed in note 
33 to the consolidated financial statements. The non-executive directors do not receive any benefits except that they are entitled to reclaim 
for expenses incurred in carrying out the Group’s business.
Pension
Executive directors may participate in the pension arrangements of the Group or receive cash in lieu of pension on the same basis as other 
employees. The Group’s contributions are currently 15% of base salary.

Equity incentives
Long Term Incentive Scheme (‘LTIS’) and Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’)
The Group established an EBT on 3 December 2010. The Trust was established to acquire ordinary shares in the Company in connection 
with the deferred share element of the profit-related bonus under the LTIS as detailed above. The EBT is also used for other long-term 
awards to members of the Board and other long-term awards to other senior employees.
The Remuneration Committee has made additional awards under the LTIS to certain executive directors and other senior employees. The 
conditional awards are subject to the same performance and other conditions as those applying to the deferred profit-related bonus 
share options.
Details of the awards granted to the directors of the Company under the terms of the LTIS during the year ended 30 June 2014, in respect 
of the deferred element of the profit-related bonus for the previous year together with any additional awards, are detailed below. The 
market value of the Company’s shares at the date the awards were made, 1 November 2013, was £14.64.

During the year none of the directors exercised any shares under the LTIS (2013: none). The LTIS options have a £nil exercise price and no 
expiry date.
Sharesave Scheme
All directors are entitled to take part in the HMRC approved Brooks Macdonald Group Sharesave Scheme on the same terms as all other 
employees. Annual invitations to participate in the scheme, which commences each year on 1 June, are sent to directors and subject to 
rules of the scheme various option grants were made for new three-year fixed term contracts as detailed below:

On the expiry of the 2011 Sharesave Scheme the directors exercised their options as detailed above. The aggregate gain on exercise was 
£31,000 (2013: £nil). As none of the shares had been sold by 30 June 2014 the aggregate realised gain was £nil (2013: £nil). The 
Company’s share price at the various dates of exercise was between £14.91 and £15.49.
Under the rules of the scheme, Colin Harris, Christopher Knight, Richard Price and Diane Seymour-Williams were not eligible to participate 
in the Sharesave Scheme and therefore held no options at either the beginning or the end of the year or at the date of their appointment.
Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme (‘EMI’) 
The Brooks Macdonald Group Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme (EMI) was adopted by the shareholders of the Company on  
11 February 2005. 
Options granted can be exercised if there has been an increase in the diluted earnings per share of the Company of at least 2% per annum 
more than the increase in the RPI over the period of three financial years starting with the financial year in which the date of grant falls and 
ending with the financial year in which the third anniversary of the date of grant falls.
Options may not normally be exercised before the third anniversary of the date of the grant and expire on the tenth anniversary of the 
grant. Due to the increase in the size of the Company it is no longer eligible under HMRC rules to grant options under this EMI scheme and 
the last options were awarded to directors under this scheme on 17 October 2007. Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Brooks Macdonald Group plc

The aggregate gain during the year from the exercise of the above EMI share options was £427,000 (2013: £301,000). The Company’s 
share price at the exercise date was £16.950 (2013: £12.905).
None of the other directors held any EMI share options at either the beginning or the end of the year or at the date of their appointment.
The average share price during the year was £14.87 (2013: £13.27). Details of the share option schemes are provided in note 21 and note 
26 to the consolidated financial statements. The market price at the end of the year was £15.65 (2013: £14.35) and the highest and lowest 
prices during the year were £18.02 (2013: £14.96) and £11.84 (2013: £11.35) respectively.
Company Share Option Plan (‘CSOP’)
Following discussions regarding remuneration structures and incentives schemes for senior employees and directors the Company decided to set 
up a CSOP which was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 17 October 2013 and by HMRC on 21 November 2013.
The scheme is a discretionary scheme whereby employees or directors are granted an option to purchase the Company’s shares in the 
future at a price set on the date of the grant. The maximum award under the terms of the scheme for an individual is a total market value of 
£30,000. There are performance conditions attaching to the scheme similar to those in place for the EMI Scheme above whereby there 
must be an increase in the diluted earnings per share of the Company of 2% more than the increase in the RPI over the three years starting 
with the financial year in which the option is granted.
Details of the number of options granted to the directors of the Company under the terms of the CSOP during the year ended 30 June 
2014, in respect of awards made in the previous financial year, are shown in the table below. The options were granted on 21 November 
2013 with an exercise price of £14.52.

In the year ended 30 June 2014, a new award with an aggregate market value of £15,000 was made under the CSOP to R H Spencer. The 
number of options to be granted and the option price for this award will be determined based on the share price at the grant date in 
October 2014. None of the other directors held any CSOP share options at either the beginning or the end of the year or at the date of 
their appointment.

Dilution
Not more than 15% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company (adjusted for bonus and rights issues) will be issued for all EMI and 
share incentive schemes operated by the Company in any ten year rolling period. The Company satisfies the various equity-based schemes 
it operates using a combination of market purchased, newly issued and treasury shares.
Service contracts for executive directors
The Company has service contracts with its executive directors with a notice period of 12 months and it is company policy that such 
contracts should not normally contain periods of more than 12 months. 
External appointments
Executive directors are encouraged to take on external appointments as non-executive directors but are discouraged from taking more than 
one other position given the time commitment. Prior approval of any new appointment is required by the Board with any fees in excess of 
£10,000 per annum paid to the Company.
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
During the year the Remuneration Committee have employed professional advisers to assist with the implications of the FCA Remuneration

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared 
the Group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union, and the parent company financial statements in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under 
company law the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of 
the profit or loss of the Company and Group for that period. In 
preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
•  make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
•  state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Group 
and parent company financial statements respectively;
•  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them 
to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the Group’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors consider that the Annual Report & Accounts, taken as 
a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess a company’s 
performance, business model and strategy. 
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in the 
report of the directors confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
•  the group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the 
Group; and
•  the strategic report and the report of the directors include a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business and 
the position of the Group, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that it faces

Report on the group financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion the financial statements, defined below:
•  give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
30 June 2014 and of its profit and cash flows for the year 
then ended;
•  have been properly prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union; and
•  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the 
remainder of this report.
What we have audited
The group financial statements (the “financial statements”), which 
are prepared by Brooks Macdonald Group plc, comprise:
•  the consolidated statement of financial position as at  
30 June 2014;
•  the consolidated statement of comprehensive Income for the 
year then ended;
•  the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended;
•  the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year 
then ended; and
•  the notes to the financial statements, which include a  
summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union.
In applying the financial reporting framework, the directors have 
made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of 
significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they 
have made assumptions and considered future events.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). An audit 
involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
•  whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; 
•  the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by 
the directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information 
in the Annual Report & Accounts to identify material inconsistencies

Brooks Macdonald Group plc
1. General information
Brooks Macdonald Group plc (‘the Company’) is the parent company of a group of companies (‘the Group’), which offers a range of investment 
management services and related professional advice to private high-net-worth individuals, charities, and trusts. The Group also provides financial 
planning as well as offshore fund management and administration services and acts as fund manager to regulated OEICs, providing specialist funds 
in the property and structured return sectors and managing property assets on behalf of these funds and other clients.
The Company is a public limited company, incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 and listed on AIM. 
The address of its registered office is 111 Park Street, London, W1K 7JL.
2. Principal accounting policies
The general accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been applied 
consistently to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.
a) Basis of preparation
  The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union, IFRS IC interpretations, and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial 
statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of available for sale financial assets such that they are 
measured at their fair value.
  At the time of approving the financial statements, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.
b) Basis of consolidation
  The Group’s financial statements comprise a consolidation of the financial statements of the parent company (Brooks Macdonald Group plc) 
and its subsidiaries. The underlying financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, 
using consistent accounting policies. Subsidiaries are all entities controlled by the Company, deemed to exist where the Company has the 
power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The financial statements of the 
subsidiaries are included from the date on which control is transferred to the Group to the date that control ceases.
 All intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
c) Changes in accounting policies
  The Group’s accounting policies applied to these financial statements are consistent with those disclosed within the financial statements for the 
year ended 30 June 2013, except as described below.
 New accounting policies
 During the year the Group entered into a joint venture (note 14) and adopted the accounting policy below:
 i) Investments in joint ventures
   A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds a long-term interest and is jointly controlled by the Group and one or more third 
parties under a contractual agreement. Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost in 
the consolidated statement of financial position and subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the 
entities. The Group’s share of the results of joint ventures is included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
   If the Group’s share of the losses of a joint venture equals or exceeds its investment, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it 
has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
2. Principal accounting policies (continued)
d) Critical accounting estimates and judgements
  The preparation of financial information requires the use of assumptions, estimates and judgements about future conditions. Use of currently available 
information and application of judgement are inherent in the formation of estimates. Actual results in the future may differ from those reported. In this 
regard, the directors believe that the accounting policies where judgement is necessarily applied are those that relate to the measurement of intangible 
assets, deferred consideration, the estimation of the fair value of share-based payments and client compensation provisions.
  The underlying assumptions made are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which 
the estimate is revised only if the revision affects both current and future periods.
 Further information about key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty are set out below.
 Intangible assets
  The Group has acquired client relationships and the associated investment management contracts as part of business combinations (as 
described in note 9), through separate purchase and purchased with newly employed teams of fund managers (as described in note 11). In 
assessing the fair value of these assets the Group has estimated their finite life based on information about the typical length of existing client 
relationships. Contracts acquired with fund managers and acquired client relationship contracts are amortised on a straight line basis over their 
estimated useful lives, ranging from 5 to 20 years.
  Goodwill recognised as part of a business combination is reviewed annually for impairment, or when a change in circumstances indicates that it 
might be impaired. The recoverable amounts of cash generating units are determined by value in use calculations, which require the use of 
estimates to derive the projected future cash flows attributable to each unit. Details of the more significant assumptions are given in note 11.
 Deferred consideration
  As described in note 19, the Group has a deferred consideration balance in respect of the acquisition of JPAM Limited in July 2012; Brooks 
Macdonald Asset Management (International) Limited and Brooks Macdonald Retirement Services (International) Limited in November 2012; and 
DPZ Capital Limited in April 2014. Deferred consideration is recognised at its fair value, being an estimate of the amount that will ultimately be 
payable in future periods. This has been calculated allowing for estimated growth in the acquired funds, discounted by the cost of capital. The 
Group considers that potential changes to these assumptions would not result in a material change in the fair value of the deferred consideration. 
 Share-based payments
  The Group operates various share-based payment schemes in respect of services received from certain employees. Estimating the fair value of 
these share-based payments requires the Group to apply an appropriate valuation model and determine the inputs to that model (notes 21 and 
26). The charge to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in respect of share-based payments is calculated using assumptions 
about the number of eligible employees that will leave the Group and the number of employees that will satisfy the relevant performance 
conditions. These estimates are reviewed regularly.
 Provisions 
  In the ordinary course of business, the Group may receive complaints from clients in relation to the services provided. Complaints are assessed 
on a case-by-case basis and provisions are made where it is judged to be likely that compensation will be paid.
e) Exceptional items
  Exceptional items are disclosed and described separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide further 
understanding of the underlying financial performance of the Group. These include material items of income or expense that are shown 
separately due to the significance of their nature or amount. Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Brooks Macdonald Group plc
28
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
2. Principal accounting policies (continued)
f) Business combinations
  Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the aggregate 
amount of the consideration transferred at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. Acquisition costs are charged 
to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the year of acquisition.
  When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in 
accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions at the acquisition date. If the business combination is 
achieved in stages, the fair value of the Groups’ previously held equity interest is re-measured at the acquisition date and the difference is 
credited or charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Identifiable assets and liabilities assumed on acquisition are 
recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position at their fair value at the date of acquisition.
  Any contingent consideration to be paid by the Group to the vendor is recognised at its fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes 
to the fair value of contingent consideration are recognised in accordance with IAS 39 in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
  Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the consideration transferred over the acquired company’s net identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed. If the consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets acquired, the difference is recognised as a gain 
on a bargain purchase in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
 Impairment
  Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite life are tested annually for impairment. For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill 
acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, 
irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquisition are assigned to those units. The carrying amount of each cash generating unit 
is compared to its recoverable amount, which is determined using a discounted future cash flow model.
  Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the 
operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. 
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash 
generating unit retained.
g) Fees, commissions and interest
  Portfolio management and other advisory and custody services are billed in arrears but are recognised over the period the service is provided. 
Fees are calculated on the basis of a percentage of the value of the portfolio over the period. Dealing charges are levied at the time a deal is 
placed for a client. Fees are only recognised when the fee amount can be estimated reliably and it is probable that the fee will be receivable. 
Amounts are shown net of rebates paid to significant investors.
  Performance fees are earned from some clients when contractually agreed performance levels are exceeded within specified performance 
measurement periods. They are only recognised, at the end of these performance periods, when a reliable estimate of the fee can be made and 
it is almost certain that it will be received.
  Financial consulting fees are charged to clients using an hourly rate or by a fixed fee arrangement and are recognised over the period the 
service is provided. Commissions receivable and payable are accounted for in the period in which they are earned.
  Where amounts due are conditional on the successful completion of fund raising for investment vehicles, revenue is recognised where, in the 
opinion of the directors, there is reasonable certainty that sufficient funds have been raised to enable the successful operation of that investment 
vehicle. Amounts due on an annual basis for the management of third party investment vehicles are recognised on a time apportioned basis.
 Interest receivable is recognised on an accruals basis.
h) Cash and cash equivalents 
  Cash comprises cash in hand and call deposits held with banks. Cash equivalents comprise short-term, highly liquid investments, with a 
maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition. Annual Report & Accounts 2014
29
Brooks Macdonald Group plc
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
2. Principal accounting policies (continued)
i) Share-based payments
 Equity settled schemes 
  The Group engages in equity settled share-based payment transactions in respect of services received from certain employees. The fair value of 
the services received is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares or share options on the grant date. This cost is then recognised in 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over the vesting period, with a corresponding credit to equity.
  The fair value of the options granted is determined using option pricing models, which take into account the exercise price of the option, the 
current share price, the risk free rate of interest, the expected volatility of the Company’s share price over the life of the award and other 
relevant factors.
 Cash settled schemes 
  The Group engages in cash settled share-based payment transactions in respect of services received from certain employees. On the grant date, 
the liability is measured at its fair value. The liability is subsequently re-measured at the end of each reporting period and on the date of settlement, 
with any changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The cost of the services received from 
employees in respect of this scheme is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income with a corresponding credit to accruals. 
j) Segmental reporting 
  The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is provided internally to the Group Board of Directors, 
which is the Group’s chief operating decision maker. The Group’s reportable segments were amended in the year to include the Channel Islands 
as a separate segment, reflecting the way in which reporting to the Board has evolved with the continued integration of BMI and BMRSI into 
the Group. Comparative information for the year ended 30 June 2013 has been restated accordingly.
k) Fiduciary activities 
  The Group commonly acts as trustee and in other fiduciary capacities that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf of individuals, 
trusts, retirement benefit plans and other institutions. These assets and income arising thereon are excluded from these financial statements, as 
they are not assets of the Group.
  The Group holds money on behalf of some clients in accordance with the client money rules of the Financial Conduct Authority. Such monies 
and the corresponding liability to clients are not included within the consolidated statement of financial position as the Group is not beneficially 
entitled thereto.
l) Property, plant and equipment 
  All property, plant and equipment is included in the consolidated statement of financial position at historical cost less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment. Costs include the original purchase cost of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset into a working condition 
for its intended use.
  Provision is made for depreciation to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset, using a straight line method, over its expected 
useful life as follows:
Fixtures and fittings   3 to 6.67 years
Equipment   5 years
Leasehold improvements   over the term of the lease
Motor vehicles   4 years
  The assets’ residual values and useful economic lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. Gains and 
losses arising on disposal are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount. These are included in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income.  Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Brooks Macdonald Group plc
30
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
2. Principal accounting policies (continued)
m) Intangible assets
  Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight 
line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets (4 to 20 years).
  Acquired client relationship contracts and contracts acquired with fund managers
  Intangible assets are recognised where client relationship contracts are either separately acquired or acquired with investment managers who 
are employed by the Group. These are initially recognised at cost and are subsequently amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated 
useful economic life. Separately acquired client relationship contracts are amortised over 15 years and those acquired with investment managers 
over five years. Both types of intangible asset are reviewed annually to determine whether an indicator of impairment exists.
 Computer software
 Computer software costs are amortised on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of four years.
 Goodwill 
  Goodwill arising as part of a business combination is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred 
over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the separately identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary at date of 
acquisition. In accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed annually for impairment and is 
therefore stated at cost less any provision for impairment of value. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income and is not subsequently reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill 
relating to the entity sold. On acquisition, any goodwill acquired is allocated to cash generating units for the purposes of impairment testing. If 
the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
n) Financial investments 
  The Group classifies financial assets in the following categories: fair value through profit or loss; available for sale; loans and receivables; and 
held-to-maturity. The classification is determined by management on initial recognition of the financial asset, which depends on the purpose for 
which it was acquired. 
 Fair value through profit or loss
  Financial instruments are classified as fair value through profit or loss if they are either held for trading or specifically designated in this category 
on initial recognition. Assets in this category are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently re-measured, with gains or losses arising from 
changes in fair value being recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
  Available for sale
  Available for sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either specifically designated in this category or are not classified in any of the other 
categories. They are included in non-current assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose of it within 12 months of 
the end of the reporting period. Available for sale financial assets are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently revalued based on 
the current bid prices of the asset as quoted in active markets. 
 Loans and receivables 
  Loans and receivables are non-derivative assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included 
in current assets except where they have maturities of more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period, in which case they are 
classified as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables are recognised within ‘trade and other receivables’.
 Held-to-maturity
  Held-to-maturity financial assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinate payments and fixed maturities that the Group’s

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
2. Principal accounting policies (continued)
o) Provisions
  Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, where it is probable that it will result in an 
outflow of economic benefits and can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be 
required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the obligation.
  Client compensation 
  Complaints are assessed on a case-by-case basis and provisions for compensation are made where it is judged necessary.
p) Foreign currency translation
  The Group’s functional and presentational currency is the Pound Sterling. Foreign currency transactions are translated using the exchange rate 
prevailing at the transaction date. At the reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated at the prevailing rates on that date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from settlement of such transactions and from the 
translation of period-end monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
q) Retirement benefit costs
  Contributions in respect of the Group’s defined contribution pension scheme are charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income as they fall due.
r) Taxation 
  Tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, 
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
  Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts in the Group’s financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled based on tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date.
  Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
s) Trade receivables 
  Trade receivables are initially recognised and subsequently measured at the original invoice amount less an allowance for any amounts that are 
expected to be uncollectable. Doubtful debts are provided for when the collection of the full amount is no longer probable, whilst bad debts 
are immediately written off when identified.
t) Trade payables 
  Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. These are 
classified as current liabilities if payment is due within 12 months or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). Otherwise, 
they are presented as non-current liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position.
 Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
u) Operating lease payments 
  Rent payments due under operating leases are charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the 
term of the lease. Where leases include lease incentives such as rent-free periods, the benefit of these incentives is recognised over the lease 
term as a reduction in the rental expense.  Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Brooks Macdonald Group plc

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
2. Principal accounting policies (continued)
v) Financial instruments 
  The Group classifies financial instruments, or their component parts, on initial recognition as a financial asset, a financial liability or an equity 
instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement. Financial instruments are recognised in the consolidated 
statement of financial position at fair value when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
w) Carried interest receivable 
  The Group earns a performance fee, carried interest receivable, on some of the funds it manages on behalf of its investors. Carried interest 
receivable is recognised where, at the reporting date, the performance criteria have been met based on the valuations of the funds. Carried 
interest that has been earned but is not yet due for payment is discounted to its present value. This is included within current liabilities in the 
consolidated statement of financial position.
x) Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’)
  The Company provides finance to an EBT to purchase the Company’s shares on the open market in order to meet its obligation to provide 
shares when an employee exercises certain options or awards made under the Group’s share-based payment schemes. The administration and 
finance costs connected with the EBT are charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The cost of the shares held by the 
EBT is deducted from equity. A transfer is made between other reserves and retained earnings over the vesting periods of the related share 
options or awards to reflect the ultimate proceeds receivable from employees on exercise. The trustees have waived their rights to receive 
dividends on the shares.
  The EBT is considered to be a Special Purpose Entity (‘SPE’) where the substance of the relationship between the Group and the SPE indicates 
that the SPE is controlled by the Group. In substance, the activities of the trust are being conducted on behalf of the Group according to its 
specific business needs, in order to obtain benefits from its operation. On this basis, the assets held by the trust are consolidated into the 
Group’s financial statements.
y) Share capital
  Ordinary share capital is classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in 
equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
  Where the parent company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares) the consideration paid, including any directly 
incremental costs (ie net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled or 
reissued. Where such ordinary shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received (net of any directly attributable incremental 
transaction costs and the related income tax effects) is included within equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders. 
z) Dividend distribution
  The dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which 
the dividend is authorised and no longer at the discretion of the Company. Final dividends are recognised when approved by the Company’s 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and interim dividends are recognised when paid.

3. Segmental information
For management purposes the Group’s activities are organised into four operating divisions: investment management, financial planning, fund and 
property management and the Channel Islands. The Group’s other activity, offering nominee and custody services to clients, is included within 
investment management. These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segmental information. In accordance with IFRS 8 
‘Operating Segments’, disclosures are required to reflect the information which the Board uses internally for evaluating the performance of its 
operating segments and allocating resources to those segments. The information presented in this note follows the presentation for internal 
reporting to the Group Board of Directors.
During the year the Group identified the Channel Islands as being a separate reportable segment. This comprises the results of BMI and BMRSI along 
with the recently acquired DPZ. Previously, BMI and BMRSI were included within the investment management and financial planning segments 
respectively. The comparatives for the year ended 30 June 2013 have been restated in accordance with IFRS 8 to reflect this change.
Revenues and expenses are allocated to the business segment that originated the transaction. Revenues and expenses that are not directly originated 
by a particular business segment are reported as unallocated. Sales between segments are carried out at arm’s length. Centrally incurred expenses 
are allocated to business segments on an appropriate pro-rata basis. Segmental assets and liabilities comprise operating assets and liabilities, those 
being the majority of the balance sheet.

8. Taxation
The tax charge on profit on ordinary activities for the year was as follows:
  2014 2013 
  £’000 £’000
UK Corporation Tax at 22.50% (2013: 23.75%)  2,477 2,618

Total current tax  2,460 3,042
Deferred tax credit  (473) (673)
Effect of change in tax rate on deferred tax  (475) (1)
Income tax expense  1,512 2,368
Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
The tax on the Group’s profit before tax differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the time apportioned tax rate applicable to profits 
of the consolidated entities in the UK as follows:    
  2014 2013 
  £’000 £’000
Profit on ordinary activities before tax  10,568 10,398
Profit on ordinary activities multiplied by the standard  
rate of tax in the UK of 22.50% (2013: 23.75%)  2,378 2,469
Tax effect of:  
– lower tax rates in other countries in which the Group operates  (618) (398)
– disallowable expenses  77 189
– non-taxable income  (1) (260)
– tax losses unutilised/(utilised) on which no deferred tax is provided  168 (55)
– change in rate of Corporation Tax applicable to deferred tax  (475) (1)
– (over)/under provision in prior years  (17) 424
Tax charge for the year  1,512 2,368
The deferred tax credits totalling £948,000 (2013: £674,000) represent a credit of £122,000 (2013: £287,000) arising from the share option reserve 
at the balance sheet date, a credit of £10,000 (2013: £10,000) relating to accelerated capital allowances, a credit of £341,000 (2013: £377,000) 
arising from the amortisation of acquired client relationship contracts and a credit due to a change in tax rates of £475,000 (2013: £nil).
On 1 April 2014, the standard rate of Corporation Tax in the UK was reduced from 23% to 21%. As a result the effective rate of Corporation Tax 
applied to the taxable profit for the year ended 30 June 2014 is 22.50% (2013: 23.75%).
In addition to the change in the rate of UK Corporation Tax disclosed above, the Finance Act 2013 (substantively enacted on 2 July 2013) will further 
reduce the main rate of UK Corporation Tax to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the rate that is 
expected to be in force when the temporary differences unwind, but limited to the extent that such rates have been substantively enacted. 
Consequently the tax rate used to determine the deferred tax assets and liabilities is 20% (2013: 23%).

9. Business combinations
On 11 April 2014, the Group acquired the entire share capital of DPZ Capital Limited (‘DPZ’). DPZ is a well established wealth management business 
based in Jersey. It manages a range of distinct investment strategies founded on its core competencies: asset allocation; manager selection; fixed 
interest and credit investing; and equity selection. On acquisition, DPZ had funds under management of approximately £430m, £360m of which 
was managed on a discretionary basis, £60m on an advisory basis and £10m on an execution only basis. 
In the financial year ended 30 June 2013, the Group acquired the entire share capital of JPAM Limited, Brooks Macdonald Asset Management 
(International) Limited (formerly Spearpoint Limited) and Brooks Macdonald Retirement Services (International) Limited (formerly Spearpoint 
Retirement Services Limited). Details of these acquisitions are disclosed in note 9 of the 2013 Annual Report.
The total consideration for the acquisition of DPZ was £11,678,000, comprising of: cash of £4,155,000; the issue of 158,032 shares in Brooks 
Macdonald Group plc with a value of £2,697,000; and a contingent balance of £4,826,000 payable in two instalments in October 2014 and May 
2016 and based on the future value of the discretionary funds under management acquired. The fair value of the liability is currently the maximum 
consideration that could be paid under the terms of the acquisition, assuming that there is no reduction in the level of discretionary client 
funds retained. 
Directly attributable acquisition costs of £61,000 were incurred as a result of the acquisition and have been charged to the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.
Goodwill of £4,035,000 was recognised on acquisition in respect of expected synergies from combining the operations of DPZ with the Group’s 
existing offshore operations, as well as intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition and the experience of the investment 
management staff employed by DPZ.
The fair values of the assets acquired are the gross contractual amounts and all are considered to be fully recoverable. The fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, at the date of acquisition, are detailed in (a) below.

and is subject to approval by the shareholders at the Company’s Annual General Meeting. It will be paid on 28 October 2014 to shareholders who 
are on the register at the close of business on 26 September 2014. In accordance with IAS 10 ‘Events After the Reporting Period’, this dividend has 
not been included as a liability in these financial statements. Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Brooks Macdonald Group plc

a) Goodwill
  Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at acquisition to the cash generating units (‘CGUs’) that are expected to benefit from 
that business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill at 30 June 2014 comprises £3,550,000 in respect of the Braemar Group Limited 
(‘Braemar’) CGU, £17,208,000 in respect of the Brooks Macdonald Asset Management (International) Limited and Brooks Macdonald 
Retirement Services (International) Limited (collectively ‘Brooks Macdonald International’) CGU and £4,035,000 in respect of the DPZ Capital 
Limited (‘DPZ’) CGU.
  Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment and its recoverability has been assessed at 30 June 2014 by comparing the carrying amount of 
the CGUs to their expected recoverable amount, estimated on a value-in-use basis. The value-in-use of each CGU has been calculated using 
pre-tax discounted cash flow projections based on the most recent budgets approved by the Board, covering a period of up to five years. Cash 
flows are then extrapolated beyond the forecast period using an expected long-term growth rate.

Brooks Macdonald Group plc
11. Intangible assets (continued)
a) Goodwill (continued)
  Based on the value-in-use calculation, at 30 June 2014 the calculated recoverable amount of the Brooks Macdonald International CGU was 
£26,520,000, indicating that there is no impairment. The key underlying assumptions of the calculation are the discount rate, the short-term 
growth in earnings and the long-term growth rate of the business. A pre-tax discount rate of 10% has been used, based on the Group’s 
assessment of the risk-free rate of interest and specific risks relating to Brooks Macdonald International. Annual earnings growth rates of 7% 
and 5% respectively are forecast in the next two financial years, the period covered by the most recent forecasts, which reflect historic actual 
growth and are considered to be achievable given current market and industry trends. The 2% long-term growth rate applied is considered 
prudent in the context of the long-term average growth rate for the funds, investment management and financial planning industries in 
which the CGU operates.
  The key assumptions inherent in the value-in-use calculations for the Braemar and DPZ CGUs were similarly a pre-tax discount rate of 10%, 
annual revenue growth rates ranging from 10% to 27% and a long-term growth rate of up to 2%. Significant headroom exists in the 
calculations of the respective recoverable amounts of these CGUs over the carrying amounts of the goodwill allocated to them. On this basis, 
the directors have concluded that there is no impairment.
  The directors consider that no reasonably foreseeable change in any of the key assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill,  
given the margin by which the estimated recoverable amounts of the CGUs exceed the carrying amounts of the goodwill allocated to each.

payable in respect of the acquired client relationships of BMI and BMRSI and £840,000 relating to the acquisition of JPAM Limited, was transferred to 
provisions within current liabilities.
A range of final outcomes for the expected total deferred consideration payable cannot be estimated as the future value of the funds under 
management is dependent on several unpredictable variables, including client retention and market movements.

in October 2008 and October 2009 and employer’s National Insurance contributions arising from share option awards under the LTIS (note 26b). 
The schemes are cash settled and payments are made to participants in respect of their awards by the Group’s subsidiary undertakings. The options 
are awarded at no cost to the participants. The amount that is ultimately payable to participants of the scheme is equal to the increase in market 
value of the Company’s ordinary shares over a three year vesting period. The award will vest after three years to the extent that the performance 
conditions are satisfied and will be forfeited in total if performance fails to meet the minimum criteria. 
The options have been valued using a Black Scholes model based on the market price of the Company’s shares at the grant date (note 26). The total 
charge to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year for all Phantom Share Option Schemes and employer’s National 
Insurance contributions arising from share option awards under the LTIS (note 26b) was £150,000 (2013: £423,000). The number of Phantom

26. Equity settled share-based payments
All share options granted to employees under the Group’s equity settled share-based payment schemes are valued using a Black Scholes model, based 
on the market price of the Company’s shares at the grant date and volatility ranging from 15% to 50% on an historic price, covering the period to the 
end of the contractual life. Volatility has been estimated on the basis of the Company’s historical share price subsequent to flotation. The risk-free annual 
rate of interest is deemed to be the yield on a gilt edged security with a maturity term of ten years, ranging from 0.34% to 2.00%.
For options granted during the year, the Black Scholes model was based on the market price of the Company’s shares at each respective grant date and 
volatility of 50% with no dividend yield, an expected vesting period of three years and a risk-free annual rate of interest of 0.34%.
The share options issued under the various equity settled share-based payment schemes have been valued at prices ranging from £nil to £14.64 per 
share. The charge to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year in respect of these was £1,288,000 (2013: £1,111,000). The 
weighted average remaining contractual life of all equity settled share-based payment schemes at 30 June 2014 was 2.08 years (2013: 2.61 years). The 
weighted average share price of all options exercised during the year was £15.79 (2013: £13.75). The total charge to the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income for the year for all share-based payment schemes was £1,130,000 (2013: £1,624,000).

ordinary shares in the Company to satisfy rights to purchase shares on the exercise of options awarded under the LTIS. All finance costs and 
administration expenses connected with the Trust are charged to consolidated statement of comprehensive income as they accrue. The Trust 
has waived its rights to dividends. The following table shows the number of shares held by the Trust that have not yet vested unconditionally.

d) Company Share Option Plan (‘CSOP’)
  The Company has established a Company Share Option Plan (‘CSOP’), which was approved by HMRC in November 2013. The CSOP is a 
discretionary scheme whereby employees or directors are granted an option to purchase the Company’s shares in the future at a price set on 
the date of the grant. The maximum award under the terms of the scheme is a total market value of £30,000 per recipient. The performance 
conditions attached to the scheme require an increase in the diluted earnings per share of the Company of 2% more than the increase in the 
RPI over the three years starting with the financial year in which the option is granted.

27. Earnings per share
 The directors believe that adjusted earnings per share provide a truer reflection of the Group’s underlying performance in the year. Adjusted earnings 
per share are calculated based on ‘adjusted earnings’, that is earnings before acquisition costs, finance costs of deferred consideration and 
amortisation of intangible non-current assets. The tax effect of these adjustments has also been considered.

30. Financial risk management
The Group has identified the financial risks arising from its activities and has established policies and procedures as part of a formal structure for 
managing risk, including establishing risk lines, reporting lines, mandates and other control procedures. The structure is reviewed regularly. The 
Group does not use derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes.
a) Liquidity risk
 Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its payment obligations associated with its financial liabilities when they fall due.
  The primary objective of the Group’s treasury policy is to manage short-term liquidity requirements and to ensure that the Group maintains a 
surplus of immediately realisable assets over its liabilities, such that all known and potential cash obligations can be met.
  The table below shows the cash inflows and outflows from the Group under non-derivative financial assets and liabilities, together with cash 
and bank balances available on demand.

30. Financial risk management (continued)
 
b)  Market risk
 Interest rate risk
  The Group may elect to invest surplus cash balances in short-term cash deposits with maturity dates not exceeding three months. 
Consequently, the Group has a limited exposure to interest rate risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing level of market interest rates.
  A 1% fall in the average monthly interest rate receivable on the Group’s cash and cash equivalents would have the impact of reducing interest 
receivable and therefore profit before taxation by £180,000 (2013: £184,000). An increase of 1% would have an equal and opposite effect.
 Foreign exchange risk
  The Group does not have any material exposure to transactional foreign currency risk and therefore no analysis of foreign exchange risk is provided.
 Price risk
  Price risk is the risk that the fair value of the future cash flows from financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market prices (other 
than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk). The Group is exposed to price risk through its holdings of equity securities and other 
financial assets, which are measured at fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position (notes 13 and 17). A 1% fall in the value of 
these financial instruments would have the impact of reducing other comprehensive income by £22,000 (2013: £12,000) and profit before tax 
by £5,000 (2013: £nil). An increase of 1% would have an equal and opposite effect.
c)  Credit risk
  The Group may elect to invest surplus cash balances in highly liquid money market instruments with maturity dates not exceeding three 
months. The difference between the fair value and the net book value of these instruments is not material. To reduce the risk of a counterparty 
default, the Group deposits the rest of its funds in approved, high quality banks. At 30 June 2014 there was no significant concentration of 
credit risk in any particular counterparty (2013: none).
  Assets exposed to credit risk recognised on the consolidated statement of financial position total £18,056,000 (2013: £18,440,000), being the 
Group’s total cash and cash equivalents.
  Trade receivables with a carrying amount of £9,653,000 (2013: £5,158,000) are neither past due nor impaired. Trade receivables have no 
external credit rating as they relate to individual clients, although the value of investments held in each individual client’s portfolio is always in 
excess of the total value of the receivable. All trade receivables fall due within three months (2013: all).

31. Capital management
Capital is defined as the total of share capital, share premium, retained earnings and other reserves of the Company. Total capital at 30 June 2014 
was £67,458,000 (2013: £57,560,000). Regulatory capital is derived from the Group Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), which 
is a requirement of the Capital Requirements Directive. The ICAAP draws on the Group’s risk management process which is embedded within the 
individual businesses, function heads and executive committees within the Group.
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to comply with the capital requirements set by the Financial Conduct Authority, to safeguard the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to 
maintain a strong capital base to support the development of the business.
Capital adequacy and the use of regulatory capital are monitored daily by the Group’s management. The Group’s 2014 ICAAP was approved in 
August 2014. There have been no capital requirement breaches during the year. Brooks Macdonald Group plc’s Pillar III disclosure is presented on 
our website at www.brooksmacdonald.com.
32. Guarantees and contingent liabilities
The Company has an agreement with the Royal Bank of Scotland plc to guarantee settlement for trading with CREST stock on behalf of clients. The 
Group holds client assets to fund such trading activity.
Additional levies by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme may give rise to further obligations based on the Group’s income in the current or 
previous years. Nevertheless, the ultimate cost to the Group of these levies remains uncertain and is dependent upon future claims resulting from 
institutional failures.
33. Related party transactions
Certain directors have taken advantage of the Group’s interest-free season ticket loan facility which is available to all employees. The directors who 
have such loans are as follows:

33. Related party transactions (continued)
All of the above amounts are interest-free and, with the exception of the subordinated loan to Braemar Group Limited, are repayable on demand.
The Group manages a number of collective investment funds that are considered related parties. Available for sale financial assets include an 
investment of 1,426,793.64 B shares in Braemar Group PCC Limited Student Accommodation Cell (note 13). This transaction was conducted on an 
arm’s length basis at market value.
In the year ended 30 June 2014 Brooks Macdonald Funds Limited, a subsidiary of the Group, entered into a new partnership, North Row Capital LLP, 
in which it holds a 60% interest and has joint control. The balance is owned by two individual partners who developed the investment approach 
behind the IFSL North Row Liquid Property Fund, which was launched in February 2014. The fund offers investors liquid exposure to global real 
estate markets by investing predominantly in property derivatives, as well as property equity and debt, to gain exposure to the direct property 
markets.
The establishment of the partnership and the fund required an initial capital contribution of £135,000 by Brooks Macdonald Funds, with a further 
investment of £225,000. The Group’s share of the loss for the period reported by North Row Capital LLP was £128,000, which has been recognised 
in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income with a corresponding reduction in the investment in joint venture recognised in the 
consolidated statement of financial position.
34. Events since the end of the year
On 31 July 2014, the Company exercised its option to acquire 100% of the share capital of Levitas Investment Management Services Limited 
(‘Levitas’). Levitas is the sponsor of two funds known as TM Levitas A and TM Levitas B, to which Brooks Macdonald Asset Management Limited acts 
as the investment adviser. The funds were launched in July 2012 and aggregate assets under management on completion of the acquisition were 
£89,353,000. The Levitas investment proposition uses a blend of the two funds to match investments to a client’s specific risk rating, thus 
simplifying the investment and rebalancing processes while keeping down costs. 
The consideration payable by the Group will be based on 3% of Levitas’ funds under management, calculated at agreed milestones up to 1 
November 2018. The maximum consideration payable by the Group will be £24,000,000 and is subject to reduction if the growth in funds under 
management fails to meet the agreed targets. Payment of the consideration will be made by the Group in cash in a series of instalments, with the 
final payment date being on or around 8 November 2020.
The acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination under IFRS 3 and it is anticipated that goodwill will be recognised. The goodwill 
represents the Levitas concept; the relationship with Aspira, the principal intermediary and vendor; and growth potential of the assets under 
management of the two funds in generating future fee income for Levitas. Transaction costs of £80,000 were incurred in the year ended 30 June 
2014 and are included within administrative costs in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Due to the acquisition occurring after the end of the financial year and the proximity to the date of issuing the Annual Report & Accounts, the 
directors are unable to provide the full disclosures required under IFRS 3 regarding acquisitions after the end of the reporting period but before the 
financial statements are due for issue. Specifically, an assessment of the acquisition date fair value of the consideration and identifiable assets and 
liabilities has not yet been completed as the required information is not currently available. This will be finalised in the 12 months following the 
acquisition and full disclosures will be provided in the Half Yearly Financial Report for the six months ending 31 December 2014.

Independent auditors’ report 
to the members of Brooks Macdonald Group plc
Report on the company financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion the financial statements, defined below:
•  give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 
30 June 2014;
•  have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
•  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder 
of this report.
What we have audited
The company financial statements (the “financial statements”), which 
are prepared by Brooks Macdonald Group plc, comprise:
• the Company balance sheet as at 30 June 2014; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of  
 significant accounting policies and other explanatory information
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). In applying 
the financial reporting framework, the directors have made a number of 
subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting 
estimates. In making such estimates, they have made assumptions and 
considered future events.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). An audit involves 
obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
•  whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; 
•  the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by  
the directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
Annual Report & Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If 
we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the strategic report and the 
report of the directors for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Other matters on which we are required to report  
by exception
Adequacy of accounting records and information and 
explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, 
or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
•  the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities set out 
on page 18, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the 
Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of 
the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to 
any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of Brooks

Notes to the company financial statements
35. Principal accounting policies
The general accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been applied consistently 
to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.
a) Basis of preparation
  The Company’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable accounting standards in the 
United Kingdom. The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of investments such that 
they are measured at their fair value.
  At the time of approving the financial statements, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
b) Investments in subsidiary companies
 Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at cost less provisions for impairment.
c) Share-based payments
  The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 ‘Share-based Payment’ and has adopted the requirements of UITF 44. Equity settled 
share-based payments are measured at fair value at the grant date and the charge to the profit and loss account is recognised on a straight line 
basis over the period in which the related services are provided, based on the number of shares that are expected to vest.
d) Operating lease payments
  Rent payments due under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. The 
Company benefited from a rent-free period under the terms of its current property lease. In accordance with UITF 28 ‘Operating Lease 
Incentives’, the benefit is allocated over the shorter of the lease term and the date of the market rent review specified in the lease. During the 
rent-free period a rental charge has been recognised in the profit and loss account and accrued as a liability in the balance sheet.
e) Retirement benefit costs
  Contributions in respect of the Group’s defined contribution pension scheme are charged to the profit and loss account as they fall due.
f) Employee Benefit Trust
  Where the Company holds its own equity shares through an Employee Benefit Trust these shares are shown as a reduction in shareholders’ 
equity. Any consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of these shares is shown as a reduction in the reconciliation of movements in 
shareholders’ funds. No gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account or the statement of total recognised gains or losses on the 
purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of these shares.
g) Other investments
  Other quoted investments are re-valued each reporting period to their fair value according to the most recently available market information.

Long Term Incentive Scheme
The Group established an Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’) on 3 December 2010 to acquire ordinary shares in the Company to satisfy awards under the 
Group’s Long Term Incentive Scheme (‘LTIS’) and other share-based payment schemes (note 26). All finance and administration expenses connected with 
the Trust are charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as and when they accrue. The Trust has waived its rights to dividends.
As at 30 June 2014, the Company had paid £3,339,000 to the Trust, which had acquired 261,072 ordinary shares on the open market for 
consideration of £3,277,000.
In November 2013, in respect of the scheme granted in October 2010, the Trust received instructions to exercise 11,376 options. The cost of the 
shares released on exercise of these options amounted to £110,000. At 30 June 2014, the number of shares held by the Trust was 249,696 (2013: 
212,172) with a market value of £3,906,000 (2013: £3,045,000), acquired for a total consideration of £3,168,000 (2013: £2,544,000). These shares 
are presented as treasury shares in the Group financial statements and their cost is deducted from retained earnings within shareholders’ equity. Annual Report & Accounts 2014

Explanatory notes to the Annual General Meeting resolutions
Enclosed with this document is a notice convening the Annual General 
Meeting of the company for 27 October 2014. This explanatory note 
gives further information on the resolutions set out in the notice of 
Annual General Meeting.
Resolution 1 – Approval of the Report & Accounts
The directors propose that the Company’s annual accounts and reports 
of the directors and the auditors for the year ended 30 June 2014 be 
received and considered.
Resolution 2 – Approval of the directors’ remuneration report
While it is not a strict requirement for the Company, as a matter of good 
corporate governance the directors have decided to propose an ordinary 
resolution to approve the directors’ remuneration report for the year 
ended 30 June 2014. The directors’ remuneration report can be found 
on pages 9 to 15 of the Annual Report & Accounts. 
Resolution 3 – To declare a final dividend
The directors recommend a final dividend of 19 pence per ordinary 
share. Subject to approval by shareholders, the final dividend will  
be paid on 28 October 2014 to shareholders on the register on  
26 September 2014. 
Resolutions 4 to 7 – To re-elect certain of the directors
Richard Price has been appointed as an additional director since the 
Annual General Meeting in 2013 and, accordingly, the Company’s 
articles of association require him to retire from office at this Annual 
General Meeting and to offer himself for re-election.
In addition, the Company’s articles of association state that one third of 
the directors (or the nearest whole number closest to one third) must 
retire from office at each Annual General Meeting and offer themselves 
for re-election. In addition, any director who has been in office for more 
than three years since their last appointment or re-appointment should 
also retire and offer themselves for re-election. Simon Jackson, Diane 
Seymour-Williams and Richard Spencer are therefore offering themselves 
for re-election on this basis. 
Information on each of the directors standing for re-election is set out 
below. The Board confirms that each of the directors offering themselves 
for re-election has extensive relevant experience of the Group and its 
business. The Board is therefore of the opinion that all such persons 
should be re-elected to the Board.
Simon Jackson (55) is finance director responsible for the Group’s 
management accounts. In addition to the finance function, Simon has 
Board responsibility for some of the other central administrative 
functions of the Group, with the managers of ICT, Human Resources and 
Learning and Development reporting to him. 
He is a chartered accountant and joined the Group in 2000 having 
worked for a number of public and private companies at director level. 
Diane Seymour-Williams (55) joined the board of Brooks Macdonald 
Group plc in 2011. She has spent her entire career in the fund 
management industry, both managing portfolios and businesses. Diane 
spent 23 years at Morgan Grenfell/Deutsche Asset Management in a 
variety of roles, including Head of Asian Equities team, CEO & CIO Asia, 
and Head of Global Equity Product. 
Diane is currently a director of LGM Investments Limited, Lloyd George 
Investment Company plc, Witan Pacific Investment Trust plc, LG China 
Fund plc and BMO Investments (Ireland) plc.
Richard Spencer (51) is the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of Brooks 
Macdonald Asset Management Limited where he is responsible for 
overseeing the investment management strategy and asset allocation. 
Richard joined the Company in 1991 as a founding director and has 
worked in the industry since 1985.
Richard Price (52) joined the board of Brooks Macdonald Group plc in 
August 2014. Richard spent 28 years at KPMG where he had 
considerable exposure to financial services clients, holding a number of 
roles including the UK Head of KPMG’s Financial Sector Transaction 
Services practice.
Richard is also a non-executive director of Think Money Group Limited. 
A copy of each service contract is available for inspection at the 
registered office of the Company and will be available for inspection at 
the Annual General Meeting.
Resolution 8 – To appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
as auditors
This Resolution proposes that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP should 
be appointed as the Company’s auditors and authorises the 
directors to determine their remuneration.
Resolution 9 – Authority to allot shares
The Companies Act 2006 prevents directors from allotting unissued 
shares without the authority of shareholders in general meeting. In 
certain circumstances this could be unduly restrictive. The directors’ 
existing authority to allot shares, which was granted at the Annual 
General Meeting held in 2013, will expire at the end of this year’s 
Annual General Meeting. Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Brooks Macdonald Group plc
68
Explanatory notes to the Annual General Meeting resolutions
Resolution 9 - Authority to allot shares (continued)
Resolution 9 in the notice of Annual General Meeting will be proposed, as 
an ordinary resolution, to authorise the directors to allot ordinary shares of 
1 pence each in the capital of the Company up to a maximum nominal 
amount of £44,855 (ie up to 4,485,500 ordinary shares) representing 
approximately 33% of the ordinary shares in issue on 16 September 
2014. The Company does not currently hold any shares in treasury. 
The authority conferred by this resolution will expire on the date which 
is 15 months after the passing of this resolution or, if sooner, at the end 
of next year’s Annual General Meeting.
Resolution 10 – To disapply pre-emption rights
Unless they are given an appropriate authority by shareholders, if the 
directors wish to allot any of the unissued shares for cash or grant rights 
over shares or sell treasury shares for cash (other than pursuant to an 
employee share scheme) they must first offer them to existing 
shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. This is known as 
pre-emption rights.
The existing disapplication of these statutory pre-emption rights, which 
was granted at the Annual General Meeting held in 2013, will expire at 
the end of this year’s Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, Resolution 10 
in the notice of Annual General Meeting will be proposed, as a special 
resolution, to give the directors power to allot shares without the 
application of these statutory pre-emption rights: first, in relation to offers 
of equity securities by way of rights issue, open offer or similar 
arrangements; and second, in relation to the allotment of equity securities 
for cash up to a maximum aggregate nominal amount of £13,592 (ie up 
to 1,359,200 ordinary shares) representing approximately 10% of the 
ordinary shares in issue on 16 September 2014. 
The authority sought and limits set by this resolution will also apply to a 
sale by the Company of any shares it holds as treasury shares. The 
Companies Act 2006 allows shares purchased by the Company out of 
distributable profits to be held as treasury shares, which may then be 
cancelled, sold for cash or used to meet the Company’s obligations 
under its employee share-based incentive schemes. Any subsequent 
transfers of treasury shares by the Company to satisfy the requirements 
of employee share-based incentive schemes will be counted towards the 
anti-dilution limits for such share issues to the extent required by the 
Association of British Insurers guidelines.
The power conferred by this resolution will expire on the date which 
falls 15 months after the passing of this resolution or, if sooner, at the 
end of next year’s Annual General Meeting.
Resolution 11 – Company’s authority to purchase its own shares
Resolution 11 in the notice of Annual General Meeting, which will be 
proposed as a special resolution, will authorise the Company to make 
market purchases of up to 1,359,200 ordinary shares. The existing 
authority to make market purchases of ordinary shares, which was 
granted at the Annual General Meeting held in 2013, will expire at the 
end of this year’s Annual General Meeting.
The number of ordinary shares stated in this resolution equals 
approximately 10% of the Company’s ordinary shares in issue on 16 
September 2014. The minimum price that may be paid is the nominal 
value of an ordinary share (ie 1 pence), and the maximum price shall 
not exceed 5% above the average of the middle market quotations for 
an ordinary share for the five business days before each purchase is 
made (exclusive of expenses).
The authority conferred by this resolution will expire on the date which 
falls 15 months after the passing of this resolution or, if sooner, at the 
end of next year’s Annual General Meeting.
The directors are committed to managing the Company’s capital 
effectively. Although the directors have no plans to make such 
purchases, buying back the Company’s ordinary shares is one of the 
options they keep under review. Purchases would only be made after 
considering the effect on earnings per share, and the benefits for 
shareholders generally.
The Company may hold in treasury any of its own shares that it purchases 
pursuant to the Companies Act 2006 and the authority conferred by this 
resolution. This would give the Company the ability to re-issue treasury 
shares quickly and cost effectively and would provide the Company with 
greater flexibility in the management of its capital base. Annual Report & Accounts 2014

To resolve as an ordinary resolution:
9.  that the directors be generally and unconditionally authorised 
pursuant to section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”) to 
exercise all the powers of the Company to allot shares in the 
Company and to grant rights to subscribe for, or to convert any 
security into, shares in the Company (“Relevant Securities”), up to a 
maximum aggregate nominal amount of £44,855, for a period 
expiring (unless previously revoked, varied or renewed) on the date 
which is 15 months after the passing of this resolution or, if sooner, 
the end of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company. 
However, in each case the Company may, before such expiry, make 
an offer or agreement which would or might require Relevant 
Securities to be allotted after this authority expires and the directors 
may allot Relevant Securities in pursuance of such offer or agreement 
as if this authority had not expired.
  All previous unutilised authorities given to the directors pursuant to 
section 551 of the Act shall cease to have effect at the conclusion of 
the Annual General Meeting, save to the extent that those authorities 
are exercisable pursuant to section 551(7) of the Act by reason of any 
offer or agreement made prior to the date of this resolution which 
would or might require shares to be allotted or rights to be granted 
on or after that date
Disapplication of pre-emption rights
To resolve as a special resolution:
10.  that, subject to the passing of resolution 9 above, the directors be 
generally empowered pursuant to sections 570 and 573 of the Act to 
allot equity securities (within the meaning of section 560 of the Act) 
for cash, pursuant to the authority conferred by resolution 9, as if 
section 561 of the Act did not apply to such allotment, provided that 
this power shall expire on the date which is 15 months after the 
passing of this resolution or, if sooner, the end of the next Annual 
General Meeting of the Company. This power shall be limited to the 
allotment of equity securities:
 10.1  in connection with an offer of equity securities (including, 
without limitation, under a rights issue, open offer or similar 
arrangement) in favour of holders of ordinary shares in the 
capital of the Company in proportion (as nearly as may be 
practicable) to their existing holdings of ordinary shares but 
subject to such exclusions or other arrangements as the 
directors deem necessary or expedient in relation to fractional 
entitlements or any legal, regulatory or practical problems 
under the laws of any territory, or the requirements of any 
regulatory body or stock exchange; and 
 10.2  otherwise than pursuant to paragraph 10.1 up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £13,592; 
   but the Company may, before such expiry, make an offer or 
agreement which would or might require equity securities to be 
allotted after this power expires and the directors may allot 
equity securities in pursuance of such offer or agreement as if 
this power had not expired. 
   This power applies in relation to a sale of shares which is an 
allotment of equity securities by virtue of section 560(2)(b) of 
the Act as if in the first paragraph of this resolution the words 
“pursuant to the authority conferred by resolution 9” were 
omitted.
   All previous unutilised powers given to the directors pursuant to 
sections 570 and 573 of the Act shall cease to have effect at the 
conclusion of this Annual General Meeting
Company’s authority to purchase its own shares
To resolve as a special resolution:

Notes:
Your rights to appoint a proxy
1.   As a member of the Company you are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of your rights to attend and to speak and vote at a meeting of the Company. A proxy does not need to 
be a member of the Company. You may appoint more than one proxy in relation to a meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or 
shares held by you
2.  You may appoint a proxy in respect of all or some only of the shares held by you. If you do not want to appoint a proxy in respect of all of the shares held by you, delete the word “all” in 
square brackets and insert the number of shares in respect of which you wish to appoint your proxy in the box provided. If you sign and return this proxy form with no number inserted, you 
will be deemed to have appointed your proxy in respect of all of the shares held by you
3.  If you require additional proxy forms in order to appoint more than one proxy, please contact the Company’s registrar, Capita Asset Services, or you may copy this form. Please indicate by 
ticking the box provided if the proxy appointment is one of multiple appointments being made. You must also indicate in the separate box the number of shares in relation to which the proxy 
holder is authorised to act as your proxy. All proxy forms must be signed and should, wherever possible, be returned together in one envelope
4. If you appoint a proxy, this does not preclude you from attending the meeting and voting in person
Procedure for appointing a proxy
5. Please insert your full name and address in block capitals in the box
6.  To appoint as your proxy a person other than the chairman of the meeting, delete the words in square brackets and insert the full name and address of your chosen proxy in block capitals in 
the box. If you sign and return this proxy form with no name inserted in the box, the chairman of the meeting will be deemed to be your proxy. Where you appoint as your proxy someone 
other than the chairman of the meeting, it is your responsibility to ensure that that person attends the meeting and is aware of your voting intentions. If you wish your proxy to make any 
comments on your behalf, you will need to appoint someone other than the chairman of the meeting and give that person your directions
Directing your proxy how to vote
7.  To direct your proxy how to vote on the resolutions mark the appropriate box with an “X”. If no voting direction is given, your proxy can vote or abstain from voting as he or she chooses. 
Your proxy has the right to vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she chooses in relation to any other business (including a resolution to adjourn the meeting or to amend a resolution) which 
may properly come before the meeting
8.  The “vote withheld” option is provided to enable you to abstain on any particular resolution. However, it should be noted that a “vote withheld” is not a vote in law and will not be counted 
in the calculation of the proportion of the votes “for” and “against” a resolution

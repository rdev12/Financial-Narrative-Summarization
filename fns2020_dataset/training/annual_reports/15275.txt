2007 was a good year for the Group. 
We made steady progress across all 
of our Divisions in both our operational
performance and strategic plans to
develop the Group for the future. This
showed through in the financial results.
The Polymers business had another
good year, of growth in volumes and
profit. Our strategy in Polymers remains
focused on geographical expansion
around our existing business hubs and
developing market sectors where our
product technology and manufacturing
capabilities give us real competitive
advantage. 
We are investing heavily in additional
Nitrile capacity in Malaysia to take full
advantage of the continued growth in 
this product and the Asian region.
Our Pharma business continued to 
grow the range of generic and ethical
products that it plans to manufacture 
by registering further drug master files in
the year. As we had previously indicated
Pharma earnings declined, in part due to
the phasing of orders in the second half
of the year. We announced plans to exit
our Italian site to improve the operational
cost base and the productivity of the
business. This exit is proceeding to plan. 
Impact Chemicals has had a challenging
year, but has delivered significant
improvement. We are clearly seeing 
the benefits of our strategy to raise 
the performance of these businesses
through restructuring and focusing 
on market segments offering better
margins and growth. 
Overall, underlying Group profit 
before taxation increased some 10% 
to £34.5 million, and earnings per 
share by 18% to 17 .3 pence per share.
The directors recommend a final dividend
of 5.7 pence a share, which would make
the full payment for the year 9.6 pence
(2006 9.3 pence a share), an increase 
of 3.2%. Subject to shareholders’
approval, the dividend will be paid on 
4 July to members on the register at 
close of business on 6 June.
The working conditions and safety 
of our employees everywhere remains
paramount in the operation of our
business. We set targets annually to
reduce levels of Lost Time Accidents, 
and against this measure we have been
improving our safety performance for
many years. I am pleased we have made
further progress in 2007 and have had
our best ever year in terms of both 
“all accident” and “Lost Time Accident”
rates. We remain fully committed to the
principles of sustainable development
and have made significant progress
against all of the 10-year targets in our
sustainable development programme.
This has been a year in which much has
been achieved. On behalf of the directors
and shareholders, I would like to thank 
all our employees everywhere for their
commitment and contribution towards
the company’ s success.
Outlook
The closing months of 2007 and the 
start of 2008 were characterised by
concerns of lower economic growth in
the USA and parts of Western Europe.
We have, however made a satisfactory
start to 2008 with continuing momentum
in our Polymers business. 
Chairman’s Statement
We will continue to expand the geography
and customer base of our principal
Polymers business. New product
development remains an important
element of how we will achieve this. 
In addition we continue to look for
additional ways to improve our
productivity and reduce our cost base.
We have already committed ourselves 
to further investment in Asia for significant
additional Latex capacity and should
benefit from the rapid growth there.
Consequently we expect another year of
good results from our Polymer business.
In our Pharma business we will continue
to develop new generic products for future
filing whilst our previously announced re-
structuring will be complete by the end 
of 2008. The remedial measures taken in
the Impact Chemicals business should
lead to further improvement in its results.
As we enter the year, the raw material
situation for monomers looks set to
remain volatile. We coped well with 
this situation in Polymers in 2007 through
selling price increases and reformulation,
and will continue to manage our response
in a similar manner as 2008 progresses.

Overview
2007 has been a year in which the Group
has moved forward on a number of fronts
to develop the business. The result of this
process is clearly demonstrated by the
10% increase in underlying Group profit
before taxation. It has also been another
year in which the recent history of rising
raw material prices has persisted and 
we have had to work hard to mitigate the
impact of this. Against this background,
we have made good progress across 
the portfolio, and, although the global
economy looks challenging, we are
cautiously optimistic about the Group’ s
performance in 2008.
Polymers (73% of total sales) grew 
sales volumes by 4.3% and underlying
operating profit by 6.2%. This was
achieved in an environment of volatile 
and generally increasing monomer
pricing, and ongoing supply constraints.
We sustained our operating margins 
year on year at 9.7%.
The previously announced expansion 
of Nitrile capacity in Kluang, Malaysia 
was brought on line in November, and
immediately sold out. The Group has
committed itself to significant further
expansion during 2008. This site is well
located to provide reliable supply to major
glove manufacturers. Market growth for
synthetic gloves remains strong and this
investment confirms our intent to remain
as a leading supplier.
We also completed the expansion of our
Mouscron, Belgium dispersion facility,
where capacity increased by 30%.
Pharmaceuticals (11% of total sales) 
saw sales little changed at £63.8 million.
However second half year sales were
substantially lower than the first half due
to order phasing which in part resulted 
in reduced underlying profitability of 
£7 .4 million. The generic drug market
continues to grow strongly but, as
always, is characterised by price erosion
following patent expiry. Our strategy to
address this is to maximise operating
efficiencies whilst expanding our product
portfolio. During the year, we announced
the closure of our Italian site and the
transfer of production to Mexico and
Spain to improve the cost base and
productivity of the business. Looking
forward, our programme of increasing
our generic drugs pipeline made good
progress with a further six drug master
files registered.
Impact Chemicals (16% of total sales)
has suffered over several years from
aggressive competition and sub-optimal
assets. During 2007 we announced the
closure of two facilities within this business;
the Hull plant of Holliday Pigments and
the German plant of James Robinson.
Both plant closures are running to
schedule. In early 2008 we announced 
a restructuring of the William Blythe plant
in Church. We have already seen some 
of the benefit of these actions with an
increase in underlying profits in 2007 to
£3.0 million from £1.0 million in 2006.
Good cash management remains 
a key priority for the Group. Borrowings
increased modestly, but this was
attributable to the impact of the
strengthening euro on our euro
denominated debt. During the year 
we have focused hard on the effective
management of working capital with
average working capital reducing by 
£6.6 million compared with prior year,
whilst capital expenditure was at similar
levels to 2006. We invested around 
£9.0 million in restructuring, the majority
of which we will recover, when we sell 
the sites and assets we are exiting. 
Polymer Chemicals
We operate 13 factories within four
geographical regions: Europe, Pacific
Rim, Middle East and South Africa. Core
products are water-based Polymers,
both dispersions and latices, polyvinyl
alcohol/acetate and a number of more
specialised products.
2007 was another good year for our
Polymer businesses. Sales volumes 
were at record levels, up 4.3%, with 
sales turnover up 6.7%. Operating profits
were up 6.2% compared to 2006 and
operating margins were sustained at
9.7%. These good results were achieved
against a background of restricted
monomer availability, volatile prices 
and restructuring within some of our 
core markets.
Although the global economy 
looks challenging, we are cautiously
optimistic about the Group’s
performance in 2008.
Business review
Chief Executive’s report Yule Catto & Co plc 
Annual report and accounts 2007

Business review
Chief Executive’s report continued
Whilst the product portfolio and the
geographic coverage of our operations
remained unchanged, the main growth 
of our activities occurred in Asia. In
Kluang, Malaysia, in order to meet the
growing sales demand, we were able to
bring forward our latex expansion plans 
in two phases with a 33% increase in
capacity in April and a further expansion
in November, effectively increasing 
the installed capacity by circa 60%
compared to 2006. Concurrently, the
Mouscron, Belgium dispersion plant 
was subject to a major de-bottlenecking
project which was completed in late 
2007 increasing the dispersion capacity
of the site by 30%. In addition, minor 
de-bottlenecking took place on the latex
plant in Langelsheim, Germany. In the
USA we initiated dispersion manufacture
under a toll manufacturing arrangement
with a local polymeriser.
These enhancements in capacity 
are already being effectively used and
further production capacity expansion 
is planned for 2008. Nevertheless,
maintaining the excellent growth seen
over the past few years was a difficult
challenge in 2007 . Polymer producers
generally had to endure repeated
interruptions in raw material supplies 
and increases in all major monomer
costs. The industry was characterised 
by feedstock shortages, which in turn
affected the supply lines of all our top 
ten raw materials. Many of our suppliers
called force majeure as they either were
unable to get the necessary feedstock
volumes or they experienced significant
plant outages. This situation was not
helped by the cost of oil, the backbone 
of the feedstock supply, which increased
69% during the year. 
As a result we worked hard to reflect
these costs in the market place.
However, we hope that the additional
global capacity for a number of
monomers planned for commissioning 
in the fourth quarter of 2008 and
throughout 2009 will alleviate the tight
raw material supply and allow input
prices to ease in due course.
For Polymer Division this restricted
monomer supply and volatile raw 
material pricing together with continued
restructuring of some of our core markets
encouraged us to advance our product
development programmes to stimulate
demand. In 2007 we widened our nitrile
latex, dispersions and polybutadiene
product portfolios, whilst at the same
time developing complementary products
to sell alongside our core latex, dispersion
and polyvinyl alcohol activities.
Synthetic Latex
Throughout 2007 the European latex
market was subject to further customer
rationalisation, particularly in the large
commodity markets such as paper. 
Our business, whilst experiencing some
disturbance from this restructuring,
remains speciality orientated. We were
able to increase sales despite a number
of our main markets not growing as
customers sought to manufacture in
other parts of the world. The market for
our synthetic nitrile latex grew significantly
as a result of the greater use of synthetic
rubber gloves in the health and semi-
medical markets, and we were able 
to benefit from this through the newly
commissioned capacity at our Kluang
factory in Malaysia. 
Expanding our operations in Asia remains
a key part of Polymer Division’ s strategy
and in 2008 we expect the momentum 
to continue with increases in both latex
and dispersion capacity planned.
Dispersions
The dispersion market unfortunately
experienced the worst of the raw material
volatility. However, with the advantage 
of dispersion production in all our 
regional activities, combined with good
technical support and continued product
development, we were able to maintain
supply and service to all our customers.
As a result, we gained market share and
are able to report record dispersion
volumes whilst retaining our market
leadership in the UK, South Africa, 
the Middle East and Malaysia.
Specialities
The Group manufactures a variety of
speciality polymer chemicals, including:
Polyvinyl Alcohol
T o maintain our status as the world’ s
leading supplier of low hydrolysis
polyvinyl alcohol to the PVC industry, 
we have changed the profile of our
technical package to meet the ongoing
demand of the PVC resins industry. In so
doing we have added new products to
the range specifically designed for the
technological and geographic changes
which have occurred in the manner and
location in which PVC is produced. As a
result, the Polymer Division is now not
only able to supply its well established
primary and secondary PVC stabilisers,
but has added newly developed grades
alongside supplementary polymers 
used in the polymerisation of PVC.

Liquid Polybutadiene
In 2007 sales of liquid polybutadiene 
were at a record level and 10.1% higher 
in tonnes compared to 2006. The
expansion of the production facilities 
in 2006 provided the capacity to develop
sales and in 2007 the geographic portfolio
now includes Asia and the USA. A further
expansion of production is planned 
for 2008.
Alkyds and Polyester
Our resin business operates from 
the Kluang, Malaysia site with sales
predominantly in South East Asia. Sales
this year have been at record levels (8.6%
and 16.2% higher than 2006 for alkyds
and polyester respectively). This is a
notable achievement considering the
significant increase in raw material prices
which always gives rise to fluctuations 
in demand. Our excellent service and
product quality have enabled this
significant growth.
Pharma Chemicals
2007 sales were at a similar level to those
in 2006. However sales in the second 
half were reduced as a consequence 
of order phasing. We continued to make
progress on our filings of Drug Master
Files (DMF’ s) and six DMF’ s were filed 
in 2007 . Following a thorough review 
a decision was made at the mid year 
to close our Italian plant and transfer a
number of products to Spain and Mexico
to underpin our future competiveness
and profitability.
In our Spanish plants, sales were solid
with volumes at their highest level for a
number of years. This was supported by
strong sales of enteric coated Omeprazole
pellets following the approval of our 
in-house manufacturing capacity late 
in 2006. Pantoperazole was launched 
in Spain at the back end of the year and
over the next few years our partner will 
be rolling sales out in Europe as the
patent expires in various European
countries. Our other anti-ulcer franchises
did particularly well, including Ranitidine.
Our anti-bacterial, Ciprofloxacine, sold
well in Europe with a number of customers
improving their market share. A number
of new products were introduced at the
pilot plant level to support approvals in 
a number of European markets and the
USA. We continue to move products 
out of the pilot plant into mainstream
production, allowing us to develop further
new products. Our Spanish pilot plant is
fully loaded until the second half of 2008
for both development and customer 
specific products. 
Pricing pressure was heightened by the
dollar/euro exchange rate and increased
raw material costs for all producers,
including the Chinese and Indian
competition. A marketing strategy was
implemented in the last quarter of the
year to increase prices and restore
margins going forward.
Our Mexican plant had its best year 
in sales and operating profit for the last
ten years. The results were achieved 
by a combination of much improved
volumes of intermediates and Active
Pharmaceutical Intermediates (API’ s), 
as well as the launch of Zolpidem in the
USA, following patent expiry. A number 
of generic franchises in the anti-parasitic,
anti-fungal and arthritic field saw good
growth in sales to both Europe and the
USA with several key generic customers
launching products. It was pleasing to
note that this growth came from products
that Uquifa launched in 2003/4 and have
been awaiting regulatory approvals in
various markets. Our investment in
obtaining regulatory approvals is key 
to our success and goes on apace. 
The pilot plant was partially upgraded 
to help in the number of filed DMF’ s. 
The relationship between the Mexican
peso and the dollar meant margins 
were not unduly undermined. However,
as in Spain, the increased cost of raw
materials was of concern and in the last
quarter the same marketing strategy on
selling prices was rolled out in Mexico.

The combination of lower pricing and
euro/dollar exchange meant margins 
in Italy were significantly lower than in
previous years. After a thorough review,
we announced the closure of the main
manufacturing plant in Italy. A number of
products are being transferred to Spain
and Mexico and regulatory approval is
currently being sought. This transfer will
be complete in 2008. At the same time,
following the announcement of the
closure of the James Robinson, Dieburg
site in Germany, a number of additional
pharmaceutical products are currently
being transferred to Spain. Approval of
the level 5 high containment facility was
obtained and production of a cytotoxic
product for a large pharmaceutical
company has already commenced.
We also announced our intention 
of constructing a greenfield site in 
China to underpin our raw material and
intermediate position. We continue 
to make progress on this and the final
selection of the site is nearing completion.
Impact Chemicals
Impact Chemicals Division comprises: 
• James Robinson manufacturing hair,
photochromic and other dyes; 
• William Blythe manufacturing iodine
and metal salts; 
• Holliday Pigments manufacturing
ultramarine pigments;
• Oxford Chemicals manufacturing 
high impact flavour chemicals; and 
• PFW manufacturing aroma chemicals. 
2007 was a year of improving financial
performance, but one which again
presented the Division with a number 
of significant commercial and 
operational challenges. 
Sales for the year were below prior 
year as we focused on producing 
and selling higher margin products. 
In the first half of 2007 , it became 
clear that the market and operational
challenges in some of our businesses
continued to inhibit the speed of 
turn-round of the Impact Division. 
After extensive review, this led to the
announcement and implementation 
of selective restructuring to deliver 
the required financial improvements.
Consequently, the Division announced
that it would concentrate the manufacture
of all Ultramarine at its Comines site in
France, with the closure of operations 
at Holliday Pigments in Hull. This closure
was completed in the fourth quarter 
on schedule. The transfer to Comines
has gone smoothly with the business
showing greatly improved financial
performance in the fourth quarter. 
In the third quarter, an announcement 
was made on the closure of James
Robinson’ s Dieburg site in Germany. 
This reflected the decline of the James
Robinson photographic business and
continued pricing pressure from Chinese
competition. The site is scheduled 
to close at the end of 2008 and is a 
key step for James Robinson in the
ongoing refocus of its portfolio to 
higher value applications.
Whilst these changes were being
progressed, the Division continued to
focus on supporting its leading position 
in many markets. Of note is the continued
development of Oxford’ s “natural flavours”
strategy which will result in a number 
of new materials coming to the market 
in 2008. This strategy is enhanced by 
the establishment of a new three year
research project focused on Sulphur
chemistry, supported by the UK
Government T echnology Strategy Board
(TSB). At PFW the fourth quarter saw the
introduction of new “musk” materials 
to support the expansion of polycyclic
musk usage in the fragrance industry.
William Blythe successfully opened its
new Iodine facility which will benefit the
sales of higher value products such as
SMP and Periodic Acid. Key materials
used in the silk screen printing and 
silicon wafer industry.
Overall 2007 , can be seen as one 
of good progress for the Division. Whilst
difficult decisions had to be taken, new
opportunities have opened up in several
businesses, and we have made strides 
in building greater sustainability into the
Division’ s financial performance.

Income Statement – Underlying
Performance
T otal sales increased by 4.2% to 
£580.6 million, driven by good volume
growth in Polymers. Turnover remains
predominately within Europe with some
56% of sales (2006 58%). However we
continue to make progress in other parts
of the world, in particular Asia, assisted 
by ongoing investment in the Malaysian
facility. Asian sales now account for 26%
of the business (2006 23%) and will
continue to increase with our commitment
to further expansion in 2008.
With the international nature of the
business, movements in foreign currency
exchange rates can affect the value of
transactions made by the Group where
pricing of our products is in non domestic
currency, and in the translation of results
from overseas subsidiaries. With regard
to the former, the Group generally hedges
transactions once entered into and in
addition, where exchange rates continue
to be adverse, we look to increase sale
prices or sell in domestic currency. The
latter is mainly influenced by the euro,
with the Malaysian ringgit and South
African rand becoming more significant.
In 2007 , the average rate for the euro 
was comparable to 2006 so translation
effects were not significant.
Average borrowings for the period were
nearly 2% lower than 2006, though the
net interest charge of £11.5 million was
1% higher than last year. World interest
rates have drifted up during the year, 
but a large proportion of the Group’ s
exposure is hedged, which has softened
the adverse impact.
The underlying tax rate of 22% reflects 
the benefits of pioneer status on our
investment in Malaysia and the settlement
of some prior year tax positions. This is an
improvement on the prior year rate of 28%.
Profit attributable to minority interests 
has increased to £1.7 million due to the
success of the Revertex operations in the
Far East, which has a 30% shareholding
external to the Group.
The resultant underlying earnings per
share of 17 .3 pence is a year-on-year
increase of 18%. A final dividend of 
5.7 pence per share has been proposed
by the Board, which would take the full
year payout to 9.6 pence, an increase 
of 3.2%. Underlying dividend cover is 
1.8 times.
Income Statement – Special Items
T o provide a clearer indication of the
Group’ s underlying performance, a
number of special items, are shown 
in a separate column of the Income
Statement. Special Items includes; 
• During the year we announced the
closure of our Italian Pharma plant,
Holliday Pigments Hull site and the
James Robinson manufacturing plant
in Dieburg, Germany. Site closure 
and run down costs for these activities
are disclosed in special items. This
includes the write down of fixed assets
on these sites as appropriate.
• We utilise various cross currency 
and interest rate swaps for hedging
purposes, which involve maturities of
up to twelve years. IFRS requires that
where the strict requirements of IAS 39
are not met, changes in the market
value should be recognised annually in
the income statement. However, such
financial instruments are maintained by
the Group for the length of the contract
and over their lifetime have a fair value
of nil. Hence, the notional annual
adjustment is segregated from the
underlying performance.
• As a result of the actions taken 
in 2007 to reduce the cost of the
Group’ s UK pension scheme, the
Group recognised an exceptional 
profit of £10.8 million (2006 £nil), 
being the reduction of accrued 
benefits arising from these actions.
This profit is shown in special items.

Pensions
In the main UK defined benefit pension
scheme the majority of investments are in
equities. Whilst equity markets delivered
positive returns during the year, the actual
return of 3.7% fell below the expected
return. The yield on AA bonds increased
significantly during the year, which has
reduced liabilities, and action taken by
the Group to manage employee benefits
further reduced liabilities by £10.8 million.
The overall effect of these changes was a
significant reduction in the net balance
sheet liability to £33.6 million for this
scheme. 
IFRS
On an unadjusted IFRS basis, Group
revenue increased by £13.9 million to
£565.6 million reflecting good growth 
in Polymer Chemicals partly offset by a
reduction in Impact Division following the
2006 restructuring. Profit before taxation
at £21.5 million was £7 .9 million higher
than the previous period, of which 
£3.0 million relates to a better trading
performance with the remainder being 
a reduction in the special items.
Borrowings 
Net underlying borrowings, adjusted 
for the mark-to-market effect of
derivatives, are slightly up on to last 
year at £170.8 million, due to the impact
of a stronger euro on the Group’ s euro
denominated debt, which resulted in 
an increase of £5.6 million.
In 2006 we reported a year of increased
capital expenditure, following a number
of years of lower capital investment. 
This has continued in 2007 as we have
invested in expanding the Malaysia nitrile
facility. A similar level of investment in
2008 will be directed at further capacity
expansion and various upgrades in
process efficiency. 
Overall, the programme of restructuring
the Impact Chemicals and Pharma
Divisions is expected to be broadly cash
neutral. However the timing of closure
events has initially resulted in a net cash
outflow across 2006 and 2007 , with 
a gross spend of £9.0 million in 2007 . 
This was partially offset by sale proceeds
of £2.4 million from associated assets,
mainly the sale of James Robinsons’
Huddersfield site. Further sales are
expected in 2008 and beyond, including
the Hapton site (William Blythe), the
Dieburg site (James Robinson) and 
the Uquifa Italy site.
In a period of rising raw materials cost,
combined with good volume growth 
in many of our businesses, upward
pressure on working capital becomes
more acute. However we have focused
very hard on this area during 2007 and
despite increased input costs, we have
reduced working capital during the year
by £4.0 million.

Corporate Social Responsibility report 
Overview
Yule Catto made excellent progress on both its safety and its
environmental performance in 2007 . The Group had the lowest
ever number of significant accidents resulting in its lowest ever 
over 3-day accident rate and the lowest ever overall lost time
accident rate. The Group improved its performance on all of its
major sustainable development targets, including improving
energy efficiency by 7% and reducing water usage by 8.6%. 
Since 2000 energy usage per tonne of production is down by
nearly one quarter and water consumption is down by 44%. 
Over the same period, the production of acid gases is down 
by over 90%, to just 7% of the quantity produced in 2000.
Regrettably, despite excellent overall progress, an employee
died whilst engaged in a routine cleaning operation at our
Mexico site in August. The Company extends its sincere
sympathy to the family. We will ensure that all relevant lessons
are learnt from this tragic event.
Our Policy Commitments
Yule Catto is committed to the principles and practice of the
global chemical industry’ s Responsible Care
®
programme. 
All sites are expected to adhere to these principles and the
Group SHE (Safety, Health and Environment) audit programme
is designed to confirm compliance. In 2005, the Group committed
its support to the UK Chemical Industries Association’ s Sustainable
Development guiding principles. These represent a significant
element of Yule Catto’ s SHE commitments, and define a route
to a safe and sustainable chemical industry, with open reporting
of our performance and full respect for the people and
communities amongst whom we work.
Highlights and achievements during 2007
At the beginning of 2007 , Yule Catto set itself a demanding 
4% target for energy reduction during the year. This was done 
in response to the rising importance placed on global warming
and in recognition of the key, but not exclusive role, industry 
will play in dealing with this problem. This new energy reduction
target went alongside the existing Sustainable Development
targets for the other key measures of sustainability, including
water use, atmospheric acidification, global warming and
hazardous waste.
Group companies rose to this challenge and managed to
reduce energy consumption per tonne by some 7% in 2007 ,
making a cumulative reduction of 23.6% since 2000. There
were also notable improvements in other Sustainable
Development performance measures, including a 40%
reduction in the discharge of acid gases and a 16% reduction 
in the disposal of hazardous waste to landfill. The Company’ s
accident performance for 2007 was its best ever and we
experienced some 30% less accidents than in 2006. 
We have continued to improve our resources and processes 
to support our drive for improvement in our SHE performance.
• The Group SHE & Sustainable Development policies were
revised, approved and issued by the Chief Executive;
• The Group SHE team was strengthened to provide better
support to individual Group companies, Group SHE audit
procedures were updated; and a two year programme for 
the implementation of new SHE standards was initiated;
• A Group wide Process Safety Management system 
was introduced;
• Standard Hazop software has been adopted across 
the company.
Managing Safety and Environmental Performance
Yule Catto strongly believes that Safety is a primary
responsibility for managers and employees at all levels 
in the company and that safety should be managed in the 
same way as the rest of our business objectives. Senior
managers have SHE targets as part of their annual objectives
and bonuses. Management meetings always discuss SHE
matters, as the first agenda item.
The Group has two main management processes 
in relation to SHE:
• We have information gathering systems to record 
and summarise all accidents, incidents and near misses
which occur across the Group. The same system is used 
to monitor the Company’ s response to accidents and
incidents, ensuring that they are properly investigated,
appropriate lessons are learned, and the necessary 
remedial actions are put in place.
• We measure and report the key indicators of SHE
performance monthly. These are discussed at all levels of
management and at site SHE committees. The Group-wide
report is discussed as the first agenda item at Yule Catto’ s
Executive Committee meetings and the reports are drawn
together to provide a quarterly input to the Yule Catto Board. Yule Catto & Co plc

Corporate Social Responsibility report continued
Safety and Accident performance
Like most companies in the UK, Yule Catto uses a headline
measure of the rate of over 3 day lost time accidents to measure
Safety Performance. Across the European Union, these are
generally the accidents which have to be reported to the
appropriate regulatory authorities. On this measure the Group
made a significant improvement to its accident rate in 2007
reducing the rate to 0.37 accidents per 100,000 hours worked.
This is an improvement of approximately 30% compared to
2006 and represents the Company’ s best year ever. T o put 
this in context, 100,000 hours, very broadly, represents a
working lifetime.
Reportable lost time accident frequency rates
We also measure all lost time accidents. Again, 2007
represented the Company’ s best ever year with a frequency 
rate of 0.53 per 100,000 hours. This is well below the 
European average reported in 2006, as measured by CEFIC
(The European Chemical Industry Council), of 0.67 accidents
per 100,000 hours worked.
The number of significant, reportable safety incidents remains 
at a very low level.

Audit programme
T o support our objectives of improvement in SHE performance,
we have an active SHE audit programme. This programme 
was upgraded during 2007 to deliver a clear view of current
performance. It also now enables sites to identify areas for
improvement more clearly and, over a period of time allow 
sites to track their performance improvement. 
Asset protection, Process Safety Management 
and Insurance inspections
Yule Catto losses from fire or process safety related incidents
remain at a low level. This is achieved by both our own internal
management and SHE audit processes; and by biennial risk
audits carried out by our global property and business risk
insurers. These external audits produce recommendations
which are discussed within the businesses and then assessed
against their practicality and cost-effectiveness. This process 
of working in partnership with our insurers creates transparency,
which in turn helps Yule Catto achieve competitive pricing for 
its global risk insurance.
REACH
The European Parliament passed the Regulation, Evaluation
and Assessment of Chemicals regulations (REACH) in December
2006 and the regulations went through the rest of the European
Union’ s legislative stages rapidly thereafter to become EU law in
early 2007 . These regulations require all chemicals produced or
used in Europe of more than 1 tonne per year to be registered
over the next 11 years. The registration process will involve 
a risk assessment of the chemical for both human and
environmental effects. The depth of the risk assessment, 
and the date by which it is required to be presented to the 
new European Chemicals Agency, will be determined by the
tonnage made and used, unless the chemical is of high concern
in which case the date for registration will be brought forward.
Although the regulations have been finalised, a great deal of
work is still being done by both regulators and industry on the
interpretation and implementation of REACH. 
Before the start of full registration, which will be from the
beginning of 2009, there will be a pre-registration period
between 1 June 2008 and 1 December 2008. During this 
time all chemicals which manufacturers or importers intend 
to continue to place on the European market after 1 December
2008 are to be pre-registered. Any chemical which is not 
pre-registered by 1 December 2008 will not be allowed to 
be sold or used inside the EU without going through a full
registration procedure. Yule Catto will ensure that all our
products and raw materials are pre-registered as required.
Group companies have been preparing for the implementation
of REACH for several years. We have brought in independent
consulting support to work with our Group companies to help
ensure we remain on track for full compliance. The first impact
of REACH has been a sharp increase in customer and supplier
enquiries about the chemicals we sell, manufacture and use.  Yule Catto & Co plc 
Annual report and accounts 2007 
17
Although REACH is a new requirement, it can be seen as 
an extension of Yule Catto’ s long-term commitment to the
principles of Product Stewardship. We have expert staff in
Group companies who are able to provide safety advice on 
our products and their application to our customers. These
experts are active in industry groups, at a UK and European
level, spreading good practice and ensuring that Yule Catto
Companies’ advice is comparable to the best in our field.
Sustainable Development Performance
Report 2007
Managing Our Environmental Responsibilities
As signatories to the UK Chemical Industries Association’ s
Sustainable Development Goals, the Yule Catto Group 
is committed to a 10 year programme of reducing its
environmental impact. The base year for this commitment 
was 2000, with targets for significant improvements by 2010.
Progress across Group companies is such that on all the
targets, Yule Catto has already achieved the reductions 
required to comply with the 2010 goals: indeed current
performance levels are between 13% to 87% better than 
the relevant individual 2010 targets. However, we will 
continue to set annual objectives for yet further improvement.
T o achieve this each site has specific targets. A number 
of these targets have required very significant capital investment
– for example the Flue Gas Desulphurisation plant at Holliday
Pigments, Comines – and the environmental benefits of this
investment are now flowing through to Group performance. 
All the targets are set on a per production tonne basis and the
graphs reproduced below show how the Group’ s performance
has improved over the last 7 years (since the baseline year 
of 2000).
Energy
Yule Catto has already passed its 2010 target for energy
reduction per tonne of product. Yule Catto set a target of 4%
reduction in energy in 2007 and this target has been set again
for 2008 when a further 4% reduction is aimed for.

Global warming
The threat of global warming has become a major issue around
the world over the last few years and its importance increased
further in 2007 with new European and Global targets being set.
The Group’ s global warming burden is expressed as tonnes of
carbon dioxide equivalent and this was reduced by 6.3% in
2007 , giving a cumulative reduction of 34% since 2000. 
Global warming Burden
Atmospheric Acidification
By the installation of high efficiency flue gas desulphurisation
units at both of the Group’ s ultramarine pigment factories the
release of acidic gases to atmosphere has been reduced by
over 93% compared to 2000, to just 1/8th of the target value 
for 2010. With the closure of the Holliday Pigments factory in
Hull UK, this target will be re-set for 2008 and subsequent
years, but it is certain that the Group will continue to beat the
2010 Sustainable Development target by a comfortable margin.

Water use
Water is an increasingly precious resource worldwide and 
one which is vital for the safe and productive operation of 
the chemical industry. Yule Catto companies use water for,
amongst other things, cleaning process equipment, as a key
constituent in our processes and for cooling chemical reactions
to keep them safe. Water use per tonne of product had already
been reduced by over a third by the end of 2006 and 2007 
has seen a further reduction of 8.6%, bringing the cumulative
reduction since 2000 to 44%. This is already 30% below the
2010 target but the Group has targeted a further 4% reduction
in water use in 2008.
Water Consumption
Waste disposal
The near 50% reduction in hazardous waste disposal seen in
2006 could not be repeated in 2007 but a further very significant
reduction of 16.7% was achieved. This achievement brings the
reduction since 2000 to in excess of 70% and means that the
Group’ s hazardous waste production was less than 40% of the
2010 target. This has been achieved despite a re-classification
of the term “hazardous” as applied to waste in the European
Union. This re-classification had the effect of significantly
increasing the range of wastes that had to be classified as
hazardous and makes the reduction achieved even more striking.

The quantity of non-hazardous waste disposed of to land 
also declined very sharply in 2007 , by nearly 30% compared 
to 2006. As with other targets the reduction since 2000 is very
marked at 45%. (This performance measure does not have 
an agreed industry-wide reduction target.)
Non-hazardous waste disposal to land
Environmental incidents 
The number of environmental incidents remains at a very 
low level, and nearly all are minor excursions above permitted
discharges limits. It is, of course, the policy of all Yule Catto
companies to remain within discharge limits at all times but
these minor excursions, whilst regrettable, have not produced
any long-term, noticeable environmental damage. 
Reportable environmental incidents
One notable incident which illustrates this was related to
the extremely heavy rainfall experienced in parts of the UK 
in June 2007 . This downpour, in which the rain expected in 
a month fell in little over an hour, overwhelmed the drains at 
our Stallingborough site. The torrential rain then carried material
being discharged to the site’ s effluent treatment system over 
the site boundary and into the surrounding fields. Because 
of the quantity of rain, the dilution was very high and the water,
whilst mildly discoloured, caused absolutely no environmental
damage. The UK Environment Agency, whilst confirming that
the event was reportable to them, agreed that no environmental
damage had occurred.

Environmental KPIs
The UK Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) published guidelines for reporting environmental key
performance indicators in 2006. The three key measures suggested were energy use, waste disposal and water consumption. 
Yule Catto has reported on these indicators for a number of years, but not in the suggested format. T o aid transparency of reporting
environmental performance the data for the period 2005-2007 has been re-cast into the suggested format and is reproduced

The table shows the striking progress the Group has made on its environmental targets over the last 3 years. At a time when
production has risen by 11.7%, absolute emissions of Carbon Dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas, have fallen by 11.4%. 
This is due to the increased energy efficiency our production facilities have been able to achieve: nearly 20% less energy per
tonne of production and an absolute reduction of 10.5%.
A similar picture emerges with water, where absolute usage is down by 10.6% and by 20% judged on the per production tonne
measure. Waste, hazardous and non-hazardous, is also down sharply. Hazardous waste fell by over 25% between 2005 and 
2007 , and non-hazardous waste fell by 48%.  Yule Catto & Co plc

12 March 2008 Corporate governance 
This compliance statement is produced in relation to the
Combined Code on Corporate Governance (“the Code”) which
was published in June 2006 by the Financial Reporting Council.
Statement of Compliance
The company considers that it has complied throughout the
financial year ended 31 December 2007 with the provisions 
set out in Section 1 of the Code.
Application of the Code
The main and supporting principles of Section 1 of the 
Code were applied as follows:
The Board
Operation of the Board
The activities of the company are controlled by the Board 
which comprises two executive directors and nine non-
executive directors. The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive
are clearly divided between Mr A E Richmond-Watson who
heads the Board in his capacity as non-executive Chairman 
and Mr A M Whitfield who has responsibility for the running of
the company’ s business as Chief Executive. The non-executive
directors all have wide business and boardroom experience
gained in a broad range of business sectors.
The Board has reserved to itself a schedule of matters which
includes setting long term objectives for the Group and the
strategies to be employed in achieving them, setting policies 
in the areas of safety, health and the environment, recruitment
and employment, risk management and treasury and, subject
to materiality thresholds, decisions on the raising of capital,
financial commitments, capital expenditure, acquisitions and
disposals and the prosecution, defence and settlement 
of litigation.
The Board meets quarterly to review current and projected
performance and to determine strategic issues. The directors
receive in advance full information on all matters to be
discussed at Board meetings as well as a detailed quarterly
review of performance prepared by the Chief Executive. The
Board has established Audit, Nomination and Remuneration
committees which are discussed below.
In addition arrangements are made each year for the Board 
to visit up to two of the Group’ s operational sites and meet 
local management. Ad hoc site visits are facilitated for 
individual non executive directors on request.
The Board has delegated to the Chief Executive responsibility
for the development and preparation of the business plan for 
the Group and the annual Group budget for recommendation to
the Board. As the senior executive director, the Chief Executive
is responsible for all aspects of day to day operational control 
of the Group and execution of the Group strategy. The Chief
Executive has established and chairs an Executive Committee
(whose other members are the divisional chief executives, the
Finance Director, the Deputy Finance Director and the Company
Secretary) to assist him in the performance of his duties and
which meets once a month. The Chairman receives the minutes
of the Executive Committee and all directors receive a monthly
trading summary and commentary.

Board membership and balance
The Chairman, Chief Executive and senior independent 
director are identified on page 21. The chairmen and members
of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration committees are
identified below.
The Board met on four occasions in 2007 . All Board and
Committee meetings were fully attended during 2007 except 
for the Board meetings held in March, August and December
when Dato’ Seri Lee Oi Hian was unable to attend.
The Board considers the following non-executive directors 
to be independent in accordance with the provisions of the
Code: Dr A A Dobbie, Mr R H Hunting, Mr J K Maiden, 
Mr C J Williams and Mr P S Wood.
Induction and training
Induction arrangements are in place in order to ensure 
new directors receive a full formal and tailored induction 
on appointment. The skills and knowledge of Board members 
are updated by briefings provided by the company’ s internal
resources and materials and seminars offered by external advisers.
Performance evaluation
Performance evaluations of the Board, its committees and 
its directors were carried out in the last year by the following
internal processes:
• an assessment of the performance of individual non-
executive directors is carried out by the Chairman through 
a rolling programme of one-to-one discussions using
performance evaluation questions as the centrepiece 
for those discussions. Every non-executive director is
assessed in this way once a year;
• the performance of the executive directors was reviewed in
September 2007 at a meeting of the non-executive directors
chaired by the Chairman;
• a meeting of the non-executive directors (in the absence 
of the Chairman) chaired by the senior independent director
was held in December 2007 to evaluate the performance 
of the Chairman, taking into account the views of the
executive directors; and
• the Board and its Committees carry out an annual self
assessment of performance led by the Chairman and the
chairman of each committee respectively. The results of
assessment questionnaires completed by those chairmen
were reviewed by the relevant committees and the Board 
and were shared with and discussed by the Board as a 
whole at its meeting in December 2007 .
Non-executive directors are appointed for three year terms.
Those non-executive directors who have served longer than
nine years on the Board are subject to annual re-election by
shareholders with other directors subject to re-election at 
least every three years. Yule Catto & Co plc 
Annual report and accounts 2007

Shareholder communications
Dialogue with institutional investors is conducted on a regular
basis by the Chief Executive and the Finance Director and
meetings take place following the announcement of interim and
full year results and at other times according to circumstances.
The Board has adopted a set of shareholder communication
principles in order to ensure that Board members develop an
understanding of the views of the Group’ s major shareholders.
These principles require the Chairman to be present with 
the Chief Executive and the Finance Director at sufficient
shareholder presentations and meetings so that he fully
understands the issues and concerns of major shareholders.
The Chairman reports on shareholder relations at each Board
meeting. Communications with shareholders relating to
corporate governance matters are conducted by the Chairman
with the assistance of the chairmen of the Audit, Nomination
and Remuneration committees. Written reports on all meetings
between non executive directors and institutional shareholders
and their representative bodies are presented to the Board 
at the first opportunity following such meetings as is all
correspondence with them.
The Board seeks to encourage participation of all shareholders,
and in particular private investors, at the company’ s Annual
General Meeting and endeavours to ensure all Board members
are in attendance. In particular , the chairmen of the Remuneration,
Audit and Nomination Committees are available to 
answer questions.
The company makes use of its website www.yulecatto.com 
to communicate with its shareholders where it publishes interim
and full year results, company announcements, share price 
and corporate governance and other investor information.
Board Committees
The Board has formally established Audit, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees each with their own terms 
of reference which set out their respective roles and the
authority delegated to them by the Board. Copies of the 
terms of reference are available upon request from the
Company Secretary and can also be downloaded from 
the company’ s website.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprised Mr P J Welch (Chairman), 
Mr R H Hunting, Mr P S Wood and Mr C J Williams until 
16 May 2007 . Thereafter it comprised Mr P S Wood (Chairman),
Mr R H Hunting and Mr C J Williams until 30 August 2007 
when Mr J K Maiden joined it. Mr Welch was and Mr Wood 
and Mr Maiden are considered by the Board to have “recent 
and relevant financial experience” for the purposes of Provision
C.3.1 of the Code. The Committee has established a detailed
remit regarding the application of financial reporting and internal
control principles. The Finance Director and senior members of
his department attend meetings of the Committee as part of the
review of the Group’ s interim and final statements prior to their
submission to the Board. The Committee meets periodically
with the company’ s auditors to discuss the adequacy of the
Group’ s financial management, internal controls and information
systems. The Committee’ s remit includes the review of the cost
effectiveness, independence and objectivity of the auditors
(including the extent of non-audit services and fees payable 
to the auditors) which is carried out and discussed with the
auditors on a periodic basis. With regard to seeking to ensure
the independence and objectivity of the auditors, the Audit
Committee’ s policy is to avoid the auditors providing services 
in areas which may create or be perceived to create a conflict 
of interest. Accordingly, other than in circumstances where 
time constraints render it impractical or assignments are 
of a minor nature, the auditors are not invited to tender or
propose for services of the following nature: corporate finance,
legal, information technology and systems, recruitment or
remuneration, accounting, internal audit or control, acquisition
due diligence, valuations or appraisals, actuarial or general
business consulting. In addition the auditors have been
requested not to provide services to executive directors 
or senior executives. Non-executive directors are required 
to disclose any relationship they have with the auditors.
The Group does not have an internal audit function. 
The Committee has reviewed this during the year and has
concluded that there are in place appropriate procedures 
for assuring the integrity and effectiveness of the Group’ s
governance, risk management and control processes. 
The Board has accepted this recommendation.
The current auditors were first appointed in 2002 and their
appointment was reviewed by the Committee in 2006. Details 
of audit and non-audit fees paid to them in 2007 are set out in
note 6 on page 48. Non-audit fees principally relate to taxation
advice. The Board accepts the Committee’ s recommendation
that the current auditors be proposed for re-appointment at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The Committee met formally three times during 2007 and 
the Chairman of the Committee had regular dialogue with the
auditors during the course of the year. As well as complying with
the terms of its remit during the year the Committee reviewed 
its remit and, with the approval of the Board, updated it.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprised Mr R H Hunting
(Chairman), Mr P J Welch and Mr P S Wood until 16 May 2007 .
Thereafter it comprised Mr R H Hunting (Chairman), Mr P S Wood
and Mr A E Richmond-Watson until 30 August 2007 when 
Mr Richmond-Watson was replaced by Dr A A Dobbie. 
The Committee is responsible for: the regular review of the
structure, size and composition of the Board and the making 
of recommendations with regard to any changes; leading the
process for Board appointments and nominating candidates for
non-executive positions; and considering succession planning.
The Committee led the process for recruiting the Finance Director
and was assisted in this process by an external recruitment
consultancy. The Committee also nominated Dr A A Dobbie 
and Mr J K Maiden for appointment as non-executive directors.
Messrs Dobbie and Maiden were nominated as replacements
on the Board for Dr M J Peagram and Mr P J Welch respectively
following a review of prospective candidates put forward by an
external recruitment consultancy. The Nomination Committee
held two formal meetings during 2007 and a number of informal
discussions and interviews associated with the foregoing
recruitment processes. Corporate governance continued
Remuneration Committee
All matters relating to the Remuneration Committee and
remuneration are covered in the Remuneration Report, 
set out on pages 28 to 32.
Accountability
An explanation of the directors’ responsibility for preparing 
the financial statements, their report that the business is a going
concern and their statement as to disclosure of information 
to the auditors are set out on pages 35 and 23 respectively.
Statements by the auditors about their reporting responsibilities
are set out on pages 36 and 70 respectively. A report on the
approach to internal control is set out below. The directors
endeavour to make the annual report and financial statements
as informative and understandable as possible.
Internal control
The Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility for the Group’ s
system of internal control and sets appropriate policies to
ensure that the Code requirements on internal control are met.
The system of internal control deployed within the Group 
is designed to reduce the risks of failure to meet business
objectives, but these risks cannot be eliminated. The internal
control system adopted can therefore only provide reasonable,
not absolute, assurance about meeting such business
objectives or against material mis-statement or loss.
A process for identifying, evaluating and managing significant
business risks faced by the Group has been in place since 2000.
This has since been built upon so as to embed further the
process into the businesses and to enhance the usefulness of
the relevant processes and information, and has been operated
throughout 2007 and up to the date of approval of the Annual
Report and Accounts, and accords with the Turnbull Guidance.
The system is applied at all material subsidiaries, and a 
“bottom up” risk profile is created by evaluating the information
at business, divisional and Group level.
Individual directors within Yule Catto’ s businesses identify and
assess key risks associated within their area of responsibility
based on formal management information and interaction with
colleagues, customers, suppliers and other parties.
The individual submissions are consolidated, reviewed and
agreed at a board meeting of the subsidiary. A business risk
report is prepared that is closely linked to business strategy 
and takes account of key internal and external factors. Risks 
are prioritised using a common risk matrix, which forms the
basis of a single corporate risk report that is reviewed and
discussed by the Yule Catto Audit Committee.
Yule Catto & Co plc 
Annual report and accounts 2007 
26
The individual business risk reports are formally reviewed at a
board meeting of the subsidiary every six months, out of which 
a revised report is submitted which identifies changes in the 
risk environment.
The process was last reviewed by the Yule Catto Board of
Directors in March 2007 .
The nature of the risks identified as a result of this process
during the year primarily relate to matters of an operational
nature and the most significant of those which faced the 
Group in 2007 are reviewed in the reports of the Chairman, 
Chief Executive and Group Finance Director.
Risks associated with safety, health and the environment are, 
by the nature of the Group’ s business, always of the utmost
concern and the Corporate Social Responsibility Report on
pages 15 to 20 reviews the Group’ s performance in this
connection in 2007 .
The processes which are used by the Board either directly 
or, where appropriate, through the Audit Committee to review
the effectiveness of the internal control system includes 
the following:
• A review of the external audit work plan;
• Consideration of reports from management and external
parties, including the auditors, on the system of internal
financial control and any material control weaknesses;
• Quarterly review of safety, health and environmental
performance;
• Discussion with management of the actions taken on any
possible problem areas for the business identified by Board
members or in the audit report; and
• Consideration of a consolidated risk management report
setting out the main conclusions from the internal control
process.
In addition, the Board:
• Receives copies of the minutes from all Audit Committee
meetings;
• Considers the role of the Group insurance programme;
• Receives regular written and oral reports from management
on all aspects of production, operations, financial and risk
management matters; and
• In compliance with Provision C.2.1 of the Combined Code 
the Board regularly reviews and approves the effectiveness 
of the Group’ s system of internal controls. Yule Catto & Co plc 
Annual report and accounts 2007

Environmental, social and governance matters
In January 2007 the Association of British Insurers (ABI)
published a revised version of its guidelines on responsible
investment disclosure. These guidelines require statements 
on the extent to which environmental, social and governance
matters are taken into account by the Board and identified,
assessed, managed and monitored particularly in relation 
to the risks and opportunities they present to the value of 
the company.
Environmental matters
The maintenance of high standards of environmental 
(together with health and safety) protection is central to the
company’ s business. A separate statement on safety, health
and environmental (SHE) matters has been a feature of the
annual report for a number of years. The Corporate Social
Responsibility Report statement on pages 15 to 20
incorporates the ABI guidelines and includes a report on 
the initiatives the company has adopted regarding 
sustainable development.
Social and ethical matters
The Board takes account of social and ethical matters as part 
of its review of internal control which, by virtue of its approach 
to risk identification, covers areas which encompass social 
and ethical matters.
The Board is conscious of its responsibility to the communities
in which the Group’ s businesses operate and is supportive 
of local initiatives by management.
The Board is also aware of the reputational risk associated 
with social and ethical issues and has a Group wide code 
of business conduct on corruption and anti-competitive
activities. The purpose of this code is to ensure that the Group’ s
employees have a clear understanding of the principles that are
important in these areas when conducting the Group’ s business.
The application of the code is explained to senior management
at regular intervals who are charged with its communication
throughout their businesses. A compliance procedure was
initiated in 2007 involving annual certification by the senior
management of each operating company. A report is made 
to the Audit Committee annually on the code and the
company’ s whistleblowing procedure.
Governance
The Board’ s approach to governance, training of directors 
and identification and assessment of risk is set out above. Directors’ remuneration report
The following report complies with the Directors’ Remuneration
Report Regulations 2002 and satisfies the requirements 
of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and 
the Combined Code on Corporate Governance which was
published in June 2006 by the Financial Reporting Council.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprised Mr P S Wood
(Chairman), Mr P J Welch and Mr C J Williams, until 16 May
2007 . Thereafter it comprised of Mr P S Wood (Chairman), 
Mr R H Hunting and Mr C J Williams until 30 August 2007 when
Dr A A Dobbie and Mr J K Maiden joined and Mr R H Hunting
stood down. The Committee is responsible for determining the
company’ s policy on executive remuneration and the specific
remuneration for the Chairman and each of the executive
directors, including pension rights. The Committee is also
responsible for reviewing the remuneration of senior executives
throughout the Group. The Committee was assisted in its
deliberations on executive directors’ remuneration by Monks,
part of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , (“Monks”) and the Chief
Executive. With the approval of the Remuneration Committee,
Monks was retained by the company and during the year
provided general executive remuneration advice for salary
review purposes and advice on incentives, employer pension
contributions and company car allowances. The Board as a
whole determines the remuneration of the non-executive
directors, including members of the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee met three times during 2007 and
each meeting was fully attended by the Committee’ s members.
Remuneration Policy
Non-executive directors’ remuneration
It is the Board’ s policy to review fees paid to non-executive
directors periodically. A review of non-executive director
remuneration was last carried out in December 2006 with 
the assistance of advice provided by Monks. With effect from 
1 January 2007 non-executive director fees are as follows:
£30,000 pa for those who do not sit on a committee; £33,000
pa for those who do sit on a committee; £36,000 pa for those
who are Committee chairmen. The fees payable to the
Chairman of the Board are £110,000 pa.
Non-executive directors are not eligible to receive awards under
any of the company’ s share schemes or other employee benefit
schemes nor does the company make any contribution to their
pension arrangements.
Executive directors’ remuneration
The company’ s policy for 2007 was and continues to be to
structure executive pay in such a way that key executives may
be recruited, motivated and retained through being offered
remuneration packages that are competitive. For this purpose,
the Committee uses data provided by external independent
surveys relevant to the industry or sector in which each Yule
Yule Catto & Co plc 
Annual report and accounts 2007 
28
Catto subsidiary operates. Whilst not adopting set formulae 
the Committee is also sensitive to the pay and employment
conditions elsewhere in the Group when considering annual
salary increases and total remuneration. The Committee also
has the discretion to consider the company’ s performance on
environmental, social and governance matters when setting 
the remuneration of the executive directors.
The major element of the remuneration package of senior
executives is a competitive basic salary which is reviewed 
with effect from 1 January each year. For executive directors 
this review is conducted with the assistance of an annual
independent survey of salaries at UK industrial and service
companies with a similar profile to the company in terms 
of overseas operations, turnover and market capitalisation. 
The survey presents market guidelines for basic pay and
increases in basic salaries for executive directors in the UK
during the previous twelve months. The Committee then uses
this information to recommend basic salaries for the executive
directors in line with the Board’ s policy of awarding for good
performance a basic salary of approximately the market median
for companies of a similar size and complexity. In addition, 
the Remuneration Committee has overseen the introduction 
of incentives, which are designed to reward the achievement 
of predetermined targets by the individuals concerned. 
These incentives, which were designed in accordance with 
the provisions of Schedule A to the Code, currently comprise
annual cash bonuses and membership of one of two shareholder
approved longer term incentive plans (the “Share Plans”). 
The Committee does not consider that the incentive structure
for senior executives gives rise to environmental, social 
or governance risks by inadvertently motivating 
irresponsible behaviour.
• Annual cash bonuses
The annual cash bonus payment for the executive directors
and senior head office employees is an amount equal to 
a percentage of basic pay calculated by reference to the
annual growth in the company’ s basic earnings per share 
for underlying performance (EPS) after taking account of 
the annual rise in the rate of headline inflation (RPI). For the
maximum bonus to be awarded EPS growth must exceed
RPI plus 10%. For the minimum bonus to be awarded EPS
growth must exceed RPI plus 2.5%. The percentage of basic
pay which will be awarded for performance between these
points is calculated on a straight line basis with no bonus
being awarded if EPS growth is RPI plus 2.5% or less. For
2007 the maximum and minimum percentage of basic pay
awardable to the executive directors upon attainment of the
maximum and minimum performance criteria was 80% and
5% respectively. Yule Catto & Co plc 
Annual report and accounts 2007

For divisional chief executives and managing directors 
of subsidiary companies the annual cash bonus payments
are based on appropriate combinations of profit, cash flow,
working capital and safety and environmental targets. In
2007 the bonuses were subject to limits of 60% and 50% 
of basic pay respectively.
• Share plans
The Share Plans comprise the Performance Share Plan 
(the “Performance Plan”) and the Yule Catto Deferred 
Bonus Plan 2006 (the “Deferred Plan”).
The Performance Plan was introduced in 2002 following
shareholder approval at that year’ s Annual General Meeting
and covers the executive directors, divisional chief executives
and senior head office employees. An award consists of a
right to acquire shares which can be exercised for a nominal
price, subject to the company satisfying performance conditions.
The value of shares awarded under the Performance Plan in
any financial year to any individual currently may not exceed
100% of their annual basic salary. For awards made from
2002 to 2005 performance conditions related to growth in
earnings per share over a three year period. Following review
by the Remuneration Committee and shareholder approval
the earnings per share based performance conditions were
replaced by performance conditions related to relative and
absolute growth in total shareholder return. These conditions
were chosen in order to better align the interests of the
participants in the Performance Plan with shareholders.
Details of performance conditions are set out at pages 33 
to 34. An award which vests in accordance with the former
and current performance conditions will only be exercisable
and allocated shares may only be transferred as to one half
after the third anniversary of the date the award is made and
as to the remaining half after the fourth anniversary of the
date the award is made. In order to further align the interests
of the executive directors and shareholders there are share
ownership requirements in connection with the Performance
Plan requiring the retention of a percentage of the shares
acquired by executive directors until such time as ordinary
shares in the company have been built up to a level
equivalent in value to their annual basic salary.
The Deferred Plan covers managing directors of subsidiary
companies and was introduced following approval at the
2006 Annual General Meeting to replace an expired plan. 
An award takes the form of a deferred bonus structured as 
a deferred right to acquire shares in the company which can
be exercised for a nominal price after three years. The value
of shares subject to an award is determined by reference 
to sustained growth in the profit before tax (set at a minimum 
of 5% per annum) of the company or subsidiary for which the
participant works by reference to a base year determined 
at the date of grant. The value of shares subject to an award
may not exceed 30% of any participant’ s basic salary in any
year. The application of the plan is currently under review.
During 2007 478,173 shares and 9,497 shares were
awarded under the Performance Plan and the Deferred 
Plan respectively.
For the awards made under the Performance Share Plan 
in 2005 the Remuneration Committee decided that as the
results of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2004
have been converted onto an audited IFRS basis that basic
earnings per share for underlying performance should
replace adjusted earnings per share for the purposes 
of comparing performance in 2004 with that for 2007 .
Executive directors are entitled to participate in grants of
options made under the company’ s Savings-Related Share
Option Scheme as and when these are made.
• Pension arrangements
Mr A M Whitfield and Mr D C Blackwood are not members 
of the company pension scheme and receive payments 
from the company to enable them to make their own
arrangements. There are no unfunded pension promises 
or similar arrangements for directors. Mr S V Cummins was 
a member of the company pension scheme. T o the extent
that his benefits from the company pension scheme were
restricted, payments were made to him to enable him 
to make his own arrangements.
• Remuneration details
The amount and components of the directors’ 
remuneration are set out below. No elements of
remuneration other than basic salary are pensionable. 
A payment was made to Mr Whitfield during the year of
£25,000 in respect of compensation for loss of vested
options with his former employer.
• Service contracts
No director other than Mr A M Whitfield and Mr D C Blackwood
has a service contract. Mr Whitfield’ s contract is dated 
22 November 2005, has no unexpired term, provides for 
a notice period of one year and makes no provision for pre-
determined compensation on termination. Mr Blackwood’ s
contract is dated 12 September 2007 , has no unexpired
term, provides for a notice period of three months, increasing
to 12 months after one year’ s service, and makes no provision
for pre-determined compensation on termination. 
Mr S V Cummins resigned as a director on 22 March 2007
and ceased to be employed by the company on 26 July
2007 . Details of his termination payment are set out on page 
34. His service contract comprised a letter of appointment
dated 21 June 1999, had no unexpired term, provided for 
a notice period of one year and made no provision for 
pre-determined compensation on termination.
The Remuneration Committee’ s policy on contracts and
notice periods for executive directors is to seek to comply 
with best practices in corporate governance. Directors’ remuneration report continued
All non-executive directors are appointed in writing. The first
year of each director’ s appointment is shown in the directors’
biographies on page 21. The periods of appointment and the
requirements for re-election of non-executive directors are
provided within the Performance Evaluation section of the
Corporate Governance Report on page 24.
• Non-executive directorships held by the executive directors
Mr Whitfield does not hold any non-executive directorships.
Mr Blackwood is a non executive member of the Cabinet
Office Audit and Risk Committee and is a member of the
Board for Actuarial Standards for which he receives and
retains £4,000 and £10,000 per annum respectively.

(c) Options granted under the Yule Catto Performance Share Plan at 200 pence (total exercise price) conditional upon the following
performance targets:
(i) If Mr S V Cummins was still employed by the company the award made in 2005 to him would have vested in respect of 
100% of the shares only if the company’ s basic earnings per share for underlying performance over a three year period ended
on 31 December 2007 had increased by more than the annual rise in RPI plus 6% per annum compound compared with the
company’ s basic earnings per share for underlying performance for the year ended 31 December 2004 of 13.9p (with basic
earnings per share for underlying performance to be calculated on a consistent basis under IFRS). The award would not have
vested in respect of any shares unless the company’ s earnings per share over the same period has increased by at least the
annual rise in RPI plus 3% per annum compound at which point the award would have vested in respect of 30% of the shares
under the award. The proportion of the award which would have vested for an increase in the company’ s earnings per share
over the same period between these points would have been calculated on a straight line basis. Directors’ interests continued
As Mr Cummins ceased to be employed by the company on 26 July 2007 the performance criteria were tested by reference
to the company’ s earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2006 and were determined by the Remuneration
Committee not to have been met and accordingly the award has lapsed.
(ii) For the award made in 2006 to Mr A M Whitfield it will vest in respect of 50% of the shares only if the company’ s total
shareholder return (TSR) over a three year period, ending on 31 December 2008 has increased by the rise in RPI plus 
15.76% or more compared with the company’ s TSR at the start of the three year performance period. If growth in the
company’ s TSR is equal to the rise in RPI plus 7 .69% over the three year performance period 25% of the shares subject
to the award will vest. Performance between these points will result in between 25% to 50% of the shares vesting on a
straight line basis with lesser performance resulting in no part of the 50% of the shares vesting. Vesting of the other 50% 
of the shares subject to an award will be based on the growth in the Company’ s TSR compared with the growth of the 
FTSE 250 total return index over the same three year period. If the company’ s TSR exceeds the FTSE 250 total return index
by 7 .69% or more over the three year period 50% of the shares subject to an award will vest. If growth in the company’ s TSR
is equal to the FTSE 250 over the three year performance period 5% of the shares subject to the award will vest. Performance
between these points will result in between 5% to 50% of the shares vesting on a straight line basis, with lesser performance
resulting in no part of the 50% of the shares vesting.
The award made in 2006 to Mr S V Cummins was granted subject to the same performance criteria as for Mr Whitfield
however as Mr Cummins ceased to be employed by the company on 26 July 2007 the performance criteria were tested as at
that date and were determined by the Remuneration Committee not to have been met and accordingly the award has lapsed.
(iii) For the award made in 2007 to Mr A M Whitfield it will vest in respect of 50% of the shares only if the company’ s total
shareholder return (TSR) over a three year period, ending on 31 December 2009 has increased by the rise in RPI plus 15.76%
or more compared with the company’ s TSR at the start of the three year performance period. If growth in the company’ s TSR
is equal to the rise in RPI plus 9.27% over the three year performance period 25% of the shares subject to the award will vest.
Performance between these points will result in between 25% to 50% of the shares vesting on a straight line basis with lesser
performance resulting in no part of the 50% of the shares vesting. Vesting of the other 50% of the shares subject to an award
will be based on the growth in the Company’ s TSR compared with the growth of the FTSE 250 total return index over the
same three year period. If the company’ s TSR exceeds the FTSE 250 total return index by 7 .69% or more over the three year
period 50% of the shares subject to an award will vest. If growth in the company’ s TSR is equal to the FTSE 250 over the three
year performance period 5% of the shares subject to the award will vest. Performance between these points will result in
between 5% to 50% of the shares vesting on a straight line basis, with lesser performance resulting in no part of the 50% 
of the shares vesting.
The award made in 2007 to Mr S V Cummins was granted subject to the same performance criteria as for Mr Whitfield
however as Mr Cummins ceased to be employed by the company on 26 July 2007 the performance criteria were tested as at
that date and were determined by the Remuneration Committee not to have been met and accordingly the award has lapsed.
The notional value of unexercised share options is based on the mid-market price of a share on 31 December 2007 of 188.25
pence. During the year the market price ranged between 149 pence and 258.25 pence.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
Financial statements, including adoption 
of going concern basis
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report,
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year. The directors are required 
by the IAS Regulation to prepare the Group financial statements
under IFRSs (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The Group
financial statements are also required by law to be properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that IFRS financial
statements present fairly for each financial year the company’ s
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This
requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions,
other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions
and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses
set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’ s
‘Framework for the preparation and presentation of financial
statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation 
will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs.
However, directors are also required to:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and
understandable information; and 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other
events and conditions on the entity’ s financial position and
financial performance.
The directors have elected to prepare the parent company
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom
Accounting Standards and applicable law). The parent
company financial statements are required by law to give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the company. In preparing
these financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed
and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure
that the parent company financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding
the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other
irregularities.
Other matters
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity
of the corporate and financial information included on the
company’ s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. Independent auditors’ report to the members 
of Yule Catto & Co plc
We have audited the group financial statements of Yule Catto & Co
plc for the year ended 31 December 2007 which comprise the
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Balance Sheet,
the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated
Statement of Recognised Income and Expense and the related
notes 1 to 35. These group financial statements have been
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have
also audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report
that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the parent company 
financial statements of Yule Catto & Co plc for the year 
ended 31 December 2007 .
This report is made solely to the company’ s members, as a body , 
in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
company’ s members those matters we are required to state to
them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. T o the fullest
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility
to anyone other than the company and the company’ s members
as a body , for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the group financial statements
in accordance with applicable law and International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union 
are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the group financial statements in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the group financial
statements give a true and fair view, whether the group financial
statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and
whether the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as
having been audited has been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our
opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent
with the group financial statements. The information given in the
Directors’ Report includes that specific information that is cross
referred from the Business Review section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received 
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration 
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects
the company’ s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority , and we report if it does not. We are not
required to consider whether the board’ s statements on internal
control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the group’ s corporate governance procedures 
or its risk and control procedures.
Yule Catto & Co plc 
Annual report and accounts 2007 
36
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report 
as described in the contents section and consider whether it is
consistent with the audited group financial statements. The other
information comprises only the Directors’ Report, the Chairman’ s
statement, the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report,
the Enhanced Business Review and the Corporate Governance
Statement. We consider the implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies
with the group financial statements. Our responsibilities do not
extend to any further information outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, 
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the group
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the
significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the
preparation of the group financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the group’ s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the group financial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error . In forming our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the group
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the group financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
of the state of the group’ s affairs as at 31 December 2007 
and of its profit for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the
IAS Regulation; 
• the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as
having been audited has been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985; and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with
the group financial statements.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs
As explained in Note 2 to the group financial statements, the group 
in addition to complying with its legal obligation to comply with IFRSs
as adopted by the European Union, has also complied with the
IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
In our opinion the group financial statements give a true and fair
view, in accordance with IFRSs, of the state of the group’ s affairs 
as at 31 December 2007 and of its profit for the year then ended.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
31 December 2007
1 General information
Yule Catto & Co plc is a company incorporated in the United
Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985. The address of the
registered office is given on page 21.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling
because that is the currency of the primary economic environment
in which the Group operates. Foreign operations are included 
in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, 
the following Standards and Interpretations which have not
been applied in these financial statements were in issue but 
not yet effective: 
IFRS 8 Operating segments 
Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements 
– A revised presentation 
Amendments to IAS 23 Borrowing costs
IFRIC 11 IFRS 2: Group and treasury share transactions 
IFRIC 12 Service concession arrangements 
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty programmes
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The limit on a defined benefit asset, 
minimum funding requirements and their interaction
2 Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). The
financial statements have also been prepared in accordance
with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the
Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS
Regulation. The financial statements have been prepared on 
the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain
properties and financial instruments. The principal accounting
policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the 
financial statements of the Company and entities controlled 
by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December
each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the
power to govern the financial and operating policies of an
investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the
year are included in the consolidated income statement from
the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date 
of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments 
are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring 
the accounting policies used into line with those used by 
the Group.
The results of joint ventures are accounted for using 
equity accounting.
Minority interests in the net assets of consolidated 
subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’ s equity
therein. Minority interests consist of the amount of those
interests at the date of the original business combination 
(see below) and the minority’ s share of changes in equity since
the date of combination. Subsequently, any losses applicable 
to the minority interest in excess of the minority interest are
allocated against the interests of the parent except to the extent
that the minority has a binding obligation and is able to make 
an additional investment to cover the losses.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses
are eliminated on consolidation.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the
cost of acquisition over the Group’ s interest in the fair value of
the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate 
or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition. Goodwill 
is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least
annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit 
or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to
each of the Group’ s cash generating units expected to benefit
from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units 
to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment
annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the
unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount
of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets
of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each
asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is
not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity,
the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the
determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition 
to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts
subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill
written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not
been reinstated and is not included in determining any
subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Other intangible assets
Software development and environmental licensing costs
resulting in development of a long term intangible asset are
measured initially at cost and are amortised on a straight-line
basis over their estimated useful lives.
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the 
Group’ s product development is recognised only if all of the
following conditions in IAS 38 are met:
• an asset is created that can be separately identified 
(such as software and new processes);
• it is probable that the asset created will generate future
economic benefits; and
• the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
31 December 2007
2 Significant accounting policies continued
No research or development costs met the criteria for 
required capitalisation under IAS 38 during the year.
Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be
recognised, development expenditure is recognised as 
an expense in the period in which it is incurred. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of
depreciation and any provision for impairment. Except for
freehold land and land grants in Malaysia, which are not
depreciated, the cost or valuation of property, plant and
equipment is depreciated using a straight line basis over 
its expected useful life as follows:
Freehold buildings – 50 years
Leasehold land and buildings – the lesser of 50 years and 
the period of the lease
Plant and equipment – between 3 and 10 years
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying
amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered
an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the
extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not
generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, 
the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell
and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which
the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) 
is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an
expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a
revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated
as a revaluation decrease.
Operating leases
Operating lease payments are expensed on a straight line basis
to the income statement over the term of the relevant lease. Any
benefits received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease
are also spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable
value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable,
direct labour costs and those overheads that have been
incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location 
and condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted average
method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling
price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be
incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is made
for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the
Group’ s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair 
value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest rate method. Appropriate allowances for
estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss
where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. 
Amortised costs
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges,
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and
direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the
profit and loss account using the effective interest method and
are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent
that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value
and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest rate method.
Fair Value through the income statement
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce
exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate movements.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial
instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’ s
policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide
written principles on the use of financial derivatives, as set 
out in note 21 .
Impairment of financial assets
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying
amounts of its financial assets to determine whether there is 
any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment
loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of 
the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the
impairment loss (if any). Yule Catto & Co plc 
Annual report and accounts 2007 
43
Finance costs
Finance costs of debt are recognised in the income statement
over the term of such instruments at a constant rate on the
carrying amount. Finance costs that are directly attributable 
to the construction of tangible fixed assets are capitalised as
part of the cost of those assets in accordance with IAS 23.
Foreign currencies 
In preparing the financial statements of the individual
companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’ s
functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance
sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated
in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing 
on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities
carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies
are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair
value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured
in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not
retranslated.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks,
the Group enters into forward contracts and options (see below
for details of the Group’ s accounting policies in respect of such
derivative financial instruments).
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’ s
overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing
on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are
translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless
exchange rates fluctuate significantly. Exchange differences
arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the
Group’ s translation reserve. Such translation differences are
recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which 
the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition 
of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. The Group has
elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on
acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs as sterling-
denominated assets and liabilities.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently 
payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
T axable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that
are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’ s liability
for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been
enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable 
on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding 
tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred
tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary
differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent
that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the
Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse
in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow
all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected 
to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset
is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income
statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt 
with in equity.
Retirement benefit costs 
The costs of defined benefit contributions to the Group’ s
pension schemes and of augmenting existing pensions are
charged to the income statement on a systematic basis over 
the expected period of benefits from employees’ service.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes
are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Actuarial gains on the defined benefit schemes are recognised
in full in each period in which they occur. They are recognised
outside of profit or loss and are presented in the statement of
recognised income and expense.
The UK defined benefit scheme is funded, with the assets 
of the scheme held separately from those of the Group, in
separate trustee-administered funds. 
For the German schemes, the assets are included within the
assets of the respective companies, as permitted under local
laws. The assets of the other overseas schemes are held
separately from those of the Group.
Provisions
Provisions for warranty costs are recognised at the date of sale
of the relevant products, at the directors’ best estimate of the
expenditure required to settle the Group’ s liability.
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the
Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has
been communicated to affected parties. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
31 December 2007
2 Significant accounting policies continued
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration
received or receivable and represents amounts receivable 
for goods and services provided in the normal course of
business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and
title has passed, where delivery is defined in accordance with
Incoterms 2000.
Share based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based
Payments. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS
2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7
November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2006.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to
certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments 
are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value
determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based
payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting
period, based on the Group’ s estimate of shares that will
eventually vest.
Definitions
Total sales
T otal sales represent the total of revenue from Yule Catto 
& Co plc, its subsidiaries, and its share of the revenue 
of joint ventures.
Operating profit
Operating profit represents profit before financing costs 
and taxation. 
EBITDA
EBITDA is calculated as operating profit before depreciation,
amortisation and non-recurring items.
Non-recurring items
Non-recurring items includes those items that are not directly 
or indirectly associated with the Group’ s trading performance,
which need to be separately disclosed in order to enable
improved understanding of the accounts by users.
Non-recurring items are defined as:
• Profit or loss impact arising from the sale or closure 
of an operation;
• Impairment of non-current assets; and
• Other non-operating or one-off items.
Yule Catto & Co plc 
Annual report and accounts 2007

Special items
The following are disclosed separately in note 3 as special 
items in order to provide a clearer indication of the Group’ s
underlying performance:
• Non-recurring items;
• Mark-to-market adjustments in respect of cross currency 
and interest rate derivatives used for hedging purposes 
where IAS 39 hedge accounting is not applied; and
• Revaluation of US dollar loan notes from the rate of the 
related cross currency swaps to the year end rate.
Net borrowings
Net borrowings represents cash and cash equivalents together
with short and long term borrowings, as adjusted for the effect
of related derivative instruments irrespective of whether they
qualify for hedge accounting.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources 
of estimation uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group’ s accounting policies,
which are described above, management has made the
following judgements that have the most significant effect on 
the amounts to be recognised in the financial statements (apart
from those involving estimations, which are dealt with below).
Impairment of goodwill 
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an 
estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to
which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation
requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected 
to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount
rate in order to calculate present value. The carrying amount 
of goodwill at the balance sheet date was £172.4 million after 
an impairment loss of £58.9 million was recognised during the
transition to IFRS in 2004. Details of the impairment loss
calculation are provided in note 14.
Post retirement benefit obligations
Included in the actuaries’ calculation of the post retirement
benefit obligations are a number of assumptions. These are
shown in detail in note 23.
Current tax liability
When calculating the current tax liability an appropriate estimate
has been made regarding the outstanding items in respect of
previous years with various tax authorities to which the outcome
of discussions is uncertain.
Closure of manufacturing sites
Included in costs to close the manufacturing sites are estimates
for redundancy, decontamination and dismantling costs. These
estimates are based on experience gained in previous closures. Yule Catto & Co plc

10 Deferred taxation
Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of all tax losses and other temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax
assets to the extent that it is probable that these assets will be recovered. No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings
of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures. As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be
payable on them in the foreseeable future.
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities (prior to offset) are shown below:

Deferred tax asset not recognised
Deferred tax has not been recognised where it has been assumed that the deferred tax asset is not recoverable. The amounts 
of deferred tax not recognised at the balance sheet dates are as follows:
2007 2006
£’000 £’000
UK pension liability 9,419 20,786

Other timing differences 2,731 2,780
26,796 40,454
In March 2007 the UK Government announced that they would introduce legislation that would reduce the corporation tax rate to
28% with effect from 1 April 2008. Deferred tax asset not recognised for the UK entities, previously stated at 30% of the temporary
differences, have been restated at 28% of those amounts.

Deferred tax on unremitted overseas earnings
The estimated deferred tax relating to the retained profits held within subsidiary Group companies and not yet remitted, excluding
any mitigation through use of loss relief, double taxation credits and other reliefs is as follows:
2007 2006
£’000 £’000
Deferred tax not recognised 66,965 68,243
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries,
associates and joint ventures was £67 .3 million (2006 £68.8 million). Calculation of the potential deferred tax liability has not been
undertaken as the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. If the temporary differences were to reverse in the future, it is probable that the
majority of the potential tax liability would be covered by tax credits in respect of tax paid locally.

In compiling the above table, the recoverable amounts for the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations, based upon
discounted cash flows. The key assumptions for the discounted cash flow calculations are those regarding the discount rate, profit
and growth rate. Management estimates pre-tax discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money
and the risks specific to each CGU. Discount rates of 8.0 – 10.0% have been used. The profit used in the cash flows for the first five
years is derived from management forecasts, for years 6 to 10 a growth rate is applied. The profit for year 10 is then assumed to
apply without further growth into perpetuity. Growth rates of between 2.5 and 5.0% have been used, representing management’ s
best estimate of each CGU’ s circumstances, and these do not exceed average long term growth rates for the markets concerned.

Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
No development expenditure met the requirements to be recognised as an internally generated intangible asset, therefore all

Amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’ s management
based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment. The Group has no significant concentration
of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
Before accepting a new customer, the Group uses appropriate procedures to assess the potential customer’ s credit quality in order
to set a credit limit. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

20 Cash and Borrowings
Cash pooling
The Group runs notional pooling facilities in a number of countries, principally the UK. The structure facilitates interest and balance
compensation of cash and bank overdrafts. This notional pooling does not meet the strict set-off rules under IFRS, and as a result
the cash and bank overdraft balances must be reported ‘gross’ on the balance sheet.
The table below shows the impact of netting the cash and overdraft balances in each of the pooled facilities. It is the opinion of the
directors that this treatment reflects the commercial reality of the Group’ s position with its banks.

bond rates appropriate to the country in which the borrowing is incurred. 
At 31 December 2007 , the Group had available £60 million (2006 £60 million) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect
of which all conditions precedent had been met.
The directors calculate the carrying value of the Group’ s borrowings as follows:

The special item represents the revaluation of US dollar loan notes from the rate of the related cross currency swaps to the year 
end rate, together with the transitional adjustment required to reflect movements in fair value caused by variations in interest rates,
and subsequent amortisation thereof, to the extent that these constituted effective hedges under UK GAAP . Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

21 Financial instruments
The Group’ s treasury function operates procedures designed to reduce or eliminate financial risk and ensure that funds are available
for current and future needs. The policies are approved by the Board and the use of financial instruments is strictly controlled.
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the
return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt,
which includes the cash and borrowings disclosed in note 20 and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising
issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 25.
The Group’ s principal financial instruments comprise borrowings, some cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade
debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations. The Group also uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps and
forward foreign currency contracts to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Group’ s operations and its
sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group’ s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Set out below is a comparison by category of book values and fair values of the Group’ s financial assets and liabilities.

Fair values have been obtained from the relevant institutions where appropriate. Where market values are not available, fair values 
of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flow at prevailing interest rates
and by applying year end exchange rates. The carrying amount of short term borrowings approximate to book value.
The main risks arising from the Group’ s financial instruments are market risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees
policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below, together with related disclosure required by IFRS.
Market risk
The Group’ s main exposure to market risk is in the form of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The policies adopted to
address these risks are as follows:
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, loan notes and bank borrowings. The Group borrows at
both fixed and floating rates of interest and uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest profile in order to manage the
Group’ s exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Foreign currency risk
The Group uses currency borrowings, forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge overseas net assets, which are
predominantly denominated in euros. Profit translation exposures are not hedged.
The Group hedges currency transaction exposures at the point of confirmed order, using forward foreign exchange contracts. The
Group’ s policy is, where practicable, to hedge all exposures on monetary assets and liabilities. Consequently, there are no material
currency exposures to disclose (2006 none).

Impact on income statement
Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts amounting to £4,446,883 have been credited to the income statement in the year
(2006 credit of £3,618,002). These changes are shown separately as a special item in the consolidated income statement.
Hedge accounting
The Group has a number of cross currency and interest rate swaps that are used to reduce the exposure to interest rate and
currency risk.
These swaps are fully effective at eliminating the risks they address.
The Group has reviewed the requirements necessary to permit the application of hedge accounting under IAS 39. It has concluded
that the costs involved in meeting these requirements cannot be justified and therefore IAS 39 hedge accounting will not be applied.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments to which hedge accounting is not applied are recognised in the income
statement as they arise.
Interest rate risk profile
Financial liabilities
After taking into account the various interest rate and currency swaps entered into by the Group, the currency and interest rate
exposure of the Group as at 31 December 2007 was:

The interest rate sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-
derivative instruments at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability
outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
The foreign currency sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their
translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as
loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the functional currency
of the lender or borrower. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

Liquidity risk
The objective of the company is to meet financial commitments as and when they fall due. The Board closely monitors liquidity
through monthly management accounts.
At the year end, Yule Catto & Co plc had the following principal facilities:
A committed syndicated bank revolving credit facility of £60 million which expires in November 2009. This credit facility was 
negotiated in November 2004.
Unsecured loan notes totalling approximately £175 million raised from the US private placement market in 1999 and 2004. 
With maturity between 2008 and 2016, these loan notes provide the Group’ s long term requirements. Please see note 20 
for further details.

UK pension schemes
The Group participates in a funded Scheme with both a defined benefit and defined contribution section (the Yule Catto Group
Retirement Benefit Scheme). The Scheme’ s defined benefit section was closed to new members with effect from 31 December
1998 and with effect from 1 January 1999 a defined contribution section was introduced and is open to all eligible Group employees.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the companies concerned. 
Contributions to the scheme are charged to the profit and loss account to spread the cost of pensions over employees’ working
lives within the Group.

Save As You Earn share option plan
This plan, which is available to almost all UK employees, provides for a grant price equal to the average quoted market price of the
Group shares on the date of grant. The vesting period is five to seven years, followed by an exercise period of six months after
which the options expire. Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.

No grants have been made under the plan since 7 November 2002, and the Group has elected not to apply IFRS 2 to awards made
before that date. For options expected to be settled with shares purchased by the Yule Catto Employee Benefit Trust in the open
market, the charge to profit reflects the anticipated cash cost of these shares spread over the vesting period. For options expected
to be settled by the issue of new shares, no charge to profit is made.
For options outstanding as at 31 December 2007 , the exercise price is £2.61, and the weighted average remaining contractual life
was 0.7 years (2006 1.7 years).
Executive share option schemes
Details of the share option schemes available to senior management are included in the remuneration report on pages 28 to 32.
For grants made after 7 November 2002, the charge to profit is calculated on the assumption that, given that the exercise price is
effectively nil, the share price at grant provides a reasonable estimate of the option value at grant.
For grants made before 7 November 2002, the charge to profit is based on the anticipated cash cost of acquiring shares to meet
the options exercised.

On 11 February 2008, the Company announced that it had exchanged conditional contracts for the sale of the entire issued 
share capital of James Robinson Limited and certain other associated assets for an estimated consideration of $21.15 million 
plus working capital of approximately $4.5 million.
The completion of the sale is conditional on, amongst other things, the purchaser obtaining shareholder approval for the 
acquisition which is expected to be obtained by mid April 2008.
Should the conditions be met and completion be achieved, the financial impact of this sale will be reflected in the Company’ s 
2008 financial statements. Independent auditors’ report to the members 
of Yule Catto & Co plc
We have audited the parent company financial statements 
of Yule Catto & Co plc for the year ended 31 December 2007
which comprise the Balance Sheet and the related notes 1 
to 16. These parent company financial statements have been
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the group financial statements
of Yule Catto & Co plc for the year ended 31 December 2007
and on the information in the directors’ remuneration report 
that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’ s members, as a
body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
state to the company’ s members those matters we are required
to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose.
T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and
the company’ s members as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report
and the parent company financial statements in accordance
with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) 
are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial
statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent 
company financial statements give a true and fair view and
whether the parent company financial statements have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We also report to you whether in our opinion the Directors’
Report is consistent with the parent company financial
statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report
includes that specific information that is cross referred from 
the Business Review section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company 
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not 
received all the information and explanations we require for 
our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report
as described in the contents section and consider whether 
it is consistent with the audited parent company financial
statements. We consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the parent company financial statements.
Our responsibilities do not extend to any further information
outside the Annual Report.

Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test 
basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures 
in the parent company financial statements. It also includes 
an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments
made by the directors in the preparation of the parent company
financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the company’ s circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.

Directors Notes to the Company financial statements
31 December 2007
1 Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. 
They have all been applied consistently throughout the year 
and the preceding year.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical
cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain fixed
assets, and comply with applicable UK accounting standards.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate 
of exchange at the date of the transaction or, if hedged, 
at the forward contract rate. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date 
are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date or, 
if appropriate at the forward contract rate.
T angible fixed assets
T angible fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation, net of
depreciation and any provision for impairment. Except for
freehold land, which is not depreciated, the cost or valuation 
of tangible fixed assets is depreciated using a straight line 
basis over their expected useful lives as follows:
Freehold buildings – 50 years
Leasehold land and buildings – the lesser of 50 years and 
the period of the lease
Plant and equipment – between 3 and 10 years
Revaluation of properties
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of
FRS 15 “T angible fixed assets” and retained the book amounts
of certain freehold properties which were revalued prior to
implementation of that standard.
Where depreciation charges are increased following a revaluation,
an amount equal to the increase is transferred annually from the
revaluation reserve to the profit and loss account as a movement
on reserves. On the disposal or recognition of a provision for
impairment of a revalued fixed asset, any related balance
remaining in the revaluation reserve is also transferred to the 
profit and loss account as a movement on reserves.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for
impairment.
Debt
Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after
deduction of issue costs.
Dividends
Dividends are accrued where declared and unpaid at the
balance sheet date.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is
provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using
the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences
that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date
where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay
more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have
occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are
differences between the Group’ s taxable profits and its results
Yule Catto & Co plc 
Annual report and accounts 2007 
72
as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion 
of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from
those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and
therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available
evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there
will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of
the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are
expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are
expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the
Group’ s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at
their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for
estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges,
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and
direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis to the
profit and loss account using the effective interest method and
are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent
that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their
nominal value.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments
The company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce
exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate movements.
The company does not hold or issue derivative financial
instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’ s
policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide
written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Net borrowings
Net borrowings represents cash and cash equivalents together
with short and long term borrowings, as adjusted for the effect
of related derivative instruments irrespective of whether they
qualify for hedge accounting.
Pension funding
The costs of contributions to the Group’ s pension schemes and
of augmenting existing pensions are charged to the profit and
loss account on a systematic basis over the expected period of
benefits from employees’ service.
The UK defined benefit scheme is funded, with the assets of the
scheme held separately from those of the Group, in separate
trustee-administered funds.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes
are charged as an expense as they fall due. Yule Catto & Co plc

14 Guarantees and other financial commitments
The company has given guarantees amounting to £18,178,000 (2006 £14,049,000) in respect of bank and other facilities
of subsidiaries and joint ventures.
15 Pension commitments 
The Group participates in a funded Scheme with both a defined benefit and defined contribution section (the Yule Catto Group
Retirement Benefit Scheme). The Scheme’ s defined benefit section was closed to new members with effect from 31 December 1998 
and with effect from 1 January 1999 a defined contribution section was introduced and is open to all eligible Group employees.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the companies concerned. 
The pension charge for the year for the company amounted to £2,623,000 (2006 £2,087,000)
In accordance with FRS 1 7 , the company will account for its contributions to the Defined Benefit scheme as if it were a Defined
Contribution scheme because it is not possible to identify the company’ s share of the assets and liabilities in the scheme on a
consistent and reasonable basis. The latest actuarial valuation of the scheme prepared for the purposes of making transitional
disclosure in accordance with FRS 17 show a net pension liability of £69,288,000 at 31 December 2006.
FRS 17 Disclosure
Due to the application of IAS 19 to the Group financial statements, resulting in changes to the required disclosures at Group level, 
the disclosure requirements of FRS 17 for the Group have been included below.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 6 April 2006 and updated to 31 December 2007 by a qualified actuary. The major
assumptions used by the actuary were:
2007 2006 2005 2004 2003
Rate of increase in salaries 3.10% 3.30% 3.50% 3.60% 3.50%

Notes
(i) A member of the Company entitled to attend and vote at 
the above meeting may appoint one or more proxies to
attend, speak and vote in his stead. A proxy need not also
be a member of the Company. The right to appoint a proxy
does not apply to persons whose shares are held on their
behalf by another person and who have been nominated to
receive communications from the Company in accordance
with section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to enjoy
information rights (‘nominated persons’). Nominated
persons may have a right under an agreement with the
registered shareholder who holds the shares on their behalf
to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a
proxy. Alternatively, if nominated persons do not have such 
a right, or do not wish to exercise it, they may have a right
under such an agreement to give instructions to the person
holding the shares as to the exercise of voting rights.
(ii) A form of proxy is enclosed which, to be valid, must be
completed and deposited with Computershare Investor
Services PLC, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol 
BS99 6ZY not less than 48 hours before the time appointed
for holding the meeting or any adjourned meeting. The
completion and return of a form of proxy will not prevent 
a member who wishes to do so from attending and voting 
in person.
(iii) The Company, pursuant to Regulation 41 of the
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 , specifies 
that only those holders of ordinary shares registered in 
the Register of Members of the Company at 11pm on
Tuesday 13 May 2008 shall be entitled to attend and vote 
at the aforesaid Annual General Meeting in respect of 
such number of shares registered in their name at that 
time. Changes to entries on the register of members after
11pm on Tuesday 13 May 2008 shall be disregarded in
determining the rights of any person to attend or vote 
at the meeting.

(iv) In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives 
at the meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the
meeting so that (i) if a corporate shareholder has appointed
the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative
with instructions to vote on a poll in accordance with the
directions of all of the other corporate representatives 
for that shareholder at the meeting, then on a poll those
corporate representatives will give voting directions to the
Chairman and the Chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) 
as corporate representative in accordance with those
directions; and (ii) if more than one corporate representative
for the same corporate shareholder attends the meeting but
the corporate shareholder has not appointed the Chairman
of the meeting as it corporate representative, a designated
corporate representative will be nominated, from those
corporate representatives who attend, who will vote on a
poll and the other corporate representatives will give voting
directions to that designated corporate representative.
Corporate shareholders are referred to the guidance issued
by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators
on proxies and corporate representatives – www.icsa.org.uk –
for further details of this procedure. The guidance includes 
a sample form of representation letter if the Chairman is
being appointed as described in (i) above.
(v) The Company’ s capital consists of 145,663,187 ordinary
shares with voting rights. Designed and produced by

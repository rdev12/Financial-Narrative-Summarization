For the year ended 31 October 2009
IDOX specialises in providing document 
management, case management, 
workflow systems, content and web-based 
portals for local government needs. 
Local Authorities represent one of the 
largest sectors of Government IT spending 
in the UK, with an annual investment 
of around £4 billion, according to a 
November 2009 survey by Kable, the 
research consultancy. The market is 
characterised by long-term customer 
relationships that generate strong and 
recurring revenue streams.
As a result of its expertise in software 
development, coupled with a strong 
understanding of customer requirements 
and the rapid return on investment of 
its applications, IDOX has become a 
leading supplier to the land and property 
departments of local authorities.  The 
Group has also made substantial inroads 
into other local authority markets 
including revenues and benefits.
IDOX’s innovative solutions have given 
local authorities and other bodies the 
tools to manage information and the 
ability to connect directly with citizens 
through online portals, such as Scotland’s 
ePlanning web site.  At the same time, 
local authorities enjoy significant 
efficiency gains, enabling them to reduce 
costs while improving services. 
Capitalising on its expertise and market 
leadership, IDOX will continue to 
consolidate and advance these capabilities 
into adjacent public-sector markets and 
into the private sector by pursuing an 
organic and acquisitive approach.
The 2009 financial year saw IDOX 
strengthen its position as a leading partner 
of Local Authorities needing to improve 
services and reduce costs through the 
use of information technology.  Its core 
software and services are now used by 
338 local authorities.  The Group’s strong 
market position is reflected in the fact 
that IDOX beat significant competition 
to win contracts in all of the new 
Unitary Authorities created by the Local 
Government Review who have tendered 
for work. 
IDOX achieved its software sales targets 
for 2009, built a strong contracted order 
book, improved its qualified pipeline 
and increased its level of recurring 
revenues.  However, delays in procurement 
completions that left little time for 
implementation before the year end, 
as well as a shift towards longer-term 
managed-service contracts, meant that 
some revenues and profits could not 
prudently be booked before the end of the 
financial year.

The 2009 financial 
year saw IDOX 
strengthen its 
position as a leading 
partner of Local 
Authorities 3 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Revenues fell by 5% and EBITDA 13% 
as local authorities responded to the 
challenging economic climate and delayed 
IT procurement decisions or opted for 
longer-term managed-service contracts.  
However, the 2010 financial year has 
begun well with the implementation and 
recognition of orders contracted in 2009. 
Tight cost controls and strong 
management of working capital ensured 
that the Group’s net cash position 
remained strong at £3.2m, despite the 
repayment of £3m of debt, the acquisition 
of j4b for £0.8m cash and the payment 
of a maiden interim dividend.  The Group 
proposes to pay a final dividend of 0.12 
pence.

For the year ended 31 October 2009
However, the Group increased recurring 
revenues strongly and at the end of 
the year the level of contracts awaiting 
delivery was 60% up on a like for like basis.
IDOX’s operational capability was 
stretched in the first half of the year when 
it delivered on schedule an ePlanning 
Solution for the Scottish Government 
that linked its 16 Unitary Authorities.  
The experience gained from this and the 
follow-up review of internal processes 
has already delivered improvements 
in the Group’s operating procedures 
that will lead to more efficient project 
management and better managed 
services. 
In product development, IDOX achieved 
several goals. It completed product road 
maps for its core business lines, introduced 
and enhanced computerised production 
systems using in-house Enterprise product 
technology, introduced quality initiatives 
across the company, achieved cost savings 
and successfully delivered important new 
products on time and to a higher quality 
standard.  Developments planned for 2010 
The core Software division had a good 
year, winning notable large contracts 
including the Scottish Government’s 
Stream 3 ePlanning procurement and all 
of the new Unitary Authorities created 
by the Local Government Review who 
have tendered for work in 2009, namely 
Cornwall, Shropshire, and Central 
Bedfordshire.  Helped by the launch of 
new public-access modules, Enterprise 
modules, and updates to existing 
products, IDOX increased market share 
in its core segments through competitor 
replacements in Medway, North Norfolk, 
North Kesteven and expanded its presence 
in other authorities such as Eastleigh, 
where it implemented a corporate-wide 
EDRMS solution.
The timing and mix of orders was different 
than expected, with a larger element 
coming from managed-service contracts 
spread over a number of years.  This shift, 
combined with new product releases and 
the additional requirement to hit the 
deployment timetable for Scotland Stream 
2, a complex rollout across Scotland with 
customer and third-party dependencies, 
resulted in deliveries and associated 
revenue recognition falling short of 
expectations.

revenues, added new technology with its 
Content Management System, added web 
publishing expertise and strengthened the 
IDOX management team.
The Group’s Recruitment business has 
suffered through layoffs and downsizing 
in all of its markets. Contract interim 
placements held up well, but there was a 
52% fall in permanent recruitment which, 
although accounting for just 1% of Group 
revenues, had a 5% impact on Group 
operating profits.  The integration of the 
team from Intelligent Resources towards 
the end of the year, has strengthened 
the Group’s position and the outlook for 
recruitment in 2010 has already started to 
improve.
S u m m a r y	a n d	O u t l o o k
The Board is confident of a good 
performance in 2010.  Although the 
Government has reiterated its commitment 
to maintain core funding at previously 
agreed levels though until 2011, local 
authorities will face growing pressure to 
improve services and reduce costs.
are designed to position IDOX as the most 
efficient and focused supplier of quality 
solutions and managed services to Local 
Government.
Demand for the Solutions business, which 
accounts for 10% of Group revenues, 
suffered from the economic downturn 
with key private and public sector projects 
being delayed or postponed indefinitely.  
The acquisition of j4b offset this to some 
extent with the completion of a major 
contract for the charities sector after 
its integration.  j4b has also augmented

recurring revenues 
strongly and at the 
end of the year the 
level of contracts 
awaiting delivery was

The Board expects that in the face of such 
economic pressures, local authorities will 
increasingly appreciate the rapid return 
on investment and benefits of service 
improvements that IDOX software and 
services provide at relatively little cost.
The effort IDOX invested in product 
development during the 2009 financial 
year should generate good returns 
in 2010, with existing and potential 
customers benefiting from a wider range 
of software modules, upgrades and 
enhanced offerings from the consultancy, 
recruitment and managed-services 
businesses.
The 2010 financial year has begun 
positively.  IDOX is delivering on its 
substantial contracted order book, 
converting its large pipeline of prospects 
into sales and seeing signs of recovery in 
the Solutions and Permanent Recruitment 
businesses.

For the year ended 31 October 2007
The addition of j4b has augmented 
recurring revenues, which now make 
up 53% of solutions turnover which 
together with strong recurring revenues 
in the Software business, provide a solid 
foundation for the Group’s performance.
Gross margins for the Group were 77% 
(2008: 79%), reflecting a shifting mix 
within the recruitment business toward 
interim placements, which now account for 
93% of recruitment revenues (2008: 87%).  
Software margins of 85% (2008: 88%) 
were marginally reduced by additional 
costs associated with the delivery of the 
Scottish Government Stream 2 project 
and lower revenue to cover certain fixed 
external charges. 
Even after the current-year acquisition 
of j4b and a full year of costs from 
Plantech, acquired in 2008, operating costs 
were reduced by 5% to £17.4m (2008: 
£18.4m) as a result of tight cost controls, 
the completion of the integration of 
acquisitions and productivity gains.  The 
associated 17% headcount reduction since 
October 2008, resulted in an exceptional 
charge of £0.4m.  The full benefit of these 
savings will be felt in 2010.
EBITDA of £7.5m (2008: £8.6m) reflects 
the revenue decline, although it has been 
offset to some extent by operating cost 
savings.  However, EBITDA margin remains 
healthy at 23% (2008: 25%). 
Normalised pre-tax profit, excluding 
amortisation, impairment, share options 
Revenues were £32.2m (2008: £34.0m) 
reflecting extended delivery schedules on 
software contracts, an increased mix of 
longer-term maintenance and managed-
service contracts and challenging market 
conditions that affected the recruitment 
business.
The Software business, which accounts for 
78% of Group revenues, delivered £25.1m 
(2008: £27.1m), of which around 52% were 
recurring, up from 46% in the previous 
year.
Although new software sales were in 
line with management expectations, 
the revenue mix contained a higher 
proportion of maintenance and managed-
service contracts that will be recognised 
over longer periods.  In addition, there 
were a number of larger contract wins, 
including the third phase of the Scottish 
Government e-Planning project, where 
delivery and therefore revenue recognition 
extends into 2010.  As a result, the 
contracted order book increased by 60% 
year-on-year to £6.1m.
The Recruitment and Training business 
reported revenues of £3.8m (2008: £4.4m), 
reflecting the rapid deterioration in the 
employment market. 
The Solutions division increased revenue 
to £3.4m (2008: £2.6m) as a result of a 
six-month contribution from j4b, acquired 
in April 2009, which provides content to 
local authorities and other public sector 
bodies.
For the year ended 31 October 2009
C h i e f	F i n a n c i a l	O f fi c e r ’ s	r e v i e w 9 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
IDOX ended the year with £6.9m cash and 
net funds of £3.2m after repaying £3.0m 
of debt and funding from existing cash 
resources the £0.8m acquisition of j4b, a 
dividend payment of £0.7m and share buy 
backs of £0.2m.
Strong working capital management 
resulted in a significant decrease in debtor 
days to 47 (2008: 68). The tax charge of 
£1.0m (2008: £1.8m) reflects a reduction 
in the Group’s effective tax rate from 27% 
to 23% following recovery of prior-year 
research and development credits.

costs and exceptional charges, was 
£6.7m (2008: £7.6m).  Pre-tax profit was 
£4.5m (2008: £6.6m) after an increased 
amortisation charge following the 
acquisition of j4b, the amortisation of 
capitalised Research & Development and 
the exceptional charge of £0.4m (2008: 
Nil).  In addition there was a goodwill 
impairment charge of £0.5m relating to 
the Group’s Solutions business.
Normalised earnings per share were 1.64p 
(2008: 1.70p).  Basic earnings per share 
were 1.01p (2008: 1.40p).
A maiden interim dividend of 0.08p per 
share was paid in August 2009.  The Board 
proposes a final dividend of 0.12p to give a 
full year dividend of 0.20p (2008: 0.115p).  
The 74% increase in dividend reflects 
the Board’s continuing confidence in the 
long-term strength of the business and its 
healthy operating cash generation of 63% 
(2008: 50%).

The policy of informing and consulting with employees is maintained by means of 
regular team briefs and meetings.  Employees are encouraged to present their views and 
suggestions in respect of the Group’s performance.  In addition, the Group has an intranet 
which facilitates faster and more effective communication.
An Employee Share Investment Trust is in place to allow employees a tax efficient way of 
investing in the Company.  The Company purchases matching shares which become the 
property of the employee after a three year vesting period.

The Group uses various financial instruments which include cash, equity investments, 
bank loans and items such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its 
operations.  The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the 
Group’s operations. 
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk 
and interest rate risk.  The directors review these risks on an ongoing basis. This policy has 
remained unchanged from previous years.
C r e d i t	r i s k
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and trade debtors.  The credit risk associated 
with cash is limited as the counterparties have high credit ratings assigned by international 
credit-rating agencies.  The principal credit risk arises therefore from its trade debtors.  1 3 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
For the year ended 31 October 2009
D i r e c t o r s’	R e p o r t	c o n t ’ d
In order to manage credit risk, the management review the debt ageing on an ongoing 
basis, together with the collection history and third party credit references where 
appropriate. 
l i q u i d i t y	r i s k
The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet 
foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
I n t e r e s t	r a t e	r i s k
Any funds over and above the current working capital requirements of the Group are 
invested in high interest deposit accounts.  The Group’s bank borrowings bear interest at 
rates linked to the LIBOR.

affected by a further slowdown in the economic environment.  However, in the event of 
an improvement in the economy, some recruitment revenue streams may improve.  The 
software area of the business could be adversely affected if the government reduces the 
grants to local authorities in an economic downturn.  However, all indications are that 
the government will maintain and may increase the grants during such a period.  The 
Group has increased diversification through acquisitions to mitigate against economic 
risks.

The policy of the Group is to set levels of remuneration to attract, retain and motivate 
Executive Directors and key staff.  The packages are designed to be competitive in value 
to those offered to the Directors of similar sized public companies in related sectors.  It is 
the Board’s policy also to align the interests of managers with those of our shareholders in 
the grant of option and other equity rewards which underlying securities grantees are very 
much encouraged to retain over the longer term.
The components of the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages are currently a basic 
salary, bonus, money purchase pension contributions and benefits in kind.  The benefits 
include car allowance, private medical cover, life cover and critical illness cover.  The bonus 
elements are dependent on the Executive Directors achieving performance criteria set out 
by the Remuneration Committee.  The criteria include targets for turnover and profits as 
well as for cash balances.  In addition, the Group has introduced new share option schemes 
for the Executive Directors.

The Group is committed to applying the 
highest principles of corporate governance 
commensurate with its size. The Group has 
adopted the Quoted Company Alliance

2005. The Group complies with the QCA 
Corporate Governance Guidelines except

The Board takes responsibility for 
establishing and maintaining reliable 
systems of control in all areas of operation. 
These systems of control, especially 
of financial control, can only provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. 
The key matters relating to the system of 
internal control are set out below:
•	 I D O X	p l c	h a s	e s t a b li s h e d	a n	o p e ra t i o n a l	
management structure with clearly 
defined responsibilities and regular 
performance reviews
•	 t h e	G r o u p	o p e ra t e s	a	c o m p r e h e n s i v e	
system for reporting financial and 
non-financial information to the Board 
including preparation and review of 
strategy plans and the preparation and 
review of annual budgets
•	 fi n a n c i a l	r e s u l t s	a r e	m o n i t o r e d	
against budgets, forecasts and other 
performance indicators with action 
dictated accordingly at each meeting
•	 a	s t r u c t u r e d	a p p r o v a l	p r o c e s s	b a s e d	o n	
assessment of risk and value delivered
•	 s u f fi c i e n t	r e s o u r c e	i s	f o c u s e d	t o	
maintain and develop internal control 
procedures and information systems, 
especially in financial management
The Board considers that there have been 
no substantial weaknesses in internal 
financial controls that have resulted in 
any material losses, contingencies or 
uncertainties which need to be disclosed in 
the accounts.
The Board has considered the need for 
an internal audit function and concluded 
that there is no current need for such a 
function within the Group. In the absence 
of a dedicated function, one member of 
staff has undergone internal audit training 
and ad hoc internal audit projects have 
been carried out cross-departmentally 
during the year. Furthermore, in 
compliance with the Group’s quality 
standards, additional internal reviews are 
carried out. 
Following publication of Internal Control: 
Guidance for Directors on the Combined 
Code (the “Turnbull Guidance”), the Board 
confirms that there is an ongoing process 
for identifying, evaluating and managing 
the significant risks faced by the Group, 
and that this process has been in place 
for the year under review and up to the 
date of approval of the Annual Report 
and Accounts. This process is regularly 
reviewed by the Board and is consistent 
with the Turnbull Guidance. 
S t a t e m e n t	o f	D i r e c t o r s ’	r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s
The directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the directors 
have to prepare financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (IFRSs). The financial 
statements are required by law to give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the group and parent company and of the 
profit or loss of the group for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, 
the directors are required to:
•	 s e l e c t	s u i t a b l e	a c c o u n t i n g	p o li c i e s	a n d	
then apply them consistently
•	 m a k e	j u d g m e n t s	a n d	e s t i m a t e s	t h a t	a r e	
reasonable and prudent
•	 s t a t e	w h e t h e r	a p p li c a b l e	I F R S s	h a v e	
been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements
•	 p r e p a r e	t h e	fi n a n c i a l	s t a t e m e n t s	o n	
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
company will continue in business
The directors are responsible for keeping 
proper accounting records that disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Group and 
enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for ensuring 
that the Directors’ Report and other 
information included in the Annual Report 
is prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Company Law. They are also 
responsible for ensuring that the Annual 
Report includes information required by 
the AIM Market Rules. 
The maintenance and integrity of the 
Group’s web site is the responsibility of 
the Directors; the work carried out by the  18 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009

of these matters and, accordingly, the 
auditors accept no responsibility for any

Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and the 
dissemination of the accounts and other 
information included in annual reports 
may differ from legislation in other

The Board considers the appropriateness 
of its accounting policies on an annual 
basis. The Board believes that its 
accounting policies are appropriate 
in particular in relation to income 
recognition, research and development 
and deferred income.
B o a r d	o f	D i r e c t o r s
The Board, comprising the Chairman, 
the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief 
Finance Officer and two Non-Executive

as for approving potential acquisitions, 
major capital expenditure items and 
financing matters. The Board has a 
formal schedule of business reserved 
to it and meets regularly during the 
year. The Board is supplied in a timely 
manner with information in a form and 
of a suitable quality appropriate to 
enable it to discharge its duties. Advice 
from independent sources is available if 
required. The Board monitors exposure to 
key business risks and reviews the strategic 
direction of the Group, the annual budgets 
as well as their progress against those 
budgets.
The Board members and their roles are 
described on page 10.  In accordance with 
the Company’s Articles of Association,

IDOX plc is committed to open 
communication with all its shareholders. 
The Directors hold regular meetings 
with institutional shareholders to discuss 
and review the Group’s activities and 
objectives. Communication with private 
shareholders is principally through 
the Annual General Meeting, where 
participation is encouraged and where 
the Board is available to answer questions. 
IDOX plc maintains up-to-date information 
on the Investor Relations section of its 
website, www.IDOXplc.com.
Every shareholder is sent a full annual 
report each year end and at the half year 
end the interim report is made available 
on the investor relations website. Care is 
taken to ensure that any price sensitive 
information is released to all shareholders, 
institutional and private, at the same time 
in accordance with London Stock Exchange 
requirements. 
IDOX plc strives to give a full, timely and 
realistic assessment of its business in a 
balanced way, in all price-sensitive reports

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union (EU) and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.  
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets 
and liabilities, being derivative financial instruments carried at fair value through profit or loss.
As set out on page 14 of the Directors’ Report, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.

The Group has elected to adopt IFRS 8 Operating Segments early.  This standard replaces IAS 14 Segment Reporting and aligns segment 
reporting with the requirements of the US standard SFAS 131, Disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information.  The 
new standard requires a ‘management approach’, under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal 
reporting purposes.

The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations will have no marked impact on the financial statements 
when they come into effect, other than IAS1 Presentation of financial statements which will lead to presentation and disclosure amendments 
and IFRS 3 which no longer allows costs of acquisition to be capitalised. 27 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of 
future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.  The resulting accounting estimates and assumptions will, by definition, 
seldom equal the related actual results.  The Group has evaluated the estimates and assumptions that have been made in relation to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in these financial statements.  The estimates and assumptions which have the most significant 
impact on the financial statements which are recognised in the financial statements are as follows:
(i) Intangible assets 
The Group recognises intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations at fair value at the date of acquisition.  The determination 
of these fair values is based upon management’s judgement and includes assumptions on the timing and amount of future incremental cash 
flows generated by the assets and selection of an appropriate cost of capital.  Furthermore, management must estimate the expected useful 
lives of intangible assets and charge amortisation on those assets accordingly.  In determining the useful economic life of the intangible 
software assets, management has given consideration to the length of time that its own software is typically used within its market.  In 
addition, management reviewed competitor products and the length of time they had also been in use.
Consideration was also given as to the likelihood that a new competitor could enter the market with a new product.  This was considered 
unlikely due to the up-front capital investment which would be required to develop a new product, the requirement for reference sites 
to demonstrate the product, and the long life cycles which products have in the market. For details on the estimates made in relation to 
intangible assets, see note 10.
(ii) Development costs
The Group reviews half yearly  whether the recognition requirements for development costs have been met.  This is necessary as the 
economic success of any product development is uncertain and may be subject to future technical problems at the time of recognition.  
Judgements are based on the information available at each balance sheet date.  In addition, all internal activities related to the research and 
development of new software products are continuously monitored by the directors. See note 10 for further information.
(iii) Impairment of goodwill
The Group is required to test, as least annually, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment.  The recoverable amount is determined based 
upon value-in-use and net realisable value calculations.  The value-in-use method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the choice 
of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of these cash flows. Pre-tax discount rates have been applied and are based 
on WACC calculations.  See note 10 for further commentary.
Fair value less costs to sell have been determined using an earnings multiplier, derived from comparable software industry data, adjusted for 
a control premium. See note 10 for further commentary.
(iv) Revenue recognition
The group recognises revenue on certain contracts such as work in progress, prior to an invoice being raised, where work has been completed 
and there is a high degree of certainty of the contract being completed and the invoice raised and cash received. See paragraph headed 
‘Revenue’ below for more detail on how the Group accounts for revenue. 
(v) Dilapidations
Dilapidation provisions are management’s best estimates based on actual costs incurred in existing or similar properties. See note 16 for 
details of the amounts included in the balance sheet at the year end. 28 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009

The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 October each year.  Subsidiaries 
are those entities over which the Group has the power to control the financial and operating policies.  Over all its subsidiaries, IDOX plc 
obtains and exercises control through 100% of the voting rights.
The Group elected not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations retrospectively to business combinations prior to 1 November 2006.  
Accordingly the classification of the combination (acquisition, reverse acquisition or merger) remains unchanged from that used under UK 
GAAP.  
Assets and liabilities are recognised at the date of transition if they would be recognised under IFRS, and are measured using their UK GAAP 
carrying amount immediately post-acquisition as deemed cost under IFRS, unless IFRS requires fair value measurement.  Deferred tax is 
adjusted for the impact of any consequential adjustments after taking advantage of the transitional provisions.
All inter-company transactions are eliminated on consolidation. 
The presentational currency of the group is £GBP sterling.
R ev e n u e
Revenue represents the amounts receivable in respect of goods and services provided during the year, stated net of value added tax.  Where 
work has been done, but a billing milestone has not been reached, the income has been accrued and included in amounts recoverable within 
trade and other receivables. 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the right to consideration. The Group derives its revenue streams from software solutions, 
information solutions and recruitment services.  
IDOX software products revenue is recognised in stages based on contract signing, delivery, configuration and client acceptance. For 
small value orders, the whole invoice amount is recognised at the billing point. For larger value orders, revenue is reviewed to see if the 
appropriate amount of work has been completed. For the largest orders, the amount of revenue recognised is dependent on the percentage 
of completion of the Group’s contractual obligations. The revenues for maintenance and managed service contracts are spread over the 
period of the agreement, which is typically one year.  
Revenue derived from information solutions content is recognised over the life of the subscription, which is typically one year.  Revenue from 
projects is recognised over the life of the project in accordance with the stage of completion.  Revenue from information solutions based 
managed services is recognised on a usage basis as the service is performed.
Recruitment revenue from permanent placements is recognised in the month when the placement starts.  Revenue from contract recruitment 
is recognised as the service is performed.
C o n t r a c t	r e v e n u e
The amount of profit attributable to the stage of completion of a long term contract is recognised only when the outcome of the contract 
can be foreseen with reasonable certainty. Revenue for such contracts is stated at the cost appropriate to their stage of completion plus 
attributable profits, less amounts recognised in previous years. Provision is made for any losses as they are foreseen.
Amounts recoverable on contracts are included in trade and other receivables and represent revenue recognised in excess of payments on 
account. 29 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.  The 
chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the steering committee that makes strategic decisions.
G o o d w ill
Goodwill representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the group’s share of the identifiable 
net assets acquired is capitalised and reviewed annually for impairment.  Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.  
Negative goodwill is recognised immediately after acquisition in the income statement.
Goodwill written off to reserves prior to date of transition to IFRS remains in reserves.  There is no re-instatement of goodwill that was 
amortised prior to transition to IFRS.  Goodwill previously written off to reserves is not written back to profit or loss on subsequent disposal.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortised to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful lives, which are reviewed on an annual basis.  Amortisation commences when the asset is available for use.  The residual values of 
intangible assets are assumed to be zero.
(i) Research and development
Expenditure on research (or the research phase of an internal project) is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.  
Development costs incurred are capitalised when all the following conditions are satisfied:

Development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are expensed as incurred.  The cost of an internally generated intangible 
asset comprises all directly attributable costs necessary to create, produce, and prepare the asset to be capable of operating in the manner 
intended by management.  Amortisation commences upon completion of the asset, and is shown within other operating charges.
Careful judgement by the directors is applied when deciding whether the recognition requirements for development costs have been met.  
This is necessary as the economic success of any product development is uncertain and may be subject to future technical problems at the 
time of recognition.  Judgements are based on the information available at each balance sheet date.  In addition, all internal activities 
related to the research and development of new software products are continuously monitored by the directors.
(ii) Customer relationships
Customer relationships represent the purchase price of customer lists and contractual relationships purchased on the acquisition of CAPS 
Solutions Limited, Plantech Limited and j4b Software and Publishing Limited.  These relationships are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.  Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method over a period of 20, 10 and 5 
years. 3 0 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009

(iii) Trade names
Trade names represent the named intangible asset recognised on the acquisition of CAPS Solutions Limited, Plantech Limited and j4b 
Software and Publishing Limited.  These trade names are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.  
Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method over a period of 20 and 10 years.
(iv) Software
Software represents the UNI-form and ACOLAID software purchased on the acquisition of CAPS Solutions Limited and Plantech Limited.  The 
software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.  Amortisation is calculated using the straight 
line method over a period of 10 years. 
(v) Database
Database represents the grant information database purchased on the acquisition of j4b Software & Publishing Limited.  The database is 
carried at fair value less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.  Amortisation is calculated using the straight line 
method over a period of 5 years.  
I m p a i r m e nt
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows 
(cash-generating units).  As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-generating unit level.  
Goodwill is allocated to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from synergies of the related business combination and 
represent the lowest level within the group at which management monitors the related cash flows.
Goodwill, other individual assets or cash-generating units that include goodwill, other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, and 
those intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually.  All other individual assets or cash-generating 
units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 
amount.  The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs to sell, and value in use based on an 
internal discounted cash flow evaluation.  Impairment losses recognised for cash-generating units, to which goodwill has been allocated, 
are credited initially to the carrying amount of goodwill.  Any remaining impairment loss is charged pro rata to the other assets in the cash 
generating unit.  With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously 
recognised may no longer exist.

Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement using the following rates and bases so as to write off the cost or valuation of items of 
property, plant and equipment over their expected useful lives.  The rates generally applicable are:
Computer hardware          50% and 100% straight line
Fixtures, fittings and equipment      25% straight line
Library books and journals        33 1/3% straight line

All share-based payment arrangements granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested prior to 1 November 2006 are recognised in the 
financial statements.
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values.  Where employees 
are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of employees’ services are determined indirectly by reference to the fair value 
of the instrument granted to the employee.  This fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of non-market vesting 
conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets).
All equity-settled share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense in the income statement with a corresponding credit to the 
share option reserve.
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best available 
estimate of the number of share options expected to vest.  Estimates are revised subsequently if there is any indication that the number 
of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates.  Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is recognised in the current 
period.  No adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options that have vested are not exercised.
Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital, and where 
appropriate share premium.

t axation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.  Current tax is charged to the income statement except to where it 
relates to tax on items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is charged to equity.
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable profit for the year. 32 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
N o t e s	t o	t h e	A c c o u n t s	c o n t ’ d
For the year ended 31 October 2009
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences.  Deferred tax is generally provided on the 
difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.  However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial 
recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or 
affects tax or accounting profit.  Deferred tax on temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries and joint ventures is not 
provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the 
foreseeable future.  In addition, tax losses available to be carried forward as well as other income credits to the group are assessed for 
recognition as deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting.  Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
the underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset against future taxable income.  Current and deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the income statement, except where they relate 
to items that are charged or credited directly to equity in which case the related deferred tax is also charged or credited directly to equity.
Operating leases
All leases are operating in nature.  Amounts paid under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over 
the lease term.
F i n a n c i a l	i n s t r u m e n t s
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group has become a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
t r a d e	a n d	o t h e r	r e c e i v a b l e s
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are initially stated at their fair value, as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts.  All receivables are considered for impairment.  Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective 
evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the original terms of those receivables.  The amount of 
the write-down is determined as the difference between the assets carrying value and the present value of estimated future cash flows.
C a s h	a n d	c a s h	e q u i v a l e n t s
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and on deposit and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.  
F i n a n c i a l	l i a b i l i t i e s	a n d	e q u i t y
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.  An equity 
instrument is any contact that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the group after deducting all of its financial liabilities.
B a n k	b o r r o w i n g s
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded initially at fair value, net of direct transaction costs.  Such instruments are 
subsequently carried at their amortised cost and finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption, are recognised 
in the income statement over the term of the instrument using an effective rate of interest.

The Group’s activities expose the entity primarily to interest rate risk.  The Group previously used interest rate swap contracts to manage 
these exposures.  The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.  The use of financial derivatives is 
governed by the Group’s policies approved by the board of directors, which provide written principles in the use of financial derivatives.  
Derivative financial instruments are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.  The Group does not apply hedge accounting.

As at 31 October 2009, the Group is primarily organised into three main business segments, which are detailed below.
Financial information is reported to the Board on a business unit basis with revenue and operating profits split by business unit.  Each 
business unit is deemed a reportable segment as each offer different products and services.

customers 
Segment revenue comprises of sales to external customers and excludes gains arising on the disposal of assets and finance income. Segment 
profit reported to the board represents the profit earned by each segment before the allocation of tax, interest payments and share option 
charges.
Relevant assets and liabilities are allocated to reportable segments in line with the percentage of total revenue.  
The Group does not place reliance on any specific customer and has no individual customer that generates 10% or more of its total Group 
revenue.
The segment revenues by geographic location for the year ended 31 October 2009 are as follows:

In the prior year financial statements, profit was adjusted for interest rate swaps in the calculation of normalised EPS. This has not been 
included in this year’s normalised EPS calculation. The 2008 comparative normalised EPS has been adjusted to enable a like-for-like 
comparison to the 2009 amount. As a result, the 2008 amount has reduced from the reported 1.73p in last year’s financial statements to

During the year, goodwill was reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of assets. Impairment charges of £533,000 
(2008: Nil) arose as a result of this review. The impairment charge relates to the Consulting division of TFPL, included within the Solutions 
business. Given current market conditions, the Directors believe that it is prudent to recognise the impairment charge.
The current year fair value adjustment of £134,000 includes £113,000 which related to an increase in the dilapidation provision in respect of 
the Southwark Street property acquired with the acquisition of Plantech. 41 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009

With the exception of software, the recoverable amount of all CGU’s has been determined using value-in-use calculations.  These calculations 
use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering the next five financial years.  Cash flows 
beyond this period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below.
The recoverable amount of the Software CGU has been determined based on fair value less costs to sell using an earnings based multiplier 
derived from comparable software industry data, and adjusted for a control premium.  The key assumption used in this calculation is the 
earnings based multiplier, which as stated, is derived from comparable software industry data.
For value in use calculations, the growth rates and margins used to estimate future performance are based on management’s best estimate 
of short term performance based on an assessment of market opportunities and macro economic conditions. In the year to 31 October 2009 
the Weighted Average Cost of Capital for the Group has been used as an appropriate discount rate to apply to cash flows.  This represents 
the overall required return on the Group as a whole and is also considered appropriate to each CGU. 42 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
N o t e s	t o	t h e	A c c o u n t s	c o n t ’ d
For the year ended 31 October 2009
The assumptions used for the value in use calculations are as follows and are considered appropriate for each of the risk profiles of the 
respective CGU:
2009 2008
Discount rate 12.5% 12.5%
Growth rate 2% 2%
These assumptions have been used for the analysis of each CGU. 
Sensitivities have been run on both value in use and fair value less cost of sale impairment calculations. Management are satisfied that the 
key assumptions are achievable and that they would not lead to the carrying amount of the relevant CGU exceeding the recoverable amount.  
This is with the exception of the TFPL Consulting CGU which, as a result of sensitivity calculations, and based on an assessment of historical 
results, was, as noted previously, impaired by £533,000.

The provision allowance in respect of trade receivables is used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery 
of the amount owing is possible.  At that point the amounts are considered irrecoverable and are written off against the trade receivable 
directly.  Where trade receivables are past due an assessment is made of individual customers and the outstanding balance.  No provision is 
required in respect of amounts owed by group undertakings.

During the year the Group made an early repayment of £2.5m of the term loan in addition to the scheduled repayment of £0.5m. 
The average interest rate paid was 6.51% (2008: 9.42%).  Bank borrowings of £3,781,000 (2008: £6,696,000) were arranged at floating 
interest rates.
As security for the above loans, the Bank of Scotland Plc holds a bond and floating charge over the assets of the Group, a composite 
guarantee supported by each Group company and a share pledge in respect of the entire issued share capital of each subsidiary company.
The loans are repayable in six monthly instalments.  Interest on the loans is payable quarterly in arrears.
The directors’ estimate that the fair value of the Group’s borrowing is not significantly different to the carrying value.

In the previous year, the Group utilised interest rates swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings. With 
the large fall in interest rates, the group exited from the use of floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps as it was financially beneficial to do so as 
exemplified by the large reduction in bank loan interest charges. The exit from forward contracts incurred one off charges of £144,000.  
The fair value of the contract was estimated using relevant market interest rates. 48 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009

The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents, short term deposits and bank borrowings. The main purpose 
of these financial instruments is to finance the Group’s operations. The Group has other financial instruments which mainly comprise trade 
receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations.
Risk management is carried out by the finance department under policies approved by the board of directors. The Group finance department 
identifies, evaluates and manages financial risks. The board provides guidance on overall risk management including foreign exchange risk, 
interest rate risk, credit risk, and investment of excess liquidity.
The impact of the risks required to be discussed under IFRS 7 are detailed below:
M a r k e t	r i s k
( i )		F o r e i g n	e x c h a n g e	r i s k
Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not 
the group’s functional currency.  The Group has little exposure to foreign exchange risk.  
( i i )		P r i c e	r i s k
The Group is not exposed to equity securities price risk because no investments are held by the group.  The Group is not exposed to 
commodity price risk.
( i i i )		C a s h	fl o w	a n d	f a i r	v a l u e	i n t e r e s t	r a t e	r i s k
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk is respect of cash balances held with banks and other highly rated counterparties. 
The Group’s main interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.  Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to cash flow 
interest rate risk.  Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the group to fair value interest rate risk.  During 2009 and 2008, all the Group’s 
borrowings at variable rate were denominated in UK Sterling.
The Group no longer manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. 
With the large fall in interest rates over the financial year, the group exited from the strategy of using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps as 
it was financially beneficial to do so as exemplified by the large reduction in bank loan interest charges.

The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the reporting date, as 
summarised below:

Credit risk is managed on a group basis.  Credit risks arise from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions, 
as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.  
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.  It is the policy of the Group to present the amounts in the balance 
sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience and the current economic 
environment. The Group reviews the reliability of its customers on a regular basis, such a review takes into account the nature of and the 
Group’s trading history with the customer.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are three banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-
rating agencies. Management does not expect any losses from non-performance of these counterparties.
None of the Group’s financial assets are secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.
l i q u i d i t y	r i s k
The Group closely monitors its access to bank and other credit facilities in comparison to its outstanding commitments on a regular basis to 
ensure that it has sufficient funds to meet obligations of the group as they fall due.
The board receives regular debt management forecasts which estimate the cash inflows and outflows over the next twelve months, so that 
management can ensure that sufficient financing is in place as it is required.  Surplus cash within the Group is put on deposit in accordance 
with limits and counterparties agreed by the Board, the objective being to maximise return on funds whilst ensuring that the short-term 
cashflow requirements of the Group are met.
Detailed analysis of the debt facilities taken out and available to the group are disclosed in note 17. 50 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009

for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. In order to 
maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, 
issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debts.

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the company’s share price over the previous 3 years. The 
expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on the management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise 
restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The company recognised total expenses of £99,000 (2008 - £108,000) related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions during the 
year.

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Sections 495 and 496 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an

The accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and under the historical cost 
convention.
No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act, 2006.
The trade and assets of CAPS Solutions Limited and Plantech Limited have both been hived across to the fellow subsidiary company IDOX 
Software Limited.  As a result, the respective carrying values of Idox plc’s investments in CAPS Solutions Limited and Plantech Limited are not 
justified by the individual recoverable amounts of these entities.  However, a true and fair override is enacted to reflect that the value of the 
overall trade and assets now recorded within Idox Software Limited have not diminished and therefore no overall loss of value has occurred.
I nves t m e nt s
Investments, held as non-current assets, are included at cost less amounts written off for any permanent diminution in value.

All share-based payment arrangements granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested prior to 1 November 2006 are recognised in the 
financial statements.
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values.  Where employees 
are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of employees’ services are determined indirectly by reference to the fair value 
of the instrument granted to the employee.  This fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of non-market vesting 
conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets).
Employees to whom share options have been granted provide their services in subsidiary companies of IDOX plc.  All equity settled share-
based payments are recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account of the relevant subsidiary company.  In IDOX plc, the cost is 
allocated to investments in subsidiaries.
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best available 
estimate of the number of share options expected to vest.  Estimates are revised subsequently if there is any indication that the number 
of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates.  Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is recognised in the current 
period.  No adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options that have vested are not exercised.
Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital, and where 
appropriate share premium.
D e f e r r e d	t a x a t i o n
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences where the transactions or events that give the company an obligation to pay more tax 
in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred by the balance sheet date.  Deferred tax assets are recognised when it is 
more likely than not that they will be recovered.  Deferred tax is measured using rates of tax that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the balance sheet date.

Contributions paid to private pension plans of certain employees are charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which they

Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all of its financial liabilities.
Where the contractual obligations of financial instruments (including share capital) are equivalent to a similar debt instrument, those 
financial instruments are classed as financial liabilities. Financial liabilities are presented as such in the balance sheet. Finance costs and gains 
or losses relating to financial liabilities are included in the profit and loss account. Finance costs are calculated so as to produce a constant 
rate of return on the outstanding liability.
Where the contractual terms of share capital do not have any terms meeting the definition of a financial liability then this is classed as an 
equity instrument. Dividends and distributions relating to equity instruments are debited direct to equity.
Interest and expenditure arising on financial instruments is recognised on the accruals basis and credited or charged to the profit and loss 
account in the financial period to which it relates.  The Group does not apply FRS 26.
Operating leases
Amounts paid under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.

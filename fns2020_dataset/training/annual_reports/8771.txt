NEW DOS GROWTH
In line with recent years, Jimmy Choo plans to open 10 to 15 new 
stores per year. This store opening programme is weighted towards 
China, where we have historically been underpenetrated relative to 
many of our larger luxury peers. This store opening rate allows us to 
capture the growth potential of the white space while ensuring the 
quality of execution maintains the luxury positioning and brand image 
of Jimmy Choo. 
NEW STORE CONCEPT
Jimmy Choo’s retail portfolio has had a similar store design approach 
and materials since 1996. Jimmy Choo debuted a new store concept 
in 2014, developed with David Collins Studio and inspired by haute 
couture salons and fantasy shoe closets. This refreshes the look and 
feel of our stores, emphasises our luxury positioning and presents 
the fashion driven products in more space, while retaining the higher 
product densities in the key Choo 24:7 collection. The new concept 
integrates the dual gender product portfolio, helping with penetration 
of the men’s collection globally. 
EXISTING DOS RENOVATION
In addition to the new store roll-out programme, Jimmy Choo plans 
to refurbish 10 to 15 existing stores each year in the new store 
concept. This renovation programme is weighted towards our earliest 
markets of the US and Europe. While we have only recently opened 
the small number of renovated stores, the initial results are very 
positive and indicate that renovated stores in the new store concept 
outperform existing stores by a noticeable margin.
FLAGSHIP PROGRAMME
In addition to our boutiques and concessions we are planning 10 
flagship stores which are designed to be a more full expression of the 
Jimmy Choo brand in key locations. The New Bond Street and Beverly 
Hills flagship stores have already reopened. Future flagship stores are 
envisaged for New York, Milan, London, Paris, Hong Kong, Tokyo, 
Shanghai and Beijing, with the programme complete by the end of 
2017. The creation of these flagships will not entail increasing our 
number of DOS in any city, as it will be achieved by conversion and 
expansion of space in five existing stores and relocation to expanded 
space in five other locations. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014

CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014
STRATEGIC REPORT
19
2014 has been a major year in the development of Jimmy Choo. We 
have continued to grow the business, with revenue increasing 12.2% 
at constant currency through the creation of new exciting collections, 
opening new stores and driving like for like sales growth through our 
robust business. In addition to growing the business, we launched 
Jimmy Choo PLC on the London Stock Exchange in October 2014. 
We welcome our new shareholders to our first annual report as a 
public company and look forward to partnering with you in the 
years to come.
HISTORY & STRENGTHS
Jimmy Choo is a 21
st
 century accessories brand with shoes at its 
heart, with a focus on glamour, style authority, craftsmanship, 
luxury positioning and a distinctive iconic brand. 
Jimmy Choo’s journey started in 1996 from an entrepreneurial start-up 
partnership, where a combination of the shoes of Mr. Jimmy Choo, 
OBE and the drive and inspiration of Tamara Mellon, OBE, created 
a luxury footwear phenomenon. They opened the first store in 1996, 
in Motcomb Street in London SW1, and sold 3,000 pairs of the 
first ready-to-wear shoe collection, with Mr. Jimmy Choo’s niece, 
Sandra Choi, serving as the company’s Creative Director, a role  
she still holds today. 
In 1998, Jimmy Choo opened its first boutique in New York City, 
followed by Los Angeles. Jimmy Choo became an innovator in 
Hollywood, being the first accessory brand to offer award nominees 
and presenters customised shoes for their red carpet appearances. 
The brand’s presence on the red carpet helped to create a global 
following and to make it a favoured brand among celebrities, 
supermodels and royalty.
Throughout its history, Jimmy Choo has been identified by the media 
as a key element of the fashion zeitgeist, with prominence in films 
and television such as “Sex and the City” in 1999, “The Devil Wears 
Prada” in 2006 and the Korean show “My Love from the Star” 
in 2013.
There followed a sustained period of strong retail expansion 
supported by private equity ownership. In 2011, when JAB Luxury 
GmbH (“JAB Luxury”) acquired Jimmy Choo, we had a vision of a 
long term continued growth strategy built upon the amazing brand 
and people in the business, underpinned by significant new 
investment in systems and processes. 
JAB Luxury recognised Jimmy Choo as a world class brand, 
operating in an attractive market, with a strong design, 
merchandising, production and distribution platform, supported  
by a 360 degree communication programme. 
Luxury shoes are an incredibly complex category, with a range of 
functions (pumps, boots, sandals, wedges, sneakers) each at various 
heel heights, each in a number of colours and materials and each in 
a range of sizes. This complexity means that in order to grow beyond 
a certain point, systems and processes need to be sophisticated and 
scalable, which requires significant investment behind the scenes. 
Taking Jimmy Choo out of private equity hands in 2011 provided the 
environment for that core investment to commence.
In order to position Jimmy Choo for the next stage of development, 
significant investment has been undertaken to restructure and 
strengthen the business, including talent management and in 
systems and logistics. Jimmy Choo has been able to finance this 
investment through inherently strong cash flow and improvements 
in underlying margin. Whilst these investments have resulted in an 
increase in operating costs and reduced reported operating margin 
in recent years, we believe that they have provided the business 
with the requisite scale and operating leverage to generate significant 
profit growth into the future.
This investment phase is nearing completion and we look forward 
to the new systems backbone not only supporting long term growth 
in what is a complex category, but also enabling us to move to an 
omnichannel model in the near term. In addition, the regional offices 
in New York, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Beijing, Paris and Milan provide the 
distribution network with the support and drive to grow the global 
footprint profitably.
IPO
JAB Luxury have invested in the Jimmy Choo business for the long 
term. While JAB Luxury intend to remain majority shareholders of the 
business for the foreseeable future, we believe that bringing outside 
investors in and exposing the company to public scrutiny ensures the 
best governance to drive long term growth and helps to promote the 
brand and incentivise the team. 
OPENING THE LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE 22 OCTOBER 2014
Continuing the journey of the company, we therefore launched 
Jimmy Choo PLC on the London Stock Exchange on 22 October 2014 
(“Admission”). It was a time of turmoil in the markets, with the FTSE 
100 falling by 9% over the marketing period. However, we were 
looking for long term partners in the future of Jimmy Choo, and the 
investors we met recognised that the fundamentals of the business 
behind the Jimmy Choo brand are strong. As a result, we priced the 
IPO within the original price range, despite the fluctuations of the 
wider market. We are very pleased with the calibre of the investors 
who have joined us in owning Jimmy Choo PLC.  JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014

OVERVIEW OF RESULTS
We are very pleased with the strong performance of the business in 
2014. Revenue increased by 12.2% on a constant currency basis and 
6.4% on a reported basis. Our well invested business demonstrated 
its operational gearing potential, with adjusted EBITDA growing by 
7.2% to £50.2m and adjusted EBT growing by 19.8% to £28.3m. 
BOARD COMPOSITION
In order to support our CEO Pierre Denis, our CFO Jonathan Sinclair 
and the senior management team in running the day to day 
operations of the company, we have brought together an international 
Board of Directors with extensive experience of running public 
companies in a global environment. Between us, we have experience 
of luxury goods, retail and consumer goods from small cap to global 
large cap companies. We believe that by using that wealth of 
experience to help monitor and guide the path of the management 
of the company, we will ensure that the growth Jimmy Choo has 
produced to date will continue for the foreseeable future. On 
5 March 2015, Judith Sprieser informed me that she had decided 
to step down from the Board for personal reasons unrelated to the 
Company. We are grateful to Judith for the input and support she 
has provided to the Company since the IPO in October. We are sad 
to see her leave the Board, but understand her reasons for making 
this decision and we fully support her. Please see page 46 for an 
introduction to the high calibre individuals who have joined Pierre, 
Jonathan and me on the Board.
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
CONTINUED
GOVERNANCE
We believe that good corporate governance is the key to good 
businesses continuing to grow profitably for the long term. 
The Board is mindful of the need to protect and promote the interests 
of the Company’s new minority investors. We believe the Board and 
its Committees, with the addition of the independent Non-Executive 
Directors (Gianluca Brozzetti, David Poulter and Bob Singer) provide 
the appropriate corporate governance balance in light of the interests 
of both the majority shareholder and new minority shareholders.  
The Audit and Risk Committee consists solely of independent 
directors and the Board has also established a Conflicts Committee 
to help manage the relationship between the Company and our 
majority shareholder.
OUTLOOK
We continue to pursue our overall growth strategy of focussing on 
the design of high quality collections which resonate with our clients 
and growth in the retail business through like for like growth and 
opening additional stores with a focus on Asia ex-Japan and Japan. 
We are rolling out 10 to 15 new DOS, with a focus on China, and 
renovating 10 to 15 of our existing portfolio of DOS in the new store 
concept. Japan and Asia ex-Japan continue to grow well, while 
EMEA remains impacted by a reduction in Russian travellers. We 
continue to see outperformance by stores in the new store concept.
We remain focused on executing our growth strategy and pursuing 
growth without compromising our brand or its luxury position, 
despite the more challenging macroeconomic environment. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014

OUR MARKET
LUXURY SHOE MARKET GROWTH
Luxury shoes are a fast-growing segment of the luxury market with 
an estimated sales compound growth rate from 2008 to 2013 of 
10%, compared to the luxury market excluding shoes which had 
a compound growth rate of 5% over the same period.
We believe that the strong historical growth experienced in the luxury 
shoe market is a result of a number of factors.
OPTIMAL GATEWAY
Shoes are available at a psychologically accessible price. This makes 
them an optimal gateway into the luxury market, compared to many 
other luxury goods.
ACCESSORISATION
Over recent years, consumers have been buying ready-to-wear 
apparel from high street retailers and then upgrading their wardrobe 
with luxury shoes, bags and other accessories.
ACCESSORISATION

FOCUS OF RETAILERS ON LUXURY SHOES
Luxury brands and multibrand retailers have both increased their 
focus on shoes in recent years and, as a consequence, many 
department stores have considerably expanded their shoe floors.

INCREASING PARTICIPATION OF MEN IN LUXURY
It has widely been noted in the media that men are becoming more 
hedonistic and opinionated on fashion matters and that, over recent 
years, there has been an increasing trend for male clients to purchase 
luxury fashion goods for themselves. We believe that the male 
segments of the luxury goods market, in particular luxury shoes, 
are under-represented by leading luxury brands. Luxury fashion 
companies are beginning to address this opportunity, with some 
market participants launching men only stores as well as expanding 
their product offering for men, including shoes.
MEN’S LUXURY SHOES
KIT HARRINGTON IN JIMMY CHOO MEN’S 
AUTUMN WINTER 2014 ADVERTISING
LUXURY SHOE SPECIALIST BRANDS
Luxury shoes have outperformed the general luxury market in 
recent years. Luxury shoe specialist brands have outperformed the 
luxury shoe market. We believe that luxury shoe specialist brands 
experienced compound revenue growth from 2008 to 2012 of 13% 
compared to 9% for the luxury shoe market as a whole. During this 
same period, Jimmy Choo delivered reported compound revenue 
growth of 22%.
The luxury shoe business is very complex, with a variety of sizes, 
heel heights, materials and colours. Successfully mastering this 
complexity requires a constant and dedicated focus. We believe 
luxury shoe specialist brands, like Jimmy Choo, are strongly 
positioned to offer this.
We believe that the increase in market share by luxury shoe specialist 
brands from 41% in 2008 to 44% in 2012, is a result of, amongst 
other things, the fragmented nature of the market. As a result of 
this fragmentation, there remains significant scope for luxury shoe 
specialist brands like Jimmy Choo to continue outperforming the 
luxury shoe market as a whole.
LUXURY SHOE MARKET RESILIENCE
We believe that the luxury shoe market is one of the more resilient 
segments of the luxury goods market. During the global financial 
crisis of 2008 and 2009, luxury shoes sales decreased 4%, 
compared to a total market decrease of 8%. Over this same 
period, Jimmy Choo revenue increased by 2%. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014

Jimmy Choo has the merchandising, design, supply chain, 
communication and retail skills and assets to outperform in this 
attractive and complex category by superior execution. Jimmy Choo 
has a strong position in the luxury shoe market, being one of a very 
small number of luxury shoe specialist brands with the requisite 
scale to compete globally.
DEDICATED AND EXPERIENCED MANAGEMENT
The Group is run by a passionate and experienced senior 
management team with a degree of focus on execution which we 
believe can only be achieved by a pure play luxury goods company.
The Group has appointed a highly experienced and dedicated 
management team, comprising established Jimmy Choo incumbents 
together with new management who have a long and successful 
history of working in the luxury goods sector. The management team 
is led by Pierre Denis, CEO, who joined Jimmy Choo in 2012 with 
more than 25 years of experience in the luxury industry and a deep 
knowledge of Asian markets.
LEADING DESIGN TEAM THAT DRIVES PRODUCT AUTHORITY
Jimmy Choo’s design team of twelve is led by Sandra Choi,  
who has been Creative Director for the Group since its inception. 
Jimmy Choo’s design team has a proven track record of developing 
Sandra’s conceptual visions into beautiful products multiple times 
each year through a structured process encompassing line plans, 
designs, prototypes, edits and pre-launch samples.
SANDRA CHOI
SOLE CREATIVE DIRECTOR
Jimmy Choo’s design team is at the forefront of the industry in terms 
of its ability to interpret fashion trends. This provides clients with a 
very broad product range that addresses all categories and functions 
of the luxury shoe offering, including evening, day, catwalk and 
boots, and the full spectrum of client tastes.
MERCHANDISING EXCELLENCE
Jimmy Choo’s merchandising model is designed to nourish the 
brand through innovation and drive footfall through timely delivery 
of fashion-forward products, underpinned by a continuative core 
of iconic products which are continuously reviewed and refreshed. 
The product calendar is managed to create a structured flow of new 
products into our DOS and multibrand networks which drives editorial 
focus, footfall and conversion into sales. The calendar is based 
around multiple collection drops per year, with the continuative 
core Choo 24:7 collection complementing the seasonal offerings.
Designing successful collections and managing the complexity 
of multiple collection drops each year relies upon the seamless 
interaction, integration and cooperation between Jimmy Choo’s 
merchandising, design, supply chain, brand communication and 
distribution teams. The success of this collaboration is shown in 
Jimmy Choo’s track record of offering a considerable depth and 
breadth in its collections, in terms of functions, heel heights, 
materials, sizes and colours. We have been able to leverage our 
expertise to replicate this model across our accessory offering.
BESPOKE SUPPLY CHAIN FOR PRODUCT EXCELLENCE
Jimmy Choo operates a lean and flexible supply chain outsourcing 
production and logistics to gain flexibility and speed in bringing 
products to market. Those elements which protect the brand are 
owned and managed by Jimmy Choo, including quality, vendor liaison 
and product development which are managed through Studio Luxury 
S.r.l., which was acquired by Jimmy Choo on 5 August 2014. 
Jimmy Choo produces over one million units per annum in its supply 
chain. Materials research and sourcing, product development, 
engineering, production planning and control, quality assurance, 
as well as customer service and after sales are all controlled by 
Jimmy Choo.
In order to produce luxury shoes with a high quality finish, 
Jimmy Choo partners with suppliers with the specific skill sets 
to match each particular shoe style. Accordingly, Jimmy Choo’s 
products are produced by specialists in the Florence and Veneto 
regions of Italy, with the exception of espadrilles, which are made 
in Spain. In addition to providing specialist skills, this multi-supplier 
strategy provides scalability, flexibility and speed to market, as well 
as diversifying risk. This model enables the Group to drive gross 
margin improvement through early deliveries of new collections 
and inventory control resulting in lower markdowns. 
Jimmy Choo’s online infrastructure was re-launched in November 
2013, with a new flexible and powerful platform to enable the roll 
out of online sites in new countries while retaining a core backbone 
to deliver excellent customer service. The Jimmy Choo online 
store represents Jimmy Choo’s largest single DOS within the 
retail segment. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014

More importantly, our online presence provides a powerful route to 
engage with new potential clients and for clients to begin a purchase 
process which may be completed in one of Jimmy Choo’s boutiques. 
As Jimmy Choo invests in supply chain infrastructure to move 
towards an integrated omnichannel model, the online platform 
will increase the integration within the retail channel.
We expect to benefit from our systems and logistics investment, 
which includes: continued development of the online platform, new 
point of sales infrastructure, a new centralised warehouse, SAP 
implementation and product lifecycle management, many of which 
are already in place and virtually all of which have become operational 
with the opening of our Swiss warehouse in March 2015. These new 
investments will significantly enhance service and product availability, 
streamline inventory management and improve our operating margin. 
360° COMMUNICATION STRATEGY FUELS THE BRAND
Jimmy Choo’s status as a globally recognised luxury brand is a result 
of our entrepreneurial and dynamic approach to brand communication. 
The Group applies an all encompassing brand communication strategy 
which includes celebrity placement, editorial and digital influencer 
engagement, product advertising, launch events and store layout 
and display.
We adopt this approach to all our new product launches and our 
success has resulted in Jimmy Choo currently being the top ranked 
brand globally in editorial for luxury women’s shoes. We have gained 
10.7 million social media followers as of 31 December 2014; and, 
attained recognition globally through high-profile product placements, 
most notably in “Sex and the City” in 1999 and more recently in the 
Korean series “My Love from the Star” which has elevated the brand 
significantly throughout Asia.

Jimmy Choo’s brand communication spend has significantly 
increased over the last three years. This has positioned the Group 
alongside our larger luxury brand peers and is a level of spend as 
a proportion of revenue which is within appropriate parameters for 
a leading luxury shoe brand.
DISTRIBUTION
Jimmy Choo has successful and effective distribution networks 
with significant opportunity for expansion. In addition, Jimmy Choo 
benefits from having a balanced multichannel distribution network 
with our retail DOS network at the core. 
Jimmy Choo has a particularly strong presence in EMEA, USA and 
Japan, with a growing footprint in the rest of Asia. The Group has 
experienced strong growth in recent years across all of these 
markets. 2014 has been a particularly transformational year for our 
DOS network, as we launched our new store concept, continued the 
store roll-out programme and began a comprehensive renovation 
programme of our existing portfolio. By the end of 2014, we had 
125 DOS, of which 15 were in the new store concept. See page 17 
for the progress we have made in our retail network.
As part of our DOS strategy, the Group has invested significantly in 
our online platform, which has experienced strong revenue growth in 
recent years. This investment, together with the broader investments 
in the supply chain, is expected to result in the Group being able to 
provide an omnichannel client offering in the medium term. 
The Group continues to benefit from our strong multibrand distribution 
offering, which provides attractive economics and acts as a lead 
indicator of collection success and a benchmark against competitors. 
The Group’s franchise channel acts as an important entry model into 
new markets. These serve as a potential springboard to expanding the 
DOS network once the new region has become established. This has 
already been demonstrated by successful joint venture (“JV”) and 
franchise buyouts in Japan, Hong Kong and China between 2011 
and 2013.

STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK
Our goal is to pursue growth without compromising Jimmy Choo’s 
brand. This is achieved by successful product collections driving 
positive like for like sales, opening new DOS, and expansion in 
Asia and selected new markets. 
Shoes are at the heart of Jimmy Choo and will remain the core 
offering. Shoes represent three quarters of revenue, which we 
do not expect to change substantially. Jimmy Choo is a specialist 
luxury shoe company focused on growing our relationship with our 
customers and clients. Growth will always be pursued within the 
context of protecting the Jimmy Choo brand identity and luxury 
positioning. We believe that Jimmy Choo’s unique brand DNA and 
experienced design team will enable us to continue to deliver 
collections that resonate strongly with our clients.
We aim to deliver earnings growth and returns through focusing on 
growth ahead of the market and margin expansion, together with 
good cash flow conversion.
REVENUE GROWTH
Revenue growth is supported by the store opening programme, 
through which the Group plans to open 10 to 15 stores per year, 
as well as the rollout of the recently introduced new store concept 
across the estate. In addition to our DOS expansion plans, we intend 
to pursue growth through our multibrand, franchise and JV channels. 
All of these are important for Jimmy Choo’s business model as they 
provide access to new markets.
Our aim is to grow towards a regional mix more in line with the wider 
luxury market through growth in Asia and selected new markets, 
while maintaining our presence in EMEA and USA. Jimmy Choo’s 
revenue growth strategy is focused around the following key pillars:
• Market outperformance: we believe that Jimmy Choo’s client 
insight, design approach and systems that it has developed as 
a specialist will enable us to outperform the wider luxury market. 
Jimmy Choo has the right specialist resource, knowhow, skills 
and people to excel in this attractive and complex category.
• Like for like growth: through continued strong performance of our 
collections and investment in our DOS network, with selected 
openings, relocations and new store concept renovations in 
Jimmy Choo’s existing developed markets of Europe, USA 
and Japan.
• Retail led growth driven by:
 – door growth opportunity: expansion of DOS in Greater China, 
where Jimmy Choo is currently under-represented compared 
to our peers, and potential franchise buyouts and JVs in 
incumbent fast growing markets, including the Middle East, 
South Korea, Singapore and Malaysia. It is expected that half 
to two-thirds of Jimmy Choo’s DOS development will be in 
China each year.
 – Online: the Group will continue our investment in online which 
has proved to be one of the key elements of growth in the 
current environment. Recent investments into the supply chain 
and systems upgrades are expected to position the Group to 
participate in the growth of the global online trade, and provide 
an omnichannel distribution offering in the medium term.
• Wholesale entry: explore potential franchise opportunities in new 
markets where Jimmy Choo currently has a limited presence, 
particularly in Latin America and Eastern Europe, alongside 
continued development of our existing business.
MARGIN EXPANSION
The revenue growth initiatives described above, together with 
increased control over distribution, are designed to drive margin 
improvement in the business. The opex impact of the investment 
in systems and logistics is now complete and the business is scaled 
for growth. Direct costs will grow broadly in line with retail revenue 
and indirect costs will grow slower than overall revenue. The new 
systems and logistics investment will help the management team 
to improve inventory efficiency, thereby reducing markdowns and 
increasing cash flow. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014

JIMMY CHOO TO OUTPERFORM THE  
MARKET FOR THE LONG TERM
PIERRE DENIS
JIMMY CHOO CEO JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014
STRATEGIC REPORT
29
This has been a year of great progress for the Group from a financial, 
strategic and operational perspective. 
In what has been a challenging year for the industry, Jimmy Choo 
has  performed strongly in 2014, with double digit revenue growth at 
constant currency driven by a mix of like for like growth from strong 
product authority and retail excellence, new store openings with 
a focus on China and continued growth in partnership with our 
wholesale customers. Revenue grew by 12.2% on a constant 
currency basis (6.4% on a reported currency basis) to £299.7m in 
2014, driven by strong performance in both ladies’ and men’s shoes. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin grew to 16.8% despite significant currency 
headwinds, demonstrating the operating leverage of the business.
PRODUC TS
Our focus on shoes and dedication to product quality has ensured we 
continued to produce innovative products which resonate strongly 
with our clients around the world. 
As a luxury accessories brand, design and quality is everything. The 
brand positioning is nurtured and the DNA is expressed through the 
products we design and produce. 2014 was a strong year for us from 
a design perspective. The resonance of our collections with our 
clients is apparent in achieving revenue growth ahead of the market. 
We also received external validation of this at Paris Fashion Week in 
2014, where Sandra Choi and Jimmy Choo won Marie Claire’s Prix 
d’Excellence de la Mode Award for best shoe collection. 
Shoes continue to be at the heart of the brand, representing three 
quarters of the business. In accessories, evening bags and small 
leather goods (“SLG”) continued to perform well.
CHOO 24:7
The iconic Choo 24:7 collection which forms the Jimmy Choo 
woman’s perfect wardrobe of shoes underpins our business, forming 
roughly half of our shoe sales. The balance between our continuative 
and seasonal collections is one of the key elements of our 
merchandising strategy. We introduced new colours and fabrics in 
our iconic shoe styles in line with the seasonal collections. This 
maintains the cohesion of our seasonal look and feel and introduces 
newness into the continuative collection. 
CHOO.0 8°
In 2014, we launched a new collection called CHOO.08°, creating 
a cohesive collection based around boots and sneakers with a cool 
London feel. While many of the product elements of CHOO.08° 
were already in our Fashion and Weekend collections, bringing them 
together into a single collection allows us to present the biker cool 
and daring side of the brand DNA in a cohesive way, with tailored 
advertising and events. The response to CHOO.08° has been very 
positive, especially with our Asian and European clients. 
MADE TO ORDER
In order to enhance the luxury positioning of the brand and create a 
more bespoke offering for our clients, we launched Made To Order 
shoes in 2014. Clients can have a pair of shoes made, choosing from 
a range of designs and heel heights, fabric colour or skin and 
personalise them with their initials on the sole.
Made to Order was originally offered in selected stores from early 
in the year. Subsequently, the enhanced online platform has allowed 
us to roll the Made to Order service out across the retail website, 
providing a much wider footprint. 
JIMMYCHOO.COM

VICES
In addition to our usual seasonal collections, Creative Director 
Sandra Choi produced an exciting limited edition capsule collection 
with contemporary artist Mat Collishaw. The collection united 
Sandra Choi’s personal fascination with jewels with an exploration 
of themes of envy, seduction and the irrepressible yearning for 
objects of beauty. 
MEN
Men’s continued to be our strongest growth category, representing 
5% of revenue. We launched the first ever shoe fashion show in 
2014, building upon the remarkable growth of the men’s luxury shoe 
market and showcasing our fashion forward credentials in the space. 
The event was a great success, with Kit Harrington, Tinie Tempah 
and Jack Guinness amongst the guests.
In addition, we launched Jimmy Choo Man, our first male fragrance, 
with our partners InterParfums SA. The fragrance has performed 
well above our expectations, further demonstrating the appeal of 
the brand image in the rapidly expanding men’s luxury space.  JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014

DISTRIBUTION
We launched a new store concept, developed with David Collins 
Studio and inspired by haute couture salons and fantasy shoe closets. 
This refreshes the look and feel of our stores, emphasises the luxury 
positioning of the brand and presents the fashion driven products in 
more space, while retaining the higher product densities in the key 
Choo 24:7 collection. Client response has been very positive.
NEW STORE CONCEPT
NEW BOND STREET
We continued to drive our retail channel expansion, with a net nine 
new DOS opened in the period. The focus of our retail expansion 
remains in Asia, where we are under-represented relative to our 
luxury peers.
RENOVATIONS AND 
RELOCATIONS

NEW DOS

In addition, we began to renovate our existing store portfolio in the 
new store concept. We began with our Beverly Hills flagship, which 
reopened in early 2014 and completed 14 stores in the new concept 
by the end of the year. While it is still early days, we are greatly 
encouraged by the results to date, with the newly renovated stores 
consistently outperforming the rest of the portfolio. 
The reopening of our New Bond Street global flagship was a highlight 
of the year. Now covering three floors, the New Bond Street 
Townhouse gives us the space to present the fullest expression 
of the Jimmy Choo brand.
We intend to continue the renovation programme, with 10 to 15 
renovations per annum in addition to the new store openings, all 
of which will be in the new store concept.
ASIAN GROWTH OPPORTUNITY
Our growth potential in Asia was one of the opportunities which 
initially attracted me to Jimmy Choo. The luxury market in China has 
been driven by a relatively small number of global brands with broad 
product offerings. Women’s luxury shoes was not a large player in 
this initial wave of luxury consumption, focusing more on gifting 
items purchased by largely male clients. What we have seen in the 
last few years is a shift towards non-logo brands purchased by 
affluent women for their own consumption.
In order to capitalise upon this opportunity, we have focused our 
Chinese growth strategy by buying out our franchise partner in 2012, 
opening Jimmy Choo offices in Hong Kong and Shanghai in order 
to manage the operations in the region effectively and introducing 
focused brand communication messages tailored for the 
Chinese market.
As with “Sex in the City” in the nineties and the “Devil Wears Prada” 
in the following decade, Jimmy Choo’s style and product authority 
continues to catch the fashion zeitgeist. Our products were featured 
in a 2013 storyline of “My Love From the Star”, a popular television 
series in Korea. Korean media has an incredible influence on the 
Asian region as a whole and China in particular, and this alongside 
the focused brand communication in the region has transformed our 
Chinese brand awareness. The shoe featured in the story line has 
been a global best seller and continues to outstrip our expectations. 
The focused strategy in the region has been successful, with very 
strong growth rates in our stores on the ground in China and 
travelling Chinese becoming our second largest travelling client 
group, behind Russians.

There is a much larger growth opportunity for Jimmy Choo in China 
and the wider Asian region, where we remain underpenetrated 
relative to much of the wider luxury market. This includes Japan, 
which remains one of our fastest growing regions. We plan to 
continue to open the majority of our new stores each year in China. 
We have changed franchise partners in Korea, and intend to begin 
the process of forming a JV there in the coming year. This, alongside 
further JVs in Singapore and Malaysia, will allow us to focus and drive 
our growth in the region as we have done in Japan and China.
INVESTMENT IN SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES
During the year we consolidated jimmychoo.com on our new 
platform, increasing our flexibility and ability to leverage our online 
sales platform as we move towards an omnichannel model. 
The improvements made to the online platform and our digital 
communication resulted in L2Digital rating Jimmy Choo as “Gifted” 
in 2014, which underlines the preparations we are making for the 
future development of omnichannel. We also continued to implement 
SAP in our regional operations and began the roll out of elements of 
Product Lifecycle Management (“PLM”), to bring together everything 
from initial sketches and materials research through to prototyping, 
orders, production and reorders into a single system.
2015 will continue this transformation programme, with the near 
final stage of the SAP roll-out and moving into the central global 
distribution centre in Switzerland. This will represent a key stage 
in the development of our omnichannel capability. We plan to be 
initiating trials of the first stages of omnichannel delivery in 2016. 
I would like to take the opportunity to thank all of our stakeholders for 
their contribution to this year’s strong results. I would especially like 
to thank our employees across the business for their hard work in this 
transformational year. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014

Total 299.7 100.0% 281.5 100.0%
Revenue increased by 6.4%, or 12.2% on a constant currency basis, 
with continued growth across all segments. Retail grew ahead of 
wholesale, in line with our previously stated strategic aim of retail 
led growth and for 2014 represented just over 64.4% of revenue.
In 2014 retail revenue grew by 8.8% to £192.9m as a result of like  
for like growth of 5.7% and the addition of a net nine new DOS, half 
of which were opened in China. In constant currency terms, retail 
revenue grew by 15.4% in 2014. Like for like sales were also 
positively impacted by the roll out of the new store concept, with  
10 existing stores refurbished or relocated in the year and a total  
of 14 stores trading in the new concept at the year end. The early 
indications from the refurbishments undertaken in the year are that 
the new store concept helps to drive noticeably improved like for  
like sales.
Our wholesale business also performed well, although growth was 
held back by adverse movements in the US dollar exchange rate 
against sterling during the year, as a significant proportion of our 
wholesale accounts are denominated in US dollars. In constant 
currency terms, wholesale revenue grew by 6.3% during 2014, 
compared to 1.9% at reported rates. On an underlying basis we 
saw organic growth within existing key wholesale accounts as  
well as the opening of a further 8 franchise stores.
Asia remains our strongest growth region. Asia ex-Japan grew by 
34.5%, with strong acceptance of our collections and increasing 
brand penetration driving like for like sales growth supported by  
our continued build out of new stores. Despite the extent of the 
devaluation of the Yen, our Japanese business grew by 8.8%, with  
a strong response to the launch of CHOO.08º. Growth in these was 
further stimulated by the interest generated in Jimmy Choo from the 
Korean soap “My Love from the Star”. EMEA grew by 4.7%, despite 
reduced activity by travelling clients, as the marked currency shifts 
impacted behaviour and travel restrictions on Russians reduced  
foot fall offset by growth in travelling Chinese clients. Americas 
performed in line with expectations, up 0.6% despite currency 
headwind for most of the year and a number of temporary store 
closures as we began to roll out the new store concept. 
Other revenues were positively impacted this year by the launch of 
Jimmy Choo Man, our first men’s fragrance, which was very well 
received following its launch in August 2014 and has outstripped 
expectations consistently since launch.
At a product level we continued to see volume growth in both shoes 
and accessories, with shoes representing approximately three 
quarters of revenue for the year. Men’s remains the fastest growing 
category and represents around 5% of revenue.
GROSS MARGIN
Gross margin continued to improve on an underlying basis from 
increased buying volumes and the favourable shift in channel mix in 
the year. However this was impacted by strong currency headwinds 
for most of the year, especially in relation to adverse movements in 
the US dollar, Euro and Japanese exchange rates against sterling. As 
a result reported gross margin reduced from 62.3% in 2013 to 61.8% 
in 2014.
COSTS
Overall, total costs charged in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA increased 
by 5.1% in 2014, compared to a 6.4% growth in total revenue in the 
same period.
Selling and distribution expenses increased by £9.6m (13.1%) in 
2014, reflecting the impact of the addition of new stores and the 
variable costs incurred in connection with the operation of the 
Group’s website. Retail costs were also negatively impacted by 
£0.8m of increased costs during the refurbishments of the New Bond 
Street and Beverly Hills flagship locations. We also incurred £0.4m of 
costs in relation to stores due to open in subsequent years. Excluding 
these two elements costs rose by 11.4% in 2014 compared to the 
previous year.
Brand communication benefitted from the achievement of significant 
economies of scale having insourced our media production. We also 
grew our media presence and were ranked consistently as number 1 
in global editorial ranking for luxury shoes. In addition we were 
ranked as “Gifted” for our digital presence by the digital agency L2 
with our social presence being rated “Genius”. We launched Kit 
Harrington as our key male personality which coincided with our first 
catwalk show in London in June 2014. All of this was achieved with 
spend just under 4.7% of revenue and £2.8m (16.6%) lower 
expenditure than the previous year.
Overheads for 2014 were £37.9m, down 0.8% or £0.3m compared to 
the prior year, reflecting tight cost control now that the replatforming 
of the business is largely complete and savings due to movements in 
foreign exchange rates. As a percentage of revenue, overheads fell 
from 13.6% in 2013 to 12.6% in 2014. 
Exceptional costs of £13.0m (2013: £6.0m) were incurred during 
the year, of which £7.8m (2013: £nil) were IPO related costs. The 
remaining exceptional costs included replatforming costs of £3.6m 
(2013: £3.4m) and acquisition and integration costs of £1.6m 
(2013: £2.6m). Refer to note 5 of the financial statements for

FINANCIAL REVIEW

PROFITS AND EARNINGS
In 2014 Adjusted EBITDA grew by £3.4m or 7.2% compared to the 
prior year, with Adjusted EBITDA margin increasing from 16.6% to 
16.8%. This represents a strong result for the Group in a year which 
saw significant foreign exchange headwind and is clear evidence that 
one of the Group’s strategic financial goals, the widening of EBITDA 
margins, is already being delivered. 
Depreciation and amortisation increased from £11.8m in 2013 to 
£14.9m in 2014, an increase of £3.1m or 26.3% as a result of the 
investment in new stores, refurbishment of flagship stores and 
improvements to the Group’s information systems. Depreciation rose 
from 54.0% to 54.8% of capital expenditure in 2014 compared to the 
previous year.
In 2014 Adjusted EBIT grew more modestly than Adjusted EBITDA,  
as expected, increasing by 0.9% compared to the prior year as a 
result of the additional depreciation and amortisation charges 
described above. 
Adjusted EBT for the year was £28.3m (2013: £23.6m). In addition to 
the growth in Adjusted EBIT described above we realised a net gain 
on realised and unrealised foreign exchange of £1.8m (2013: net loss 
of £4.0m) and financing charges of £8.8m (2013: £7.5m). The 
increased financing charges in the year represented the fair value 
of the open currency swaps at the year end, excluding which 
financing charges fell by £4.5m or 38.4% in 2014 compared 
to the previous year. 
Adjusted consolidated net income for the year was £22.9m 
compared to £21.0m in the preceding period, generating Adjusted 
EPS of 6.1 pence per share in 2014 (2013: 5.6 pence).

1 Adjusted operating cash flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA plus/minus non-cash charges 
in respect of share-based payments, realised and unrealised foreign exchange gains and 
losses on the revaluation of monetary items and working capital. Working capital is defined 
as the sum of changes in trade and other receivables, inventories, trade and other payables 
and provisions.
2 Cash conversion is defined as Adjusted operating cash flow (as defined above) divided by 
Adjusted EBITDA.
Cash conversion decreased from 97.4% of Adjusted EBITDA in 2013 
to 92.2% of Adjusted EBITDA in 2014, largely as a result of the 
investment in working capital during the year as we have built 
inventory to support the expansion of the store portfolio.
Free operating cash flow decreased from an inflow of £8.8m in 2013 
to an outflow of £4.1m largely due to the impact of exceptional 
payments associated with the IPO.

facility from JAB Luxury to equity in October 2014 prior to IPO.
Excluding the impact of the conversion of the shareholder credit 
facility, net debt increased from £121.9m to £125.6m, principally due 
to the timing of drawdowns on the revolving credit facility to fund IPO 
related costs. As at 31 December 2014 we had drawn down £5.5m 
on the revolving credit facility (2013: £nil). During 2014 we prepaid 
£13.3m in respect of our term loans, made net drawings of £5.5m 
on the capital expenditure facility and repaid other debt of £1.7m. 
BALANCE SHEET
During the year, total assets increased by £26.1m to £759.0m at 
31 December 2014. Non-current assets increased by £15.2m to 
£647.7m due to an increase of £11.8m in tangible fixed assets as 
a result of investment in new stores and the replatforming of the 
Group’s information systems. Additional deferred tax assets of 
£3.1m were recognised in the year in respect of share based 
payments and the sale of inventory between Group entities. Current 
assets increased by £10.9m to £111.3m primarily due to an increase 
in inventory and trade receivables, offset by a lower cash balance.
Total liabilities reduced by £443.7m to £314.8m at 31 December 
2014. Non-current liabilities decreased by £458.9m to £199.5m as 
a result of the conversion of the £460.5m shareholder credit facility 
(carrying value as at 31 December 2013) to equity prior to IPO in 
October 2014. In addition we made prepayments of £13.3m against 
our non-current term loans during the year. This was partially 
offset by the acquisition of own shares from JAB Luxury by the 
Jimmy Choo PLC Employee Benefit Trust during the year. The 
consideration for the shares, £16.7m, will fall due for payment 
when awards to employees vest in accordance with the terms 
of the share awards. Current liabilities increased by £15.1m to 
£115.3m at 31 December 2014, mainly due to an increase in 
trade and other payables. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014
STRATEGIC REPORT

SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS
Jimmy Choo’s Board, Senior Management and employees recognise 
the importance of reducing our impact on the environment and 
increasing our positive social impact both in the regions in which we 
operate and in a wider global context. Sustainability has always been 
part of our thinking and we have implemented a wide variety of 
sustainability initiatives at a local level. We are always thinking about 
how we can create a more sustainable business and to this end we 
have started to create a global sustainability strategy and policy. 
We look forward to exploring how we can make further changes and 
leverage our existing sustainability initiatives across the business. 
CHARITABLE ACTIVITY
Jimmy Choo has a rich history of innovation, not only in design but 
in its collaborations with artists and charities. Jimmy Choo adopts 
a policy of working with local charities in markets where this is 
established practice and undertakes frequent charity events in which 
a portion of the sales are donated to a local charity. These events, 
particularly in the USA, allow Jimmy Choo to connect with the 
community and deliver on our values of contributing to the 
communities which it serves. Total donations in 2014 to charities 
amounted to £0.2m.
THE JIMMY CHOO FOUNDATION
In 2011 we launched The Jimmy Choo Foundation (the 
“Foundation”), a non-profit charitable trust that empowers women 
through education to enhance livelihoods. The Foundation was 
established following the ideals of the Jimmy Choo brand which has 
through history striven to offer women the confidence and optimism 
to dream and achieve. The Foundation focuses on building 
confidence and independence through education and economic 
opportunity. To date, the Foundation has raised funds from the sale 
of Jimmy Choo’s Icons collection and The Jimmy Choo XV Book. 
The Trustees of the Foundation are Pierre Denis, Sandra Choi, 
Jonathan Sinclair and Hannah Merritt.
ENVIRONMENT 
Jimmy Choo has a commitment to meeting high environmental 
standards in its operations and throughout its supply chain. 
Jimmy Choo ensures that all of the sourcing of materials is done 
in a way to limit the impact on biodiversity and animal welfare. We 
comply with the Washington Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (“CITES”), which aims 
to regulate the trade of specimens of endangered animals and plants 
by monitoring their exportation, re-exportation, importation, transit, 
transhipment or possession. 
CARBON FOOTPRINT 
In 2014, Jimmy Choo had its carbon footprint independently 
measured for the first time by Deloitte. This enabled Jimmy Choo 
to identify areas of risk and prioritise areas on which to focus carbon 
reduction efforts. Over the next 12 months, Jimmy Choo will be 
building on the activities which today centre on 93 energy reduction 
initiatives already in place across its operations. In due course, we 
will establish a global energy management programme.
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION STATEMENT
The GHG Protocol categorises Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) emissions 
into three broad scopes:
• Scope 1: All direct GHG emissions
• Scope 2: Indirect emissions from consumption of purchased 
electricity, heat or steam.
• Scope 3: Other indirect emissions
Jimmy Choo has chosen to use an intensity ratio measure based 
upon emissions per £m of revenue in order to put the GHG intensity 
in context for the size of the business.
2014
 (tCO 2 e) (tCO 2 e/£M)
Scope 1
Fuel combustion 58 0.20
Scope 2
Purchased electricity 3,069 10.26
Statutory Total (Scope 1 and 2 Emissions) 3,127 10.46
In addition to the statutorily required Scope 1&2 
disclosure, Jimmy Choo has voluntarily analysed 
the Scope 3 emissions where it has the ability to 
influence them.
Scope 3
Upstream Scope 3 emissions 1,954 6.53
Total Emissions 5,081 16.99
Note:
tCO 2 e is an abbreviation of ‘tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent’ and is the internationally 
recognised measure of greenhouse gas emissions.
Jimmy Choo applies an operational control approach to defining its organisational boundaries. 
Data is reported for sites where it is considered that Jimmy Choo has the ability to influence 
energy management. Data is not reported for sites where Jimmy Choo has a physical presence, 
but does not influence the energy management for those sites, such as a concession within a 
department store. 
We use the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (revised edition, 2004) and ISO 14064-1 (2006) to estimate 
emissions and apply conversion factors from Defra, UK Government conversion factors for 
Company Reporting (2014). All material sources of emissions are reported. 
ENGAGEMENT AND REPORTING 
In order to challenge and enhance its sustainable operation goals, we 
will consider which industry sustainability working groups would be 
appropriate for us to join. We presently meet all mandatory reporting 
requirements and will enhance this disclosure in 2015 with a 
discussion of how we have changed over the year.
SOCIAL 
Jimmy Choo is committed to improving working conditions for 
workers both under its direct operations and across its value chain. 
The majority of Jimmy Choo’s products are made in Europe, and 
in particular Italy, where factories and tanneries are subject to 
mandatory legislative requirements. Jimmy Choo already expects 
its suppliers and sub-suppliers to include clauses combatting child 
labour in their contracts.
In the unlikely event that Jimmy Choo identifies working conditions 
which do not meet its minimum standards, the Group will work 
closely with suppliers to improve their performance. Over the next 
12 months, Jimmy Choo expects to formalise its policy on human 
rights and working conditions and will continue to increase the 
amount of supplier engagement activities. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014

COMMUNITY OF HIGHLY SKILLED PEOPLE

CREATING A DIVERSE COMMUNITY

We have a comprehensive diversity policy which ensures that 
everyone who works at one of our workplaces, whether they are 
directly employed by Jimmy Choo or not, is protected from direct 
and indirect discrimination, harassment or victimisation, whether 
deliberate or accidental. In addition, we commit to ensuring that the 
work environment is suitable for our employees to carry out their 
duties, with adjustments to equipment, location and working 
practices where necessary.
We have put policies in place to ensure that the recruitment process 
is free from bias and that equal work receives equal pay.
• There should be no discrimination on account of race, colour, 
nationality, ethnic origin, religion or belief, sex, gender 
reassignment, sexual orientation, age, marital status, civil 
partnership status, or disability.
• The Group will appoint, train, develop and promote on the basis 
of merit and capability.
• All employees have personal responsibility for the practical 
application of the Group’s equal opportunity policy, which extends 
to the treatment of employees and clients.
• Special responsibility for the practical application of the company’s 
equal opportunity policy falls upon all managers and supervisors 
involved in the recruitment, selection, promotion and training 
of employees.
• The Group’s grievance procedure is available to any employee 
who believes that he/she may have been unfairly treated.
• Disciplinary action is taken against any employee who is found to 
have committed an act of unlawful discrimination. Discriminatory 
conduct will be treated as gross misconduct and may lead to 
summary dismissal.
INVOLVING OUR PEOPLE IN THE BUSINESS
We want all of our employees to be part of Jimmy Choo’s success. 
This means not only excelling in their particular role, but also taking 
an interest in and influencing outcomes across the business. We 
do this through active two way communication, training, individual 
recognition and variable rewards linked to corporate results.
COMMUNICATION
Our internal communication strategy is designed to ensure that the 
strategic framework and value creation architecture of the board is 
well understood by all employees. We keep employees up to date 
on the medium term plans for how we aim to achieve those goals, 
as well as on the day to day progress of the business. 
The Executive Directors present the strategic plan for the year 
annually to all corporate employees and managers within the retail 
business. This is supported by regular communication in relation 
to organisational changes in the business and sales data relevant 
to each employee’s region and responsibilities. This regular update 
serves to introduce new colleagues as well as provide information 
on how we are performing against the strategic framework towards 
which we are all working. 
Jimmy Choo is a dynamic environment and it is important to  
ensure that the views of our employees are taken into account as  
we change and grow. We therefore consult at local, regional and 
global levels at an early stage where any changes may impact our 
employees. This process is supported by a clear open door policy 
with our HR team and a transparent approach, where appropriate,  
in the business. All employees are encouraged to come forward  
with ideas and concerns. This consultation has positive results for  
the long term growth of the business, such as the introduction  
of new management training specifically designed to help our 
employees develop into the senior managers of tomorrow. 
PROMOTION AND TRAINING
In order to help our employees to grow within the business, training 
is offered throughout Jimmy Choo. Training and development  
does not stop because someone is pregnant or has childcare 
responsibilities. We never assume that such employees are not 
interested in promotion.
We offer training appropriate to each employee’s current 
responsibilities as well as those they need to progress within the 
business to achieve their potential. Training is organised by the 
company and with external providers at Jimmy Choo’s expense. 
Overall, we employed 1,035 people as at 31 December 2014. Of 
those, 77% (797) were female and 23% (238) were male. Of our ten 
member Executive Management Team, 50% (5) are female and 50% 
(5) are male.
Last year, 87% of those attending our newly introduced transition  
to management and people management training were female. The 
introduction of this training was in response to extensive consultation 
at many levels in the company, identifying skills gaps and underlying 
latent demand. This demonstrates how our business is working to 
ensure everyone has the opportunity to be leaders of the business. 
VARIABLE AWARDS
All employees are incentivised with an element of variable 
compensation linked to metrics relevant to their role and function. 
At retail, this is largely linked to sales commission, whereas in the 
corporate side of the business, the variable component of pay  
is linked to a mix of metrics relating to the company’s overall 
performance and their particular role and function. This blended 
approach promotes the ethos that everyone at Jimmy Choo is 
responsible not only for their own role but working together to 
promote the whole business within the strategic framework.
VALUES AWARDS
We invite managers to nominate members of their teams  
annually to be recognised in front of their peers as people who  
have achieved something exceptional and acted as a role model  
for our Company “Values”.  JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014

RISK MANAGEMENT
RISK DESCRIPTION MITIGATING ACTION
STRATEGIC RISKS
GROWTH STRATEGY Jimmy Choo’s long term growth is dependent on 
making strategic moves into new territories, 
channels, and products. The wrong strategy or poor 
implementation could put future growth at risk. 
The Board has approved well-structured growth plans 
and ensured they are adequately resourced.
The Board regularly challenges the strategic plans 
to ensure downside risks are mitigated.
The Board closely monitors the progress against the 
strategic plan, redirecting strategy or implementation 
effort when required.
COMPE TITIVE 
ENVIRONMENT
Jimmy Choo competes with other luxury goods 
companies for end clients, talent, retail sites, 
wholesale customer accounts and supplier capacity. 
Failure to compete well in any of these areas risks 
future growth.
Senior Management monitors competitor movements 
and ensures Jimmy Choo hires and retains top staff to 
stay ahead of the competition in each area – including:
• Design and Merchandising staying ahead of future 
design and consumer trends;
• Supply Chain negotiating and building strong 
relationships with current and future suppliers;
• Retail acquiring top sites in new areas; and
• Wholesale nurturing strong relationships with 
key customers.
CHANGES IN 
CONSUMER 
PREFERENCES 
AND TRENDS 
Future success depends on Jimmy Choo’s ability to 
shape, predict and respond to fashion trends and 
consumer preferences on both products and channels. 
Failure to do so risks surplus inventories, missed sales 
opportunities and a reducing salience of the brand 
with clients.
Design and Merchandising teams have a structured 
approach to monitoring trends internally and externally 
and use the feedback to develop each collection to 
stay ahead of future design and consumer trends.
Retail teams monitor consumer channel preferences.
Marketing and Brand Image teams ensure the brand 
book and marketing are aligned and relevant to the 
market place.
OPERATIONAL RISKS
KEY PERSONNEL Jimmy Choo needs to attract and retain the best 
people in each area.
HR policies and management culture are reviewed 
regularly to ensure they continue to be effective in 
keeping Jimmy Choo as an attractive place to work.
Bonuses and incentive plans are reviewed regularly 
to ensure they remain competitive with the industry.
THIRD PARTY 
PRODUC TION
If suppliers do not produce product on time, to the 
right quality levels, or fail to meet local laws and 
regulations, this would constrain the availability of 
stock in stores and for delivery to our wholesale 
customers. If Jimmy Choo requires production beyond 
current capacity this risks constraining growth.
Jimmy Choo has dedicated supply chain and quality 
assurance offices, close to where the suppliers are 
located. This helps to build strong relationships with 
suppliers and manages those suppliers tightly to 
production deadlines and contracts. 
To ensure supplier availability, Jimmy Choo plans 
volume and capacity clearly in advance.
Jimmy Choo maintains knowledge of supplier 
capability on an on-going basis to determine 
where constraints could arise in future.
The Board is responsible for identifying the nature and extent of the 
risks the Group has to manage in order to successfully pursue its 
growth strategy and generate shareholder value over the long term. 
The Board uses a risk framework which is designed to support the 
process for identifying, evaluating and managing both financial and 
non-financial risks. 
The Group has identified the following key risks. This is not an 
exhaustive list but rather a list of the most material risks facing the 
Group. The impact of these risks, individually or collectively, could 
potentially affect the ability of the Group to operate profitably and 
generate positive cash flows in the medium to long term. As a result 
these risks are actively monitored and managed, as detailed below. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014

RISK DESCRIPTION MITIGATING ACTION
IT SYSTEMS Critical data losses or delays in operations if 
Jimmy Choo’s IT systems are not robust against power 
outages; computer, network and telecommunications 
failures; computer viruses; security breaches and user 
errors could interrupt the business operations.
Senior management reviews the IT strategy and 
operations plan regularly to ensure IT systems 
continue to be appropriate for the size and complexity 
of Jimmy Choo’s business.
In addition, Jimmy Choo maintains a disaster 
recovery plan.
OUTSOURCING 
SERVICES TO 
GLOBAL BUSINESS 
SERVICES (“GBS”)
Logistics, IT and transactional accounting activities 
are outsourced to the JAB Luxury’s shared services 
company, LLX Global Business Services SA (“GBS”). 
Reductions in GBS performance risk impacting 
Jimmy Choo’s operations and reductions in GBS 
efficiency would lead to increased costs for 
Jimmy Choo.
Legal contracts and service catalogues have been 
signed between Jimmy Choo and GBS. Both parties 
are committed to improving the KPIs over time.
Performance is monitored on a daily basis and 
reported to senior managers monthly.
A clear remediation process is in place if required.
PROGRAMME RISK Interruption or reduced performance during 
implementation of the operational transformation 
programme would impact current operations. If the 
scope of transformation reduced, future development 
plans of the business would be put at risk.
Senior management have put in place a strong 
programme management team and structure in 
Jimmy Choo, linking project delivery teams (from GBS) 
to key staff in the Jimmy Choo business.
A clear programme structure, planning processes, 
reporting framework and communication plan have 
been put in place and are regularly monitored.
Senior management are prepared to enact decisions 
and actions quickly as required to ensure the 
programme is implemented successfully.
COMPLIANCE RISKS
COMPLIANCE 
WITH LAWS AND 
REGUL ATIONS
Changes in laws and regulations could result in 
Jimmy Choo being non-compliant or incurring costs  
to be compliant (e.g. system changes). If third parties 
(e.g. suppliers) are not compliant, there would be a 
risk to brand image or of financial penalties.
Employees in each area monitor regulatory 
requirements in their area (e.g. Design, Merchandising 
and Supply Chain on consumer product safety; Retail 
on health and safety in stores; Supply Chain and 
Logistics on import and export requirements).
The Jimmy Choo legal team liaise with these teams, 
provide an overall review and act swiftly should 
instances of non-compliance arise.
CUSTOMER 
CONFIDENTIALIT Y
Failure to comply with restrictions on the use of 
customer data could harm Jimmy Choo’s brand 
reputation and credibility and level of customer trust.
The new CRM system which has been implemented 
with the roll-out of SAP has been designed to handle 
customer information securely.
The Chief Information Security Officer within GBS 
undertakes regular PCI audits.
FINANCIAL RISKS
EXCHANGE RATE 
FLUC TUATIONS
Products are purchased in euro and sold in local 
currencies. In addition, our DOS costs are incurred 
in local currencies. Adverse movements in foreign 
exchange rates would impact revenue growth reported 
in sterling, as well as gross and net margins.
The Board has approved a hedging strategy to 
minimise impact of exchange rate fluctuations. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014

RISK DESCRIPTION MITIGATING ACTION
ECONOMIC 
DOWNTURN AND 
INTERNATIONAL 
MARKET RISK
Economic downturns in countries where Jimmy Choo 
sells products may reduce sales and increase inventory.
Changes in international trade laws, transportation 
costs, or local government instability could all impact 
financial results.
Economic environment and international market risks 
are regularly reviewed by senior management, with 
appropriate action taken as required (e.g. reallocation 
of product or resources between regions and active 
management of inventory).
REPUTATIONAL RISK
IMAGE AND 
REPUTATION  
OF BR AND
If Jimmy Choo’s products, stores, marketing, customer 
service and corporate profile fail to retain the 
distinctive Jimmy Choo character, quality and values, 
brand equity could be reduced and sales impacted.
Brand quality is placed at the core of everything the 
business does. 
This ensures close management by all areas of 
business concerned to retain reputation (e.g. design of 
products, quality of marketing, store environment and 
client service).
Jimmy Choo’s contracts with licensees are drafted to 
ensure retention of control of the brand and are 
rigorously enforced.
CONTROL OF 
WHOLESALE 
DISTRIBUTION  
CHANNEL
Third party multibrand and franchisee stores could 
present the brand in a manner not in keeping with 
Jimmy Choo’s brand positioning and DNA, damaging 
the brand.
Senior management review distribution partners in 
advance of accepting them as a Jimmy Choo partner.
Jimmy Choo’s contracts with distribution partners are 
drafted to ensure control of elements of the brand 
presentation and are rigorously enforced. GOVERNANCE  JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014

CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION TO GOVERNANCE
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
I am pleased to present our first Corporate Governance Report, 
which describes how the main principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”) have been applied during the year, 
information about the composition of the Board and its Committees 
and an overview of Jimmy Choo’s system of internal controls. 
Jimmy Choo listed its ordinary shares on the main market of the 
London Stock Exchange on 22 October 2014. The Listing Rules 
of the Financial Conduct Authority, including the Code, have only 
therefore applied to the Company since that date. In the months 
leading up to the listing, the Board implemented a number of 
measures to comply with the Code which have proven robust and 
useful in our post-IPO Board and Committee meetings, including 
the budgeting process for 2015. 
Since listing JAB Luxury continues to be the majority shareholder 
of the Jimmy Choo and the Company represents a significant 
investment to JAB Luxury. The Board and JAB Luxury are mindful 
of the need to consider the interests of the Company’s new minority 
shareholders. The Board believes that the Board and its Committees, 
with the addition of the new independent Non-Executive Directors 
will provide the appropriate corporate governance balance in light of 
the interests of both the majority shareholder and the new minority 
shareholders. The Audit and Risk Committee consists solely of 
independent Non-Executive Directors and the Board has also 
established a Conflicts Committee to help manage the relationship 
between the Company and its majority shareholder. Further details 
of these measures are contained within this report.
Under the Relationship Agreement between JAB Luxury and the 
Company, JAB Luxury is able to appoint up to one half of the Board 
while it continues to own 50% or more of the Company’s Shares. 
Further details of the Relationship Agreement can be found on  
page 51.
The Board believes that there are sufficient safeguards in place  
in the structures and processes implemented to consider and  
protect the interests of independent shareholders. The Company 
does have a number of areas in which it does not fully follow the 
recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code. These  
are that at least half of the Board of Directors of a UK-listed  
company, excluding the Chairman, does not comprise Independent 
Non-Executive Directors and the Board has established a joint 
Remuneration and Nomination Committee, rather than separate 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees, which is not made up 
solely of independent Non-Executive Directors. The Board believes 
that these departures from  the Code are reasonable in the 
circumstances of Jimmy Choo’s ownership.
Since the Company only recently listed, it is not practicable to  
expect full compliance with the rest of the provisions of the Code. 
Accordingly, this report includes a description of how the Company 
has applied the principles of the Code since 22 October 2014 and 
how it intends to apply those principles throughout 2015

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE – COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
The Company adopted the UK Corporate Governance Code on 
22 October 2014 on admission of its shares to the UKLA’s Official 
List and listing on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.
Since that date, the Company has applied all except four of the main 
principles of the Code as listed below:
A.3.1 The Chairman was not independent on appointment.
B.1.2 At least half of the Board, excluding the Chairman, does not 
comprise Non-Executive Directors determined by the Board 
to be independent. 
B.2.1 There is a joint Remuneration and Nominations Committee. 
The majority of the members of this committee are not 
determined by the Board to be independent.
B.6 The Board has not carried out an annual evaluation of its own 
performance given the Board and its Committees have been 
operating for less than a year. A formal evaluation process 
will be carried out within 2015. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014

BOARD AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT
Prior to Admission, the day to day running of the Company was 
overseen by Pierre Denis and Jonathan Sinclair, with an executive 
committee formed of ten senior managers. As part of the Admission 
process the Board of Directors was formed consisting of the 
Non-Executive Chairman, two Executive Directors and seven 
Non-Executive Directors and a Schedule of Matters for Board 
Decision was adopted. The executive committee’s power to exercise 
managerial decisions was transferred to the Board on its formation. 
At the Board meeting in March 2015 the Board approved revised 
delegated authorities and concluded that, with the exception of the 
Executive Directors, the pre-IPO executive committee members 
were no longer persons dispensing managerial responsibility 
(“PDMRs”) for the purpose of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules 
by virtue of the fact that all power to make managerial decisions 
affecting the future development and business prospects of the 
Company rested with the Board.
KEY BOARD ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman and 
CEO which has been agreed by the Board. The roles of the Chairman 
and CEO are held by different people and the purpose of each role 
is clear and distinct and set out in respective job descriptions. The 
Chairman is responsible for the leadership and overall effectiveness 
of the Board and setting the Board’s agenda; the CEO reports to 
the Chairman and the Board and is responsible for all executive 
management matters of the Group. A summary of the key areas

act as a sounding board for the Chairman and serve as an 
intermediary for the other directors when necessary. The SID will 
meet other Non-Executive Directors without the Chairman and 
Executive Directors present at least once a year to discuss 
governance issues. The SID will also provide feedback to the Board 
on the independent Non-Executive Directors’ collective views on the 
perceived quality of the relationship between the Chairman and the 
CEO; the degree of openness between the CEO and the Board; the 
visibility of checks and balances within the Executive Directors’ team; 
and whether all questions asked by the Non-Executive Directors of 
the Board have been adequately addressed. 
The SID is also available to shareholders to discuss concerns where 
contact through the normal channels of the Chairman, CEO or CFO 
has failed to resolve or for which such contact is inappropriate.
BOARD INDEPENDENCE
The Board currently consists of seven Non-Executive Directors 
(including the Chairman) three of whom are considered to be 
independent.

As explained in the Chairman’s introduction, under the Relationship 
Agreement JAB Luxury is able to appoint: (i) up to one half of the 
Directors on the Board while it continues to hold 50% or more of the 
shares; (ii) up to one quarter of the Directors on the Board while it 
continues to hold at least 25% but less than 50% of the shares; and 
(iii) up to one eighth of the Directors on the Board while it continues 
to hold at least 10% but less than 25% of the shares. The first 
such appointees are Bart Becht, Fabio Fusco, Olivier Goudet and 
Peter Harf. 
The Board has determined that each of Gianluca Brozzetti, David 
Poulter and Bob Singer will be regarded as independent Non-
Executive Directors. In reaching this determination, the Board took 
into consideration the following relationships: Mr. Brozzetti has 
advised JAB Luxury in respect of its investment in Zagliani; from 
1999 to 2012 Mr. Poulter held senior finance positions in Reckitt 
Benckiser Group PLC (in which JAB Luxury’s controlling shareholder 
is a significant investor) including a period as a trustee of its pension 
scheme and Mr. Singer has been a director of Coty Inc. (in which 
JAB Luxury’s controlling shareholder is the majority shareholder) 
since 2009. Each of these directors has been appointed as an 
independent Non-Executive Director of Bally and Belstaff, which 
are companies owned by JAB Luxury. The other directors have 
concluded that the judgement, experience and challenging approach 
taken by each of Gianluca Brozzetti, David Poulter and Bob Singer 
should ensure that they each make a significant contribution to the 
work of the Board and its Committees. Therefore, the Board has 
determined that each of them is of independent character and 
judgement and should be regarded as independent Directors for 
the purposes of the Code. 
The names of the Directors and brief biographies can be found on 
pages 46 and 47.
COMMIT MEN T
The Board expects Non-Executive Directors to commit sufficient 
time to allow them to meet their obligations to the Company. The 
Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment currently anticipate 
that each Non-Executive Director will need to commit ten days per 
year to the Company but clarifies that more time may be required. 
Non-Executive Directors will need to attend scheduled and 
emergency Board and Committee meetings, at least one site visit 
per year and the AGM. In addition, the Non-Executive Directors 
are expected to commit appropriate preparation time ahead of 
each meeting.
REL ATIONSHIP AGREEMENT
On 3 October 2014, the Company and JAB Luxury entered into the 
Relationship Agreement which regulates aspects of the ongoing 
relationship between the Company and JAB Luxury. The principal 
purpose of the Relationship Agreement is to ensure that the 
Company and its subsidiaries are capable of carrying on their 
business independently of JAB Luxury and its associates, that 
transactions and relationships with JAB Luxury or its associates 
(including any transactions and relationships with any member of the 
Group) are at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms, and that 
the goodwill, reputation and commercial interests of the Company 
are maintained.
The Relationship Agreement will continue for so long as (i) the shares 
are listed on the premium listing segment of the Official List and 
traded on the London Stock Exchange’s main market for listed 
securities and (ii) JAB Luxury, together with its associates, is entitled 
to exercise or control the exercise of 10% or more of the votes able 
to be cast on all, or substantially all, matters at general meetings of 
the Company. 
The Directors believe that the terms of the Relationship Agreement 
enable the Group to carry on its business independently of JAB 
Luxury and ensure that all transactions and relationships between the 
Company and/or the members of the Group and JAB Luxury and/or 
its associates are, and will be, on arm’s length terms and on a normal 
commercial basis.
Under the Relationship Agreement, JAB Luxury is able to appoint 
to the Board such number of Non-Executive Directors as discussed 
above. JAB Luxury is entitled to receive, subject to compliance by 
the Company with its legal and regulatory obligations, such financial 
or other information in relation to the Group or any member of the 
Group as is necessary or reasonably required by it: (i) in its capacity 
as a shareholder of the Company, for the purposes of its accounting 
or financial control requirements or in order to comply with its legal, 
regulatory or tax obligations; or (ii) in order for it and other members 
of its group to provide certain advisory services to the Group, 
including but not limited to management accounts, long and short 
term planning documents and sales and margin reports.
CONFLICTS COMMIT TEE 
The Board has constituted a Conflicts Committee that considers 
on behalf of the Board any contract, arrangement or transaction 
between any member of the Group and JAB Luxury or any of JAB 
Luxury’s associates, and any actual or potential conflict of interest 
between any member of the Group and JAB Luxury or any of JAB 
Luxury’s associates which involves, or would involve, significant 
expenditure by the Group. The Conflicts Committee will meet on an 
ad hoc basis as required. The Conflicts Committee is chaired by Bob 
Singer, and its other members are Pierre Denis, Jonathan Sinclair, 
Gianluca Brozzetti and David Poulter.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Company’s Articles of Association set out the policy for dealing 
with directors’ conflicts of interest and are in line with the Companies 
Act 2006. The Articles permit the Board to authorise conflicts and 
potential conflicts, as long as the potentially conflicted Director is 
not counted in the quorum and does not vote on the resolution 
to authorise.  JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014
GOV ERN A NCE
52
In March 2015, the Board agreed a procedure for dealing with 
conflicts of interest in relation to matters which are scheduled for 
Board consideration following which each Director completed 
a ‘Directors List’ which sets out details of situations where each 
Director’s interests may conflict with those of the Company 
(‘situational conflicts’). These lists were subsequently considered 
and situational conflicts authorised. In addition, Directors are 
reminded at the beginning of each Board meeting to notify the Board 
of any further conflicts of interest in accordance with sections 175, 
177 and 182 of the Companies Act 2006.
BOARD PROCESS
Since Admission the Board has met once in December 2014 
to approve the annual budget for 2015 and once in March 2015, 
following the year end. All Directors were present at each meeting. 
The Board intends to meet formally at least four times a year, with ad 
hoc meetings called as and when circumstances require it to at short 
notice. There will be an annual calendar of agenda items to ensure 
that all matters are given due consideration and are reviewed at the 
appropriate point in the regulatory and financial cycle. 
At least once a year, the Board will undertake a full strategic review 
of the business operations as part of the budget review. 
All Directors are expected to attend all meetings of the Board and 
any Committees of which they are members, and to devote sufficient 
time to the Company’s affairs to fulfil their duties as Directors. Where 
Directors are unable to attend a meeting, they are encouraged to 
submit any comments on papers to be considered at the meeting 
to the Chairman in advance to ensure that their views are recorded 
and taken into account during the meeting.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors will meet without the 
Executive Directors present on a number of occasions throughout 
the year. 
TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
In preparation for listing, all Directors received an induction briefing 
from the Company’s legal advisor, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, 
on their duties and responsibilities as directors of a publicly quoted 
company. During 2015, the Company Secretary will prepare a full, 
formal and tailored induction programme for any new directors 
joining the Board. The Chairman, with the support of the Company 
Secretary, will ensure that the development and ongoing training 
needs of individual directors and the Board as a whole are reviewed 
and agreed at least annually.
INFORMATION AND SUPPORT
An agenda and accompanying pack of detailed papers is circulated 
to the Board well in advance of each Board meeting. These include 
reports from Executive Directors and other members of senior 
management. All Directors have direct access to senior management 
should they require additional information on any of the items to be 
discussed. The Board and the Audit and Risk Committee also receive 
further regular and specific reports to allow the monitoring of the 
adequacy of the Company’s systems of internal controls.
The information supplied to the Board and its Committees will be 
kept under review and formally assessed on an annual basis as part 
of the Board evaluation exercise to ensure it is fit and proper for 
purpose and that it enables sound decision making.
The Company has adopted a formal procedure through which 
Directors may obtain independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense. 
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
Given that the majority of the Directors were only appointed in the 
months immediately preceding the listing in October 2014, the 
Board believes that a meaningful evaluation of the Board can only 
take place after it has been working together for a reasonable time. 
An evaluation policy will be developed and implemented before 
the end of 2015 and annually thereafter, with such an evaluation 
process being externally facilitated at least every three years.
SHARE DEALING CODE
At Admission, the Company adopted Share Dealing Codes which 
cover dealings by PDMRs and relevant employees. The codes 
comply with the provisions set out in the Model Code contained 
in Annex 1 to Listing Rule 9 of the UK Listing Authority’s Listing 
Rules. It restricts dealings in shares and other relevant securities 
by PDMRs and employees during designated prohibited periods 
and at any time when they are in possession of unpublished, 
price-sensitive information. As noted previously, the Board has 
concluded that the senior managers are not PDMRs however they 
are classed as ‘relevant employees’ and have therefore committed 
to full compliance of the Company’s Share Dealing Codes.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS 
DIALOGUE WITH SHAREHOLDERS
As part of the IPO “roadshow” in 2014, the CEO and CFO met with 
a large number of investors.
As part of its ongoing investor relations programme, the Group 
aims to maintain an active dialogue with its stakeholders including 
institutional investors to discuss issues relating to the performance 
of the Group including strategy and new developments. The 
Non-Executive Directors are available to discuss any matter 
stakeholders might wish to raise, and the Chairman and 
independent Non-Executive Directors will attend meetings 
with investors and analysts as required. 
Investor relations activity and a review of the share register are 
standing items on the Board’s agenda. 
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The Company’s first Annual General Meeting since Admission will 
take place on 27 May 2015 at the Radisson Blu Edwardian Hotel, 
140 Bath Road, Hayes, Middlesex UB3 5AW. The Chairman will 
be present to answer questions put to him by shareholders. The 
Annual Report and Financial Statements and Notice of the Annual 
General Meeting will be sent to shareholders at least 20 working 
days prior to the date of the meeting.
To encourage shareholders to participate in the Annual General 
Meeting process, the Company proposes to offer electronic proxy 
voting through the CREST service and all resolutions will be 
proposed and voted on at the meeting on an individual basis by 
shareholders or their proxies. Voting results will be announced 
through the Regulatory News Service and made available on the 
Company’s website.

present for each meeting.
The Remuneration and Nominations Committee’s responsibilities are 
set out in its Terms of Reference which are available on the 
Company’s website. Its role includes:
• setting the remuneration policy for all Executive Directors of the 
Company and the Chairman of the Board, the Company Secretary 
and other senior employees of the Company as the Board 
may determine;
• within the terms of the remuneration policy determining the total 
individual remuneration package of the Executive Directors, 
Company Secretary and other designated senior executives 
including base salary, bonuses and performance related 
payments, discretionary payments, pension contributions, 
benefits in kind and share options;
• in respect of any performance related element of remuneration, 
formulating suitable performance related criteria and monitor 
their operation;
• ensuring that contractual terms on termination, and any payments 
made, are fair to the individual and the Company, that failure 
is not rewarded and that the duty to mitigate loss is fully 
recognised; and
• leading the process for appointments to the Board and ensuring 
that the Board, its Committees, and the boards of the Company’s 
subsidiaries, are appropriately balanced in terms of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of the Company.
In carrying out its duties, the Remuneration and Nominations 
Committee takes into account any legal requirements, the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and UK Listing Rules. Determining 
the fees of the Non-Executive Directors is a matter reserved for 
the Chairman of the Board and the Executive Directors.
The key responsibilities of the Committee are shown below.
DIV ERSIT Y
The Board recognises the benefits of diversity, including gender 
diversity, on the Board, although it believes that all appointments 
should be made on merit, whilst ensuring that there is an appropriate 
balance of skills and experience within the Board. As at 31 December 
2014, the board consisted of 10% (1) female and 90% (9) male 
board members. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014

AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT
DEAR SHAREHOLDER,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Company’s first 
Audit and Risk Committee report.  Following the announcement that 
Judith Sprieser was stepping down from the Board for personal 
reasons, I have been asked to fulfil the role of Chairman of the Audit 
and Risk Committee, having been a member of the committee since 
the IPO and having been closely involved in all aspects of the 
Committee’s work to date.  
 
The Audit and Risk Committee is responsible for establishing, 
monitoring and regularly reviewing the Company’s internal controls 
and risk management framework, as well as overseeing the work of 
the external auditor. The Audit and Risk Committee has met three 
times so far since the IPO, focused primarily on setting the internal 
audit plan for 2015, establishing key policies and procedures in 
support of the control environment and the audit and approval 
of the 2014 Annual Report and Financial Statements. 
 
I would like to thank Judith for the support she has given to the 
Committee since IPO and look forward to reporting back to you next 
year with the progress of the Committee.
 
Further details on the activities of the Committee during the year and 
how it discharged its responsibilities are provided in the report below.

AUDIT AND RISK COMMIT TEE CHAIRMAN
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT 
CONTINUED
MEMBERSHIP AND MEETINGS
The Audit and Risk Committee currently comprises two independent 
Non-Executive Directors: Bob Singer (Chairman) and David Poulter.
All members of the Committee have recent and relevant financial 
experience. Bob Singer is currently Chairman of the Audit Committee 
of Mead Johnson Nutrition, Coty Inc., and Tiffany and Co., having 
previously been CFO of Gucci Group. David Poulter has held previous 
roles as Head of Internal Audit and Senior Vice President, Finance at 
Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC and is a Chartered Accountant and 
member of the finance committee of Save the Children UK. 
The Audit and Risk Committee will meet as often as it deems 
necessary but in any case at least four times a year, with meetings 
scheduled at appropriate intervals in the financial reporting cycle. 
Additional meetings are held as required. The Audit and Risk 
Committee met once between Admission in October and the 
year end. A further two meetings have been held since year end. 
All members of the Committee were present at all meetings. 
Only members of the Committee have the right to attend meetings. 
However, standing invitations are extended to the CFO and Internal 
Audit Manager. Other non-members may be invited to attend  
all or part of any meeting as and when appropriate. Fabio Fusco 
(Non-Executive Director) acts as secretary to the Committee. The 
external auditor attends all meetings and also meets in private with 
the Committee on each occasion. In addition the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee will have regular contact with the external and 
internal auditors throughout the year. 
ROLE OF THE AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE
The Board has delegated to the Committee responsibility for 
overseeing the internal financial controls and financial reporting of the 
Company and its subsidiaries, reviewing the Group’s internal control 
and risk management systems and for maintaining a proper 
relationship with the external auditor. The Committee’s specific 
responsibilities are set out in its terms of reference which were 
adopted in October 2014. These are available on the Company’s 
website, and are summarised below.

INTERNAL AUDIT
Internal audit services are provided by JAB Luxury under an Advisory 
Services Agreement dated 13 August 2014. The role of these internal 
audit services is to determine whether the Group’s network of risk 
management, control and governance processes are adequate and 
functioning appropriately. 
At its meeting in December 2014 the Committee also approved the 
annual internal audit plan for 2015 which identified areas of focus 
for the year. Outcomes of the work of internal audit will be reported 
to the Audit and Risk Committee and the Group’s management 
with responsibility for any improvement or remedial action allocated 
appropriately. The internal audit function will carry out follow up 
reviews to ensure that any control weaknesses are addressed.
The Audit and Risk Committee will receive regular reports from 
the internal audit function during 2015 which will include progress 
updates against the approved internal audit plan. The Committee 
will use these reports as the basis for its assessment of the 
effectiveness of the internal audit function during 2015, as well 
as monitoring the relationship between the internal audit function 
and the Group’s management. 
EXTERNAL AUDITOR
The Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s relationship 
with its external auditor, KPMG LLP. This includes the ongoing 
assessment of the auditor’s independence and the effectiveness 
of the external audit process, the results of which inform the 
Committee’s recommendation to the Board as to the auditor’s 
appointment (subject to shareholder approval) or otherwise.
APPOINTMENT AND TENURE
KPMG LLP was first appointed as the external auditor of the Group in 
2011. The current audit partner, Wayne Cox, has been in place since 
the appointment of KPMG LLP.
The audit partner is required to rotate every five years. As Wayne Cox 
is retiring from KPMG LLP this year, a new audit partner will be 
selected for the 2015 audit. In accordance with the Code, the 
Committee intends to put the external audit out to tender at least 
every ten years. There are no contractual obligations that act to 
restrict the Audit and Risk Committee’s choice of external auditor.
NON-AUDIT SERVICES
The engagement of the external audit firm to provide non-audit 
services to the Group can impact on the independence assessment. 
The Group has therefore established a policy governing the provision 
of any such non-audit services. The policy specifies services which 
cannot be carried out by the external auditor (generally activities 
that would involve the external auditor taking on management 
responsibility) and sets the framework within which non-audit 
services may be provided. All requests to utilise the external auditors 
for non-audit services must be reviewed by the CFO and above a 
certain limit must be subject to competitive tender and be approved 
by the Audit and Risk Committee.
During 2014, KPMG LLP were engaged to provide non-audit services 
to the Group. These included acting as Reporting Accountant to the 
Group in connection with the IPO and the provision of tax advisory 
services. KPMG LLP were appointed as Reporting Accountants 
following a competitive tender process. In approving the use of 
KPMG LLP to provide these services, the Board took the view that 
KPMG LLP’s knowledge of the Company and its operations meant 
that it was best placed to provide the services, and was comfortable 
that KPMG LLP’s independence would not be compromised. The 
fees paid to KPMG LLP in respect of non-audit services during the 
year totalled £1.7m which is in excess of the total audit fee of £0.2m. 
The majority of the non-audit fees incurred during the year, £1.3m, 
were in connection with the IPO and are therefore inherently one-off 
in nature. In addition, the Group incurred £0.2m of tax advisory fees 
in connection with the redesign of the Group’s supply chain which 
is also considered to be one-off in nature.
The Committee assesses the independence of the external auditor 
and the effectiveness of the external audit process before making 
recommendations to the Board in respect of their appointment 
or re-appointment. 
In assessing independence and objectivity, the Committee considers 
the level and nature of services provided by the external auditor 
as well as the confirmation from the external auditor that it has 
remained independent within the meaning of the APB Ethical 
Standards for Auditors. The Committee’s assessment of the external 
auditor’s independence took into account the non-audit services 
provided during the year. The Committee concluded that the 
nature and extent of the non-audit fees did not compromise 
the independence of the auditor, given the one-off nature of 
the majority of services provided.
Having reviewed the auditor’s independence and performance 
the Audit and Risk Committee recommends that KPMG LLP be 
re-appointed as the Company’s auditor at the next annual 
general meeting. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

SIGNIFICANT ISSUES
Significant issues and accounting judgements are identified by the finance team and through the external audit process and are reviewed by 
the Audit and Risk Committee. The significant issues considered by the Committee in respect of the year ended 31 December 2014 are set 
out below:
Risk area Significant issues and judgements How the issues were addressed
Revenue  
recognition
Revenue is a key performance indicator of the 
Group. Whilst the Group’s revenue recognition 
policies are not complex, the Group’s revenue is 
comprised of a high volume of transactions. The 
maintenance of an effective control environment, 
particularly within our retail channel which accounts 
for 64.4% of total revenue, is therefore fundamental 
to ensuring appropriate revenue recognition.
Controls relevant to the retail channel are formally 
documented within the retail excellence manual 
that was implemented within each store throughout 
the year. The accounting policies for revenue 
are set out in note 1 to the financial statements 
and are unchanged from previous periods. 
The Audit and Risk Committee considered reports 
prepared by Internal Audit during the year, particularly 
where there has been a change in the control 
environment following the transition to SAP and noted 
no significant issues with respect to the operation 
of the controls around revenue recognition. 
The Audit and Risk Committee also considered a report 
from the external auditor, which commented, inter alia, 
on revenue recognition.
Identification 
and disclosure of 
exceptional items
The Group is undergoing a significant 
transformation programme in connection with 
which the Group has incurred a significant degree 
of costs that are considered to be exceptional 
in nature as they are unrepresentative of the 
underlying operating performance of the Group. 
Further details of these costs are provided 
in note 5 to the financial statements.
The Audit and Risk Committee has discussed the nature 
of these costs with management and the external auditor. 
The Audit and Risk Committee are of the view that these 
costs warrant separate disclosure on the face of the 
consolidated income statement by virtue of the fact they 
are not representative of the underlying performance of 
the Group. The Audit and Risk Committee consider that 
separate disclosure of exceptional costs will aid investors 
in evaluating the performance of the business in the year.
Residual value 
of key money
Judgement is required in estimating the residual value 
of key money paid to outgoing tenants to secure a 
leasehold property. In certain locations, the residual 
value of key money is considered to be equal to cost; 
either due to legal protection offered to tenants in 
that jurisdiction or because it is common practice to 
at least recover the amounts paid at the end of the 
lease due to the existence of an active market for 
operating leases in premium luxury retail locations.
The Audit and Risk Committee has reviewed and 
challenged the key assumptions used in assessing 
the residual value of key money. The Audit and Risk 
Committee requested management to provide an in 
depth analysis of the valuation assumptions applied by 
location in order to consider the application of the agreed 
approach. Following review, the Audit and Risk Committee 
concluded that the judgements applied were appropriate 
in preparing the financial statements for the year.
When considering the financial statements, the Committee also considered the issues included in the Group’s critical accounting policies, 
which are set out in note 2 to the financial statements. Having discussed these matters with management and the external auditor the 
Committee has satisfied itself that such risks are being appropriately managed, the judgements made are reasonable and they are being 
accounted for in accordance with the relevant accounting standards and principles.  JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014

FAIR, BAL ANCED AND UNDERSTANDABLE
At the request of the Board, the Audit and Risk Committee has 
conducted a review of the Annual Report and Financial Statements 
to assess whether it presents a fair, balanced and understandable 
view of the Company’s position and prospects. The Committee’s 
review took account of the process by which the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements is prepared which includes detailed project 
planning, analysis of changes to applicable reporting requirements 
and standards, and a robust programme of review and verification 
at various levels of the business and by external advisers to ensure 
accurate reporting. 
The Committee is satisfied that the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position and performance, and has advised the Board accordingly.
SYSTEMS OF INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group has in place a comprehensive financial review cycle, 
which includes a detailed annual budgeting and forecasting process. 
The budget is prepared annually for approval by the Board and is 
regularly reviewed and updated during the year at key points of the 
business calendar. Performance is monitored against the budget 
through weekly and monthly reporting cycles. During the financial 
year under review regular reports on performance, including income 
statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements and key ratios, 
were provided to the Board. In respect of external financial reporting, 
the Group finance team is responsible for preparing the Group 
financial statements and there are well established controls over 
the financial reporting process.
The Group has defined and formally documented the core elements 
of the system of internal control at a store, channel and Group level. 
Policies and procedures and clearly defined levels of delegated 
authority have been communicated across the Group. Management 
has identified the key operational and financial processes which exist 
within the business and implemented internal controls over these 
processes in addition to the higher level review and authorisation 
based controls. The control environment is communicated to staff 
through three key documents:
• the Group’s internal governance rules, which set out policies for 
delegation of authority within the business, including contract 
approval and signing limits for all types of expenditure;
• the retail excellence manual detailing controls at store level; and 
• the internal control system documentation which describes 
controls over key processes such as financial reporting, 
receivables and payables management.
The Group has continued to develop its governance arrangements 
since Admission which has included the enhancement of various 
policies and procedures to support the systems of internal control 
and risk management. The Audit and Risk Committee has been 
central to this process, in particular in the drafting and review of a 
number of updated or new policies, which have subsequently been 
approved by the Board, covering:
• anti-bribery and corruption policy;
• whistleblowing policy;
• risk framework and risk register; and
• disaster recovery arrangements.
These policies will be subject to periodic review.
The Board retains ultimate responsibility for setting the Group’s 
risk appetite, identification of key risks and ensuring that there is 
an effective risk management framework to maintain levels of 
risk within the risk appetite. The Board has however delegated 
responsibility for oversight of the Group’s risk appetite, risk 
monitoring and reviewing areas of specific risk to the Audit and Risk 
Committee as well as ensuring sufficient mitigating actions are taken. 
The Committee will provide oversight and advice to the Board on 
current risk exposures and future risk strategy. Further details of the 
Group’s risk management approach, structure and principal risks are 
set out in the Strategic Report on pages 15 to 40.
FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS REPORTING
The Board is committed to ensuring that all external financial 
reporting presents a fair, balanced and understandable assessment 
of the Group’s position and prospects. Under the Schedule of 
Reserved Matters, the Board has responsibility for the approval 
of all externally published information including, but not limited 
to, annual and half-yearly financial statements, regulatory news 
announcements and publications required by regulators or to 
satisfy statutory requirements. 
REVIEW OF EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS
As part of preparing for operating in a listed environment, a review of 
the existing controls in place was performed and additional controls 
were implemented to ensure compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. The directors confirm that these processes have 
been in place since the date of Admission and up to the date of 
approval of the Annual Report and Financial Statements.
 
As such the directors confirm that they have reviewed the 
effectiveness of the system of internal controls for the period under 
review and to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements. The Board receives regular reports from the Audit and 
Risk Committee on its activities, including the Audit and Risk 
Committee’s review of reports prepared by internal audit on the 
operation and efficacy of internal controls systems.
 
However, such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide only 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement 
or loss.
TREASURY OPERATIONS
The Company adopted a treasury policy prior to Admission which 
sets the Group’s approach to the management of risks from treasury 
operations. This policy will be reviewed annually by the Board.
WHISTLEBLOWING
The Company has implemented a whistleblowing policy following 
Admission. The Audit and Risk Committee is responsible for 
monitoring the Group’s whistleblowing arrangements and the policy 
will be reviewed periodically by the Board. The Group is confident 
that these arrangements will be effective, facilitate the proportionate 
and independent investigation of reported matters, and allow 
appropriate follow up action to be taken. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014

DEAR SHAREHOLDER
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our first 
remuneration report for the financial year ended 31 December 
2014. This has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium 
sized Company and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013.
In line with the regulations, this Directors’ Remuneration Report has 
been split into three parts:
• This Annual Statement;
• The Remuneration Policy Report – which sets out the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy of Jimmy Choo PLC. This will be subject to 
a binding vote at our 2015 Annual General Meeting (“AGM”); and
• The Annual Remuneration Report – which sets out details  
on how the Directors’ were remunerated in the period to 
31 December 2014, and how the policy will be implemented  
in 2015. This will be subject to an advisory vote at our  
2015 AGM.
REMUNERATION PHILOSOPHY
As set out in the Company’s prospectus, the remuneration package 
for our Executive Directors has been designed based on the 
following key principles:
• Fixed remuneration should be set at a suitable level to attract 
and retain executives with the required calibre to run a company 
with the size and growth profile of the Company. Base salaries 
are generally targeted around market median of a suitable 
peer group.
• Variable remuneration, in particular long-term incentives, should 
form a significant part of the remuneration package to encourage 
a high-performance culture and to ensure that the interests of 
executives are strongly aligned with those of the Company’s 
shareholders. 
• In line with the above, the total target cash remuneration 
opportunity for Executive Directors (fixed remuneration and 
target annual bonus) is set at around the market median of a 
suitable peer group. The total remuneration opportunity for 
Executive Directors (fixed remuneration, annual bonus and 
long-term incentives) is targeted at around the upper quartile 
of a suitable peer group.
In recognition of our remuneration philosophy, the variable 
remuneration arrangements for our Executive Directors are made 
up of an appropriate balance of both short and long-term incentives 
to ensure that our Executive Directors are focused on delivering 
both annual as well as long-term returns for shareholders. 
• The annual bonus is based predominantly on financial 
performance conditions designed to reward the delivery of the 
Group’s strategy of pursuing growth without compromising the 
brand. For 2015, the annual bonus will be subject to three key 
performance metrics:
(1) A revenue growth metric – to support the long-term growth 
strategy of the business and the sustainability of the brand;
(2 A profit growth metric – to ensure that any growth delivers 
appropriate returns to shareholders; and
(3) A cash conversion metric – to ensure that the business is 
delivering sufficient cash returns to cover its operating costs.
• A long-term incentive, which is the primary tool to be used to 
drive the long-term business strategy and align the interests of the 
management team with those of the Company’s shareholders. 
To ensure that the long-term incentive plan achieves its primary 
objectives and to ensure that it acts as a strong motivation and 
retention tool, we have considered it appropriate for awards under the 
plan to be subject to an extended vesting period (whereby no value 
is received unless the participant remains in employment for a period 
of at least five years from the date of grant) only. We believe that 
management continuity, in particular in an industry where the 
management team is synonymous with the products developed 
and the brand vision, is key to delivering long-term returns 
for shareholders. 
We appreciate that operating a long-term incentive plan that is not 
subject to forward looking performance conditions is not common 
practice compared to other FTSE listed companies, however, we 
strongly believe that granting awards subject to an extended vesting 
period rather than granting awards which are subject to performance 
over a shorter period (i.e. three years from the date of grant), is more 
likely to drive behaviours that are in the interests of long-term value 
creation for shareholders. 
To emphasise the link between the management team and 
shareholders, the Committee also encourages the Executive 
Directors to build up significant shareholdings in the Company. 
Executive Directors are therefore expected to build up a significant 
shareholding in the Company over the seven years following 
Admission. The shareholding guideline for Pierre Denis is 500% 
of base salary and for Jonathan Sinclair is 200% of base salary.
Following the grants that were made to the Executive Directors 
shortly after Admission of the Company, there is currently no 
intention for them to participate in the long-term incentive plan 
in 2015.

2014 PERFORMANCE AND REMUNERATION OUTCOMES
2014 represented a strong year of performance for Jimmy Choo PLC, 
its first year as a publicly listed company. Particular highlights for 
2014 include:
• revenue of £299.7m, which were up 6.4% on 2013;
• 7.2% growth in Adjusted EBITDA to £50.2m; 
• opening a net nine new stores and extension of our new store 
concept to 15 stores;
• continuing rollout of SAP and shared services around 
Jimmy Choo;
• consolidation of Choo 24:7 and successful launch of CHOO.08°; 
and
• important development of our online and men’s businesses.
In light of the level of performance achieved in 2014 against 
objectives that were set prior to the IPO, the Remuneration and 
Nominations Committee approved bonus payments of c.43% of 
salary to the CEO and c.30% of salary to the CFO, pro-rated for time 
based on his period of employment during the year. Further details 
on performance against the targets are set out on page 69.
As noted above, the long-term incentive plan for the Executive 
Directors are not subject to forward looking performance conditions. 
As required under the regulations, the single figure table therefore 
includes the face value of shares awarded shorty following 
Admission. The Executive Directors have not received any value from 
these awards at this stage, as they are subject to extended continued 
employment requirements. Should an Executive Director leave the 
Company prior to vesting, unless otherwise determined by the 
Committee, these awards would be forfeit. 
I hope that you find the Remuneration Report helpful, clear and 
informative and I hope you will support the resolutions to approve the 
Directors remuneration policy and the Remuneration Report at the 
2015 AGM.

REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT
The following sets out the Remuneration Policy (the “Policy”) for Directors of the Company. This Policy will be put forward for shareholder 
approval at the 2015 AGM in accordance with section 439A of the Companies Act 2006. Subject to shareholder approval, this Policy will 
apply to payments made on or after the date of the 2015 AGM (27 May 2015) and will be effective for three years.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The remuneration of the Executive Directors is set by the Remuneration and Nominations Committee (the Committee) under delegated 
powers from the Board.
POLICY TABLE
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures
Base salary To recognise the 
responsibilities, experience 
and ability of our talent 
in a competitive global 
environment, keeping 
our people focused 
on, and passionate 
about, the brand.
The Committee sets base 
salaries within the same 
framework as those for all 
other employees taking 
into account a range of 
factors, including: 
• the individual’s skills, 
performance and 
experience; 
• their overall contribution 
to the business during 
the year;
• the cost to the Company;
• salary increases 
awarded across the 
Group as a whole;
• the external economic 
climate; and
• external benchmark data 
at other global 
companies of similar 
size and/or global reach 
within relevant sectors 
and/or companies with 
a high growth profile. 
Base salaries are normally 
reviewed, although not 
necessarily increased, 
annually. Base salaries 
may be reviewed more 
frequently at the discretion 
of the Committee.
The Committee considers 
the impact of any base 
salary increase on the total 
remuneration package.
Salaries for Executive 
Directors are targeted 
at around the median 
for competitors. 
Whilst there is no 
maximum salary, any 
increases will normally be 
in line with the range of 
increase for all employees 
across the Group. 
The Committee retains 
the flexibility to award 
increases above this level 
in certain circumstances, 
for example:
• to reflect the individual’s 
development and 
performance in the role;
• to reflect a significant 
increase in the 
individual’s role or 
responsibility; and
• where a new recruit or 
promoted employee’s 
salary has been set 
lower than the market 
level for such a role and 
larger increases are 
justified in the

Other benefits 
and allowances
To promote the well-
being of employees, 
allowing them to focus 
on the business. 
Benefit levels are normally 
reviewed on an annual 
basis and the cost to the 
Company of providing 
benefits can vary due to 
a number of factors.
Benefits for Executive 
Directors may include, 
but are not limited to: 
• private medical 
insurance (including for 
their spouse and for 
dependant children);
• life assurance;
• long-term disability 
insurance;
• car or car allowance;
• an allowance for school 
fees for dependant 
children;
• clothing allowance;
• employee discount;
• other benefits provided 
to all employees across 
the Group; and
• the Company paying any 
tax or social security 
contributions due on any 
of the benefits.
Other benefits may be 
provided, where the 
Committee considers 
this appropriate.
Reasonably incurred 
expenses will also 
be reimbursed.
The Committee may agree 
that the Company will pay 
additional allowances linked 
to relocation or international 
assignment where required.
The aggregate maximum 
value of all other benefits 
and allowances is not 
normally anticipated to 
exceed £200,000 per 
individual per annum. 
The Committee retains 
the discretion to approve a 
higher cost in exceptional 
circumstances (e.g. 
recruitment or relocation) 
or in circumstances 
where factors outside the 
Company’s control have 
changed materially (e.g. 
increases in private medical 
insurance premiums).

Annual Bonus To reward Executive 
Directors for achieving 
annual financial targets or

linked to the strategic plan 
agreed by the Board.
Awards are based on an

Long-Term 
Incentive Plan
To incentivise and reward 
participants for the delivery 
of long-term performance, 
and align the interests 
of Executive Directors 
with our shareholders.
Under the long-term 
incentive plan, awards 
of shares may be 
granted, which normally 
vest subject to the 
continued employment 
of the participant for a 
five-year period from 
the date of grant.
Long-term incentive awards 
are normally granted in 
the form of conditional 
shares or options with a 
total exercise price of £1 
(or such higher amount 
as determined by the 
Committee at grant). They 
may however be awarded 
in other forms if it is 
considered appropriate. 
Unvested awards are 
subject to malus (details 
set out later in this report).
Dividend equivalents may 
accrue over the five-year 
vesting period. These 
will normally be paid in 
shares on a cumulative 
reinvestment basis.
The Committee may 
adjust and amend 
awards in accordance 
with the plan rules.
The Committee calibrates 
long-term incentive share 
awards for participants as 
a fixed number of shares.
The Committee will 
determine annual award 
levels for each of the 
Executive Directors 
taking into account its 
philosophy that the total 
compensation opportunity 
for Executive Directors 
should be positioned at 
around the upper quartile 
of an appropriate peer 
group (as determined 
by the Committee).
The maximum award to 
any individual in respect 
of any one financial year 
will be over no more than 
2,500,000 shares. Details 
of the awards in respect 
of each financial year will 
be disclosed in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
Vesting of awards is subject 
to continued employment. 
NOTES TO THE POLICY TABLE
DISCRETION TO HONOUR ALL PRIOR COMMITMENTS
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office where the terms were agreed before 
this Policy came into effect or prior to an individual being appointed a director of the Company and the payment was not in consideration for 
the individual becoming a director of the Company. 
For these purposes ‘payments’ include the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares 
(including awards granted prior to and shortly after Admission of the Company (including the JC PLC Share Award and the One-Off Share 
Award as detailed below)), in line with the terms of the payment that were agreed at the time the award was granted.
JC PLC SHARE AWARD 
Prior to Admission, a co-investment plan was operated which required executives to invest in shares of Choo Luxury Holdings Limited. In 
return for the participant’s investment in these shares, they were granted matching phantom (i.e. cash settled) options which participated in 
the growth in the value of the company from the date of the investment to the end of the vesting period. 
On Admission of the Company, participants exercised a portion of their phantom options. The remaining phantom options were surrendered 
by participants. Following Admission of the Company, participants were granted awards in the form of an option with a nominal total exercise 
price of £1 or conditional share awards. The number of shares awarded was linked to the Black-Scholes value of the phantom options 
surrendered. These awards will normally become exercisable (or will vest) in equal tranches in July 2016, July 2017 and July 2018 subject to 
the participant’s continued employment with the Group. Details of the outstanding awards made to the CEO under the plan are set out in the 
Annual Remuneration Report. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014
GOV ERN A NCE

ONE-OFF SHARE AWARD
Following Admission of the Company, selected senior management 
and the Executive Directors of the Company were granted a one-off 
award in the form of an option with a nominal total exercise price  
of £1 or conditional shares, which normally vest 50% on the fifth  
and 50% on the sixth anniversary of the date of grant subject  
to the participant’s continued employment with the Group.  
The CFO’s award vests in equal tranches on the fourth, fifth  
and sixth anniversary of the date of grant, subject to his continued 
employment with the Group. Details of the outstanding awards  
made to Executive Directors under the plan are set out in the  
Annual Remuneration Report.
REMUNERATION AND NOMINATIONS COMMIT TEE DISCRETION IN 
REL ATION TO FUTURE OPERATION OF THE REMUNERATION POLICY
In the event of a variation of share capital, demerger, dividend in 
specie, special dividend or similar event, the Committee may adjust 
or amend awards in accordance with the rules of the relevant plan.
If the Company has been or will be affected by a demerger, dividend 
in specie, special dividend or other transaction which will affect the 
current or future value of the Company’s shares, awards may vest to 
the extent the Committee determines, which may include awards 
being time pro-rated if the Committee considers it appropriate. 
The Committee retains the discretion to amend performance targets 
in exceptional business or regulatory circumstances or to vary such 
targets if acting fairly and reasonably if it considers it appropriate to 
do so. If discretion is exercised in this way the Committee may 
consult with major shareholders as appropriate.
The Committee may make minor amendments to the Policy (for 
example for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative 
purposes or to take account of a change in legislation) without 
obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.
MALUS 
Under the malus provision, the Committee can reduce awards that 
have not yet vested. Malus may apply where stated in the Policy 
table above.
The circumstances in which malus would apply are set out below:
• where there has been a material misstatement of the Company’s 
Annual Report and Financial Statements for the financial year 
during which the award was granted and/or for any subsequent 
financial year ending before either the last date when the award 
becomes exercisable or the final vesting date;
• where there has been serious reputational damage to the Company 
as a result of the participant’s actions or the actions of a member of 
the team for which the participant is directly responsible;
• where the participant has deliberately misled the Company, the 
Company’s shareholders or the market regarding the Company’s 
financial performance; or
• gross misconduct. 
CL AW BACK
The Committee can reclaim bonus payments made from 2016 
onwards, for a period of up to two years post the payment date  
in the following circumstances:
• where there has been a material misstatement of the Company’s 
Annual Report and Financial Statements for the financial year to 
which the bonus payment relates; or
• gross misconduct.
PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND APPROACH TO TARGET SET TING
The performance measures for the annual bonus are set by the 
Remuneration and Nominations Committee on an annual basis 
to reflect the Group’s financial objectives for any given year. 
The performance targets applied to the annual bonus are  
reviewed annually, based on a number of internal reference  
points (including the budget for the financial year and prior year 
performance) and external reference points (including consensus 
forecasts, forecasts for the wider luxury industry as well as  
the wider economic environment). 
The Committee believes that the pay-outs under the bonus plan 
should only be received for out-performance. Given the level of 
stretch in the performance targets for the annual bonus at all levels, 
the Committee considers it appropriate to set pay-outs for “target” 
performance at up to 75% of the maximum. Maximum awards will 
only be earned where the performance of the Group has significantly 
exceeded expectations.
The following sets out the performance measures that will be used 
for the annual bonus for 2015:
MEASURES  
• revenue growth;
• net income growth; and
• reduction in net working capital as a percentage of revenue.
WHY
The measures were chosen to support the Company’s key financial 
objectives for 2015 of:
• growth;
• margin expansion; and 
• strong cash flow generation. 
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS AND SHAREHOLDER ALIGNMENT
The Committee believes that the long-term incentive plan should 
primarily be used as a tool to align the interests of the management 
team with those of the Company’s shareholders. 
In order to achieve this primary objective and to ensure that the 
long-term incentive plan acts as a strong motivation and retention 
tool, encouraging individuals to remain in long-term employment with 
the Company, the Committee considers it appropriate to grant 
long-term incentive awards that are subject to an extended vesting 
period (i.e. five years from the date of grant) rather than granting 
awards which are subject to performance over a shorter period (i.e. 
three years from the date of grant), which the Committee considers 
may drive shorter-term behaviours.
To emphasise the link between the management team and 
shareholders, the Committee also encourages the Executive 
Directors to build up significant shareholdings in the Company. 
Executive Directors are therefore expected to build up a significant 
shareholding in the Company over the seven years following 
Admission. The shareholding guideline for the CEO is 500%  
of base salary and for the CFO is 200% of base salary.

SCENARIO CHARTS
The regulations require the inclusion of a scenario chart which sets out what each of the Executive Directors could receive for varying levels 
of performance in respect of the first year in which the Policy is to be effective. 
As set out in the Company’s Prospectus, the Committee does not currently intend to grant a long-term incentive award in respect of 2015 
and as such no determination has yet been made on the number of shares that would be granted to each of the Executive Directors under 
the long-term incentive plan. The following chart therefore only includes the value of base salary, pension, other benefits and allowances 
and the annual bonus.

The above charts are based on the following assumptions:
• Below threshold is based on fixed pay only, which includes 2015 base salary, pension (assuming both of the Executive Directors 
participate in the pension) and other benefits and allowances. For simplicity the normal maximum other benefit and allowances cap 
of £200,000 has been used. It is noted that the actual level of benefits will vary by year.
• Target includes fixed pay (as noted above) and target bonus opportunity (75% of the maximum).
• Maximum includes fixed pay (as noted above) and the maximum bonus opportunity. 
• The Committee does not currently intend to grant a long-term incentive award in respect of 2015. The value of long-term incentives 
has therefore been excluded from the above.
• Awards granted shortly after Admission have also been excluded as these were one-off in nature. 
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Purpose Approach to fees
Chairman and Non-Executive Director – fees
To attract and retain high-calibre  
Non-Executive Directors. 
Fees are set at a market appropriate rate with reference to fees paid to other Non-Executive 
Directors at companies of a similar size to the Company and to reflect the time commitment 
and the personal contribution expected from Non-Executive Directors. Fees are normally 
reviewed annually.
The remuneration of the Chairman is set by the Board based on a recommendation from 
the Remuneration and Nominations Committee. The Chairman is paid a single fee for 
all responsibilities.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is set by the Board based on a 
recommendation from the Chairman. Non-Executive Directors are paid a basic fee for their 
role. Additional fees may be paid for additional board duties such as chairmanship of a 
committee and the Senior Independent Director role. 
Fees are paid in cash. Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman are expected to invest 
50% of their net of tax fees in the Company’s shares. Any investment at Admission is 
recognised as a prepayment of such investment of fees.
Fees paid are subject to a maximum cap which is stated in the Company’s Articles of 
Association. Any changes in this would be subject to shareholder approval.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors –  
other benefits
To enable the Chairman and  
Non-Executive Directors to  
undertake their roles.
Reasonably incurred expenses will be reimbursed. Additional fees or benefits may be 
provided, where appropriate, at the discretion of the Board.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any incentive 
arrangements operated by the Company.  JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014
GOV ERN A NCE

REMUNERATION POLICY FOR NEW HIRES
The Committee aims to attract, motivate and retain an Executive 
Director with the required expertise to develop and deliver the 
business strategy, while at the same time ensuring that the 
remuneration arrangements offered are in the best interests 
of both the Company and its shareholders. 
In determining the appropriate remuneration arrangements for a new 
recruit, the Committee will take into account all relevant factors, 
including but not limited to, the individual’s skills and expertise, local 
market practice, appropriate market data, and the individual’s existing 
remuneration package. 
In cases of hiring a new recruit to the Board (including an internal 
promote), the Committee will ensure that the remuneration 
arrangements are in line with the approved remuneration policy and 
all its elements as set out in the table above. The ongoing annual 
remuneration arrangements for new Executive Directors will 
therefore comprise:
• base salary;
• suitable pension and other benefits and allowances (which may 
include a relocation allowance where the Committee considers 
it appropriate);
• an annual bonus opportunity; and
• a long-term incentive award. 
The maximum ongoing level of annual variable remuneration which 
may be awarded to a new executive shall therefore be limited to the 
levels set out in the Policy table (i.e. 200% of salary for the annual 
bonus and 2,500,000 shares under the long-term incentive plan) for 
Executive Directors, excluding buy-out awards.
The Committee retains the flexibility to undertake the following 
actions, as appropriate, in the best interests of the Company and 
therefore shareholders:
• For external appointments, the Committee may offer additional 
cash and/or share awards (‘buy-out’ awards) to take account of 
remuneration relinquished when leaving a former employer. As far 
as possible and appropriate, such payments would reflect the 
nature, time horizons and performance requirements attaching to 
the relinquished remuneration. Where appropriate, the Committee 
retains the discretion to utilise Listing Rule 9.4.2 for the purpose 
of making such an award.
• For an internal appointment, the Committee would honour any 
contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to the 
Executive Director level, even in instances where they would 
not otherwise be consistent with the prevailing Policy at the time 
of appointment.
• If necessary, the Committee may offer additional cash and/or 
share based elements to secure an appointment, for which the 
Committee has not set a maximum. The Committee would 
determine the performance conditions and time horizons that 
would apply to such awards at the time. The Committee would 
provide full disclosure of the rationale for such an award in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report in the year following such 
an award.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
If a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director is appointed, 
remuneration arrangements will normally be in line with  
those detailed in the remuneration policy for Non-Executive  
Directors above. 
SERVICE CONTRACT AND EXIT PAYMENT POLICY 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Executive Director service agreements, including for early 
termination, are carefully reviewed by the Committee. The 
Committee does not believe that there should be any element 
of reward for failure.
The Committee’s approach to termination payments is to consider 
each case on an individual basis taking into account any pre-
established contractual agreements (including the provisions of any 
incentive plans), the performance and conduct of the individual and 
the commercial justification for any payments. 
The key terms and conditions of the current Executive Directors, 
as stipulated in their service agreements are set out below:
NOTICE PERIOD 
• Each Executive Director’s service agreement is terminable by 
the Executive Director on six months’ written notice.
• The Company may terminate Pierre Denis’ service agreement 
on twelve months’ written notice.
• The Company may terminate Jonathan Sinclair’s service 
agreement on six months’ written notice.
• For new appointments the Committee’s policy is that Executive 
Director service agreements will provide up to twelve months’ 
notice by the Company and up to twelve months’ notice by the 
Executive Director.
TERMINATION PAYMENTS 
• The Company is entitled to terminate each Executive Director’s 
employment immediately and make a payment in lieu of notice 
comprising the executive’s base salary in respect of the notice 
period (or the remaining part of it) and a sum equal to the value of 
other benefits during the notice period (or the remaining part of it).
• Alternatively, the Company may continue to provide Jonathan 
Sinclair with his contractual benefits for the duration of what 
would have been his notice period (or the remaining part of it).
• The Company may elect at its discretion to make the payment in 
lieu as a lump sum or to pay half the payment in lieu as a lump 
sum and to pay the second half subsequently in equal instalments. 
• A duty to mitigate may apply to the payment in instalments.
ANNUAL BONUS 
• Where an Executive Director leaves office during the performance 
period (or after the end of the performance year but before 
payment is made) any bonus will be at the discretion of the 
Committee. Any payment will typically be on a pro-rata basis up 
to the termination date, taking into account the extent to which 
any performance targets have been met.
• Under his service contract, other than in certain “bad-leaver” 
circumstances, where the Company gives notice to Pierre Denis, 
he is entitled to a pro-rata annual bonus taking into account time in 
employment during the financial year and the extent to which any 
performance targets have been met. 
• Upon voluntary resignation or termination for cause no bonus 
payment would be made.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVES 
• The treatment of long-term incentive awards is governed by the 
relevant incentive plan.
 
JC PLC SHARE AWARD
• If a participant ceases employment with the Group by reason 
of disability, death or dismissal without cause (including mutual 
agreement) the Committee will determine the number of unvested 
awards that will vest taking into account the proportion of time 
elapsed since the original investment was made under the 
co-investment plan and a pre-agreed pro-rating approach for 
each tranche of the award.
• In other circumstances, unless the Committee determines 
otherwise, unvested awards will lapse on cessation 
of employment.
• Awards to the extent that they have vested on cessation of 
employment (or for any reason) or that are allowed to vest as 
referred to above will be exercisable for a period of up to twelve 
months from the date of cessation (or if earlier until the end of 
the option exercise period). 
ONE-OFF SHARE AWARD AND FUTURE AWARDS UNDER THE LONG-TERM 
INCENTIVE PLAN
• Unless the Committee in its sole discretion determines otherwise 
(in which case it will determine the terms on which awards vest 
and may be exercised), if a participant ceases to be employed 
by the Group for any reason, any awards will lapse on cessation 
of employment.
OTHER 
• Legal fees and outplacement costs may be paid if the Committee 
considers this commercially appropriate.
CHANGE OF CONTROL
• In the event of a change of control, Executive Directors may 
receive a bonus in respect of the year in which the change of 
control occurs, which, unless the Committee determines 
otherwise, will be pro-rated by reference to the time elapsed in 
the bonus year and performance achieved. 
• Long-term incentive awards will normally vest, taking into account 
the time elapsed between grant and vest, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise. Awards may alternatively be exchanged for 
an equivalent award in the acquirer, where appropriate. 
CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Non-Executive Directors and Chairman of the Board have letters 
of appointment which set out their duties and responsibilities. They 
do not have service contracts.
The Chairman’s letter of appointment states that his appointment is 
expected to last for at least six years, subject to annual re-election 
in general meeting. His appointment is terminable at any time upon 
written notice, in accordance with the Articles of Association, his 
resignation or in accordance with the relationship agreement entered 
into between the Company and JAB Luxury.
The appointments of each Non-Executive Director are for a fixed 
term of six years, subject to annual re-election in general meeting. 
The appointments of all the Non-Executive Directors may be 
terminated at any time upon written notice, in accordance with the 
Articles of Association or upon their resignations. In addition, the 
appointment of the Non-Executive Directors appointed pursuant to 
the relationship agreement entered into between the Company and 
JAB Luxury may be terminated in accordance with that agreement.
REMUNERATION POLICY IN THE REST OF THE COMPANY
The remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors outlined 
above are consistent with those for the other employees in the 
Group, although quantum and award opportunities vary by Executive 
level. Only the senior most executives in the Group participate in the 
long-term incentive plan.
During its deliberations on executive remuneration, the Committee 
considers the reward framework for all employees worldwide, 
ensuring that the principles applied are consistent with the Executive 
remuneration policy. Merit increases awarded to executives are 
determined within the broader context of employee remuneration.
Due to the size and geographical spread of the Group’s operations, 
it does not invite employees to comment on the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy. 
CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
Although the Company only recently became a public listed company, 
the Committee recognises the importance of understanding the 
views of their new shareholders. The Committee is therefore open to 
listening to the views of our new shareholders through the year and 
at the annual general meeting.
The Committee Chairman speaks with the Company’s largest 
shareholder on the subject of remuneration as and when appropriate. 
The Company’s largest shareholder is very supportive of the 
Company’s philosophy and policy on remuneration. The Committee 
will continue to keep its remuneration policy under review to ensure 
that it remains aligned with the Company’s strategic objectives and 
provides strong alignment with shareholder interests.  JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014

ANNUAL REMUNERATION REPORT
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
STATEMENT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY FOR 2015
BASE SAL ARY
No changes have been made to base salaries since Admission of the 
Company. The table below shows base salaries for 2015.
Pierre Denis £650,000
Jonathan Sinclair £350,000
PENSION
In respect of Pierre Denis, the Company will contribute up to €50,000 
to the Caisse des Français de l’Etranger. In respect of Jonathan 
Sinclair, the Company will contribute 10% of base salary to the 
Company’s Group Personal Pension Scheme if he contributes at 
least 5% of base salary. 
BENEF ITS
The Committee sets benefits in line with the policy set out on pages 
60 to 63. For 2015, both of the Executive Directors will receive private 
medical insurance for himself, his spouse and dependent children and 
life assurance. As agreed as part of his relocation arrangements on 
joining the Group, Pierre Denis will also be reimbursed for annual 
school fees in respect of his children (up to a maximum of £18,000 
per child) and receive a company car. 
ANNUAL BONUS
The maximum bonus opportunity for the Executive Directors in 
respect of 2015 will be as follows: 
Pierre Denis 120% of base salary
Jonathan Sinclair 50% of base salary
For 2015, the annual bonus opportunity will be based solely on  
the following financial performance metrics: revenue growth 
(measured on a constant exchange rate basis), net income  
growth and a reduction in net working capital as a percentage  
of revenue. 
Annual bonus awards will be paid in cash. 
The Committee considers the exact performance targets to  
be commercially sensitive and as such these have not been  
disclosed ahead of the financial year. However, in next year’s  
Annual Report and Financial Statements, the Committee will  
provide shareholders with appropriate context on performance 
against the performance targets and the rationale for any  
bonus pay-outs, within commercial constraints. 
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PL AN
There is currently no intention for Executive Directors to participate 
in the long-term incentive plan in 2015, given the awards received 
shortly after Admission.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The following table sets out the Non-Executive Director fee structure 
for 2015:
Chairman £150,000
Basic fee for Non-Executive Directors £50,000
Board Committee Chairman £15,000
Senior Independent Director £5,000
Fees will be paid in cash. Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman 
are expected to invest 50% of their net of tax fees in the Company’s 
shares, taking into account any investment prepaid at Admission.
SINGLE TOTAL FIGURE OF REMUNERATION FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2014 (AUDITED)
The following table sets out the total remuneration for Executive 
Directors for the year ended 31 December 2014. Given that 
Jimmy Choo PLC only listed as a public company on 22 October 2014, 
the figures shown represent the remuneration received over the 
period 22 October 2014 to 31 December 2014 and therefore do not 
include a prior year comparison figure.
The Executive Directors did not provide any qualifying services 
between 1 September 2014 (the date of appointment as Directors 
of Jimmy Choo PLC) and 22 October 2014.

pages 63 and 64. 
ELEMENTS OF THE SINGLE FIGURE OF REMUNERATION 
BASE SALARY
The values shown in the table represent the amount received since Admission of the Company. Annualised base salaries for the Executive 
Directors following Admission were:
Pierre Denis £650,000
Jonathan Sinclair £350,000
PENSION
For Pierre Denis, this represents the Company’s contribution to the Caisse des Français de l’Etranger. 
Jonathan Sinclair did not participate in the pension arrangements in 2014. 
OTHER BENEFITS AND ALLOWANCES
The values shown in the table represents the taxable value of benefits received during the financial year since Admission of the Company. 
For Pierre Denis this includes: company car, school fees (which is only drawn in respect of one of his three dependant children), private 
healthcare and product allowances. 
For Jonathan Sinclair this includes: private healthcare and product allowances.
ANNUAL BONUS
The value shown in the table reflects the annual bonus earned in respect of performance in the year ended 31 December 2014, pro-rated 
over the period since Admission of the Company. The bonus was paid in cash.
The Executive Directors’ annual bonus awards in relation to performance during 2014 were measured against a basket of metrics and 
objectives. For Pierre Denis and Jonathan Sinclair, they were weighted 70% on Group financial objectives and 30% on strategic objectives. 
The table below shows the overall outcome against each of the financial measures. The Board considered the financial performance of the 
Group to be strong in the year, and in particular, the Group made strong progress against the revenue target set at the beginning of the year. 
Although absolute Adjusted EBITDA performance was resilient during the year, the stretching targets set at the beginning of the year were 
not met and nor were the net working capital targets.

Actual targets have not been disclosed as they were set at a time prior to the Company becoming a listed Company and as such the Board 
considers the underlying targets to be commercially sensitive and any disclosure of such targets could be seriously prejudicial to the 
Group’s business.
A portion of Pierre Denis bonus was subject to performance against strategic objectives set at the beginning of the year. Pierre demonstrated 
strong performance against these objectives during the year, his key achievements in the year include development of the distribution 
network, leadership of the IPO and the transformation programme.
A portion of Jonathan Sinclair’s bonus was also subject to performance against strategic objectives set at the beginning of the year. Jonathan 
demonstrated strong performance against these objectives during the year, his key achievements in the year include a number of aspects of 
the successful IPO and the transformation programme. 
As a result of the above performance, the Committee considered it appropriate to pay Pierre Denis a bonus of c.43% of salary and Jonathan 
Sinclair a bonus of c.30% of salary, pro-rated for time based on his period of employment during the year
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES
As required under the regulations, the values shown in the table represents the face value of shares (based on a share price of £1.40) 
awarded following Admission which are subject to the Executive Directors continued employment with the Company only. Although the 
regulations require the disclosure of the full grant value of the awards in the single figure table, these awards are subject to continued 
employment requirements as set out below. The individuals have not yet received any value from these awards at this stage.
For Pierre Denis, this includes the face value of shares granted to him under the JC PLC Share Award, which as set out in the Remuneration 
Policy were granted to replace awards under a phantom share option plan that was operated by the Group prior to Admission. The value of 
the shares granted were linked to the Black-Scholes value of the phantom options that were surrendered by Mr. Denis before Admission of 
Company. These awards will only become exercisable in equal tranches in July 2016, July 2017 and July 2018 subject to Mr. Denis’ continued 
employment with the Company. 
It also includes the face value of the shares granted to him under the one-off award which was made shortly after Admission, which will vest 
50% on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant and 50% on the sixth anniversary of the date of grant subject to Mr. Denis’ continued 
employment with the Company. 
For Jonathan Sinclair, this includes the face value of shares granted to him under the one-off award which was made shortly after Admission, 
which will vest in equal tranches on the fourth, fifth and sixth anniversary of the date of grant subject to Mr Sinclair’s continued employment 
with the Company.

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SHAREHOLDINGS (AUDITED)
The Committee recognises the importance of aligning Executive Directors’ and shareholder interests through the executives building up 
significant shareholdings in the Company. Executive Directors are therefore expected to build up a significant shareholding in the Company 
over the seven years following Admission. The shareholding guideline for Pierre Denis is 500% of base salary and for Jonathan Sinclair is 
200% of base salary. 
The table below shows the shareholding of each Executive Director against their respective shareholding guideline as at 31 December 2014:

THE REMUNERATION AND NOMINATIONS COMMIT TEE
As of 31 December 2014, the Committee comprised of three Non-Executive Directors:
• Bart Becht (Chairman)
• Peter Harf
• Gianluca Brozzetti
The Committee determines and recommends to the Board the Group’s policy on executive remuneration, determines the level of 
remuneration for Executive Directors and the Chairman and other senior executives and prepares the annual remuneration report for approval 
by shareholders at the annual general meeting. The Committee also assists the Board in reviewing the structure, size and composition of the 
Board. It is also responsible for reviewing succession plans for the Directors, including the Chairman, the CEO and other senior executives. 
The Committee did not hold any scheduled meetings in the period following Admission of the Company to 31 December 2014. The Committee 
did however hold one scheduled meeting between the 31 December 2014 and the publication of this report.
During the year, the Committee received independent advice on executive remuneration matters from Deloitte LLP (“Deloitte”). Deloitte 
is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive 
remuneration consulting in the UK. The Committee has reviewed the advice provided by Deloitte during the year and is comfortable that it 
has been objective and independent. Total fees received by Deloitte in relation to the remuneration advice provided to the Committee during 
2014 amounted to £34,350 (excluding VAT) based on the required time commitment.

forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
INFORMATION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
This Annual Report and Financial Statements includes forward-
looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve 
known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are 
beyond the Company’s control and all of which are based on the 
directors’ current beliefs and expectations about future events. 
Forward-looking statements are sometimes identified by the use 
of forward-looking terminology such as “believe”, “expects”, “may”, 
“will”, “could”, “should”, “shall”, “risk”, “intends”, “estimates”, 
“aims”, “plans”, “predicts”, “continues”, “assumes”, “positioned” 
or “anticipates” or the negative thereof, other variations thereon 
or comparable terminology.
These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not 
historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this 
Annual Report and Financial Statements and includes statements 
regarding the intentions, beliefs or current expectations of the 
directors or the Company concerning, among other things, the results 
of operations, financial condition, prospects, growth, strategies 
(including continued store roll out plans), and dividend policy of the 
Company and the industry in which it operates. In particular, the 
statements regarding the Company’s strategy and other future 
events or prospects are forward-looking statements.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES IN RESPECT OF THE 
ANNUAL REPORT AND THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
Group and parent company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and parent 
company financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and 
have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in 
accordance with UK Accounting Standards. 
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of 
their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
parent company financial statements, the directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; 
• for the parent company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent 
company financial statements; and 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent 
company will continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group  
and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that complies with that law and those regulations. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation  
in other jurisdictions. 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view  
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and loss of the company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole; and
• the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the issuer and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face.
We consider the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken  
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy.

OPINIONS AND CONCLUSIONS ARISING FROM OUR AUDIT
1. OUR OPINION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS UNMODIFIED
We have audited the financial statements of Jimmy Choo PLC for  
the year ended 31 December 2014 set out on pages 81 to 122.  
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2014 and of the loss of the Group for the year 
then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with UK Accounting Standards; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
2. OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the 
risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our 
audit were as follows:
REVENUE RECOGNITION (REVENUE £299.7M)
Refer to page 54 (Audit and Risk Committee Report), note 1.15 
(accounting policy) and note 3 (financial disclosures).
THE RISK
Revenue is a key performance measure for the Group and a key 
driver for gross margin which is a further key indicator of Group 
performance. There are different revenue streams within the Group 
including for example, retail (including concessions), wholesale and 
online that have differing revenue recognition criteria and accounting 
processes handling a high volume of transactions. Due to its 
materiality in the context of the financial statements as a whole 
revenue is considered to be one of the areas which had the greatest 
effect on our overall audit strategy and allocation of resources in 
planning and completing our audit. 
OUR RESPONSE
Our audit procedures in this area included:
• we tested the design and operating effectiveness of key controls 
around the recognition of revenue, including those related to the 
reconciliation of cash receipts to sales records;
• we used a statistical sampling tool to select manual journals 
posted to revenue to critically assess whether these journals were 
appropriate and supported by documentation where relevant;
• we selected samples of sale transactions from either side of the 
financial year end and, to assess the appropriateness of the timing 
of revenue recognition compared those sales to supporting 
documentation; and
• we challenged the adequacy of the group’s provision for returns 
in the light of the historical pattern of credits given for returns.
We also assessed the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect 
of revenue recognition.
PRESENTATION OF EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS (EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS – £13.0M)
Refer to page 54 (Audit and Risk Committee Report), note 1.17 
(accounting policy) and note 5 (financial disclosures).
THE RISK
Operating profit before exceptional items is a key performance 
measure for the Group. Exceptional items are defined by the 
Group in an accounting policy set out in the financial statements. 
The identification of items as exceptional, and their quantification, 
requires the application of significant judgement. 
OUR RESPONSE
Our audit procedures in this area included:
• we obtained a listing of the items identified as exceptional by the 
Group, discussed with the Group the rationale for classifying them 
as exceptional and critically assessed whether the items meet the 
definition of exceptional items as set out in the Group’s 
accounting policies;
• we selected a sample of the underlying items which are 
aggregated and classified as exceptional and agreed these items 
back to supporting documentation; and
• we considered whether any other items we became aware of 
in the course of our audit work might be considered to be 
exceptional under the definition set out in the Group’s 
accounting policies.
We also assessed the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect 
of exceptional items.
3. OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALIT Y AND AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE 
OF OUR AUDIT
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set 
at £2.0m, determined with reference to a benchmark of Group loss 
before tax normalised for interest and exceptional costs (£35.7m of 
which it represents 5.6%). 
We report to the Audit and Risk Committee any corrected or 
uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £0.1m, in addition  
to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds. 
Of the group’s seventeen reporting components, we subjected six to 
audits for group reporting purposes and two to specified risk-focused 
audit procedures. The latter were not individually financially significant 
enough to require an audit for group reporting purposes, but did 
present specific individual risks, principally around revenue recognition, 
that needed to be addressed. These Group procedures covered 91% 
of total Group revenue; 97% of Group profit before taxation; and 96% 
of total Group assets. 
The remaining 9% of total Group revenue, 3% of Group profit  
before taxation and 4% of total Group assets is represented by nine 
reporting components, none of which individually represented more 
than 10% of any of total Group revenue, Group profit before tax, or 
total Group assets. For these remaining components, we performed 
analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment 
that there were no significant risks of material misstatement 
within these.

The Group audit team instructed component auditors as to the 
significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed 
above and the information to be reported back. The Group audit team 
approved the component materiality of £1.5m, having regard to the 
mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components. The 
Group audit team visited three component locations in UK and USA 
to perform the audit work. The work on all of the remaining in scope 
components was performed by component auditors. 
Telephone conference meetings were held with these component 
auditors. At these meetings, the findings reported to the Group audit 
team were discussed in more detail, and any further work required by 
the Group audit team was then performed by the component auditor.
4. OUR OPINION ON OTHER MAT TERS PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES 
ACT 2006 IS UNMODIFIED
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report 
for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
5. WE HAVE NOTHING TO REPORT IN RESPECT OF THE MAT TERS ON 
WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if,  
based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have 
identified other information in the annual report that contains a 
material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the financial 
statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise 
misleading. In particular, we are required to report to you if:
• we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit and the Directors’ 
statement that they consider that the annual report and financial 
statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group’s performance, business model and strategy; or
• the Report of the Audit and Risk Committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the 
Audit and Risk Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
• the directors’ statement, set out on page 74, in relation to going 
concern; and
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on page 48 
relating to the Company’s compliance with the ten provisions of 
the 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
SCOPE OF REPORT AND RESPONSIBILITIES
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement 
set out on page 75, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view. A description of the scope of an audit of financial 
statements is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website 
at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report is made solely 
to the Company’s members as a body and is subject to important 
explanations and disclaimers regarding our responsibilities, published 
on our website at www.kpmg.com/uk/auditscopeukco2014a, which 
are incorporated into this report as if set out in full and should be read 
to provide an understanding of the purpose of this report, the work 
we have undertaken and the basis of our opinions.

1. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Jimmy Choo PLC (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (together 
referred to as the “Group”) is a global luxury shoes and accessories 
brand owner, wholesaler and retailer incorporated and domiciled in 
the United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been 
prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
EU (“Adopted IFRS”).
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, 
been applied consistently to all years presented in these Group 
financial statements.
Judgements made by the directors in the application of these 
accounting policies, that have a significant effect on the financial 
statements and estimates with a significant risk of material 
adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 2.
1.1 MEASUREMENT CONVENTION
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost 
basis, except for financial instruments that are measured at revalued 
amounts or fair values at the end of each reporting year, as explained 
in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on 
the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and 
services. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid 
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that 
price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation 
technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the 
Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability  
if market participants would take those characteristics into account 
when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value 
for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these consolidated 
financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for share 
based payment transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 2, 
leasing transactions that are within the scope of IAS 17, and 
measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are  
not fair value, such as net realisable value in IAS 2 or value  
in use in IAS 36. 
In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements 
are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which 
the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the 
significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its 
entirety, which are described as follows: 
• Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for 
identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the 
measurement date;
• Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within 
Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
or indirectly; and
• Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.2 GOING CONCERN
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going 
concern basis as the directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence  
for the foreseeable future. The Group has considerable financial 
resources, together with a strong ongoing trading performance. 
Details of the Group’s liquidity position and borrowing facilities are 
described in note 18. Financial risk management objectives, details of 
financial instruments and hedging activities, and exposures to credit 
risk and liquidity risk are described in note 23. 
The directors have reviewed the Group’s forecasts and projections. 
These include the assumptions around the Group’s products and 
markets, expenditure commitments, expected cash flows and 
borrowing facilities. 
Taking into account reasonably possible changes in trading 
performance, and after making enquiries, the directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly the directors consider it appropriate 
to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
1.3 BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
On 16 October 2014 the Company obtained control of the entire 
share capital of Choo Luxury Group Limited by way of a share for 
share exchange with one share in the Company being exchanged for 
each share in Choo Luxury Group Limited. There were no changes in 
rights or proportion of control exercised as a result of this transaction. 
Although the share for share exchange resulted in a change in legal 
ownership, in substance these financial statements reflect the 
continuation of the pre-existing Group, headed by Choo Luxury 
Group Limited.
As a result the comparatives presented in these financial statements 
are the consolidated results of Choo Luxury Group Limited. The 
prior year statement of financial position reflects the share capital 
structure of Choo Luxury Group Limited. The current year statement 
of financial position presents the legal change in the ownership of  
the Group, as well as the issue of shares in satisfaction of the 
shareholder credit facility. The consolidated statement of changes 
in equity explains the impact of these transactions in more detail. 
SUBSIDIA RIES
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control. The Group 
controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, 
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the 
ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. 
In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential 
voting rights that are currently exercisable. The acquisition date is 
the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. The financial 
statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial 
statements from the date that control commences until the date that 
control ceases. Intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised 
profits on transactions between Group companies are eliminated 
in preparing the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
Employee benefit trusts that are controlled by the Group are 
consolidated on the same basis as subsidiaries as set out above. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
87
1. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
CON TINUED
1.4 ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant 
influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. 
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds 
between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity. Joint 
ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has 
joint control. 
Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity 
method (equity accounted investees) and are initially recognised 
at cost. The Group’s investment includes goodwill identified on 
acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The 
consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the 
total comprehensive income and equity movements of equity 
accounted investees, from the date that significant influence or joint 
control commences until the date that significant influence or joint 
control ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its 
interest in an equity accounted investee, the Group’s carrying amount 
is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued 
except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive 
obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee.
1.5 FOREIGN CURRENCY
FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATIONAL CURRENCIES
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s 
entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds 
sterling which is the Company’s functional and the Group’s 
presentational currency.
TRANSACTIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective 
functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate 
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are 
retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate 
ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation 
are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the 
transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the 
functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates 
the fair value was determined.
TRANSL ATION OF THE RESULTS OF OVERSEAS BUSINESSES
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and 
fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to the 
Group’s presentational currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at 
the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign 
operations are translated at an average rate for the year where this 
rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates 
of the transactions. Exchange differences arising from this translation 
of foreign operations are reported as an item of other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in the translation reserve.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a 
foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity 
and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising are 
recognised in other comprehensive income.
1.6 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only 
to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: 
(a) they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver 
cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or 
financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are 
potentially unfavourable to the Group; and 
(b) where the instrument will or may be settled in the Group’s own 
equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no 
obligation to deliver a variable number of the Group’s own equity 
instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Group’s 
exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for 
a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are 
classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified 
takes the legal form of the company’s own shares, the amounts 
presented in these financial statements for called up share capital 
exclude amounts in relation to those shares. 
FINANCIAL ASSETS
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value on the 
consolidated balance sheet when the entity becomes a party to  
the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset is 
derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flow expire 
or substantially all risks and rewards of the asset are transferred.
i. TRADE RECEIVABLES
Trade and other receivables are included in current assets, except  
for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. 
Receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method,  
less any provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when 
there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect 
all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The 
amount of the provision is determined as the difference between the 
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future 
cash flows, and is recognised in the consolidated income statement 
in administrative expenses.
ii. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held  
at call with banks with an original maturity of three months or less. 
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and 
cash equivalents includes bank overdrafts in addition to the 
definition above.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according  
to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual 
interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
88
1. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
CON TINUED
The Group’s financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables, 
borrowings and other non-current liabilities. All financial liabilities are 
recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method except for 
derivatives, which are classified as held for trading, except where 
they qualify for hedge accounting, and are held at fair value. The 
fair value of the Group’s liabilities held at amortised cost are 
approximately equal to their carrying amount. A financial liability 
is derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract 
is discharged, cancelled or expires.
i. BANK BORROWINGS
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of 
the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the 
borrowing. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; 
any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and 
the redemption value is recognised in the consolidated income 
statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective 
interest method.
Financial expenses comprise interest expense on borrowings and 
the cost of foreign currency forward contracts.
ii. TRADE PAYABLES
Trade and other payables are included in current liabilities, except 
for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. 
Payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
iii. PUT OPTION LIABILITIES OVER NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST
Put options over shares in subsidiaries or joint ventures held by 
non-controlling interests are recognised initially at fair value through 
equity when granted. They are subsequently remeasured at fair value 
at each reporting period with the change in fair value recorded in 
the consolidated income statement as other finance expenses 
and income.
iv. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its 
exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates arising on certain 
trading transactions. The principal derivative instruments used are 
forward foreign exchange contracts taken out to hedge highly 
probable cash flows in relation to future sales and product purchases.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value. The gain 
or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised in the 
consolidated income statement.
1.7 PROPERT Y, PL ANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have 
different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of 
property, plant and equipment.
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance 
leases. Operating lease payments are accounted for as described 
at 1.16 Operating leases below.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of 
property, plant and equipment. The estimated useful lives are 
as follows:
Leasehold improvements between 4 and 10 years
Fixtures and fittings, plant and machinery between 3 and 10 years
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed 
at each balance sheet date or if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
1.8 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using 
the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business 
combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum 
of the acquisition date fair values of assets transferred by the Group, 
liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree 
and the equity interest issued by the Group in exchange for control of 
the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are recognised in profit or loss 
as incurred.
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the 
liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration 
transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the 
acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity 
interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition date 
amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities 
assumed. If, after reassessment, the net of the acquisition date 
amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any 
non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the 
acquirer’s previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess 
is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain. 
When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business 
combination includes asset or liability resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured 
at its acquisition date fair value and included as part of the 
consideration transferred in a business combination. Changes in fair 
value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement 
period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding 
adjustments against goodwill. Measurement period adjustments are 
adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during 
the ‘measurement period’ (which cannot exceed one year from 
the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed 
at the acquisition date. 
The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the 
contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement period 
adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is 
classified. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is 
not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent 
settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration 
that is classified as an asset or a liability is remeasured at subsequent 
reporting dates in accordance with IAS 39 or IAS 37 Provisions, 
Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, as appropriate, with 
the corresponding gain or loss being recognised in profit or loss.  JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014

1. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
CON TINUED
When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s 
previously held interests in the acquired entity is remeasured to its 
acquisition date fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is 
recognised in profit or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the 
acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been 
recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit 
or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest 
were disposed of.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by 
the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the 
Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the 
accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted 
during the measurement period (see above), or additional assets or 
liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about 
facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if 
known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
1.9 ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS OF NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS
Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests that do not 
result in a change of control are accounted for as transactions with 
owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is 
recognised as a result of such transactions. The adjustments to 
non-controlling interests are based on a proportionate amount of the 
net assets of the subsidiary. Any difference between the price paid 
or received and the amount by which non-controlling interests are 
adjusted is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the 
owners of the parent.
1.10 INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL
GOODW IL L
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised 
but tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not 
be recoverable.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to 
each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from 
synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating unit is less that the carrying amount of the unit, the 
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of 
goodwill and then to the other assets of the unit on a pro rata basis. 
Impairment losses relating to goodwill are not reversed in 
subsequent years.
For further details see 1.12 Impairment excluding inventories and 
deferred tax assets.
BR A ND
Brands acquired in a business combination are recognised at 
fair value at the acquisition date and are carried at cost less 
accumulated impairment.
The Jimmy Choo brand is the only intangible asset that is considered 
to have an indefinite useful life on the basis that:
• the brand is central to the business strategy, differentiating the 
products in the market through building a reputation for excellence 
and it is not considered realistic to abandon the brand given its 
importance to the business; 
• the brand does not face technological obsolescence and the 
luxury market is not a sector with a definite life;
• the Group is able to protect the brand and associated products 
from counterfeiters or other infringements through securing 
protection of its intellectual property and enforcing this through 
litigation where necessary; and 
• the Group dedicates sufficient resources to support the brand and 
plans to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. This includes 
investment across all forms of media to convey the fundamental 
tenets of the brand.
The brand value is not amortised but subject to an impairment 
test which is performed annually or more frequently if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may  
not be recoverable.
For further details see 1.12 Impairment excluding inventories and 
deferred tax assets.
KEY MONEY
Key money paid to the outgoing tenant to enter a leasehold property 
is stated within intangible assets at cost, net of amortisation and any 
provision for impairment. Amortisation is charged on key money at 
rates calculated to write-off the cost, less estimated residual value 
(which in some locations and geographies equates to cost) on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term.
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The cost of securing and renewing design patents, trademarks and 
other intangible assets is capitalised at purchase price and amortised 
by equal annual instalments over the period in which benefits are 
expected to accrue. The useful economic life of these assets is 
determined on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the terms 
of the underlying agreement and the nature of the asset.
A MOR TISATION
Amortisation is charged to the statement of profit and loss on a 
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets 
unless such lives are indefinite. Intangible assets with an indefinite 
useful life including the Jimmy Choo brand and goodwill are 
systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. 
Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available 
for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Trademarks 5-10 years
Software 3-7 years
1.11 INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost is based on the weighted average principle and includes 
expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and other costs 
in bringing them to their existing location and condition. 
Where necessary, provision is made to reduce the cost to no more 
than net realisable value having regard to the nature and condition 
of inventory, as well as anticipated utilisation and saleability. 
1.12 IMPAIRMENT EXCLUDING INVENTORIES AND DEFERRED TA X ASSETS
FINANCIAL ASSETS (INCLUDING RECEIVABLES)
A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is 
assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is 
objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if 
objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the 
initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event has a negative 
effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be 
estimated reliably. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
90
1. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
CON TINUED
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at 
amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying 
amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows 
discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Interest on 
the impaired asset continues to be recognised through the unwinding 
of the discount. When a subsequent event causes the amount of 
impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is 
reversed through profit or loss.
NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than 
inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting 
date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. 
If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is 
estimated. For goodwill, and intangible assets that have indefinite 
useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable 
amount is estimated each year at the same time.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is 
the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, 
assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into 
the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from 
continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of 
other assets or groups of assets (the “cash-generating unit”). The 
goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of 
impairment testing, is allocated to cash-generating units, (“CGU”). 
CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that 
the level at which impairment is tested reflects the lowest level at 
which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes which 
does not exceed the level of individual operating segments. Goodwill 
acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs 
that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset 
or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment 
losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first 
to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units, 
and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the 
units on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect 
of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior years are 
assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss 
has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed 
if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the 
recoverable amount, only to the extent that the asset’s carrying 
amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment 
loss had been recognised.
1.13 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PL ANS
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under 
which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and 
has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. 
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans 
are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement 
in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED
SHORT-TERM BENEFITS
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an 
undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is 
provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid 
under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has 
a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a 
result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation 
can be estimated reliably.
1.14 PROVISIONS
A provision is recognised in the consolidated balance sheet when the 
Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a 
past event, that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an 
outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
Provisions are discounted if the effect of the time value of money is 
material using a pre-tax market rate adjusted for risks specific to 
the liability.
1.15 REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue, which is stated excluding Value Added Tax and other sales 
related taxes, is the amount receivable for goods supplied (less 
returns, trade discounts and allowances) and royalties receivable.
Wholesale sales are recognised when the significant risks and 
rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer, with 
provisions made for expected returns and allowances. Retail sales, 
returns and allowances are reflected at the dates of transactions with 
customers. Provisions for returns on retail and wholesale sales are 
calculated based on historical return levels. 
Royalty revenue from licensing agreements is recognised on an 
accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant 
agreement (provided that it is probable that the economic benefits 
will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be 
measured reliably).
1.16 OPERATING LEASES
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease 
except where another more systematic basis is more representative 
of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset 
are consumed. Contingent rentals arising under operating leases are 
recognised as an expense in the year in which they are incurred.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into an 
operating lease such incentives are recognised as a liability. Lease 
incentives are recognised as a reduction of rental expense on 
a straight-line basis over the lease term, except where another 
systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in 
which economic benefits from the lease are consumed.
Premiums paid to landlords to secure operating leases are recognised 
as assets and depreciated to residual value over the lease term.
1.17 EXCEPTIONAL COSTS
Exceptional items are non-recurring items which are outside the 
normal scope of the Group’s ordinary activities such as costs arising 
from a fundamental restructuring of the Group’s operations or are 
considered to be one-off in nature. Such items are disclosed 
separately within the consolidated income statement. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014

1.18 FINANCIAL INCOME AND EXPENSES
Financial expenses comprise interest payable and changes in the 
fair value of financial liabilities that are recognised in the income 
statement. Financial income comprises interest receivable on funds 
invested and changes in the fair value of financial assets recognised 
in the income statement.
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss 
as it accrues, using the effective interest method. 
1.19 TA X ATION
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred 
tax. Tax is recognised in the consolidated income statement and 
consolidated statement of other comprehensive income except to 
the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in 
which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable 
income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable 
in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following 
temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of 
goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect 
neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business 
combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries 
to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable 
future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected 
manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets 
and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that future profits will be available against which the 
temporary difference can be utilised. 
Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when 
there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority 
on either the same taxable entities or different taxable entities where 
there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
1.20 SHARE BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS
CASH-SET TLED SHARE BASED PAYMENT SCHEMES
Share based payment transactions in which the Group receives 
goods or services by incurring a liability to transfer cash or other 
assets that is based on the price of the Group’s equity instruments 
are accounted for as cash-settled share based payments. The fair 
value of the amount payable to employees is recognised as an 
expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period 
in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment. 
The liability is remeasured at each balance sheet date and at 
settlement date. Any changes in the fair value of the liability 
are recognised as personnel expense in the consolidated 
income statement.
EQUIT Y-SET TLED SHARE BASED PAYMENT SCHEMES
Share based payment transactions in which the Group receives 
goods or services by incurring a liability to transfer its own equity 
instruments are accounted for as equity-settled share based 
payments. The payments are assessed at their fair value on the grant 
date. The cost of the share based incentives is recognised as an 
expense over the vesting period of the awards, with a corresponding 
increase in equity. The estimate of the number of options expected 
to vest is revised at each balance sheet date.
When options and awards are exercised, they are settled through 
awards of shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust. The proceeds 
received from the exercises, net of any directly attributable 
transaction costs, are credited to equity. 
1.21 OWN SHARES RESERVE 
Where the Company or its subsidiaries (including the Jimmy Choo 
PLC Employee Benefit Trust) purchase the Company’s own  
equity shares, the cost of those shares, including any attributable 
transaction costs, is presented within the own shares reserve  
as a deduction in shareholders’ equity in the consolidated 
financial statements. 
1.22 ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED STANDARDS
ADOPTION OF NEW STANDARDS
With effect from 1 January 2014, the Group has adopted the 
following standards and amendments endorsed by the IASB

IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements 
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 
IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements
IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
The following new standards, amendments to standards or

FUTURE ADOPTION OF NEW STANDARDS
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the 
following standards and interpretations which have not been applied 
in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and 
in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
IAS 19 (Amendments) Defined Benefit Plans: Employee 
Contributions 
IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts
IFRS 11 (Amendments) Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests 
in Joint Operations 
IAS 16 and 36 Classification of Acceptable Methods 
of Depreciation and Amortisation
IAS 27 (Amendments) Equity Method in Separate Financial 
Statements 
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
The Group chose not to adopt any of the above standards and 
interpretations early. No significant net impact from the adoption 
of these new standards is expected.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a 
reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed 
review has been completed.
2. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the 
directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and various other 
factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing 
basis based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable 
under the circumstances. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised and in any 
future year impacted. The key judgements and estimates employed 
in the financial statements are considered below. 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED
IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE 
ASSE TS
On an annual basis, the Group is required to perform an impairment 
review to assess whether the carrying value of goodwill and other 
indefinite life intangible assets is less than its recoverable amount. 
Recoverable amount is based on a calculation of expected future 
cash flows, which include estimates of future performance. Details 
of assumptions used in the impairment tests are detailed in note 11.
KEY MONEY VALUATION
Judgement is required in estimating the residual value of key money 
paid to outgoing tenants to secure a leasehold property. In certain 
locations, the residual value of key money is considered to be equal 
to cost; either due to legal protection offered to tenants in that 
jurisdiction or because it is common practice to at least recover the 
amounts paid at the end of the lease due to the existence of an active 
market for operating leases of prime luxury real estate. 
VALUATION OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The assessment of fair value in a business combination requires the 
recognition and measurement of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities in the acquired business. The key judgements 
required are the identification of intangible assets meeting the 
recognition criteria of IAS 38 and their attributable fair values. The 
key assumptions in relation to the brand valuation are the directors’ 
best estimate of its life and the royalty and discount rate used in 
its valuation.
SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
The vesting of awards granted under the Group’s share based 
payments scheme is dependent upon continued employment 
within the Group over the vesting period. Judgement is required 
in determining the number of shares that will ultimately vest.
TA X ATION
The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon 
future taxable income and the expected recoverability of the balance. 
The estimate will include assumptions regarding future income 
streams of the Group and the future movement in corporation tax 
rates in the respective jurisdictions. The estimation of liabilities in 
respect of current taxation depends on estimates and judgements in 
respect of whether or not, and the extent to which items of income 
and expenditure will be taxable.  JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014

3. OPERATING SEGMENTS
The Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) is the Board of Directors. Internal management reports are reviewed by the CODM. Key 
measures used to evaluate segment performance are revenue and segment contribution to EBITDA. Management believes that these 
measures are the most relevant in evaluating the performance of the segment and for making resource allocation decisions as central 
costs are not allocated across the segments.
The CODM considers the Group’s segments to be its three channels to market, being retail (including online), wholesale and other. 
Retail revenue is generated through the sale of luxury goods to end consumers via Jimmy Choo directly operated stores in Europe, USA, 
Hong Kong, China and Japan and via the Group’s website.
Wholesale revenue is generated through the sale of luxury goods to distribution partners, multi-brand department stores and speciality 
stores worldwide.
Other revenue is predominantly generated through receipt of royalties from the Group’s global licensees of Jimmy Choo branded fragrance, 
sunglasses and eyewear products.
There are no material inter-segment transactions. 
An analysis of net assets by segment is not reviewed by the CODM and accordingly is not presented below.

11 INTANGIBLE ASSETS CON TINUED
ALLOCATION OF INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The carrying value of goodwill is allocated as follows:
2014 
£000
2013 
£000
Retail 187 ,856 187 ,565 
Wholesale 114,172 114,172 
Other 4,650 2,863 
306,678 304,600
Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually or where there is an indication that 
goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable amount of all cash generating units has been determined on a value-in-use basis.
Goodwill of £294.2m arising on the acquisition of Passion Holdings Limited on 1 July 2011 is allocated to the groups of cash generating units 
acquired that represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. This is 
consistent with the determination of operating segments. For the purpose of impairment testing, the value-in-use of each operating segment 
is calculated as described below. 
Goodwill arising on the acquisitions of J. Choo Hong Kong JV Limited, the business line of Jimmy Choo in Shanghai Kutu Trading Co., Ltd. 
and J. Choo Russia JV Limited described in note 13 is allocated to the retail segment for impairment testing.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of Studio Luxury S.r.l. on 5 August 2014 described in note 13 is allocated to the other segment for 
impairment testing. 
The Jimmy Choo brand, which was valued at £263.8m on the acquisition of Passion Holdings Limited on 1 July 2011 is considered to have an 
indefinite useful life and accordingly is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or where an indicator of impairment is identified. The brand 
is fundamental to the operations of the Group as a whole and is therefore not allocated to cash-generating units but tested for impairment at 
the Group level. 
IMPAIRMENT TESTING
The value-in-use is represented by the discounted value of future cash flows that are expected from continuous use of the assets associated 
with the cash generating units and by the terminal value attributable to them. In assessing the value-in-use, the cash flow projections were 
taken from the Group’s five year business plan, approved by the Board of Directors. The cash flow projections are subject to key assumptions 
in respect of discount rates, future net revenue, margin and EBITDA growth. The directors have reviewed and approved the assumptions 
inherent in the model as part of the annual budget process using historical experience and considering economic and business risks facing 
the Group.
The terminal value was determined using a perpetuity long-term growth rate in line with macro-economic estimates of 3%.
In assessing the Group’s value-in-use a discount rate of 9.9% (2013: 11.3%) has been applied to the groups of cash generating units. 
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the value-in-use calculations by assuming a reasonable change in the discount rate, revenue 
growth rates, EBITDA margins and terminal growth rates. The sensitivity analysis indicated significant headroom between the recoverable 
amount under these scenarios and the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles.
No impairment has been recognised in respect of the carrying value of the goodwill or the brand in any of the years presented as, for each 
cash generating unit and the Group as a whole, the recoverable amount exceeds its carrying value.

acquired, the workforce and the value of other immaterial intangible assets acquired. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be 
deductible for income tax purposes. 
ACQUISITIONS IN THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2013
On 29 May 2013 J. Choo Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary undertaking of the Group, entered into a joint venture agreement with Rubinse 
Trading LLC to form J. Choo Russia JV Limited. The Directors have concluded that the Group has control over the joint venture because it has 
the ability to appoint the majority of Directors to the Board of the company and accordingly has consolidated the results of J. Choo Russia JV 
Limited and its immediate subsidiary undertaking, J. Choo RUS LLC, in the Group’s consolidated financial statements from 13 March 2013, 
the date of the incorporation of J. Choo Russia JV Limited.
The joint venture agreement includes a put and call option which requires the Group to purchase the share capital of the joint venture partner 
on expiry of the joint venture agreement in 2018 which has been accounted for under the anticipated acquisition method, resulting in the 
recognition of goodwill of £0.3m.

date (see below for aged analysis). In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the credit  
quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The Group has recognised an allowance  
for doubtful receivables at each reporting date by considering the recoverability of each receivable. The average age of receivables is  
32 days (2013: 27 days).

22. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
During the year the Group operated two equity-settled share based compensation schemes and one cash-settled share based payment 
scheme for its Directors and employees. Details of each of these schemes are set out in this note.
CASH-SETTLED SHARE OPTION SCHEME
PHANTOM OPTION SCHEME
The Group operated a long term incentive plan open to invited employees of the Group (“the Participants”), which was accounted for as 
a cash-settled share based payment scheme. The Participants in the scheme were required to purchase equity in Choo Luxury Holdings 
Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group (“the Subsidiary”) in order to receive matching phantom options over the shares of 
the Subsidiary. 
A put and call agreement existed between the Participants and the Subsidiary which enabled the Participant to put their equity shares back 
to the Subsidiary at fair value. The Subsidiary could call the shares in the event of a change in control or if the Participant left employment 
with the Group. The put and call agreement was accounted for as a cash settled share based payment scheme as the Participants were 
required to remain employed by the Group in order to participate in any increase in the fair value of the underlying equity shares. 
The IPO of the Group in October 2014 triggered the vesting conditions of the all the options. Of these, 5,387,877 options were exercised at 
a fair value of £1.40, calculated with reference to the IPO price. The remaining 3,571,713 were cancelled and replaced by the equity-settled  
JC PLC Scheme detailed below. 
At IPO the Participants also exchanged their shares in Choo Luxury Holdings Limited for shares in Jimmy Choo PLC via a series of share-for-
share exchanges. The put and call agreement over the Participants’ shares in Choo Luxury Holdings Limited lapsed at IPO. The liability of 
£3.5m that had previously been recognised in respect of the put and call agreement was therefore reclassified to equity. 
The total liability recognised in respect of the cash settled share based payment scheme at 31 December 2014 was £nil (2013: £5.9m).

EQUITY-SETTLED SHARE OPTION SCHEMES
JC PLC SHARE AWARD
Following the partial vesting of the Phantom Option Scheme at IPO in October 2014, 3,571,713 options were cancelled and a new equity-
settled share based payment scheme implemented (the “JC PLC Share Award”). The number of shares awarded under the JC PLC Share 
Award was calculated by reference to the value attributed to the proportion of previously held phantom options. For each phantom option 
forfeited, Participants received 0.55 share awards, with a nominal exercise price of £1 in total for each exercise. 
The options are due to vest in three stages: one third are exercisable on 1 July 2016; one third are exercisable 1 July 2017; and the remaining 
third are exercisable on 1 July 2018. The vesting of these options is dependent upon continued employment over the vesting period. 
Any vested but unexercised options will automatically lapse on 21 October 2024. 
Movements in the number of share awards outstanding are as follows:
2014 2013
Outstanding at the beginning of the year – –

The weighted average exercise price of the options is £nil. 
ONE-OFF AWARD
On 30 October 2014, share awards of 10,192,858 ordinary shares in Jimmy Choo PLC were granted as a one-off award at IPO to members 
of the Group’s senior management team, with a nominal exercise price of £1 in total for each exercise.
The options were awarded in three tranches each with different vesting conditions:
1. MAIN AWARD
50% of the options granted are exercisable on the fifth anniversary of the grant date and 50% are exercisable on the sixth anniversary 
of the grant date. The total number of shares granted under this award was 8,271,429.
2. ALTERNATE GRANT 1
33% of the options granted are exercisable on the fourth anniversary of the grant date; 33% are exercisable on the fifth anniversary of 
the grant date and 33% are exercisable on the sixth anniversary of the grant date. The total number of shares granted under this award 
was 1,071,429. 
3. ALTERNATE GRANT 2
850,000 options were granted with vesting conditions that are the same as the JC PLC Share Awards described above.
The vesting of these options is dependent upon continued employment over the vesting period. Any vested but unexercised options will 
automatically lapse on 21 October 2024. The fair value of the award was determined as £1.40 based on the market value of ordinary shares 
at the grant date.
Movements in the number of share awards outstanding are as follows:

23. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Directors have overall responsibility for the oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. A formal process for reviewing and 
managing risk in the business has been developed. A register of strategic and operational risk is maintained and reviewed by the Directors, 
who also monitor the status of agreed actions to mitigate key risks.
CREDIT RISK
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, 
and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from wholesale customers and the Group’s foreign exchange forward contracts.
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. The trade receivables balance is spread across a large number of different 
customers. The Group has policies in place to ensure that wholesale sales are made to customers with an appropriate credit history. The 
Group only sells to wholesale customers who are creditworthy and mitigates risk in certain markets by trading on terms with accelerated 
payments, bank guarantees and letters of credit, as well as adopting credit insurance when appropriate. The Group monitors the 
creditworthiness of counterparties using publicly available information. As a result the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant and 
default rates have historically been very low. Sales to retail customers are made in cash or via major credit cards. An ageing of overdue 
receivables is included in note 17.
The Group is also exposed to credit risk arising from other financial assets, which comprise cash and short-term deposits and certain 
derivative instruments. The Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from the default of the counterparty with a maximum exposure equal to 
the carrying value of these instruments if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligation. The Group’s policy 
is that surplus funds are placed on deposit with counterparties, who are either party to the Group’s banking syndicate, or who are credit 
worthy counterparties.
LIQUIDITY RISK
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group ensures that it has 
sufficient cash or loan facilities to meet all its commitments when they fall due by ensuring that there is sufficient cash or working capital 
facilities to meet the Group’s cash requirements. 
The risk is measured by review of forecast liquidity each month to determine whether there are sufficient credit facilities to meet forecast 
requirements and by monitoring covenants on a regular basis to ensure there are no expected significant breaches, which would lead to an 
“Event of Default”. Cash flow forecasts are submitted monthly to the Directors. These continue to demonstrate the strong cash generating 
ability of the business and its ability to operate within existing agreed banking facilities. There have been no breaches of covenants during 
the reported years. For further details of the Group’s borrowings see note 18.
All short-term trade and other payables, accruals, bank overdrafts and borrowings mature within one year or less. The carrying value of all 
financial liabilities due in less than one year is equal to their contractual undiscounted cash flows.
The maturity profile of the contractual undiscounted cash flows of the Group’s non-current financial liabilities, excluding derivatives used for 
hedging, is as follows:
2014 
£000
2013 
£000
In more than one year, but not more than two years (12,299) (470,914)
In more than two years, but not more than three years (5,862) (8,021)
In more than three years, but not more than four years (116,408) (6,268)
In more than four years, but not more than five years (6,115) (125,225)
In more than five years (6,195) –
Total non-current financial liabilities (146,879) (610,428)
MARKET RISK
Market risk is the risk that changes in the market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group’s income. 
The Group’s exposure to market risk predominantly relates to interest and currency risk. 
INTEREST RATE RISK
The Group is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations mainly with regard to the interest expense on the debt carried by Choo Luxury 
Finance Limited. The Group’s bank borrowings incur variable interest rate charges linked to EURIBOR/LIBOR plus a margin. The Group’s 
policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within the constraints of its financial covenants and business plan.
The Group has historically held interest rate swaps in connection with the financing put in place at the time of the acquisition of the Group 
by JAB Luxury GmbH. The original swap agreements expired in 2014.
Sensitivity analysis of the effect of a change in interest rates of ±1% is included below. JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

23. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES CON TINUED
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK
The Group operates internationally and is, therefore, exposed to the foreign exchange risk which can negatively impact revenue, costs, 
margins and profit.
The Group transacts with its suppliers of finished goods, based in continental Europe, in euro. In addition to this, the Group is exposed to 
transaction risk on the translation and conversion of surplus US dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan balances, generated 
by its directly owned stores globally into euro and pounds sterling. The Group’s policy allows these exposures to be hedged for up to 
12 months forward in order to create sufficient certainty to price different collections and assure the business cash flows.
Hedging is performed through the use of foreign currency bank accounts and forward foreign exchange contracts and nil cost options. These 
contracts are put in place as part of the Group’s treasury management strategy. It enables merchandisers to be given targeted exchange 
rates for products, which are set aligned with the hedge rates for future collections, typically 9–12 months before cash flows crystallise. In 
addition, the Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts in order to hedge its exposure to foreign currency gains and losses arising on 
the Euro denominated portion of its external bank facilities.
The following table shows the extent to which the Group has monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date in currencies other 
than the local currency of operation. Monetary assets and liabilities refer to cash, deposits, borrowings and other amounts to be received 
or paid in cash. Amounts exclude intercompany balances which eliminate on consolidation.

PENSION LIABILITY RISK
The Group has no association with any defined benefit pension scheme and therefore carries no deferred, current or future liabilities in 
respect of such a scheme. 
CAPITAL RISK 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to optimise returns to its 
shareholders. The Board’s policy is to retain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor, and market confidence and to sustain 
future growth. The Directors regularly monitor the Group’s level of capital to ensure that this can be achieved.
Cash is used to fund the Group’s continued investment and growth of the global brand. It is also used to make routine outflows of capital 
expenditure, tax and dividends. The Group has access to a revolving cash flow facility of €91.6m (£71.6m) of which €14.9m (£11.7m) was 
utilised at 31 December 2014 (2013: €25.1m available (£20.1m) and €nil utilised (£nil)).
The Group is in compliance with the financial and other covenants within its committed bank credit facilities, and has been in compliance 
throughout the reported years. 
FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES
The carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair values. The majority of the financial assets are current. The 
majority of the current interest-bearing liabilities are at variable interest rate. The fair values of the non-current fixed rate interest-bearing 
liabilities are not materially different from their carrying amounts.
The fair value of non-current fixed rate interest-bearing liabilities is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest 
cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. 
The fair value of derivative instruments (currency forwards and options) is determined based on current and available market data. Pricing 
models commonly used in the market are used, taking into account relevant parameters such as forward rates, spot rates, discount rates, 
yield curves and volatility.

FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY
Financial instruments carried at fair value are categorised into the below levels, reflecting the significance of the inputs used in estimating 
the fair values:
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical instruments;
Level 2: Valuation techniques based on observable inputs, other than quoted prices included within level 1, that are observable either directly 
or indirectly from market data;
Level 3: Valuation techniques using significant unobservable inputs, this category includes all instruments where the valuation technique 
includes inputs not based on observable data and the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the instrument’s valuation.
The Group recognises derivative financial instruments at fair value. No other financial instruments are carried at fair value. The derivative 
financial instruments have been measured using a level 2 valuation method.

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the current year.
The Company was incorporated on 1 September 2014 and, therefore, no comparative information is presented. On 29 September 2014, 
the Company was registered as a public limited company. On 22 October 2014, its shares were listed on the London Stock Exchange.
BASIS OF PREPARATION
These financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable 
United Kingdom law and UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice. The principal accounting policies are set out below and have been 
applied consistently throughout the period.
The Company has control over the assets and liabilities of the Jimmy Choo PLC Employee Benefit Trust and accordingly the assets and 
liabilities of the Jimmy Choo PLC Employee Benefit Trust are recognised in the Company financial statements. No profit or loss account is 
presented for the Company as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The Company’s loss for the period was £1.5m, mainly 
related to exceptional costs incurred in respect of the IPO.
GOING CONCERN
At the balance sheet date, the Company had net assets. The Directors have reviewed the financial projection of the Company for a period of 
12 months from the date of this report, which shows that the Company will be able to generate sufficient cash flows in order the meet its 
liabilities as they fall due. Accordingly, the Directors are satisfied that the gong concern basis remains appropriate for the preparation of the 
financial statements.
RELATED PARTIES
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in Financial Reporting Standard 8 Related party disclosure and has not 
reported transactions with related parties.
SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries, it recognises, in its individual financial 
statements, an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share based payment charge recognised 
in its subsidiary’s financial statements. The corresponding credit is recognised directly in equity.
INVESTMENTS
Shares in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment where in the opinion of the Directors there has been 
a diminution in the value of the investment.
CASH FLOW
Under FRS 1 (revised 1996) the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement as a consolidated cash flow has 
been included in the Jimmy Choo PLC consolidated financial statements. 
2. FEES PAYABLE TO THE AUDITORS

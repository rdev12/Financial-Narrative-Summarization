Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2008
Chairman’s statement
“During 2008, Spirent introduced new, 
innovative products and lowered its 
cost base, resulting in a stronger 
financial position overall.”
Spirent’s financial performance improved in each 
quarter throughout 2008 as a result of the programmes 
put in place to increase manufacturing efficiency and to 
deliver new innovative products. In addition, the 
Company benefited from favourable exchange rates and 
a reduced number of issued shares. These factors, with 
annualised cost reductions of a further £8.2 million 
implemented in the first quarter of 2009 and the strong 
financial position of the Company, mean that Spirent is 
well placed to face the challenges of an uncertain market 
in the coming year.
Group revenue increased by £20.9 million, some 9 per 
cent over that for 2007 and the resulting gross profit 
increased by £18.8 million, with the gross profit margin 
increasing by 2.2 percentage points year-on-year. 
Adjusted earnings per share increased by 75 per cent to 
6.24 pence from 3.57 pence in 2007. This was after 
charging 0.30 pence for share-based payment and 
intangible amortisation, down from 0.38 pence in 2007. 
Cash generation was robust with free cash flow of 
£42.2 million in the year.
The Company paid its first dividend since the first half 
of 2002 and proposes a final dividend of 0.6 pence per 
share. This will result in a total dividend for the year of 
1.1 pence per share. It is the Board’s policy to maintain 
a high dividend cover and to pursue a sustainable 
distribution policy consistent with the development of 
earnings over time.
The cash generation of the Group allowed the funding of 
share repurchases through on-market repurchase and by 
way of a tender offer. £67.0 million was used to 
repurchase and cancel 125.8 million shares, some 16 
per cent of the shares in issue. The total cash returned 
to shareholders since 1 January 2007 is £133.8 million. 
To ensure flexibility, further authority will be sought at the 
Annual General Meeting for share repurchases of up to 
15 per cent of issued share capital, depending on market 
conditions and other factors.
Total order intake in January 2009 for the Group is level 
with that for the same period in the prior year in constant 
currency terms, with Performance Analysis being down 
by 10 per cent. In sterling total order intake in January 
2009 increased 27 per cent year-on-year. The 
restructuring of the business over the past two years has 
resulted in a material reduction in the break-even point 
for sales. At current exchange rates the Company will 
benefit both as an exporter of products and services 
from the UK and in the translation of the Group’s 
substantial dollar earnings. These factors, combined with 
the reduction in the number of shares in issue, will result 
in a greater resilience to the impact of any reduction in 
sales levels on the earnings per share and the cash 
generation of the Group.

Annual Report 2008
Chief Executive Officer’s review
“Our role as leaders in test and measurement 
is to enable our customers to develop and 
validate their most successful products 
and services, not just from a technological 
perspective but also to ensure the greatest 
return on their investment.”
As we look back over the past year, customers in most 
segments of the telecommunications industry spent more 
cautiously as 2008 progressed. This was particularly true 
as the end of the fourth quarter approached. Network 
equipment manufacturers remained focused on 
profitability and growth as competition intensified. 
Restructuring across the telecommunications industry had 
an impact not only on major wireline network equipment 
manufacturers, but also mobile equipment suppliers and 
service providers. These factors are contributing to an 
uncertain outlook in 2009, although it is expected that 
research and development investments are unlikely to be 
reduced to the same levels as other areas of spending. 
While network operator’s wireless and Ethernet based 
broadband services experienced strong year-on-year 
growth, revenues for traditional wireline services declined. 
Service providers and network equipment manufacturers 
continue to invest in areas of growth aimed at ensuring 
their future. Test requirements in these growth areas have 
become even more critical as service providers are driven 
to deploy highly complex converged networks delivering 
differentiated voice, video, data and next-generation 
mobile networks, that include an array of GPS and location 
based services. The need for testing today’s, as well as 
tomorrow’s, equipment and networks is driven by the 
requirement to achieve uncompromised performance and 
scalability while delivering superior Quality of Service and 
Experience across the telecommunication infrastructure. 
Our global reach and world-class sales and service 
organisations allow Spirent to partner closely with our 
customers, enabling research and development 
efficiencies through leadership in test methodologies and 
automation. Spirent’s products and services serve a wide 
range of technologies, from wired to wireless, from 
development laboratories to live networks, from chip 
manufacturers to enterprise customers. Our strong 
customer relationships and broad solutions portfolio 
brings value to our customers and represent a distinct 
strategic advantage for Spirent. 
The financial performance of the Company reflects 
operational improvements undertaken through outsourced 
manufacturing, design improvements and focus on driving 
efficiency throughout all aspects of our business. Our cash 
generation and profitability allows us to invest in the areas 
most critical to the success of our customers. At the same 
time, we have an agile business which is able to react 
quickly to developments in our markets. In addition, we 
have already taken action in the first quarter of 2009 to 
reduce Spirent’s cost base by an annualised £8.2 million.
Major customers view 2009 as a year of decreased 
activity, with few seeing upside before 2010. Service 
providers and network equipment manufacturers will 
prioritise their overall spending but will invest in key 
technology development areas to ensure their future 
success. This will drive demand for our test solutions 
despite the challenging economic environment. 
Our role as leaders in test and measurement is to enable 
our customers to develop and validate their most 
successful products and services, not just from a 
technological perspective but also to ensure the greatest 
return on their investment. Spirent’s financial strength and 
diversified solutions portfolio will be key to defending and 
expanding our market share as well as developing new 
opportunities. We remain realistic in facing the challenges 
resulting from the current worldwide economic downturn 
and we believe that Spirent enters this year well placed to 
face the market uncertainties ahead.

Annual Report 2008
Description of the business
Spirent delivers wireline and wireless solutions which 
address carrier Ethernet, data center, IMS, IPTV, location 
based, Long Term Evolution (“LTE”), satellite, Triple Play, 
WiMax, 3G wireless and other emerging technologies.
Spirent’s service assurance solutions allow service 
providers to diagnose, troubleshoot and determine how 
to resolve issues with networks and systems within the 
live network as well as address the transition to next-
generation service offerings. Service providers rely on 
Spirent to improve the quality of service at the network 
core, edge or even within the home. 
By leveraging the expertise gained by testing 
technologies and systems in the lab, Spirent enables 
service providers to deploy and maintain efficient, 
cost-effective and high-performing networks. Spirent’s 
equipment and software facilitate functional, 
conformance, interoperability and scalability testing 
across an entire wireline or wireless network. As a result, 
the operators of Ethernet, IMS, IPTV, Triple Play and 
wireless networks see reduced churn by providing a 
higher quality of experience which ultimately increases 
subscriber retention. Additionally, such testing helps 
service providers reduce operational costs through better 
identification of potential network problems and then 
using the right resources to address and correct those 
difficulties.
Systems is a leading supplier of sophisticated electronic 
control systems for electrically powered vehicles in the 
mobility and industrial markets. These include medical 
vehicles such as powered wheelchairs and mobility 
scooters as well as industrial vehicles such as floor 
cleaning vehicles, golf carts, fork-lift trucks and aerial 
access platforms. 
The Spirent Group is organised into two business areas: 
Communications and Systems. The Communications 
business comprises two divisions: Performance Analysis, 
providing test solutions for wireline and wireless 
technologies, and Service Assurance, providing network 
monitoring solutions for telecom service providers.
Spirent Communications provides tools and systems to 
enable the world to communicate faster, better, more 
frequently and more reliably. We develop new test 
solutions for the engineers working within the 
Communications industry to evaluate the performance of 
the latest technologies to be deployed across the 
worldwide telecommunications infrastructure. We also 
provide tools for service technicians and field test 
engineers to improve quality and make troubleshooting 
more efficient and effective.
Network equipment manufacturers and service providers 
face numerous challenges associated with taking 
products and solutions from the lab to the marketplace. 
Spirent’s Performance Analysis division allows equipment 
manufacturers, service providers, enterprise and 
governments to holistically test and benchmark the 
performance of voice, video and data systems and 
services in an effort to accelerate the development and 
deployment of related applications.
Spirent provides the ability to conduct functional, 
conformance, interoperability, scalability and quality of 
experience testing under real-world conditions inside and 
outside the lab. This capability, across the entire product 
lifecycle from concept inception to use in commercially-
available scenarios, helps shorten the product 
development cycle, improve the quality of new services, 
and reduce the cost and risk associated with such efforts.

Performance Analysis
Market conditions
The market saw growth in the first half year in all major 
areas, while the second half was characterised by 
cautious spending, highlighted by reduced demand in 
the fourth quarter of 2008. The current economic climate 
is forcing network equipment manufacturers and service 
providers to reprioritise the way they do business and 
has increased their focus on driving efficiency and 
operating even more cost-effectively. At the same time, 
they understand the need to invest in technologies 
and solutions that will allow them to compete in 
global markets. 
The demand for next-generation networks and services 
continues. The pervasive nature of the internet on 
multiple devices: computers, mobile equipment, TV and 
others, offering content rich applications, is driving 
growth in traffic, demand for higher speed access and 
network complexity. For example, Ethernet is evolving to 
meet the demand for increased business connectivity, 
the migration of storage networks and service provider 
core networks which are moving from 10 GbE to 40/100 
GbE in order to handle larger volumes of traffic. 
Investment in next-generation technologies will continue 
to drive the need for test solutions. Furthermore, the 
current economic climate has led network equipment 
suppliers to focus on increasing efficiency in the use of 
research and development resources which drives the 
demand for more automated solutions, professional 
services and expertise to assist in automation projects, 
all of which are important sources of revenue for Spirent.
Mobile communication now demands a higher level of 
performance testing, which is not satisfied by existing 
conformance test standards and equipment. Emulation 
of real-world wireless testing in the laboratory has 
become a fundamental requirement as field testing is 
expensive and inconsistent. Demand is also increasing 
for smartphone testing, where greater numbers of 
integrated applications on a mobile device require a 
higher degree of testing. Open mobile device operating 
systems are leading to the proliferation of applications to 
take advantage of higher speed data and location based 
services. Further growth will come from streaming and 
broadcast video, as content becomes more attractive to 
users. Spirent delivers industry leading wireless test 
solutions to meet the ever evolving needs of wireless 
applications and services. 
The market for test equipment in the positioning sector 
continues to grow as GPS services evolve and new 
investments are being made in satellite systems such as 
GLONASS and Galileo.
Revenue
Performance Analysis revenues grew by 5 per cent in 
constant currencies year-on-year. The rate of growth in 
the second half year slowed following the 9 per cent 
growth in the first half of 2008. 7
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2008
Business review
Demand in the second half was softer in all areas of the 
business. New broadband products, including Spirent 
TestCenter
TM
, grew over the levels for the first half year 
but order intake slowed towards the end of the year. 
Wireless test solutions saw a peak in demand during the 
first half year and similarly demand softened towards the 
end of the year. Legacy products continued to decrease 
year-on-year, but the level of revenue decline flattened in 
the second half year. 
Spirent continues to command technology leadership 
across its broadband solutions, winning head-to-head 
competitive opportunities based on technical comparisons 
against competitive products and solutions. Customers 
choose Spirent TestCenter for its performance, scalability, 
and ability to replicate real-world conditions across a 
wide array of testing environments. Combined these 
characteristics maximise return on investment and reduce 
total cost of ownership for our customers. 
Professional services are an increasingly important part 
of the business. The number of maintenance agreements 
and their renewals has increased, reflecting the value 
these services bring to our customers. Laboratory 
automation has stimulated demand for professional 
services. The industry’s first automation forum, the Test 
Automation Alliance, was launched by Spirent working 
with best-in-class providers of automation solutions. 
Revenues for Spirent’s Wireless UMTS test solutions 
increased during the year including significant wins with 
Tier 1 carriers in the US and network equipment 
manufacturers worldwide for both mobile device 
performance test systems and RF channel emulators. 
Revenues for CDMA EV-DO Rev A reached record levels 
and new customers adopted our solutions for LTE 
infrastructure testing in Europe and Asia. Wireless 
solutions now account for 36 per cent of Performance 
Analysis revenues (2007 32 per cent).
Market adoption of location based solutions continue to 
drive revenue for our positioning products as these 
services are integrated into a wide range of devices such 
as smartphones. The adoption of location based 
services has opened up a new market for our positioning 
test solutions which served 172 new customers in 2008.
The division’s revenues are broad based by customer 
type and geography, with a low level of customer 
concentration. No single customer accounts for more 
than 10 per cent of revenues and the top 20 customers 
account for 43 per cent of the total.
Profitability
Performance Analysis profits grew in constant currency 
for the year by 83 per cent over 2007 and the second 
half year grew by 24 per cent over the same period. 
Profitable growth in sales contributed to the improved 
returns, whilst improvement in design of our products 
and the supply chain increased gross profit margin by 1.9 
percentage points year-on-year. Indirect overheads were 
reduced in constant currency by £9.5 million, or some 
9 per cent.
Product development
Anticipating the needs of customers and bringing 
products to market at the right time is a key contributor 
to Spirent’s success, as we continue to command the 
number one or two position in most markets we serve. 
In 2008, Spirent launched multiple new solutions to 
support a variety of customer needs. New broadband 
application and security testing solutions were 
introduced along with 10 gigabit Ethernet application 
performance appliances. We delivered next-generation 
solutions to support integrated Layer 2–7 testing at line 
rate performance. For mobile packet core performance 
testing, we evolved our Landslide solutions to support 
next-generation wireless standards such as LTE and 
WiMax. Our Spirent TestCenter platform is now capable 
of handling the needs of the latest data centre 
technology such as Fibre Channel over Ethernet as well 
as evolving Metro Ethernet Standards. Our focus in 
2009, is to continue to enhance our Ethernet solutions 
portfolio meeting the requirement for testing higher 
speeds such as 10/40/100 GbE. From a software 
perspective, we will enhance our capabilities to offer 
more testing and technology coverage under our flagship 
product, Spirent TestCenter.
Spirent offers unique solutions that allow makers of 
wireless equipment as well as operators of wireless 
networks to be successful. In 2008, Spirent launched 
Over-The-Air test solutions for location based services 
testing devices through the antenna for both UMTS and 
CDMA technologies. Call reliability testing was a market 
first in the measurement of the reliability of a device to 
complete and maintain a call under various adverse 
conditions including handover from one cell to another. 
We continue our leadership in CDMA testing by 
increasing protocol test coverage and the release of an 
EV-DO Rev A protocol test solution. With the release of 
the Video User Experience test solution we have 
assumed a leadership position in measuring the quality 
of experience in viewing video on a handset. Complex 
Performance Analysis continued 8
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2008
Business review
Business group development and performance continued
for these solutions will reach levels to cover the decline 
in legacy solution spend until some time in 2010.
Professional services revenues for test automation and 
custom software remained an area of growth as service 
providers looked to increase the effectiveness of their 
existing service assurance solutions.
Profitability
While the Service Assurance business saw a decline 
in revenue in 2008, the business was able to improve 
profitability by 30 per cent in constant currency driven 
by increased efficiency and continued tight cost control 
measures across the business.
Product development
The division continues to focus on the development  
of service assurance and field test solutions for  
next-generation networks. In November 2008, we 
launched a new modular field test platform, Tech-X Flex, 
to the market for in-home Triple Play testing. We are in 
the process of adding additional modules in the first half 
of 2009 to extend test capabilities to “outside the home” 
and to address opportunities in the European market. We 
are in trial with several major service providers in North 
America and will look to begin shipping in quantity during 
the first half of 2009. In addition, we continue to 
enhance our next-generation diagnostic and performance 
management Ethernet solutions.

The Systems group comprises PG Drives Technology, 
a leading supplier of control systems for electrically 
powered medical and small industrial vehicles. Revenue 
continued to be affected by changes in US government 
healthcare funding for powered wheelchairs, creating a 
shift from premium systems to lower cost solutions. 
This was, however, offset by solid growth in our industrial 
systems. The US dollar exchange rate did not materially 
impact revenue, but profit was impacted by a loss on 
exchange of £0.4 million. The weaker exchange rate 
for sterling to US dollars will benefit earnings in 2009 
compared to 2008 by £1.0 million on hedge contracts 
antenna configurations required for LTE are tested using 
the advanced Multiple Input Multiple Output channels 
models on the SR5500 platform, released in 2008. 
2009 will see the need for LTE device performance test 
and the multimode combination of LTE and CDMA. We 
also expect further development in smartphones and 3G 
wireless deployments, particularly in China, combined 
with the need to evaluate mobile performance in real-
world conditions. We continue to deliver testing solutions 
that address all emerging wireless technologies.
Undoubtedly the investment priorities in 
telecommunications will be reset during 2009. As a 
result of the increased efficiency, low cost production 
and investment in innovation, our Performance Analysis 
division is better positioned than most in our industry to 
respond to the challenges ahead. The longer term 
prospects resulting from the convergence of wired and 
wireless technologies in a world of increased connectivity 
with greater functionality remain good for test and 
measurement products, solutions and services.
Service Assurance
Market conditions
Market conditions remained challenging throughout 2008 
for the Service Assurance division. However, there were 
signs that the adoption of next-generation network 
architectures has grown to a scale where service 
assurance solutions are required. Specifically, we saw 
increased demand for Metro Ethernet and Triple Play 
solutions for both centralised test and field test 
solutions. This included important wins in 2008 at 
several large service providers in North America.
Overall we see the service assurance market remaining 
sluggish during 2009 due to the economic climate and 
continued caution around capital spending. However, we 
believe that increased global competition and the 
transition to next-generation networks provides additional 
market opportunities for the Service Assurance division 
within cable multiple system operators, wireline and 
wireless service providers.
Revenue
Service Assurance revenues declined by 9 per cent in 
constant currency year-on-year as service providers 
continued to reduce spend on legacy and DSL solutions. 
We received further orders for our Triple Play monitoring 
solutions. While we have seen increased demand for 
next-generation solutions, we do not anticipate spending

in place at the year end. We continued to place more 
production into China to support our activities in the Asia 
Pacific Region and in order to gain product and logistical 
cost benefits.
During 2008 we introduced new products for scooters 
and wheelchairs to further strengthen our position in the 
medical mobility market. Good progress was made in 
opening new industrial market segments, such as 
fork-lift trucks. 
Non-segmental costs
Non-segmental costs before exceptional items reduced 
by £0.7 million to £3.2 million in 2008. These cost 
reductions were principally a result of the consolidation 
of reporting activities and other functions in the business 
units, enabling a reduction in staff levels.

The Group’s financial performance is reported in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).
All comments below refer to continuing activities only unless otherwise stated.
The Group is reporting an underlying change in revenue and adjusted operating profit given the effect the strength of the US dollar has had on operating 
results this year compared with the previous year. Underlying change is the change at constant currencies and eliminates the effects of fluctuating 
exchange rates on the translation of operating results.

A significant amount of Spirent’s revenues are 
denominated in US dollars and with sterling weakening 
against the US dollar particularly in the last quarter of 
2008, translation has had a positive effect increasing 
reported revenue by £16.0 million compared with 2007. 
Revenue
Reported revenue in sterling was up 9 per cent compared 
with 2007. The underlying change was an increase of  
2 per cent due to the improvement seen in

The geographic profile by market of reported revenues 
did not change significantly with revenue in sterling terms 
up in all markets.

 257.9  237.0 
 
The book to bill ratio was lower at 0.98 for the year 
compared with 1.05 for 2007. This reflects both the 
changing profile of the Spirent Group as technology 
continues to migrate from older platforms to new and a 
weakening of demand levels seen towards the end of the 
fourth quarter of the year. The Group continues to 
maintain a healthy order book.
Operating profit
Operating profit improved by 91 per cent to £48.7 million 
compared with an operating profit before exceptional 
items of £25.5 million in 2007, 11 percentage points of 
the improvement was due to exchange rates. Other 
factors include higher revenue, improved gross profit 
margin and reductions in overhead cost resulting from 
the actions commenced in 2007.
The resulting operating return on sales increased to  
18.9 per cent for 2008 compared to 10.8 per cent in 
2007. Return on sales was 20.2 per cent for the second 
half of 2008.
Currency impact
As previously mentioned there was a significant 
weakening of sterling in the latter part of the year against 
all the major currencies. Spirent is most exposed to the 
sterling to US dollar exchange rate and this rate has 
changed from $1.99:£1 at 31 December 2007 to 
$1.44:£1 at 31 December 2008. Although there was a 
marked change to the closing exchange rate, as this 
happened in the latter part of 2008 its effect on the 
average rate used to translate Spirent’s results was 
positive but less material; the average US dollar to 
sterling exchange rate was $1.85:£1 in 2008 compared 
with $2.00:£1 in 2007. 
Given that a significant amount of Spirent’s revenue 
arises in North America even this degree of change in 
the average exchange rate positively affected the 
translation of our revenue and profits, increasing 
reported revenue as noted above. The impact on 
operating profit was an increase of £2.6 million due 
to translation. 
Our UK based businesses are exposed to transactional 
currency risk, but had hedged most of the 2008 US 
dollar exposures by the end of 2007 at an average 
forward rate of $2.03:£1. For 2009 transaction 
exposures have been hedged in 2008 at a forward 
average rate of 1.76, this will result in a £3.0 million 
benefit in 2009 compared to the hedge rate in 2008. 
Foreign exchange will be a continuing theme in 2009, 
and if exchange rates remain at current levels this will 
have a significant positive effect on Spirent’s reported 
revenue and earnings due to translation period-on-period. 
At an average exchange rate of $1.45:£1 and based on 
2008 revenue and operating profit, revenue would 
increase by approximately £48 million and operating 
profit by £12 million compared to that reported.
Cost of sales and operating expenses
Gross profit margin increased by just over two 
percentage points to 64.6 per cent of revenue from 
62.4 per cent in 2007. Much of this increase reflects the 
further improvements achieved through the restructuring 
and outsourcing initiatives undertaken in the 
Communications businesses in 2007.
As the development of new innovative test products is 
critical to the success of Performance Analysis, product 
development continues to be a significant cost for the 
Group. Product development expense increased from 
£44.5 million in 2007 to £45.3 million in 2008, but was 
lower in US dollar terms and dropping to 17.6 per cent 
from 18.8 per cent of sales in 2007. 
This reduction reflects benefits achieved through 
increased efficiencies, reduction in facilities and lower 
development spending on older technology products.
Other operating expenses, excluding exceptional items 
reduced from £77.8 million in 2007 to £72.6 million in 
2008, being 32.8 per cent and 28.2 per cent of sales 
respectively. The annual reduction includes the lower 
expense for share-based payment of £1.5 million in 
2008 compared with £2.5 million in 2007 and the lower 
cost base achieved through restructuring.
Exceptional items
No exceptional operating items have been charged in 
2008. In 2007 £14.4 million was expensed for

restructuring costs, including severance costs, asset 
write-downs and provisions for vacant leasehold space.
In 2008 £0.8 million of exceptional finance income has 
been reported in relation to interest received on tax 
refunds for prior periods. An exceptional interest expense 
of £2.6 million has been charged for interest paid on the 
agreement of prior year tax positions with the relevant 
tax authorities.
There is an exceptional tax credit of £25.6 million which 
relates to the agreement of an overseas tax position.
Intangible amortisation
Operating expense for continuing businesses includes a 
charge of £0.7 million for the amortisation of intangibles 
in 2008, compared to £0.9 million in 2007. 
Share-based payment
The charge for share-based payment for 2008 was 
£1.5 million compared to £2.5 million for 2007. Minimal 
share-based incentives were awarded in 2008 and it is 
expected that this charge will fall further in 2009 to 
approximately £0.4 million.
Net finance income
Net finance income was £2.7 million compared with 
£6.7 million for 2007 excluding exceptional interest 
referred to above. This reflects the significant reduction 
in returns particularly in the last quarter of 2008, as 
central banks lowered base rates in response to the 
economic uncertainties. Surplus funds are held in short 
term bank deposits and earn market rates of interest, 
since these returns have reduced considerably this will 
result in substantially reduced interest income in 2009. 
Net finance income includes £0.1 million of income in 
respect of the expected return on pension plan assets 
less the interest charge on the unwinding of liabilities. 
This has reduced from £0.9 million in 2007, a result of 
reduced asset values compared with the prior year. For 
2009 the expected interest for the pension plan will be a 
cost in the region of £1.2 million, affected by the 
reduced returns on assets as well as lower asset values.
Profit before tax for continuing operations
Reported profit before tax for continuing operations was 
£49.6 million compared with £17.8 million for 2007.
Adjusted profit before tax is set out below:
£ million  2008 2007

Tax
In 2008 there was a net tax credit of £25.2 million 
(2007 £7.7 million credit). This includes the release of a 
£30.5 million provision resulting from the agreement of 
prior year tax positions with the relevant tax authorities. 
Of this £25.6 million has been classed as exceptional 
due to its significance and unusual nature. As discussed 
above, net interest of £1.8 million has been incurred as 
a result of these agreements. Excluding prior period 
adjustments the current year tax charge was £5.3 million 
giving an effective tax rate of 10.3 per cent.
In 2007 there was a prior year tax credit of £5.3 million 
and a tax credit on exceptional items of £3.9 million. The 
current year charge for 2007 was £1.5 million giving an 
effective tax rate for 2007 of 4.7 per cent including the 
recognition of deferred tax assets.
At 31 December 2008 a deferred tax asset of 
£12.2 million (2007 £10.5 million) has been recognised. 
Deferred tax assets on temporary differences of 
£29.1 million (2007 £56.2 million) arising principally in 
the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom have 
not been recognised. In addition, the Group has tax 
losses arising in the United Kingdom of £80.3 million 
(2007 £68.9 million in the United Kingdom and 
£28.6 million in the United States) that are available for 
offset against future taxable profits. 
In total, deferred tax assets amounting to a tax value 
of £34.0 million (2007 £50.1 million) have not been 
recognised on unutilised losses and temporary 
differences. Although the directors ultimately expect 
to realise these assets, there is currently insufficient 
evidence under IAS 12 “Income Taxes” to recognise them.
As the Group utilises the benefit of tax losses brought 
forward the future tax rate will increase progressively, 
this effect is expected to result in an increase in the 
effective rate for 2009 to about 15 per cent.

Discontinued operations
In 2007 discontinued operations relate to the loss 
making SwissQual business. The disposal was 
completed on 5 July 2007 for cash proceeds of 
$3.0 million (£1.5 million). A loss on disposal of 
£4.2 million was recorded. There were no discontinued 
operations in 2008.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share for the Group was 10.13 pence 
for 2008 compared with 2.05 pence for 2007. 
Adjusted basic earnings per share for continuing 
operations, being before exceptional items, net of any 
related tax and prior year tax, was 6.24 pence compared 
with 3.57 pence for 2007, an improvement of 75 per cent 
year-on-year. 
Weighted average Ordinary share capital was 
738.5 million shares compared with 859.8 million for 
2007, significantly reduced by the on-market share 
repurchase programme and tender offer made to 
shareholders in 2008. At the year end the shares in 
issue ranking for dividend were 664.0 million.
Financial risk management
The key objective of the Group Treasury department is to 
manage the financial risks of the business and to ensure 
that sufficient liquidity is available to the Group. All 
treasury activity operates within a formal control 
framework. The Board has approved treasury policies and 
guidelines and periodically reviews treasury activities. 
Additionally, it is the Group’s policy that speculative 
treasury transactions are expressly forbidden.
Spirent’s financial risk management objectives and 
policies and its exposure to risks are discussed in note 
27 of Notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Financing and cash flow
Cash and cash equivalents were £59.7 million at 
31 December 2008 compared with £79.0 million at 
31 December 2007, and this was after an outflow of 
£67.2 million for the share repurchase programme and 
tender offer in 2008. The Group continues to be debt 
free, although a £25 million three-year working capital 
facility, which is currently undrawn, was put in place in 
the second half year. The majority of the cash is held in 
the United Kingdom and the United States. Currency 
translation has increased cash and cash equivalents by 
£5.8 million.
Operating activities generated cash of £47.7 million in 
the year compared with £49.8 million in 2007. Free cash 
flow is set out below:
£ million  2008 2007
Cash flow from operations   53.4 43.8
Tax (paid)/received  (5.7) 6.0
Cash flow from operating activities  47.7 49.8
Net interest income  1.4 5.6
Net capital expenditure  (6.9) (5.2)
Free cash flow  42.2 50.2
  
In 2008 there was a net tax payment of £5.7 million 
compared with a net tax refund in 2007 of £6.0 million. 
In 2007 brought forward tax losses were available for 
set-off of taxable profits and tax refunds were due for 
prior years. In 2008 profitability has improved and the 
losses available for set-off have also reduced resulting in 
a return to tax payments at more normal levels. 
Net interest received is considerably lower at £1.4 million 
compared with £5.6 million in 2007 affected by the 
reduction in returns on bank deposits and includes 
£1.8 million of net interest due on the prior year  
tax settlements.
Net capital expenditure for the Group has increased to 
£6.9 million of cash outflow in 2008 (2007 £5.2 million). 
This was well below the depreciation charge of 
£8.8 million. With most manufacturing now outsourced, 
the Group’s capital investment requirements continue 
to be low.
Net proceeds of £0.6 million were received from the sale 
of SwissQual in 2007 and a tax payment of £6.8 million 
was made in respect of a prior year disposal. 
In 2008 the Group paid an interim dividend of 0.5 pence 
per share giving a net outflow of £3.7 million (2007 nil).
Pension fund
The accounting valuation of the UK defined benefit 
pension plans at the end of 2008 was based on the 
results of the triennial valuation of the plans at 1 April 
2006. The next valuation is due at 1 April 2009. 
Group financial performance continued 14
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2008
Business review
Financial review continued
The Group has adopted IFRIC 14 “The Limit on a Defined 
Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their 
Interaction” and this has required a restatement of the 
opening surplus to £6.1 million, having previously been 
restricted to £3.0 million at 31 December 2007 under 
IAS 19 “Employee Benefits”.
The surplus in the plans reduced from £6.1 million at 31 
December 2007 to £2.6 million at 31 December 2008. 
This reduction is due to falling equity markets and 
returns on other assets, compensated for by a change in 
the assumptions underlying the calculation of the 
liabilities, principally the rate of return on corporate 
bonds. The asset allocation strategy of the main plan 
has progressively been reduced from an equity weighting 
of 37.5 per cent at 1 January 2008 to 25 per cent at 31 
December 2008, and this has mitigated the impact of 
falling equity markets during 2008. 
The Group has also reported a liability of £0.6 million 
(2007 £0.7 million) in respect of the UK unfunded plan.
Essential contractual arrangements 
Spirent uses contract manufacturers for the manufacture 
of a substantial amount of its products. The principal 
contract manufacturer is Celestica Corporation with 
which an agreement is in place until September 2010. 
The Company considers that this arrangement is 
essential to its business.
Capital structure 
In 2008 £67.0 million (2007 £66.8 million) of cash 
was returned to shareholders via on-market share 
repurchases and a tender offer, this represents 
125.8 million Ordinary Shares (2007 103.4 million). 
As a result of the tender offer in November 2008 the 
Company repurchased 52.9 million shares at a strike 
price of 46 pence per Ordinary Share. Shares 
repurchased on-market amounted to 72.9 million and 
these were repurchased at an average price of 57 pence 
per share.
At 31 December 2008 there were no shares held in 
treasury, all shares repurchased have been cancelled 
and at 31 December 2008 there were 664.0 million 
Ordinary Shares in issue ranking for dividend. 
Dividend
Following a period of improved profitability and more 
stable cash generation the Board was pleased to 
announce at the interim stage a dividend of 0.5 pence 
per share. This was paid to shareholders in October 
2008 and amounted to £3.7 million. 
The Board are now recommending the payment of a  
final dividend for 2008 of 0.6 pence per Ordinary Share 
bringing the full year dividend to 1.1 pence per Ordinary 
Share and being covered 5.7 times by adjusted earnings. 
This is the first full year dividend payment since that for 
2001. Subject to approval by the shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting, the final dividend will be paid  
on 8 May 2009 to shareholders on the register at  
6 March 2009. Payment to ADR holders will be made  
on 18 May 2009.
Outlook
During 2008, Spirent introduced new, innovative 
products and lowered its cost base, resulting in a 
stronger financial position overall. These factors, with the 
benefit of current exchange rates and the substantially 
reduced number of shares in issue, will result in relative 
resilience in earnings and cash generation.
Spirent enters 2009 well placed to face the uncertainties 
of the market.
Group financial performance continued 15
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2008
Business review
Principal risks and uncertainties
The principal risks and uncertainties which the directors 
believe are currently faced by Spirent Communications 
plc are discussed below.
Global economic and market conditions 
Spirent operates globally with revenue generated in the 
United States, Europe and Asia. Demand for Spirent’s 
products is therefore dependent on the general economic 
and market conditions in all these regions. A significant 
deterioration in economic or market conditions, for 
example a recession in any one of these regions, could 
significantly reduce demand for Spirent’s products which 
could harm the business, operating results and financial 
condition of the Group.
Deteriorating economic and market conditions may also 
impact the financial position of the Group’s customers 
and suppliers and impact their ability to do business 
with Spirent.
The Group’s businesses closely monitor both market and 
geographic trends in order to take timely actions to 
minimise the effects of adverse economic and 
market conditions.
Technological change
The Spirent Group sells products and systems in several 
industries that are characterised by rapid technological 
changes, frequent product and service introductions and 
evolving industry standards. If the Communications 
business fails to extend its existing capabilities in the 
next-generation technology, the business, operating 
results and financial condition of the Communications 
group will suffer.
Spirent believes that the continued success of the 
Communications business is dependent on its ability to 
advance next-generation technologies and continues to 
make significant investment in product development and 
in 2008 £45.3 million, being 18 per cent of revenue, was 
invested. Spirent prioritises investment across its 
portfolio based on the expected return.
Customer concentration
Although no one customer accounts for more than 
10 per cent of revenue for the Spirent Group, in some 
businesses in particular in Service Assurance and 
Systems there are a limited number of customers, which 
makes relationships with these customers, as well as 
the success of those customers’ businesses, critical to 
their success. The loss of one or more of Spirent’s major 
customers could harm the business, operating results 
and financial condition of Spirent.
Spirent is continuing to diversify its customer base in 
Service Assurance and Systems. In addition Spirent 
works closely with all its customers to develop strong 
relationships with a significant focus on ensuring its 
products and services meet the needs of its customers 
and are of the highest quality.
Reliance on contract manufacturers
The fact that Spirent uses contract manufacturers for the 
manufacture of a substantial amount of its products 
could have an adverse impact on the supply of its 
products and on operating results. Financial problems of 
contract manufacturers on whom Spirent rely, or 
limitations in the manufacturing capacity at contract 
manufacturers, could either limit supply or increase 
costs. Also, a major contract manufacturer of the Group 
is located in Asia. Any disruption of its operations could 
have an adverse impact on Spirent.
Spirent works closely with its contract manufacturers and 
maintains a regular onsite presence. To minimise the 
effect on supply that could be caused by disruption at 
contract manufacturers there are contingency plans in 
place to transfer manufacturing to other locations.
Operational risks and systems
Operational risks are present in the Spirent Group’s 
businesses. These risks include, but are not limited to, 
the risk of failed internal and external processes and 
systems (including information technology systems), 
human error and external events. Such events could have 
an impact on the business, operating results and 
financial condition.
A significant portion of Spirent’s communications 
operations are located in California which has 
experienced natural disasters, including earthquakes and 
wildfires, in the past. A significant natural disaster, such 
as an earthquake or wildfire, could disrupt its ability to 
conduct business in the affected locations and could 
have a material adverse impact on business, operating 
results and financial condition.
An important component of Spirent’s corporate 
governance is its integrated risk management strategy 
and its regular self assessment of risks encompassing 
all business units. Part of this process is to ensure that 
the risks of disruption to the business are identified, 
monitored and controlled wherever possible as well as 
arranging appropriate insurance cover. 16
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2008
Business review
Principal risks and uncertainties continued
Competition
The Spirent Group faces competition in all of its 
businesses. To stay competitive these businesses will 
need to introduce successful new products and also may 
have to adjust prices of some products. The business, 
operating results and financial condition may suffer if 
Spirent does not compete effectively.
The Group invests in product development to develop 
new technologies and products to sustain and improve 
its competitive position. Spirent actively works with its 
customers to find innovative ways to meet their 
technological needs in order to remain a key provider to 
them. Spirent’s value proposition is based on its service, 
expertise and product breadth rather than just competing 
on price.
Financial markets and credit risk
The Spirent Group is exposed to credit risk in relation to 
its trade receivables and its short term bank deposits 
and other investments. 
Deteriorating economic conditions may impact the 
financial position of our customers and of those banks 
with whom Spirent transact investments. There has also 
been significant weakness during the year in the 
international financial markets which should it continue 
could pose risks to the financial position of our 
customers and may impact that of the banks with whom 
Spirent transact investments. 
Should Spirent be subject to the failure of a major 
customer or a bank with which it transacts investments 
the Spirent Group’s business, operating results and 
financial condition may suffer.
For trade receivables the appropriate credit checks are 
made on potential customers prior to sales commencing 
and balances due from customers are monitored and 
managed by local management. The concentration of 
credit risk is limited due to the large customer base. 
The Spirent Group invests cash as short term bank 
deposits and other similar investments. Investment 
is limited to a group of high quality banks. There are 
pre-approved limits set by the Board for each bank 
to avoid concentrations of credit risk. 
Credit risk is discussed in note 27 of Notes to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Retention and recruitment of key staff
Spirent’s success is dependent on attracting and 
retaining highly qualified and skilled employees. There  
is competition for personnel from other organisations 
and the loss of key employees, or the failure to attract 
and retain other highly skilled employees, may impair 
Spirent’s ability to run and expand its business 
effectively.
The Group aims to attract, retain and motivate the 
highest calibre of employees and encourages their 
contribution and development. Appropriate career paths 
and internal recognition programmes are developed for 
both technical and non-technical staff.
Intellectual property
While Spirent does not believe that any of its products 
infringe the valid intellectual property rights of third 
parties, it may be unaware of intellectual property rights 
of others that may cover some of its technology, 
products and services. As a result Spirent could suffer 
litigation expenses or could be prevented from selling 
certain products as a result of third-party infringement 
claims. Spirent has procedures in place regarding the 
development of new products that includes consideration 
of intellectual property rights and also consults internal 
and external legal counsel experienced in intellectual 
property matters.
The success of Spirent depends in part on proprietary 
technology. Should Spirent fail to maintain or enforce 
intellectual property rights, or if competitors design 
around its technology or develop competing technologies, 
its competitive position could suffer and its operating 
results may be harmed. Spirent prioritises investment 
across its portfolio based on the expected return.  
Spirent also has active IP protection programmes to 
obtain appropriate intellectual property protection in 
a cost effective manner.
Regulation and taxes
The businesses are subject to various significant 
international, federal, state and local regulations 
currently in effect and scheduled to become effective 
in the near future, including but not limited to 
environmental, health and safety and import/export 
regulations. These regulations are complex, change 
frequently, can vary from country to country, and have 
increased over time. Spirent may incur significant 
expense in order to comply with these regulations or  17
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2008
Business review
to remedy violations of them. Any failure by Spirent to 
comply with applicable government regulations could 
result in non-compliant portions of our operations being 
shut down, product recalls or impositions of civil and 
criminal penalties and, in some cases, prohibition from 
distributing our products or performing our services until 
the products and services are brought into compliance, 
which could significantly affect our operations.
The Group closely monitors regulations across its 
businesses to ensure that it complies with the relevant 
laws and regulations. Whilst Spirent does not believe that 
it is non-compliant with any laws or regulations, other 
than as disclosed in note 17 of Notes to the consolidated 
financial statements, any instances of non-compliance 
would be brought to the attention of the appropriate 
authorities as soon as possible. 
The Group’s tax charge is comprised of current and 
deferred tax charges. The calculation of these charges 
involves a certain amount of estimation and judgement. 
Spirent is subject to income taxes in a number of tax 
jurisdictions and there are many transactions for which 
the final tax determination is uncertain and which may 
take many years to resolve. Liabilities are recognised for 
anticipated tax audit issues determined on whether 
additional taxes are likely to be due using facts and 
circumstances known at the time the financial 
statements are prepared. The final outcome could differ 
significantly from the amounts initially recorded and 
affect the financial position and results of the Group.
Exchange rate
Currency exposures arise from trading transactions 
undertaken by the Group’s operations in foreign 
currencies and on the translation of the operating results 
and net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
Spirent conducts operations globally and accordingly the 
value of its revenue and expenses, assets and liabilities 
will be affected by fluctuations of the pound sterling, its 
reporting currency, against the currency in which these 
are denominated. The Group does not enter into 
instruments to hedge the translation exposure of the 
operating results or net assets of its overseas 
subsidiaries as these are considered accounting and not 
cash exposures. Such fluctuations in exchange could 
therefore have a material impact on the reported results. 
The principal currency to which Spirent is exposed is the 
US dollar.
Where trading transactions within Spirent’s operations 
are exposed to foreign currencies, and these do not 
naturally offset, forward foreign currency exchange 
contracts are put in place to hedge the transactions.
Critical accounting policies and judgements
The consolidated Group financial statements are 
prepared using a number of estimations and 
assumptions which are based on the directors’ best 
knowledge of the current facts and circumstances. 
Results may differ significantly from those estimates 
made under different assumptions and judgements. The 
directors have outlined those accounting policies which 
are considered most critical in note 2 of Notes to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Forward-looking statements
This document includes forward-looking statements 
concerning Spirent’s business, operations and financial 
performance and condition. Forward-looking statements 
are based on current expectations and projections about 
future events. These forward-looking statements are 
subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions about 
the Spirent Group. The Spirent Group undertake no 
obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking 
statements, whether as a result of new information, 
future events or otherwise. Given these considerations, 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on 
such forward-looking statements.

Corporate social responsibility statement
We recognise that our social, environmental and ethical 
conduct has an impact on our reputation. We therefore 
take our corporate social responsibilities (“CSR”) 
seriously and are committed to advancing our policies 
and systems across the Group to ensure we address and 
monitor all aspects of CSR that are relevant to our 
business. These include good ethical behaviour, concern 
for employee health and safety, care for the environment 
and community involvement.
We strive to maintain a productive and open dialogue 
with all parties who may have an interest in our activities 
including shareholders, customers, suppliers and 
employees. We have an established investor relations 
programme, work closely with our customers, monitor 
supplier performance and actively encourage feedback 
from our employees. We maintain our website as one of 
the main routes for providing information to interested 
parties and for contacting us.
The Board takes ultimate responsibility for CSR and is 
committed to developing and implementing appropriate 
policies while adhering to a fundamental commitment to 
create and sustain long term value for shareholders. As a 
Group driven largely by technological innovation, our main 
assets are the talents and skills of the people we 
employ. The Board does not believe that the activities of 
the Group present any significant environmental risks.
Ethics
Spirent expects that all of its business is conducted  
in compliance with high ethical standards of business 
practice. We apply these standards to all dealings  
with employees, customers, suppliers and other 
stakeholders.
The Group’s Ethics Policy, which has been approved by the 
Board, is available on our website at www.spirent.com. 
Our Ethics Policy has been developed to ensure that the 
Group’s business is conducted in adherence with high 
ethical and legal principles and sets standards of 
professionalism and integrity for all employees and 
operations worldwide. The Ethics Policy was reviewed 
and revised by the Board during 2008 and sent to every 
Spirent employee.
The following is a summary of the Ethics Policy:
all employees have the right and responsibility to  •
ensure that Spirent’s business is conducted with high 
ethical and legal principles;
our policy is to operate within applicable laws; •
discrimination or harassment of any kind will not   •
be tolerated;
as a matter of policy, we do not make political  •
donations;
no bribes shall be given or received; •
conflicts of interest must be avoided; •
we aim to be a responsible partner within our local  •
communities; and
employees are encouraged and supported to report,   •
in confidence, any suspected wrongdoings 
(“whistleblowing”).
Appropriate ethical behaviour is reviewed as part of the 
Group’s internal control process.
Employees
Spirent is its employees. So, the Group aims to find, 
keep and engage the highest calibre of employees and 
encourages their contribution and development.
An environment that fosters innovation and collaboration 
is critical to the Company’s success. Appropriate career 
paths and internal recognition programmes are 
developed for both technical and non-technical staff.
Employees are provided with numerous learning and 
development opportunities to fulfil their potential. For 
example, our US employees enjoy a tax free tuition 
reimbursement benefit for classes taken towards 
college-level degrees such as a master of business 
administration or master of science in electrical 
engineering. A wide variety of courses and training 
opportunities are also available to employees globally  
to enhance their skills. In our Beijing office, we had 33 
employees during the last fiscal year taking English 
language training through guided multimedia and 
supported self-study combined with face-to-face 
speaking activities. These development opportunities are 
structured to align with our organisational objectives and 
to help employees in furthering their career aspirations.
Spirent demonstrates that it values its employees 
through several reward and recognition programmes. 
One example is our President’s Club, which recognises 
our most exceptional sales employees on an annual 
basis in every geographic region. Another way we reward 
and recognise excellence is through our Spot Bonus 
Programme. Employees in any function or business unit 
are eligible for a spot bonus award for performing at a 
level above and beyond the call of duty, including 
contributions that produce results that will continually 
improve current operations, that delight our customers 
or that result in a significant reduction of expenses.  19
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2008
Business review
Similarly, the importance of two-way communication is 
recognised particularly as it relates to the business and 
its performance. The leadership team is responsible for 
providing forums for employees to understand the 
business objectives and to ask questions. A variety of 
tools are utilised to foster two-way communications, 
including management meetings, “all-hands” employee 
meetings, and the Company’s intranet.
Leadership and management development programmes 
are regularly reviewed and updated as the competition 
for talented employees increases and the leadership 
needs of our business grow. Formal performance reviews 
are conducted annually and are linked to the goals of 
the organisation.
The Group is committed to providing equality of 
opportunity to all existing and prospective employees 
without unlawful discrimination on the basis of religion, 
disability, gender, age, marital status, sexual orientation, 
race, ethnicity or any other protected status. We 
encourage diversity and opportunity, which is reinforced 
through the Group’s Ethics Policy.
Health and safety
The Chief Financial Officer is the director appointed by 
the Board to have responsibility for the health and safety 
performance of the Group. The Chief Financial Officer 
reports any major health and safety issues to the Audit 
Committee and the Board as necessary.
The health and safety risk profile of the Group again 
improved in 2008 as further Group manufacturing moved 
to an outsourcing model. The main risks of the Group 
are based around final test and assembly of products 
and working environment issues such as ergonomics and 
Repetitive Strain Injury. The Group continued to have 
very low accident rates in 2008 and no incidents 
required any hospitalisation. No major health and safety 
issues were reported to the Audit Committee and Board 
during the year.
The Group Health and Safety Policy places responsibility 
for the management of health and safety on local 
management, who are supported by local external 
advisers, where necessary. It is the Group’s intention 
that each business unit should have a senior individual 
designated as being responsible for ensuring the 
business unit conforms to local statutory health and 
safety regulations as well as the Group Policy.
All business units are responsible for providing 
employees with a written health and safety policy. An 
annual questionnaire on health and safety performance 
is completed by all our business units and any issues are 
addressed and resolved. Independent external reviews of 
the Company’s health and safety performance are 
conducted annually at selected business units. Regular 
designated health and safety awareness training 
programmes are also carried out.
Environmental
Good environmental practice and the impact that  
our operations have on the environment are of great 
importance to Spirent. The main aim of Spirent’s 
Environmental Policy is to comply with all applicable 
environmental legislation in all jurisdictions in which  
we operate and to adopt responsible environmental 
practices. The full text of our Environmental Policy  
is available on our website at www.spirent.com.
Business units are required to comply with the Group 
Policy and local statutory regulations and are  
encouraged to set their own environmental targets.  
An annual environmental questionnaire is completed  
by each business unit which highlights their 
environmental performance.
The vast majority of our products continue to be 
manufactured by outside contract manufacturers and  
we check the environmental policies of these suppliers 
through audits and surveys. Wherever possible our 
products are designed and manufactured to take  
account of the recycling and disposal of the product  
at the end of its lifecycle. Our businesses comply with  
both The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment 
Regulations and The Restriction of the Use of Certain 
Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic 
Equipment Regulations 2004.
The Group’s main environmental impact now largely 
involves the effects produced from offices housing 
employees. Where possible, business units monitor 
energy consumption, water consumption and waste 
production. All business units continue to take positive 
steps to reduce energy consumption, such as better 
space utilisation, more efficient running of equipment 
and machinery and sensor controlled equipment. 
Environmental waste management in the Group 
continues to improve with most business units operating 
waste minimisation schemes mainly focusing on 
increased recycling.

Business review
The vacant site reported on last year where historical 
activity had led to minor land and groundwater 
contamination is continuing to be monitored to confirm 
that remedial work carried out has been successful. We 
have also been contacted by authorities regarding 
another previously owned property which appears to also 
have historic land and groundwater contamination. It is 
our position that we do not have legal responsibility for 
the clean up costs on this site.
Community 
Spirent aims to build stronger and healthier global 
communities through education, charitable donations 
and support of non-profit agencies in the communities in 
which we operate. Working with established non-profit 
organisations maximises the impact of our community 
building initiatives. 
Education
The Group has established links with certain public-
private non-profit educational organisations to help 
students develop the skills needed to succeed in the 
global economy. Throughout 2008, we continued to 
support education by offering internships and work 
experience programmes. For example, in the UK, 
one of our employees is a “Science and Engineering 
Ambassador” for STEMNET, the Science Technology 
Engineering Mathematics Network (www.stemnet.org.uk).
Spirent also periodically provides work experience 
opportunities for local teenagers in our Paignton, UK 
office, where 15 year olds spend a week with our team, 
visiting each department that is of interest to them. Our 
Service Assurance division in Maryland partners with its 
local Junior Achievement chapter to bring the real-world 
to students through hands-on curriculum. 
Local community support of Non-Profit Agencies
We recognise the significance of our communities 
through our relationship with local non-profit agencies. 
Our employees help their communities by volunteering 
their time to various programmes and donating materials 
and equipment to local causes. 
The Group has formed lasting partnerships with several 
local non-profit organisations to provide essential 
resources and services to those in need. During the 
winter holiday season in 2008, our employees in the US 
participated in food drives for the Second Harvest Food 
Bank (www.secondharvestfood.org) and for the Santa 
Comes to Agoura and Beyond programme. Our California 
employees also collect toys during the holidays for 
underprivileged children as part of the annual California 
Highway Patrol’s holiday toy drive (“CHiPs for Kids”). 
Charitable Donation Policy
Our businesses are encouraged to support the particular 
needs of their population by contributing to local 
charities and participating in community initiatives. 
Support takes the form of employee time and skills, gifts 
in kind and cash donations. 
While our Charitable Donation Policy matches employee 
contributions on a regular basis, there are times when 
extraordinary events lead to extraordinary action. 
Following the devastating earthquake in China’s Sichuan 
province in May 2008, our employees in China donated 
time, money and gifts generously. Spirent also made a 
special contribution to the Red Cross China Relief Fund 
of £10,700.
In addition to the special contribution to the Red Cross, 
Spirent made charitable cash donations of £41,300 in 
2008 (2007 £40,000).
Spirent continues to support all of our employees and 
businesses in finding new ways of becoming involved to 
give back to their communities.

Report of the directors
The directors present their Annual Report to the 
shareholders together with the audited consolidated 
financial statements of the Group and the parent 
Company financial statements for the year to 31 
December 2008. The purpose of the Annual Report is to 
provide information to shareholders of the Company. The 
Annual Report contains certain forward-looking 
statements with respect to the operations, performance 
and financial condition of the Group. By their nature, 
these statements involve uncertainty since future events 
and circumstances can cause results to differ from those 
anticipated. Nothing in this Annual Report should be 
construed as a profit forecast. 
Business review
The Companies Act 2006 requires the directors to 
present a Business Review in this report. The information 
that fulfils this requirement can be found in the sections 
set out below and is incorporated by reference into  
this report:
Chairman’s statement on page 3; •
Chief Executive Officer’s review on page 4; •
Description of the business on page 5; •
Business group development and performance on  •
pages 6 to 9;
Financial review on pages 10 to 14; •
Principal risks and uncertainties on pages 15 to 17;  •
Corporate social responsibility statement on pages 18  •
to 20; and
Statement of directors’ responsibilities on   •
page 26.
This Business Review has been prepared to provide the 
Company’s shareholders with a fair review of the 
business of the Company and a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties facing it. 
This report, together with the sections of the Annual 
Report incorporated by reference as set out above, 
consist of a directors’ report that has been drawn up and 
presented in accordance with, and reliance upon, 
applicable English law. The liabilities of the directors in 
connection with that report shall be subject to the 
limitations and restrictions provided by such law.
Principal activities
The principal activities of the Group are set out on page 
5 of this Annual Report.
Results and dividends
The consolidated income statement is on page 43. Profit 
for the financial year attributable to equity shareholders 
amounted to £74.8 million.
A final dividend of 0.6 pence per Ordinary Share is 
recommended by the Board for the year to 31 December 
2008 (2007 nil) for which approval will be sought from 
shareholders at the Company’s 2009 Annual General 
Meeting (“2009 AGM”) on 7 May 2009, to be paid on  
8 May 2009 (ADR holders on 18 May 2009) to those 
shareholders whose names are on the Register of 
Members on 6 March 2009.
Together with the interim dividend of 0.5 pence per 
Ordinary Share (2007 nil) which was paid to shareholders 
on 15 October 2008, this amounts to a total dividend for 
2008 of 1.1 pence per Ordinary Share.
Share capital and control
The Company has a single class of share which is divided 
into Ordinary Shares of 3
1
/ 3 pence each. Each Ordinary 
Share carries one vote and all of the Ordinary Shares 
rank pari passu. There are no special control rights 
relating to the Ordinary Shares.
At the date of this report, 671.8 million Ordinary Shares 
of 3
1
/ 3 pence each had been issued and are fully paid  
up and are listed on the London Stock Exchange. The 
Company also operates a Level 1 American Depositary 
Receipt (“ADR”) programme with each ADR representing 
four Ordinary Shares. The ADRs trade on the US over-the-
counter market and The Bank of New York Mellon is the 
authorised depositary bank for the Company’s ADR 
programme. Further details on share capital are set out 
in note 29 to the consolidated financial statements and 
note 16 to the parent Company financial statements.
The rights (including those relating to voting), obligations 
and any restrictions on transfer relating to the Company’s 
Ordinary Shares, as well as the powers of the Company’s 
directors, are set out in the Company’s Articles of 
Association, a copy of which can be found on our website 
at www.spirent.com or can be obtained from Companies 
House or by writing to the Company Secretary. The 
Company’s Articles of Association may only be amended 
by a special resolution at a general meeting 
of shareholders.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
shareholders that may result in restrictions on the 
transfer of securities or on voting rights. 23
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2008
Governance
During the year to 31 December 2008, options and 
rights exercised pursuant to the Company’s share 
incentive plans resulted in the allotment of 5.2 million 
new Ordinary Shares. No new Ordinary Shares have been 
allotted under the share incentive plans between the end 
of the financial year and the date of this report.
The Company has established two employee benefit 
trusts in connection with the operation of the Company’s 
share incentive plans: the Spirent Employee Share 
Ownership Trust (“ESOT”) and the Spirent Sharesave 
Trust (“SST”). The trustees of both trusts have waived 
their right to receive dividends on any Ordinary Shares 
held by them except for a nominal amount of 0.01 pence, 
save for those Ordinary Shares held in the ESOT which 
are the beneficial property of an employee (for further 
details on the employee benefit trusts see “Investment 
in own Ordinary Shares” in note 16 to the parent 
Company financial statements on page 106).
Trustees of both trusts do not vote their Ordinary Shares, 
save for those Ordinary Shares held in the ESOT which are 
the beneficial property of an employee/shareholder which 
they will vote in accordance with the instructions received 
from the beneficial owner.
The Company does not have agreements with any 
director or employee that would provide compensation for 
loss of office or employment resulting from a takeover 
except that provisions of the Company’s share incentive 
plans may cause options and awards granted to 
employees under such plans to vest on a takeover, 
as follows:
 Change of 
 control  
Share incentive provisions  Effect on Performance

Incentive Plan Yes Pro-rated Still applies
Spirent Stock 
Incentive Plan No None N/A
The Company has entered into a £25 million Multicurrency 
Revolving Facilities Agreement dated 5 September 2008 
which provides that, in the event of a change of control of 
the Company, the lenders are entitled to call for the 
repayment or cancellation of the facilities. The facilities 
are undrawn at the date of this report.
Share capital and control continued
A Group company has a significant agreement with a 
contract manufacturer which contains a clause requiring 
the manufacturer’s consent to any proposed transaction 
which will or may result in a change of control of the 
Group company. The Company considers that the 
agreement is essential to its business and intends it to 
remain in place until at least September 2010.
The Company is not aware of any other significant 
agreements to which it is party that take effect, alter or 
terminate upon a change of control of the Company 
following a takeover. 
Return of capital
Since the Company commenced returning capital to 
shareholders in May 2006, a total of £175.7 million 
has been returned, representing 319.5 million 
Ordinary Shares.
The Company will seek renewal of the authority to 
repurchase up to 14.99 per cent of its own Ordinary 
Shares at the 2009 AGM to facilitate any further return 
of capital if it is concluded that it is in the best interests 
of shareholders.
On-market programme
The Company was authorised at the 2006 AGM to 
repurchase up to 14.99 per cent of its own issued 
Ordinary Shares, within certain limits and as permitted 
by the Company’s Articles of Association. This authority 
was renewed at the 2007 and 2008 AGMs and the  
2008 EGM (see tender offer below). During 2008 a  
total of 72.9 million Ordinary Shares, each with a nominal 
value of 3
1
/ 3 pence were repurchased for an aggregate 
consideration of £42.2 million and placed either in 
treasury and cancelled or cancelled immediately following 
the repurchase. This represents 9.2 per cent of the 
Company’s issued Ordinary Share capital at the 
beginning of 2008 (excluding treasury shares – see 
also note 29 to the consolidated financial statements 
and note 16 to the parent Company financial 
statements). The Company did not repurchase any 
further Ordinary Shares between 1 January 2009 and 
the date of this report.
Tender offer
On 15 September 2008, the Company announced the 
launch of a tender offer to repurchase up to £50 million 
of Ordinary Shares in the Company. A circular was sent  
to shareholders on 15 September 2008, containing  
the detailed terms of that tender offer. However, on   24

13 October 2008, the Company announced that as the 
Company’s Ordinary Shares were trading at a 22 per cent 
discount to the bottom of the price range set out in the 
tender offer, it no longer believed the tender offer to be 
in the best interests of the Company or the shareholders 
as a whole and withdrew the tender offer. 
On 13 October 2008, the Company announced that  
it would launch a new tender offer to repurchase up 
to £25 million of Ordinary Shares in the Company and 
a new price range was set for this tender offer. This 
offer was launched on 27 October 2008 and led to 
52.9 million Ordinary Shares (7.3 per cent of the

Election and re-election of directors
The Company’s Articles of Association contain provisions 
relating to the appointment and replacement of directors.
Pursuant to the Company’s Articles of Association, and 
the Combined Code on Corporate Governance, Ian 
Brindle and Alex Walker will retire at the 2009 AGM and,

Report of the directors continued
Return of capital continued
Board on 22 December 2006, Edward Bramson and 
Gerard Eastman stated that they would retire and offer 
themselves for re-election as directors on an annual 
basis and therefore, will retire at the 2009 AGM and, 
being eligible, offer themselves for re-election. Bill Burns 
is the only director subject to election or re-election who 
has a service contract with a Group company.
Directors’ interests
Edward Bramson and Gerard Eastman have a connected 
notifiable interest in the Company’s Ordinary Shares held 
by Sherborne Investors GP, LLC (see Substantial 
shareholdings above). This connected notifiable interest 
is also deemed for statutory purposes, to be an interest 
of these directors as they are members of Sherborne 
Investors GP, LLC, which is the general partner of 
Sherborne Investors, LP. Sherborne Investors, LP is the 
managing member of each of the following funds, which 
are the beneficial owners of the Company’s Ordinary 
Shares: Sherborne Strategic Fund A, LLC; Sherborne 
Strategic Fund B, LLC; Hayden Investor Partners, LLC and 
Hayden Investor Partners II, LLC. The directors’ interests 
(including any connected persons) in the issued Ordinary 
Share capital of the Company are set out in the Report 
on directors’ remuneration.
Directors’ indemnity arrangements
Save as disclosed, at no time during the year did any 
director hold a material interest in any contract of 
significance with the Company or any of its subsidiary 
undertakings other than a third party indemnity provision 
between each director and the Company and service 
contracts between executive directors and the Company. 
The Company has purchased and maintained throughout 
the year directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in 
respect of itself and its directors.
In addition to the indemnity provision contained in the 
Company’s Articles of Association, the Company has 
provided a deed of indemnity for the benefit of the 
directors of the Company in respect of costs of defending 
claims against them and third party liabilities. These 
provisions are currently in force.
Corporate social responsibility
The Group’s Corporate social responsibility statement 
appears on pages 18 to 20. This statement gives details 
of the Group’s policies on ethics, the environment, health 
and safety, charitable donations and involvement in 
the community.  25
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2008
Governance
Charitable donations of £52,000 were made in the year 
(2007 £40,000). This amount excludes operating units’ 
support and participation in local community activities. 
No political donations were made in the year (2007 nil).
The Group employs approximately 1,500 people  
(2007 1,550) around the world and is proud of its history 
of being regarded as a responsible and respected 
employer. The Corporate social responsibility statement 
gives details of the Group’s policies on employment, 
training and development.
Research and development
Product development and innovation are considered 
key strategies to maintain and improve the Group’s 
competitive position and therefore continue to receive 
high priority. This commitment is highlighted by the 
£45.3 million research and development spend during 
the year for continuing business, equivalent to 18 per 
cent of revenue (2007 £44.5 million and 19 per cent). 
The Group will continue to commit resources as 
appropriate to research and development.
Policy on payment of suppliers
Group operating companies are responsible for agreeing 
the terms and conditions under which business 
transactions with their suppliers are conducted and it is 
Group policy to comply with those terms and to make 
suppliers aware of them.
At 31 December 2008, the Company had an average of 
51 days purchases outstanding in trade creditors 
(2007 43 days).
Corporate governance
The Directors’ statement on corporate governance is set 
out on pages 27 to 31. The Statement of directors’ 
responsibilities in respect of the financial statements 
appears on page 26.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position are set out in the Business review on pages 4 to 
20. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, 
liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in 
the Financial review on pages 10 to 14. In addition, note 
27 to the consolidated financial statements includes the 
Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing 
its capital; its financial risk management objectives; 
details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; 
and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. 
Corporate social responsibility continued
The Group has considerable financial resources together 
with long term contracts with a number of customers and 
suppliers across different geographic areas and 
industries. As a consequence, the directors believe  
that the Group is well placed to manage its business 
risks successfully despite the current uncertain 
economic outlook. 
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group and the Company have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue  
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the  
Annual Report.
Disclosure of information to auditors
Each of the directors of the Company at the date of this 
report confirms that:
so far as the director is aware, there is no information  •
needed by the Company’s auditors in connection with 
preparing their report of which the Company’s auditors 
are unaware; and
he has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken  •
as a director in order to make himself aware of any 
information needed by the Company’s auditors in 
connection with preparing their report and to establish 
that the Company’s auditors are aware of that 
information.
Auditors
Resolutions to re-appoint Ernst & Young LLP as auditors 
and to authorise the directors to determine their 
remuneration will be proposed at the 2009 AGM.
Annual General Meeting
The 2009 AGM will be held at 10.30am on Thursday  
7 May 2009 at the offices of the Company’s PR advisers,

Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the annual report 
and the financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the audited consolidated financial statements 
of the Group and parent Company financial statements, 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare such 
financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the audited consolidated 
financial statements of the Group in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as 
adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and have elected 
to prepare the parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles and applicable law.
The audited consolidated financial statements of the 
Group are required by law and IFRS as adopted by the EU 
to present fairly the financial position and performance of 
the Group; the Companies Act 1985 provides, in relation 
to such financial statements, that references in the 
relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a 
true and fair view, are references to their achieving a  
fair presentation.
The parent Company financial statements are required by 
law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the parent Company. 
In preparing each of the audited consolidated financial 
statements of the Group and parent Company financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply  •
them consistently;
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable  •
and prudent;
state for the audited consolidated financial statements  •
of the Group whether they have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU;
state for the parent Company financial statements  •
whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have 
been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the parent Company 
financial statements; and
prepare the financial statements on a going concern  •
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume the Group 
and the parent Company will continue in operational 
business for the foreseeable future.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the 
above requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper 
accounting records that disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group 
and the parent Company and enable them to ensure that 
its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
1985 and, for the Group, Article 4 of the International 
Accounting Standards Regulation. They have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and 
to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors 
are also responsible for preparing a directors’ report, 
a directors’ remuneration report and a statement on 
corporate governance that comply with the law and 
those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the  
UK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in  
other jurisdictions.
This Annual Report complies with the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules (“DTR”) of the Financial Services 
Authority in respect of the requirement to produce an 
annual financial report.
Each of the directors, the names of whom are set out 
on page 21 of this Annual Report, confirms that, to the 
best of his knowledge:
the audited consolidated financial statements of the  •
Group and parent Company financial statements, 
prepared in accordance with the applicable set of 
accounting standards, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and the 
profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
this Annual Report includes a fair review of the  •
development and performance of the business and 
the position of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.

Governance
Directors’ statement on corporate governance
Compliance
This statement describes how the principles and 
provisions as set out in the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council in 
June 2006 (the “Code”) have been applied within the 
Group during 2008.
The Board
As at 31 December 2008, the Board comprised a 
chairman, four independent non-executive directors,  
one non-executive director not classified as independent 
for the purposes of the Code when determining the 
composition of the Board or its Committees, and two 
executive directors, details of whom are provided on 
page 21. The Board operates within a framework of 
controls including a formal schedule of matters 
specifically reserved for its decision. At an Extraordinary 
General Meeting held on 22 December 2006 (“2006 
EGM”) shareholders elected Edward Bramson as a 
director of the Company, following which the Board 
elected him as Chairman. Mr Bramson assumed 
responsibility for the management of the Group by 
becoming Executive Chairman on 7 March 2007. At that 
point in time, as there was no longer a separation of the 
chairman and chief executive roles, Code Provision A.2.1. 
was breached. Although Mr Bramson performed a critical 
role during the strategic review and reorganisation of the 
Group, the Board considered that, given the balance of 
non-executive directors, no single individual dominated 
its decision making. However, on 6 November 2008 Bill 
Burns was appointed as Chief Executive Officer resulting 
in a separation of the chairman and chief executive roles 
and renewed compliance with this Code provision.
The Board discharges its responsibilities by providing 
leadership of the Company within a framework of prudent 
and effective controls, which enables risk to be 
assessed and managed. It sets the Company’s strategic 
aims, ensures that the necessary financial and human 
resources are in place for the Company to meet its 
objectives, and reviews management performance. It 
also defines the Company’s values and standards and 
ensures that its obligations to its shareholders are 
understood and met.
The independence of each director is reviewed at least 
annually. The Board determined that, within the terms of 
the Code, Ian Brindle, Duncan Lewis, Tom Maxwell and 
Alex Walker are all independent non-executive directors. 
As Edward Bramson and Gerard Eastman have a 
connected material notifiable interest in the issued 
Ordinary Share capital of the Company (see the Report of 
the directors on pages 22 to 25), the Board has 
concluded that they should not be considered 
independent of the Company. Details of other 
professional commitments of the Chairman and non-
executive directors are provided in their biographies on 
page 21.
The Company adopted new Articles of Association  
which were approved by shareholders at the Company’s 
2008 Annual General Meeting (“2008 AGM”) with effect 
from 1 October 2008. The new Articles of Association 
permit the Board to consider and, if it sees fit, to 
authorise situations where a director has an interest  
that conflicts, or may possibly conflict, with the interests 
of the Company (“situational conflicts”). The Board has  
a formal system in place for directors to declare 
situational conflicts and for these to be considered for 
authorisation by those directors who have no interest in 
the matter being considered. In deciding whether to 
authorise a situational conflict, these non-conflicted 
directors are required to act in the way they would 
consider would be most likely to promote the success  
of the Company and they may impose limits or conditions 
when giving authorisation, or subsequently, if they think 
this is appropriate.
Alex Walker currently serves as the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director. The Senior Independent Non-
Executive Director is available to meet shareholders 
upon request if they have concerns which contact 
through the normal channels (the Chairman or an 
executive director) has failed to resolve, or for which such 
contact would be inappropriate.
It is Company policy to hold at least four Board meetings 
a year. There were seven Board meetings during 2008. 
The agenda is settled by the Chairman in advance of the 
meeting and Board papers are circulated to Board 
members several days ahead of any meeting. Minutes of 
previous meetings are circulated to all Board members 
and approved at the next Board meeting.
Full attendance of the Board is expected at meetings 
and in 2008 all directors attended all seven meetings 
except Duncan Lewis, who missed two meetings due to 
unavoidable diary conflicts. Where the director was  
absent, full documentation for the meeting was issued 
and briefings were provided as appropriate. Where a 
director was absent it was ensured that any comments  
on the documentation or subject matter to be  
considered were passed to the Board, as appropriate,  
for consideration. 28
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2008
Governance
Certain of the matters specifically reserved for the 
Board’s decision have been delegated to three 
Committees with clearly defined terms of reference 
which, together with the composition of each Committee, 
are reviewed annually. 
The terms of reference for the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination Committees can be found on the Company’s 
website at www.spirent.com.
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that the 
directors receive accurate, timely and clear information. 
They receive regular updates on business performance 
and receive presentations from the executive directors 
and other senior managers at Board meetings. Directors 
are encouraged to update their skills continually and their 
knowledge of the Company required to fulfill their role 
both on the Board and on Board Committees. Under the 
direction of the Chairman, the Company Secretary 
ensures good and timely information flows within the 
Board and its Committees and makes sure that Board 
procedures are complied with. The Company Secretary 
also updates and advises the Board on all regulatory and 
governance matters.
There is a policy whereby the non-executive directors 
and the Board Committees may take independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense in order to 
fulfill their duties. All directors also have access to the 
advice and services of the Company Secretary, whose 
removal may be effected only with the approval of  
the Board.
Board appointments and induction
The Board has in place a procedure for the appointment 
of new directors to the Board which is in compliance with 
the Code and this procedure was applied in relation to 
the appointment of Bill Burns during 2008.
The Company’s Articles of Association require that all 
directors seek election by shareholders at the first 
annual general meeting following their appointment and 
as a result, Bill Burns will offer himself for election at the 
2009 Annual General Meeting (“2009 AGM”). They also 
require that all directors seek re-election at least every 
three years and therefore, Ian Brindle and Alex Walker 
will offer themselves for re-election at the 2009 AGM. 
Notwithstanding the requirements of the Company’s 
Articles of Association, Edward Bramson and Gerard 
Eastman have agreed to offer themselves for re-election 
at each annual general meeting whilst they serve on the 
Directors’ statement on corporate governance continued
Board and will, therefore, also offer themselves for 
re-election at the 2009 AGM.
On appointment to the Board and its Committees all 
directors receive an induction tailored to their individual 
requirements. New directors are briefed on their legal 
and other duties and obligations as directors of a UK 
listed company. Visits to different facilities and meetings 
with senior management are organised, as appropriate, 
to assist the new director in developing an understanding 
of how the Group operates and the key issues that  
it faces.
Performance evaluation
Performance evaluation of the Board and its Committees 
was carried out during the year by directors completing 
questionnaires and the results being collated and 
analysed by the Company Secretary, who prepared a 
report for Board discussion. The Board discussion 
concluded that the Board and Committees operated well 
and were effective.
The Chairman communicates regularly with the non-
executive directors and this contact provides an 
opportunity to assess performance and to raise any 
questions regarding the performance of the executive 
directors or in respect of any other matters. The 
Chairman concluded that during the year the quality and 
commitment of the non-executive directors was high. The 
Chairman also confirms that all those non-executive 
directors seeking re-election at the 2009 AGM continue 
to contribute effectively and to demonstrate commitment 
to their roles, including having time to attend all Board 
and appropriate Committee meetings and to carry out 
other appropriate duties.
The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director met with 
the independent non-executive directors on 16 December 
2008, in the absence of the Chairman, to assess the 
Chairman’s effectiveness. Notwithstanding Mr Bramson’s 
role as chairman and chief executive officer of Nautilus, 
Inc the independent non-executive directors were of the 
opinion that Mr Bramson gave sufficient time to his role 
as Chairman of the Company and was effective in that 
role during the year.

Board Committees continued
Committee is compliant with the Code. The Code 
requires that the Audit Committee includes at least one 
member who has recent, significant and relevant financial 
experience and the Board believes that both Ian Brindle 
and Tom Maxwell provide such experience. 
During 2008, the Audit Committee held three meetings 
at which there was full attendance by Committee 
members. At all meetings the Company’s external 
auditors, the Chief Financial Officer, the Group Vice 
President-Finance, the Head of Financial Reporting and 
the Company Secretary were in attendance. The 
Chairman and the other directors may also attend the 
meetings. The Committee also meets with the external 
auditors without management present. The minutes of all 
Committee meetings are available to all directors.
The Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its 
responsibilities by reviewing financial statements and 
post audit findings before their presentation to the 
Board, focusing in particular on accounting policies, 
compliance, management judgement and estimates. 
It also monitors the Group’s internal control and risk 
management regime and financial reporting. Any 
significant findings or identified weaknesses are closely 
examined so that appropriate action can be taken, 
monitored and reported to the Board. The Audit 
Committee also advises the Board on the appointment 
of external auditors.
There is a detailed agenda for each Audit Committee 
meeting. Specific issues dealt with during the year are 
set out below.
In February 2008 the Committee considered the external 
auditors’ performance and independence and their 
re-appointment, reviewed the annual financial 
statements, key accounting policies, areas of judgement, 
quality of earnings, the external auditors’ report on the 
year end audit and management’s responses to the 
issues raised. The Committee also reviewed corporate 
governance within the Group, in particular compliance 
with Turnbull and the annual internal control audit plan.
In August 2008 the Committee reviewed the Half-year 
Report, key accounting policies, areas of judgement, 
quality of earnings, the external auditors’ report on the 
half-year audit and management’s responses to the 
issues raised. The Committee also reviewed internal 
controls throughout the Group, with particular emphasis 
on visits by the financial management team to the 
business units.
In November 2008 the Committee reviewed the external 
auditors’ report on their strategy and scope for the audit 
of the annual financial statements and proposed fees. 
The Committee also reviewed the corporate risk register 
and an amended, updated Ethics Policy which it 
recommended to the Board should be adopted 
throughout the Group.
At each meeting the Group Vice President-Finance also 
briefed the Committee on progress made against the 
annual internal control audit plan and any significant 
findings. Regular reports to the Committee also covered 
issues in the areas of tax, litigation, treasury and health 
and safety.
The Audit Committee has adopted a policy in relation to 
the provision of non-audit services performed by the 
external auditor to ensure that the provision of such 
services does not impair the external auditors’ 
independence or objectivity. This policy is reviewed on an 
annual basis. A report is presented to the Committee on 
a regular basis detailing all non-audit services performed 
by the external auditors, including cost, when the 
services were provided and who approved the instruction. 
This policy identifies those services which the external 
auditors are permitted to provide and those which they 
are precluded from providing. Precluded services include, 
but are not limited to, bookkeeping or other services 
relating to the accounting records or financial 
statements, financial information systems design and 
implementation, management functions, human 
resources, actuarial services and information technology 
consulting. If the Company wishes to engage the external 
auditors to provide any other services which are not 
contained in the policy and which are not precluded,  
the Company must obtain pre-approval for such  
services from the Audit Committee through the 
Committee’s Chairman.
As part of this policy, the Committee also pre-approves 
annual financial limits for permitted audit services, tax 
services and any other services, which the Company may 
pay to Ernst & Young globally for services performed 
during the year. These financial limits may not be 
exceeded without approval by the Committee. Committee 
approval of permitted services is not required during the 
year provided the aggregate amounts paid by the 
Company do not exceed the pre-approved financial limits.  30

Governance
The total fees paid to Ernst & Young LLP during the 
year to 31 December 2008 were £0.5 million (2007 
£0.6 million) of which none (2007 £0.1 million) related to 
non-audit work. Further disclosure of fees paid to the 
auditors during the year can be found in note 5 to the 
audited consolidated financial statements of the Group.
Remuneration Committee
Chairman, Alex Walker
The Remuneration Committee comprises Ian Brindle, 
Duncan Lewis and Alex Walker, all of whom are 
independent non-executive directors and the composition 
of the Committee is compliant with the Code.
Further details about the Remuneration Committee are 
included in the Report on directors’ remuneration on 
pages 32 to 41.
Nomination Committee
Chairman, Edward Bramson
The Nomination Committee comprises the Chairman and 
all non-executive directors and meets at least once each 
year. During 2008 the Nomination Committee held two 
meetings at which there was full attendance by 
Committee members except for Duncan Lewis, who was 
unable to attend one meeting. The Nomination 
Committee is responsible for reviewing the composition 
and structure of the Board and for identifying and 
recommending candidates for executive and non-
executive positions, based on the required role and 
capabilities which have been specified for the 
appointment. Executive search consultants are used by 
the Nomination Committee to assist this process as 
appropriate. As the majority of members are independent 
non-executive directors, the composition of the 
Committee is compliant with the terms of the Code.
Relations with shareholders
Communication with all shareholders is given a high 
priority and a number of methods are used to promote 
greater understanding and dialogue with investment 
audiences. Dialogue with institutional investors is 
conducted on a regular basis by the Chairman, the Chief 
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The 
Company’s largest shareholder, Sherborne Investors GP, 
LLC has been represented on the Board by Edward 
Bramson and Gerard Eastman since December 2006.
The Company has an established cycle of communication 
based on its financial reporting calendar. This includes 
the Preliminary Results in February, Annual Report in 
March, Annual General Meeting and Interim Management 
Directors’ statement on corporate governance continued
Board Committees continued
Statement in May, Half-year Report in August and the 
Interim Management Statement in November.
The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer ensure that the views expressed at meetings with 
institutional shareholders are communicated effectively 
to the Board as a whole so that any issues or concerns 
are fully understood.
The Company promotes the use of electronic 
communication. All stock exchange announcements and 
presentations to shareholders are made available on our 
website, together with webcasts of our annual and 
half-year financial results. Our website also contains 
up to date corporate governance information including 
terms of reference for the three Board Committees, the 
terms and conditions of appointment of non-executive 
directors, the Company’s Ethics Policy and Articles 
of Association.
Electronic communications
At its 2008 AGM the Company passed a resolution 
allowing it to communicate with shareholders by means 
of the Company’s website and an invitation to sign up 
for this method of communication will be sent to 
shareholders with the 2009 AGM documentation. 
Electronic communications provide significant benefits 
for shareholders and the Company in terms of timeliness 
of information, reduced environmental impact and cost 
and the Board encourages investors to participate in  
the programme.
Pensions governance
The Group’s principal pension and retirement schemes 
exist in the UK and the US. Scheme funds are held 
separately from those of the Group and are administered 
by trustees (which include employees and independent 
bodies). The schemes do not lend money or lease any 
assets to the Group.
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s 
system of internal control. The Board, assisted by the 
Audit Committee, has reviewed the effectiveness of this 
system and this review did not reveal any significant 
issues or weaknesses. The Board confirms that this 
process was in place throughout the year under review 
and up to the date of approval of these financial 
statements. The primary aim is to operate a system 
which is appropriate to the business and which can, over 
time, increase shareholder value whilst safeguarding the 
Group’s assets. The system is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve  31
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2008
Governance
business objectives and can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
Process
Day to day responsibility for effective internal control 
and risk monitoring rests with senior management at 
business unit level.
The Board and the Audit Committee continue to agree 
that currently there is no need for a dedicated internal 
control department. Responsibility for internal control 
rests with the Group Vice President-Finance and North 
America Vice President-Finance. Both of these senior 
finance managers are independent of any business unit 
and play a key role in providing an objective view and 
continuing assessment of the effectiveness of the 
internal control systems throughout the Group. The 
Group consists of a limited number of entities which can 
comfortably be covered by the two senior finance 
managers. As stated above, the Group Vice President- 
Finance attends all Audit Committee meetings to give an 
update on any internal control issues arising and any 
outstanding remedial actions.
The Group’s system of risk management comprises 
an integrated risk management strategy of regular 
self-assessment of all business units. Significant risks 
are regularly reviewed by the Audit Committee and by 
the Board.
In addition to this process, the following key elements 
are critical to the overall internal control environment:
an organisational structure with clear operating  •
procedures, defined lines of responsibility and 
delegated levels of authority;
an ethics policy (which has been approved by the  •
Board), which sets standards of professionalism and 
integrity for all employees and operations. The Ethics 
Policy also includes “whistleblowing” procedures 
whereby employees may report, in confidence, 
suspected wrongdoings;
a comprehensive strategic planning, financial control  •
and budgeting system which is properly documented 
and regularly reviewed; and
a disciplined acquisitions and divestments   •

Report on directors’ remuneration
1. Compliance
This Report on directors’ remuneration has been 
prepared on behalf of the Board by the Remuneration 
Committee (the “Committee”). The Committee has 
adopted the principles of good governance relating to 
directors’ remuneration as set out in the 2006 Combined 
Code (the “Code”). The Report complies with the 
Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002) and the Listing 
Rules of the UK Listing Authority. Shareholders will be 
asked to approve the Report at the Annual General 
Meeting to be held on 7 May 2009 (“2009 AGM”).
2. Remuneration Committee
There were no changes to the composition of the 
Committee during the year. The members of the 
Committee were Alex Walker (Chairman), Ian Brindle 
and Duncan Lewis. The composition of the Committee 
is compliant with the Code in terms of independent 
non-executive directors. The Committee met four times 
during the year. Full attendance of the Commitee is 
expected at meetings and all members attended all four 
meetings except Duncan Lewis, who missed one meeting 
due to an unavoidable diary conflict. The Company 
Secretary is Secretary to the Committee.
The Committee is responsible for determining, on behalf 
of the Board, all elements of the remuneration of the 
chairman, executive directors and senior managers, 
reviewing remuneration policy and overseeing the 
operation of the Company’s share incentive plans. The 
Committee’s terms of reference can be found on the 
Company’s website at www.spirent.com.
3. Remuneration policy
The remuneration policy set by the Committee aims to 
encourage a performance-based culture which reinforces 
behaviour which will lead to the continued long term 
development of the business, attract and retain high 
calibre executive directors and senior managers and 
align their interests with shareholders. The aims of the 
policy are achieved by ensuring their remuneration is 
competitive when compared with companies of similar 
size, type and complexity within the countries in which 
they are based. It is structured so that a substantial 
proportion of their total remuneration package is 
weighted towards performance-based pay.
4. Advisers to the Committee
When the Committee considers it appropriate, it takes 
advice on remuneration matters from:
Aon Consulting Inc – Radford executive remuneration  •
data;
Ernst & Young LLP – independent verification of  •
earnings per share (“EPS”) to determine the  
vesting of share incentives (they are also the 
Company’s auditors);
Kepler Associates Limited – measurement of total  •
shareholder return (“TSR”) to determine the vesting of 
share incentives; 
Linklaters LLP – advice on share incentive plans (they  •
are also one of the Company’s general legal advisers); 
and
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP – Monks’ executive  •
remuneration data.
During the year the Committee also consulted with the 
Company’s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief 
Financial Officer, Vice President of Human Resources  
and the Company Secretary but not on matters relating 
directly to their own remuneration.
 
5. Executive directors’ remuneration
The remuneration of executive directors comprises the 
following elements:
base salary, benefits and pension contributions or  •
cash allowance in lieu of pension;
quarterly and/or annual performance cash incentive;  •
and
long term share incentive awards. •
a) Edward Bramson, Chairman
Edward Bramson acted as Executive Chairman until 
the appointment of Bill Burns as Chief Executive Officer 
on 6 November 2008. Mr Bramson, who is a partner in 
Sherborne Investors GP, LLC (“Sherborne Investors”), the 
Company’s largest shareholder, chose to waive 
his right to any remuneration for his role as Executive 
Chairman whilst he managed the operational turnaround 
of the Group. As a consequence he received no director’s 
fee, salary, pension contributions, cash incentive or 
share incentive awards from his appointment to the 
Board on 22 December 2006 until 31 December 2008. 
Following the separation of the chairman and chief 
executive roles, the Committee determined that Mr 
Bramson should receive a director’s fee of £150,000 
per annum from 1 January 2009 for his services as 
Non-Executive Chairman. 33

b) Base salary, fees and benefits
Base salaries and benefits of executive directors are 
determined by the Committee and are normally reviewed 
annually. Bill Burns’ base salary and benefits were set on 
appointment on 6 November 2008 and will not be 
reviewed until 1 January 2010. Eric Hutchinson’s base 
salary and benefits were last reviewed on 1 January 
2008 and the Committee determined that there should 
be no change for 2008. Mr Hutchinson’s base salary and 
benefits will next be reviewed on 1 July 2009.
When conducting such reviews, the Committee takes into 
account a range of factors including the Company’s 
performance, economic conditions, the prevailing market 
rates for similar positions in a comparable group of 
companies, the responsibilities, individual performance 
and experience of each executive director and the level 
of salary increases awarded to employees throughout 
the Group. 
Bill Burns has a service agreement with Spirent 
Communications Inc. (“SCI”), and being a US resident, 
receives a remuneration package which is in line with US 
employment practice. In addition to his base salary, he 
participates in SCI’s medical, dental and vision plans, 
401(k) Pension Plan (see below) and a non-qualified 
deferred compensation plan (see below) and receives 
disability coverage benefit, life insurance cover of four 
times base salary and a car allowance.
The SCI 401(k) Pension Plan is a defined contribution 
plan approved under Section 401(k) of the US Internal 
Revenue Code (“US IR Code”). SCI make matching 
contributions of up to 4 per cent of the maximum 
compensation permitted for these purposes under the 
US IR Code. Under the US IR Code, the maximum annual 
amount of an employee’s compensation that can be 
taken into account in determining the employer’s 
contribution is $230,000 in respect of 2008. 
The SCI Deferred Compensation Plan is a non-qualified 
plan offered as a benefit to senior management in  
the US. This plan allows participants to defer up to  
50 per cent of their base salary and up to 100 per cent 
of any cash incentive until they reach retirement age  
or leave the Group’s employment. Under this plan, 
contributions are met solely by Mr Burns and SCI makes 
no matching contributions.
During the year Bill Burns was required to relocate to 
California. A taxable relocation payment of $174,200 
(£116,913
1
) was made during the year. 
Eric Hutchinson has a service agreement with Spirent 
Communications plc, and being a UK resident, receives a 
remuneration package which is in line with UK 
employment practice. In addition to base salary he 
receives private medical insurance, life insurance cover 
of four times base salary and a car allowance.
During the year under review, Eric Hutchinson received an 
annual cash allowance in lieu of pension of 20 per cent 
of base salary, totalling £58,970 (2007 £58,970).
Further details of executive directors’ remuneration are 
given in paragraphs 7a, 7b and 8b.
c) Annual and quarterly performance cash incentives
The Committee regularly reviews performance incentive 
targets and performance conditions to incentivise 
executive directors to meet the short term strategic 
objectives of the Company and its divisions.
Since appointment as Chief Executive Officer, Bill Burns 
has participated in a quarterly performance cash 
incentive arrangement. This cash incentive arrangement 
was structured so that performance was measured 
against a mixture of growth targets in the Company’s 
EPS, other financial targets and personal objectives. The 
Committee reviewed Mr Burns’ performance against the 
targets set and having exceeded the EPS target and met 
all personal objectives, the Committee approved a total 
cash incentive payable for the period he served as a 
director during the year of $76,087 (£51,065
1
), which 
was equivalent to 83 per cent of his pro-rated base salary.
During 2008 Eric Hutchinson participated in an annual 
performance cash incentive arrangement which was 
structured so that performance was measured against 
growth targets in the Company’s EPS together with 
personal objectives. The target annual cash incentive for 
2008 was set at 50 per cent of base salary. 
The Committee reviewed his performance against the 
targets set and having exceeded the EPS target and met 
all personal objectives, the Committee approved a cash 
incentive payable for 2008 of £147,425, which was 
equivalent to 50 per cent of base salary.
d) Long term share incentive awards
The Company operates a number of share incentive 
plans. Currently, the principal share incentive plan 
utilised for executive directors is the 2005 Employee 
Note
1 Using an average exchange rate for his period as a director of  
£1 = $1.49
5. Executive directors’ remuneration continued 34
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2008
Governance
Incentive Plan (“EIP”), which is a discretionary share 
plan. The only award made under the EIP during the year 
was to Bill Burns on his appointment as Chief Executive 
Officer (further details are given in paragraph 8b below).
Executive directors are also able to participate in an all 
employee share plan if one is offered in the country 
within which they are domiciled. The applicable all 
employee plans in the UK are the 2005 Sharesave 
Scheme and the UK Employee Share Purchase Plan. The 
applicable plan in the US is the US Employee Stock 
Purchase Plan. The Board did not make any invitations to 
executive directors or any other employees to participate 
in an all employee plan during the year. 
During 2008, historical awards of share incentives held 
by executive directors under the Spirent Stock Incentive 
Plan (“SSIP”), 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme 
(“ESOS”) and the UK Savings Related Share Option 
Scheme (“SRSOS”) remained outstanding. The SSIP is 
the principal share incentive plan used to deliver awards 
to Communications group employees. Mr Burns 
participated in the SSIP in his former positions within the 
Communications group and there is no intention to offer 
further awards to Mr Burns under the SSIP following his 
appointment to the Board. The grants made to Bill Burns 
in 2005 and 2006 under the SSIP all have performance 
conditions attached and further details are given below. 
The ESOS and SRSOS were closed in 2005 and no 
grants have been made under either scheme since then.
Further details on all the Company’s share incentive 
plans are provided in note 29 to the consolidated 
financial statements and note 16 to the parent Company 
financial statements.
2005 Employee Incentive Plan
Any awards made to executive directors are subject to 
prior satisfactory performance of the individual and 
award levels vary in accordance with the individual’s 
potential to add value to the business over the medium 
to long term.
Under the EIP, the Company is able to grant options and 
share-settled stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), the 
vesting of which would be subject to meeting an EPS 
growth target. Performance shares may also be granted, 
the vesting of which would be subject to meeting a TSR 
performance target. 
Report on directors’ remuneration continued
In normal circumstances, the maximum combined award 
under the EIP is limited to 250 per cent of base salary in 
SARs/options. As explained above, grants would normally 
consist partly of SARs/options and partly of performance 
shares, with the proviso that the performance share 
element does not exceed 100 per cent of base salary  
(ie using the ratio of two SARs/options being equivalent 
to one performance share). Executive directors would 
normally receive a mix of SARs/options and performance 
shares, utilising a ratio of two SARs/options being 
equivalent to one performance share. At least 25 per 
cent of each grant is delivered in SARs/options and  
at least 25 per cent in performance shares, with  
the balance of the grant delivered through a mix of  
SARs/options and performance shares as determined  
by the Committee.
All EIP awards are tested once on or shortly following the 
third anniversary of grant. Any part of an award which 
does not vest will lapse and there is no retesting.
The Committee believes that real EPS growth is the most 
appropriate measure of the Company’s performance in 
determining the vesting of SARs and options granted 
under the EIP since 2005. Accordingly, the performance 
condition for SARs and options is based on growth in the 
Company’s EPS after excluding any increase in the Retail 
Prices Index (“RPI”), over a three year performance 
period as set out in the following table.
 
Annual rate of growth   
in EPS in excess of growth in RPI  Proportion of

Following testing of the EPS performance condition 
attached to the SARs and options granted under the EIP 
on 25 August 2005, 100 per cent vesting occurred on  
25 August 2008. 
The Committee believes that a relative TSR growth target 
is the most appropriate measure of the Company’s 
performance in determining the vesting of performance 
shares granted under the EIP since 2005. Accordingly, 
the performance condition for performance shares is 
based on the Company’s relative TSR rating against a 
comparator group of companies over a three year 
performance period as set out in the table overleaf.
5. Executive directors’ remuneration continued 35
Spirent Communications plc

Governance
The comparator group consists of the 30 largest 
companies by market capitalisation in the FTSE 
TechMARK 100 Index, excluding those companies who 
were also constituents of the FTSE 100 Index at the 
commencement of the performance period. The 
Committee considers the selected comparator group as 
providing a suitable benchmark for the Company’s TSR 
rating. In determining the TSR for the Company and its 
comparator group, share prices are taken at a fixed point 
immediately prior to, and at the end of, the performance 
period, and there is no averaging period.

Grants made to Bill Burns in 2005 and 2006 under 
the SSIP remain outstanding and are subject to a 
performance condition, as approved by shareholders in 
2004, as set out below. A 25 per cent tranche of each 
grant of SARs vests and becomes exercisable, subject to 
the attainment of a performance condition, on each of 
the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the 
date of grant. The performance condition is measured 
against a fixed base year determined at the date of grant. 
Any tranche which does not meet the performance 
condition before the fourth anniversary of the date of 
grant is subject to a final testing on that fourth 
anniversary. The performance condition for this final 
testing is measured from the base year and the 
performance condition is increased in proportion to 
the four year performance period. Any tranche which 
remains unvested after the fourth anniversary of the 
date of grant lapses.

Spirent Communications plc

Report on directors’ remuneration continued
e) Service contracts
It is the Company’s policy that service contracts for the 
executive directors have no fixed term and are capable of 
termination on no more than 12 months’ notice from the 
Company and no more than 12 months’ notice from the 
executive director.
The contract dates and notice periods for each executive 
director are as follows:
   Notice Notice 
  period by period by 
 Date of company  director 
 contract month(s) month(s)
Bill Burns 6 November 2008 1 1 
Eric Hutchinson 13 December 1999  12 12
Both contracts contain provisions for the employer to 
make payment in lieu of notice and for removal of the 
director for poor performance or material misconduct 
without compensation. In the case of Eric Hutchinson, the 
Company will seek to apply practical mitigation measures 
to any payment of compensation on termination, taking 
into account all relevant circumstances. 
In the case of Bill Burns, mitigation provisions are 
contained in his service contract. His service contract is 
with SCI and is governed by the laws of the State of 
California and, accordingly, its termination provisions 
reflect US practice. Either the employer or Mr Burns may 
terminate upon 30 days’ notice (although the employer 
may make payment of base salary in lieu of notice). If the 
employer terminates employment in circumstances other 
than for death, disability or “cause” (which is defined in 
detail in the contract and includes dismissal for material 
misconduct or poor performance), or Mr Burns 
terminates for “good reason” (which is defined in detail in 
the contract and includes any material breach of the 
contract by the employer), he is entitled to the following 
payments in addition to one month’s base salary (or 
payment in lieu): accrued base salary; accrued paid time 
off and vacation pay; cash incentive due and payable 
with respect to the previous quarter and/or fiscal year, as 
appropriate, in which the termination occurs; a sum 
equal to 11 months’ base salary payable in 10 equal 
monthly instalments but subject to a set-off for any base 
salary earned from alternative employment during the 12 
months period following termination (“severance period”); 
and monthly COBRA premium payments for the duration 
of the severance period subject to a set-off for health 
insurance provided from alternative employment during 
the severance period.
Both service contracts contain appropriate provisions 
to protect the legitimate interests of the Company with 
respect to preventing any terminated director from 
working in a business which competes against the 
Company. Service contracts do not contain any 
compensation rights which could be increased on 
a change of control in the Company.
f) External appointments
The Company recognises that its executive directors may 
be invited to become non-executive directors of other 
companies and that such appointments can broaden 
their knowledge and experience, to the benefit of the 
Company. The director retains any related fees. Eric 
Hutchinson serves as a non-executive director on the 
board of Trifast plc and received a fee of £33,250 during 
the year.
g)  Shareholder dilution and share plan approval sought 
at 2009 AGM
The Committee is mindful of the need to manage 
shareholder dilution in a responsible manner. At the 
2008 Annual General Meeting (“2008 AGM”), 
shareholders granted the Company authority to award 
share incentives over new issue shares of no more than 
half of one per cent of the then issued Ordinary Share 
capital under the EIP and SSIP. This authority is due to 
expire at the 2009 AGM. It was also stated in the Notice 
of 2008 AGM that the Employee Share Ownership Trust 
(“ESOT”) held 1.7 million unallocated shares as a result 
of share incentives lapsing on termination of employees 
and that the Company would utilise these unallocated 
shares before making any significant awards over new 
issue shares. 
Between the 2008 AGM and the date of this report, the 
Committee approved awards of share incentives over 
1.2 million Ordinary Shares, just under one million of 
which were sourced from unallocated Ordinary Shares 
held in the Company’s ESOT. The remainder of the 
awards to be satisfied with new issue shares equated to 
just 0.02 per cent of the issued Ordinary Share capital 
on 8 May 2008 (the date of the 2008 AGM). In addition, 
wherever practical, SARs are awarded rather than share 
options. SARs are more efficient than share options in 
terms of actual dilution as only the appreciation value 
and not the full value of the award needs to be funded in 
shares when awards are exercised. To demonstrate this 
efficiency, during 2008 the Company issued only 
1.6 million new Ordinary Shares to cover the exercise of 
5.4 million SARs. 
5. Executive directors’ remuneration continued 37
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2008
Governance
Overall shareholder dilution resulting from the Company’s 
share incentive plans (on a rolling 10 year basis) has 
fallen by 0.9 per cent when comparing the positions at 
31 December 2008 (14.1 per cent) and 31 December 
2007 (15.0 per cent). The overall number of share 
incentives outstanding at 31 December 2008 has fallen 
by 17 million when compared to the number outstanding 
at 31 December 2007 (2008 50.1 million, 2007 
67.1 million). However, the Committee’s efforts to 
manage shareholder dilution have been significantly 
offset by the Company’s share repurchase programme, 
as this has resulted in a large drop in the issued Ordinary 
Share capital over the year (2008 671.8 million, 2007 
792.4 million). Ignoring the impact of the share 
repurchase programme, the dilution position at 31 
December 2008 would have been 11.2 per cent, a drop 
of 3.8 per cent.
The Committee considers SARs, options and 
performance shares to be meaningful share incentives. 
Accordingly, in line with its sustainable dilution strategy, 
and to give management flexibility, the Company will seek 
shareholder authority at the 2009 AGM to award share 
incentives over new issue shares of no more than half of 
one per cent of the current issued Ordinary Share capital, 
such authority to expire at the 2010 Annual General 
Meeting (“2010 AGM”). In order to further mitigate the 
impact on dilution, the Company intends to utilise the 
0.8 million unallocated shares currently held in the ESOT 
(these shares were allocated to awards which have since 
lapsed) before making any significant awards over new 
issue shares.
At the 2008 AGM, the Company was also given authority 
by shareholders to continue to operate the SSIP until the 
2009 AGM. As outlined above, during 2008 a minimal 
number of share incentives were granted under the SSIP. 
The Company continues to review share incentive 
arrangements and as such it will seek shareholder 
authority to further extend the operation of the SSIP until 
the 2010 AGM at which time the Company will revert to 
shareholders with an update on long term share 
incentive policy. Accordingly, a resolution is being placed 
before shareholders at the 2009 AGM to renew the 
authority to operate the SSIP and to grant share 
incentives using new issue shares. 
Shareholder approval was given in 2005 to operate the 
EIP until 2015, subject to further shareholder approval 
being required on the use of new issue shares and any 
material changes to the plan. No material changes to 
the EIP are proposed and therefore no shareholder 
approval is required at the 2009 AGM to continue to 
operate this plan.
6.  Non-executive directors’ fees and letters of 
appointment
The Company’s remuneration policy with regard to 
non-executive directors is to pay fees which are in line 
with market practice. Fees are normally reviewed once 
every three years and having last been reviewed on  
1 January 2008 will not formally be reviewed until  
1 January 2011. It is considered that non-executive 
director fees are at the median level for comparable 
companies. The basic annual fee for non-executive 
directors with effect from 1 January 2008 is £36,000. 
The Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees receive an additional fee of £11,000 and 
£9,000 respectively. 
All non-executive directors have a letter of appointment 
with the Company for not more than a three year period, 
subject to the Company’s Articles of Association. Each 
letter provides for retirement every three years, except 
Edward Bramson and Gerard Eastman who have stated 
that they will seek re-election by shareholders on an 
annual basis. Non-executive directors are not eligible to 
participate in cash incentive or share incentive 
arrangements and their service does not qualify for a 
pension or other benefits. No element of their fee is 
performance related. Details of individual appointments 
are as follows:

Alex Walker 22 December 2006 2009 AGM
The letters of appointment are available for inspection on 
request and will be available for inspection before and 
during the 2009 AGM.
As outlined in 5a above, Edward Bramson acted as 
Executive Chairman until the appointment of Bill Burns 
as Chief Executive Officer on 6 November 2008.  
Mr Bramson, who is a partner in Sherborne Investors, 
the Company’s largest shareholder, chose to waive 
his right to any remuneration for his role as Executive 
Chairman whilst he managed the operational turnaround 
of the Group. As a consequence, he received no 
remuneration from his appointment to the Board  
on 22 December 2006 until 31 December 2008. 
5. Executive directors’ remuneration continued 38
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2008
Governance
Following the separation of the chairman and chief executive roles, the Committee determined that Mr Bramson should 
receive a director’s fee of £150,000 per annum from 1 January 2009 for his role as Non-Executive Chairman.
Gerard Eastman, also a partner in Sherborne Investors, continued to waive his right to any fees in 2008 whilst the 
operational turnaround of the Group was managed. Following the appointment of Bill Burns as Chief Executive Officer, 
the Board determined that Mr Eastman should receive the basic fee of £36,000 per annum from 1 January 2009 for his 
services as a non-executive director. Messrs Bramson and Eastman have both elected to have their fees paid to 
Sherborne Investors.
Further information on non-executive directors’ fees is provided in paragraph 7a.

Annual Report 2008
Financial statements
We have audited the Group financial statements of Spirent 
Communications plc for the year ended 31 December 
2008 which comprise the Consolidated income statement, 
the Consolidated balance sheet, the Consolidated cash 
flow statement, the Consolidated statement of recognised 
income and expense, the related notes 1 to 35 and the 
list of Principal divisions and subsidiaries. These Group 
financial statements have been prepared under the 
accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent Company 
financial statements of Spirent Communications plc for 
the year ended 31 December 2008 and on the information 
in the Report on directors’ remuneration that is described 
as having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as 
a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies 
Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the Company’s members those matters we 
are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, 
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the Company and the Company’s members as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions 
we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual 
Report and the Group financial statements in accordance 
with applicable United Kingdom law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by  
the European Union are set out in the Statement of 
directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial 
statements in accordance with relevant legal and 
regulatory requirements and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group 
financial statements give a true and fair view and whether 
the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you 
whether in our opinion the information given in the Report 
of the directors is consistent with the financial statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not 
received all the information and explanations we require for 
our audit, or if information specified by law regarding 
director’s remuneration and other transactions is  
not disclosed.
We review whether the Directors’ statement on corporate 
governance reflects the Company’s compliance with the 
nine provisions of the 2006 Combined Code specified for 
our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required 
Independent auditors’ report to the members of 
Spirent Communications plc
to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal 
control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on 
the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance 
procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report 
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited 
Group financial statements. The other information 
comprises only the Chairman’s statement, the Business 
review, the Board of directors, the Report of the directors, 
the Statement of directors’ responsibilities, the Directors’ 
statement on corporate governance, the Report on 
directors’ remuneration, Financial history and Shareholder 
information. We consider the implications for our report if 
we become aware of any apparent misstatements or 
material inconsistencies with the Group financial 
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any 
other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the 
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, 
on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and 
disclosures in the Group financial statements. It also 
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and 
judgements made by the directors in the preparation  
of the Group financial statements, and of whether  
the accounting policies are appropriate to the  
Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all 
the information and explanations which we considered 
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence 
to give reasonable assurance that the Group financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming  
our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy  
of the presentation of information in the Group  
financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
the Group financial statements give a true and fair view,  •
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 
December 2008 and of its profit for the year then ended; 
the Group financial statements have been properly  •
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and
the information given in the Report of the directors is  •
consistent with the Group financial statements.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
1. Corporate information
The Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 were authorised for issue by the 
Board of directors on 24 February 2009. Spirent Communications plc is a public limited company incorporated and 
domiciled in England and Wales. The Company’s Ordinary Shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
As required by the European Union’s IAS Regulation and the Companies Act 1985, the Group has prepared its 
consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by 
the European Union (“EU”).
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to include 
revaluation to fair value of certain instruments as described below.
The Group has prepared its financial statements under IFRS. The significant accounting policies applied in the 
preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those applied in the consolidated financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2007 except in relation to the implementation of IFRIC 14 “The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, 
Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction”.
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are mandatory for the first time in the 
current financial year and have been adopted by the Group with no significant impact on its consolidated results or 
financial position other than in relation to IFRIC 14 which is discussed below.
International Accounting Standards (“IAS/IFRS”)                                                   Effective date
IFRIC 11 IFRS2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions     1 January 2008
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements      1 January 2008
IFRIC 14 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction 1 January 2008
IAS 39 & IFRS 7 Reclassification of Financial Assets     1 July 2008
IAS 19 “Employee Benefits” limits the measurement of a defined benefit asset to the present value of economic 
benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan plus 
unrecognised gains and losses. IFRIC 14 clarifies what effect the existence of a minimum funding requirement has on 
this limit and provides guidance as to when the employer has an unconditional right to a refund from the plan.
At 1 January 2007 the full amount of the defined benefit plan surplus had been recognised, but the surplus was 
restricted at 31 December 2007 to the present value of economic benefits available as a reduction in future 
contributions. However, as clarified by IFRIC 14 an unconditional right of refund to the employer exists in the Spirent 
plans and therefore the full amount of the surplus should be recognised on the balance sheet at 31 December 2007. 
IFRIC 14 requires provision to be made for any part of the surplus that would not be recoverable. Any surplus on the 
plans that may ultimately be repaid to the Company would currently be subject to a 35 per cent tax charge prior to 
repayment. IFRIC 14 requires that this liability be recognised at the balance sheet date. The Comparatives have been 
restated accordingly. There is no effect on the income statement for the year to 31 December 2007 nor on earnings 
per share. 48

Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries made 
up to 31 December each year. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the 
parent Company, using consistent accounting policies.
Results of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be 
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. All intra Group transactions, balances, 
income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries, representing the excess of cost over the net fair value of the 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, is capitalised as an intangible asset. Goodwill is carried 
at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored by 
management, usually at business segment level or statutory company level as the case may be. Where the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised 
in the income statement.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit, an operation within a cash-generating unit, an 
associate or jointly controlled entity is included in the profit or loss on its disposal.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Separately 
identifiable intangible assets such as patent fees, licence fees, trademarks and customer lists, and relationships are 
capitalised on the balance sheet only when the value can be measured reliably, or the intangible asset is purchased as 
part of the acquisition of a business. Such intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight 
line basis. The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued 49
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2008
Financial statements
Intangible assets arising on the Group’s various product development projects are recognised only if all of the following 
conditions are met:
i)  an asset is created that can be separately identified (such as software or a new process);
ii)  it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits;
iii)  the development cost can be measured reliably;
iv) it is intended that the asset is completed and used; and
v)  there is adequate financial, technical and other resources to complete, use or sell the asset.
Product development costs are expensed as incurred until the technological feasibility of the product under development 
has been established. Technological feasibility in Spirent’s circumstances occurs when a working model is completed. 
For software development technological feasibility is not established until the process of developing the software is 
complete. After technological feasibility is established, additional costs are capitalised and amortised on a straight line 
basis over the estimated useful life.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment. 
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land. Depreciation is provided to write off the cost, less estimated residual 
value, of all other assets over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis at rates which take into account 
commercial conditions at their location. Usual asset lives are as follows:
Freehold buildings 50 years 
Plant and machinery 3 to 8 years 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment    
Building installations 20 years or lease period if less 
Fittings and equipment 3 to 8 years 
Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years 
Business systems software 4 years 
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Impairment of assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such 
indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the 
asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair 
value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not 
generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying 
amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its 
recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value 
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific 
to the asset. Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement of those expense 
categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised 
impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is 
estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to 
determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case the 
carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. The increased amount cannot exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in 
prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the income statement. After such a reversal the depreciation charge is

adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis 
over its remaining useful life.
Leases
Operating leases are leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset 
and are not finance leases. Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over 
the period of the lease.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value. Cost includes all costs in bringing each 
product to its present location and condition, being the full manufacturing cost on a first-in-first-out basis, including  
all attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity and excluding borrowing costs. Net realisable value 
represents selling price less further costs to be incurred to completion and on sale.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less 
an allowance for any uncollectable amounts. An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full  
amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits with an 
original maturity of three months or less.
For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash 
equivalents as defined above.
Provisions
Provisions are recorded when the Group has a present, legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, for 
which it is probable that the Group will be required to settle by an outflow of resources and for which a reliable estimate 
of the amount of the obligation can be made. Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect 
the current best estimate.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision shall be the present value of the 
expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.
Foreign currencies
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Company’s functional and 
presentation currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet 
date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are measured in terms of historical costs 
using the exchange rate at the date of the initial transactions.
The functional currencies of the Group’s operations are principally US dollar, sterling or euro.
On consolidation the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated into the Group’s presentation 
currency at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. The results of foreign operations are translated into 
sterling using average rates.
Equity investments in foreign operations include long term intra group loans, the settlement of which is neither planned 
nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future. Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of opening net assets of 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued 51
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2008
Financial statements
foreign investments and exchange adjustments arising from the translation of the results of foreign operations, are 
classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as 
part of the profit or loss on disposal should an operation be disposed of. The Group has elected to apply the exemption 
in IFRS 1 “First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards” which allows the cumulative translation 
differences for all foreign operations to be deemed to be zero at the date of transition to IFRS, being 1 January 2003. 
The gain or loss on the subsequent disposal of any foreign operation therefore excludes translation differences that 
arose before the date of transition.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of 
the foreign entity and translated at closing rates of exchange. As permitted by IFRS 1 the Group has elected to treat 
goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions prior to the date of transition to IFRS as an asset of the 
parent, and as such these are sterling denominated.
All other exchange profits and losses are taken to the income statement.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The 
Group’s policy is not to undertake any trading activity in financial instruments. Such derivative financial instruments are 
stated at fair value.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is 
entered into, and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at the reported balance sheet date. 
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is 
documented at its inception. This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the 
nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration. Such hedges are 
expected at inception to be highly effective.
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are used to hedge foreign exchange exposures arising on forecast receipts 
and payments in foreign currencies. The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is calculated by 
reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to 
changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability, or cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to the 
variability in cash flows that is due to the risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction. 
The Group discontinues hedge accounting if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the 
hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the Group revokes the designation.
In relation to those fair value hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from remeasuring 
the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement and any gain or loss on the item that is being hedged is 
adjusted against its carrying amount and recognised in the income statement.
In relation to cash flow hedges (forward foreign currency exchange contracts) to hedge firm commitments or highly 
probable forecast transactions and which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the proportion of the gain or loss 
on the remeasurement of the fair value of the hedging instrument that is deemed to be effective is recognised in equity 
and the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued 52
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2008
Financial statements
When the firm commitment or highly probable forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a 
non-financial liability, the associated gains and losses that have previously been recognised in equity are included in the 
initial measurement of the carrying amount of the asset or liability at the time the asset or liability is recognised.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken 
to the income statement.
Gains or losses arising on hedging instruments, which are cancelled due to termination of the underlying exposure, are 
taken to the income statement immediately.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when 
their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts.
Pensions
In the United Kingdom, the Group operates two defined benefit pension plans for the benefit of employees. These plans 
require contributions to be made to separately administered funds, based on triennial actuarial valuations. Other plans 
are defined contribution in nature.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit pension plans is determined separately for each plan using the 
projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period (to determine current service 
cost), and to the current and prior periods (to determine the present value of defined benefit obligations), and is based 
on actuarial advice. Past service costs are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting 
period or immediately if the benefits have vested. When a settlement (eliminating all obligations for benefits already 
accrued), or a curtailment (reducing future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the plan membership or a 
reduction in future entitlement) occurs, the obligation and related plan assets are remeasured using current actuarial 
assumptions and the resultant gain or loss recognised in the income statement during the period in which the 
settlement or curtailment occurs.
The interest element of the defined benefit cost represents the change in present value of plan obligations resulting 
from the passage of time and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening present value of the benefit 
obligation, taking into account material changes in the obligation during the year. The expected return on plan assets is 
based on an assessment made at the beginning of the year of long term market returns on plan assets, adjusted for the 
effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions received, and benefits paid during the year. The difference 
between the expected return on plan assets and the interest cost is recognised in the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement of recognised income and expense in the period in 
which they occur.
The defined benefit pension asset or liability in the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the present value 
of the defined benefit obligation (using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds), less any past service 
cost not yet recognised and less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. Fair 
value is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price. The value of 
a net pension benefit asset is restricted to the sum of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any 
amount the Group expects to recover, by way of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions.
Contributions payable to the defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the year for which they 
are due.
Treasury shares 
Spirent Communications plc Ordinary Shares held by the Group are classified in shareholders’ equity as treasury shares 
and are recognised at cost and shown as a deduction from retained earnings. Consideration received for the sale of 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued 53
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2008
Financial statements
such treasury shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original 
cost being taken to retained earnings.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group, the revenue can be reliably 
measured and when the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership. In addition, 
revenue is only recognised when collectability is probable.
For the sale of services, revenue is recognised in accounting periods in which the service is rendered. Revenue from 
maintenance contracts is recognised over the period of performance on a straight line basis.
Revenue from product sales of hardware and software is recognised at the time of delivery and acceptance and when 
there are no significant vendor obligations remaining. It is not until acceptance has occurred that the risks and rewards 
of ownership are transferred to the buyer. Terms of acceptance are dependent upon the specific contractual 
arrangement agreed with the customer.
Contractual arrangements are accounted for as two or more separate transactions only where the commercial 
substance is that the individual components operate independently of each other, because they are capable of being 
provided separately from one another and it is possible to attribute reliable fair values to every component. To the 
extent that a separate component comprises a product sale of hardware or software, revenue is recognised as 
described above. Revenue is recognised on other components as the Group fulfils its contractual obligations and to the 
extent that it has earned the right to consideration.
Employee benefits
When an employee has rendered services to the Group during an accounting period, short term benefits expected to be 
paid in exchange for those services are recognised in the same accounting period.
Share-based payment
Employees (including executive directors) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment 
transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (equity-settled transactions).
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which 
they are granted. The fair value is determined using a binomial model.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in 
which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled 
to the award (vesting date). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date, 
until the vesting date, reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that will 
ultimately vest, in the opinion of the directors of the Company at that date and based on the best available estimates.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a 
market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided 
that all other conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had 
not been modified. In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of 
the modification, as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense 
not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled 
award and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated 
as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.

The dilutive effect of outstanding share incentives is reflected in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
The Group has an employee share trust for the granting of certain share incentives to employees. Shares in the Group 
held by the employee share trust are treated as treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction 
from equity.
The Group took advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied 
IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment” only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 which were unvested at 
1 January 2005.
Tax
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a   •
transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor 
taxable profit or loss;
in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint  •
ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the 
temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available  •
against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity. Otherwise 
income tax is recognised in the income statement.
Dividends paid
The interim dividend is included in the financial statements in the period it is approved by the directors, and the final 
dividend in the period it is approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.
Critical accounting assumptions and judgements
The preparation of financial statements requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect items 
reported. Such estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best knowledge of current facts, circumstances 
and future events, actual results may differ, possibly significantly, from those estimates. The areas requiring a high 
degree of judgement or where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are 
discussed below.
Goodwill impairment
The Group tests annually by cash-generating unit whether goodwill has suffered impairment and more frequently when 
events or circumstances indicate that the current carrying value may not be recoverable. The recoverable amounts of 
cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use calculations which require the use of estimates and 
assumptions. These are described in note 15.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued 55
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2008
Financial statements
Defined benefit pension schemes
The pension cost and the defined benefit obligation of the Group’s defined benefit pension plans are based on a number 
of selected assumptions, these include the discount rate, inflation rate, salary growth, longevity and expected return on 
the plans’ assets. Differences arising from actual experience or future changes in assumptions will be reflected in future 
periods. The effect of changing these assumptions is described in note 11.
Revenue recognition
For revenue recognition purposes contractual arrangements are accounted for as two or more separate transactions 
only where the commercial substance is that the individual components operate independently of each other, because 
they are capable of being provided separately from one another and it is possible to attribute reliable fair values to every 
component. To the extent that a separate component comprises a product sale of hardware or software, revenue is 
recognised as described above. Revenue is recognised on other components as the Group fulfils its contractual 
obligations and to the extent that it has earned the right to consideration. Management exercises a degree of judgement 
in setting the criteria used for determining when revenue which involves several elements should be recognised.
Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in a number of tax jurisdictions and judgement is applied in determining the 
worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions for which the final tax determinability is uncertain. 
For example liabilities are recognised for anticipated tax audit issues based on whether additional taxes are likely to be 
due based on the facts and circumstances known at the time the financial statements are prepared. Where the final 
outcome differs from the amounts that were initially recorded the differences will be recorded in the future period in 
which the determination is made.
Deferred taxes
The extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognised is based on current forecasts and estimates prepared by 
management. A change to these forecasts and estimates could result in a different recognition outcome.
Provisions
The Group records a provision for vacant property based on future rentals and reduced by its expected ability to 
sublease the vacant space to a third party and discounted where the effect is significant. Changes in the actual 
outcome compared with expected outcome on subleasing or changes to expectations will be recorded in future periods.

IFRS 8 “Operating Segments” will require disclosure of information about the Group’s operating segments and replace 
the requirement to determine primary (business) and secondary (geographical) reporting segments of the Group. The 
Group expects that the operating segments will remain the same as the business segments previously identified under 
IAS 14 “Segment Reporting”.
The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on 
the Group’s financial statements in the period of initial application.

Business segments
For management purposes, the Group is currently organised on a worldwide basis into two operating groups, 
Communications and Systems. Communications is further subdivided into two divisions, Performance Analysis and 
Service Assurance. The SwissQual business, which was included in Performance Analysis, was sold in 2007 and was 
reported as a discontinued operation in that year. There are no discontinued operations in 2008.
The principal activities of each segment are as follows:
Performance Analysis division of the Communications group develops testing solutions for a broad range of  •
communications technologies critical to the development of next-generation network equipment and devices.
Service Assurance division of the Communications group provides network monitoring and management systems for  •
service providers to assure the quality of their high bandwidth data services. Sales include hardware and software 
products as well as maintenance and support services.
Systems group comprises PG Drives Technology, which develops power control systems for electrical vehicles in the  •
mobility and industrial markets.
Non-segmental costs represent corporate expenses, non-segmental assets comprise cash and cash equivalents held 
for central treasury purposes and other corporate assets and non-segmental liabilities represent tax payable and other 
corporate liabilities.

Defined benefit plans        
The defined benefit pension plans are in the United Kingdom and comprise the Spirent Communications plc Staff 
Pension & Life Assurance Plan (“Staff Plan”) and the Spirent Communications plc Retirement Cash & Life Assurance 
Plan (“Cash Plan”). These plans have been combined for the purposes of the following disclosures. There is in addition a 
United Kingdom unfunded plan.
        
The assets and liabilities on the balance sheet are as follows:

Rate of increase in deferred pensions     3.0 3.4 
 Rate used to discount plan liabilities     6.0 5.7 
Expected rate of return on plan assets     5.2 5.9
Spirent Communications plc employs a building block approach in determining the long term rate of return on plan  
assets. Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns 
consistent with widely accepted capital market principles. The assumed long term rate of return on each class of asset 
is set out within this note. The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected 
return of each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the plans.     64

The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements. The 
assumptions are such that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 21.7 years (2007 21.6 years) if 
they are male and for a further 24.0 years (2007 24.0 years) if they are female. For a member who retires in 2028 at 
age 65 the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 22.9 years (2007 22.8 years) after retirement if 
they are male and for a further 25.0 years (2007 25.0 years) after retirement if they are female.    
The approximate impact to the past service liabilities of changing these main assumptions is as follows:   
             
Reducing the discount rate by 0.1 per cent per annum. This would increase past service liabilities by £1.8 million. •
Increasing the life expectancy of a current 65 year old by one year (by modifying the standard mortality tables using  •
an appropriate scaling factor). This would increase past service liabilities by £3.1 million.    
    
There will also be an impact on the future service cost but given the small active population in these plans this is likely 
to be insignificant.

The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised since 1 January 2003 in the Group’s statement of 
recognised income and expense is £11.7 million loss (2007 £6.6 million loss). The directors are unable to determine 
how much of the pension plan deficit recognised on 1 January 2003 and taken directly to equity of £41.9 million in the 
Group is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension plans. Consequently, the directors 
are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group’s 
statement of recognised income and expense before 1 January 2003.

The above plans are funded and have full UK HM Revenue & Customs tax-exempt approval. Certain members, whose 
salaries were in excess of the statutory earnings cap, had their benefits increased through unapproved, unfunded 
arrangements, to the level that would otherwise have applied in respect of basic salary only. The Group has contractually 
agreed to pay the additional retirement benefits itself and a provision is made in respect of this obligation in the balance 
sheet at 31 December 2008 of £0.6 million (2007 £0.7 million). This represents the actuarial value as confirmed by the 
Group’s pension advisers, of the unapproved benefit entitlements accrued at that date. The value is assessed and reviewed 
on a market value basis in line with the main plan valuation and adjusted each year. There are no experience gains or losses 
in the period from 2004 to 2008 on the unfunded plan.
        
Expected contributions for these plans for 2009 are £0.3 million.       
 
A curtailment gain of £0.8 million arose in 2007 on the closure of a site which led to a reduction in the number of  
employees covered by the plans. As the curtailment gain related to restructuring it was included within exceptional 
restructuring costs.
Defined contribution plans         
United Kingdom         
The Group maintains defined contribution pension plans for employees in the United Kingdom. Employer contributions 
into these plans for 2008 were £0.7 million (2007 £0.7 million).       
  
United States         
The Group maintains a defined contribution pension benefit plan for employees of its United States subsidiaries. This 
plan, also known as a 401(k) Plan, allows employees to defer a percentage of their salary for retirement. The investment 
choices offered by the plan are a selection of diversified mutual funds offering a broad mix of investment return 
potential with varying levels of risk.         
         
In aggregate, the Group contributions to the US plan totalled $3.1 million for 2008 (2007 $3.5 million). Total assets in 
the defined contribution plan at the end of 2008 were $89.4 million (2007 $129.2 million). There were no defined 
benefit plans in the United States in 2008 or 2007.         
Other jurisdictions         
Outside the United Kingdom and the United States employees are provided with pension arrangements determined in 
accordance with approved local practice and regulations. These arrangements are defined contribution plans. Total  
contributions for 2008 in respect of these plans amounted to £0.2 million (2007 £0.5 million).    
     
Total contributions to defined contribution plans were £2.6 million (2007 £3.0 million).

Annual impairment test         
The recoverable amount of the Performance Analysis cash-generating unit at 30 November 2008, the annual impairment 
testing date, has been determined based on a value in use calculation using management’s cash flow projections over a 
three year period. Cash flows in subsequent years have been extrapolated using a 2.5 per cent (2007 2.5 per cent) 
growth rate which approximates to the average long term growth rate for the industries in which this unit operates. The 
cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 21.0 per cent (2007 21.3 per cent). The recoverable 
amount of this unit, calculated on a value in use basis, was in excess of its carrying value and consequently no 
impairment has been recognised.         
Key assumptions for the annual impairment test
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculation were:       
       
Revenue growth rates.      •
Gross margin.          •
Operating expenses.          •
Discount rate.          •
Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three year period covered by management’s projections.   •
       
Projections were denominated in the same currency as the denomination of the goodwill balance to eliminate the effect 
of fluctuating exchange rates.
Revenue growth rates used in management’s projections are based on management’s estimate of growth in the markets 
served, taking into account the current economic uncertainties. The cash flows used in the impairment review were 
approved by the Board.         
Gross margins and operating expenses are based on historical values.     
The discount rate applied to the cash flows is based on the risk free rate for ten year government bonds adjusted for a 
risk premium to reflect both the increased risk associated with investing in equities and the systematic risk of the 
specific cash-generating unit.
         
Long term growth rates are based upon industry analysis.        
 
Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions         
At 30 November 2008, the date of the Group’s annual impairment review, the estimated recoverable amount of the 
Performance Analysis cash-generating unit exceeded its carrying value by £36.2 million. The table below shows the key 
assumptions used in the value in use calculation and the rate to which each must change in isolation in order for the 
estimated recoverable amount to be equal to its carrying value.

15. Intangible assets continued
In the impairment review carried out at 30 November 2007 the recoverable amount exceeded the carrying value of the 
cash-generating unit by £138.2 million. The directors believed that no reasonable possible change in any of the key 
assumptions used in isolation would have caused the carrying value of the Performance Analysis cash-generating unit to 
exceed its recoverable amount.

During 2006 Spirent discovered potential violations of the United States Export Administration Regulations surrounding 
the valuation and classification of exports together with record keeping requirements. The Company has notified the 
Office of Export Enforcement of the US Department of Commerce and until the Office of Export Enforcement has 
concluded on this matter, the Company is unable to determine what liability, if any, might be due in respect of this.

23. Deferred tax continued
A deferred tax asset of £12.2 million has been recognised at 31 December 2008 (2007 £10.5 million). £6.1 million is in 
the United Kingdom (2007 £5.8 million) and £6.1 million is in the United States (2007 £4.7 million).   
        
The deferred tax liability arising on the United Kingdom pension plan surplus in 2008 and 2007 has been offset as 
permitted by IAS 12 “Income Taxes”. Movements have been charged to the statement of recognised income and 
expense in 2008 and 2007.           
Deferred tax assets on temporary differences of £29.1 million (2007 £56.2 million) arising principally in the United 
States, Canada and the United Kingdom have not been recognised. These assets can only be realised when they 
reverse against suitable taxable profits. Although the directors ultimately expect to realise these assets, there is 
currently insufficient evidence under IAS 12 to recognise a deferred tax asset in respect of these temporary differences. 
          
In addition, the Group has tax losses arising in the United Kingdom of £80.3 million (2007 £68.9 million in the United 
Kingdom and £28.6 million in the United States) that are available for offset against suitable future taxable profits. The 
United States tax losses unrecognised at 31 December 2007 have been reduced by £26.8 million following agreement 
of the tax position for prior years with the balance being utilised in the current year. A deferred tax asset has not been 
recognised in respect of these losses as their future recovery is uncertain. United Kingdom tax losses can be carried 
forward indefinitely.
In total deferred tax assets amounting to £34.0 million (2007 £50.1 million) have not been recognised on unutilised 
losses and temporary differences.           
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the tax deduction which may be available on the future exercise 
of share incentives.

The lease provisions are for the continuing obligations under leases in respect of properties which have been vacated by 
the Group. Where material, lease obligations are discounted. The Group expects these provisions to be utilised over the 
next eight years.         
Restructuring and other provisions at 31 December 2008 are mainly in relation to environmental provisions on property 
disposed of.         
26. Derivative financial instruments         
The derivative financial instruments are forward foreign currency exchange contracts.     
    
The Group uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts in the management of transactional exchange rate 
exposures. These contracts are designated where possible as hedging instruments.     
    
At 31 December 2008 the Group held various forward foreign currency exchange contracts in respect of the forward sale 
of US dollars against sterling on trading transactions. Contracts for the sale of US dollars total £26.5 million (2007 
£29.7 million), are for various maturity dates over the period to 31 December 2009 at an average exchange rate of 1.76 
(2007 over the period to 31 December 2008 at an average rate of 2.03). At 31 December 2007 there were also 
outstanding contracts for the purchase of US dollars against the euro which totalled £0.7 million at an average exchange 
rate of 1.41 which all matured before 31 December 2008.        
 
These contracts have been designated as hedges at 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007.    
     
The fair value of the derivative financial instruments at 31 December is as follows:

27. Financial instruments and financial risk management        
The main purpose of the Group’s financial instruments, other than trade receivables, trade payables and provisions is to 
fund the Group’s liquidity requirements.
All the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are categorised as loans and receivables with the exception of the 
derivative financial instruments which are measured at fair value. These are shown in the following table.

The Group enters into derivative transactions, forward foreign currency exchange contracts, for the management of the 
Group’s currency exposures when deemed appropriate.        
 
The key objective of the Group Treasury department is to manage the financial risks of the business and to ensure that 
sufficient liquidity is available to the Group. All treasury activity operates within a formal control framework. The Board 
has approved treasury policies and guidelines and periodically reviews treasury activities. Additionally, it is the Group’s 
policy that speculative treasury transactions are expressly forbidden.
a) Market risk         
The main types of market risk that affect the Group are interest rate risk and exchange rate risk.    
     
Interest rate risk         
Following the repayment of its long term debt in February 2006 the Group has remained debt free with limited exposure 
to market risk for changes in interest rates. The Group’s excess funds are principally held in the United Kingdom and 
United States and invested in short term bank deposits. It therefore has some exposure to interest rate risk  arising on 
changes in sterling and US dollar interest rates. In 2007 the Group also invested in short dated commercial paper which 
all matured within one month.         
         
Cash and cash equivalents, long term cash on deposit and forward foreign currency exchange contracts are the Group’s 
financial instruments which are exposed to interest rate risk.

27. Financial instruments and financial risk management continued
Short term bank deposits all mature within one week. Forward foreign currency exchange contracts all mature within one 
year. The financial instruments bear the following interest rates:      
     Effective   Effective  
     interest  interest 
     rate 2008 rate 2007 
     % £ million % £ million

      26.7  66.2
Floating rate
Cash at bank and in hand     27.4  12.3
Interest rates on financial instruments classified as fixed rate are fixed until the maturity of the instrument. All fixed rate 
deposits mature within one week (2007 two months) after which date they will be exposed to floating rates of interest. 
In addition, £2.5 million (2007 £3.7 million) was held in a blocked trust account and was earning interest of 1.75 per cent 
at 31 December 2008 (2007 6.25 per cent). The maturity of the deposit is less than one month, at maturity the interest 
rate will be reset. This cash must be retained in the blocked trust account in accordance with the terms of the undertakings 
made at the time of the cancellation of the share premium account and capital redemption reserve (the “Cancellation”) in 
2004. The funds must remain in this account until all the creditors who existed at the date of the Cancellation have been 
repaid and therefore the maturity of this account is uncertain.      
Interest receivable for the year was £3.1 million (note 8) (2007 £6.1 million) and is under the effective interest method.  
       
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above table are non-interest bearing and are  
therefore not subject to interest rate risk.         
         
A movement of 100 basis points in interest rates based on levels of investment at 31 December 2008 would increase 
or reduce interest income and equity by £0.3 million (2007 £0.7 million).      
   
Exchange rate risk         
Currency exposures arise from trading transactions undertaken by the Group in foreign currencies and on the translation 
of the operating results and net assets of overseas subsidiaries.       
  
The Group presents its consolidated financial statements in sterling but has significant operations in the United States, 
and its results can therefore be substantially affected on translation by movements in the US dollar to sterling exchange 
rate. The Group does not enter into instruments to hedge the translation exposure of the operating results or net assets 
of its overseas subsidiaries since these are accounting and not cash exposures. During the year, sterling has 
significantly weakened against the US dollar. The Group does not have any net investment hedges in place.   
      
A 10 per cent change in the US dollar to sterling exchange rate will have the following effect on the income statement 
and balance sheet compared with the reported exchange rate:

The Group is not exposed to significant transactional foreign currency risk at 31 December 2008, nor at 31 December 
2007, because the majority of its businesses do not enter into non-functional currency transactions. Where such 
transactions do occur the Group enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts as appropriate.   
      
Group Treasury, by means of forward foreign currency exchange contracts, carries out the majority of the transaction  
hedging activity in relation to normal trading activity. At 31 December 2008 the Group had hedged the major part of its 
2009 US dollar forecast trading exposures at an average exchange rate of 1.76 US dollars to sterling (at 31 December 
2007 at an average exchange rate of 2.03).
         
b) Credit risk         
Investment counterparties are subject to pre-approval by the Board and as such short term deposits are limited to 
banks with a rating of Standard & Poor’s A or Moody’s A2 or better. There are pre-approved limits set for each bank to 
avoid any concentrations of credit risk.         
         
The maximum credit exposure at the balance sheet date under financial instruments in relation to bank deposits is 
equal to the carrying value of £34.8 million (2007 £70.4 million, bank deposits and short dated commercial paper).
Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for 
uncollectable amounts where appropriate. Trade receivable exposures are managed in the business units where they 
arise. Allowance is made for bad and doubtful debts based on management’s assessment of the risk taking into 
account ageing profile, experience and circumstance.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk attributable to its trade receivables as the exposure is spread 
over a large number of customers with no one customer accounting for more than 10 per cent of total Group revenue. 
The maximum credit exposure at the balance sheet date in relation to trade receivables is equal to the carrying value of 
£52.2 million (2007 £40.2 million).
The composition of trade receivables at 31 December is as follows:      
       2008 2007 
       £ million £ million
Neither impaired nor past due      29.5 27.4
Past due but not impaired: 
Less than 30 days overdue      14.7 8.7
30 to 60 days       3.8 2.1
Over 60 days       4.2 2.0
Trade receivables       52.2 40.2
The Group closely monitors amounts due from customers and performs activities such as credit checks and review of 
payment history and has put in place appropriate credit approval limits. Based on these procedures management 
assessed the quality of those receivables that are past due but not impaired as low risk.
          
The movement on the receivables provision during the year is given in note 20.      
    
c) Liquidity risk          
The Group’s objective is to ensure that there are sufficient sources of funding to meet projected requirements. Its 
operations are financed through cash and cash equivalents held centrally and cash generated from operations. In 
addition the Group has a committed but currently undrawn borrowing facility for £25 million in place until September 
2011. This facility incurs commitment fees at market rates.

Spirent Communications plc

27. Financial instruments and financial risk management continued
The facility requires that the following financial covenants are met:
i) The ratio of operating profit to net interest shall not be less than 5.00:1.00
ii) The ratio of net debt to operating profit shall not be greater than 2.00:1.00
iii) The ratio of net debt to shareholders funds shall not exceed 1.00:1.00
All three financial covenants have been complied with for the 12 months ended 31 December 2008.
At 31 December 2008 the Group had cash and cash equivalents of £59.7 million (2007 £79.0 million) all of which 
mature within one week (2007 two months).         
During 2008 the Group generated £47.7 million of cash from operating activities (2007 £49.8 million) and considers 
that with current cash resources, positive cash flow from operating activities and a committed borrowing facility it has 
adequate resources available to it to remain in operational existence for the forseeable future.
The Group has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts all of which mature within one year. The gross 
settlement amounts of these contracts are as follows:
       2008 2007 
       £ million £ million
Sale of US dollars against sterling      26.5 29.7
Purchase of US dollars against euro     – 0.7
Gross settlement amounts      26.5 30.4
The Group is debt free and does not have loans payable. Financial liabilities, other than derivative financial liabilities, are  
trade and other payables, the majority of which are all due to be settled within one year, and provisions (see note 25).  
        
The Group does not have any other material contractual commitments.       
   
d) Fair value of financial instruments          
The carrying value of all financial assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of fair value.   
      
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.        
  
e) Capital management          
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to support its business and maximise shareholder value. 
The Group’s capital is its total shareholders’ funds.         
 
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions.  
During 2007 and 2008 the Company has been operating an on-market share repurchase programme. In 2008 
the Company repurchased 72.9 million of its Ordinary Shares (2007 103.4 million) at a cost of £42.2 million 
(2007 £66.8 million). In 2008 the Company also undertook a tender offer for the purchase of Ordinary Shares in the 
Company which resulted in a further 52.9 million shares being repurchased at a cost of £24.8 million.  
      
28. Operating lease commitments          
At 31 December, the Group had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable 
operating leases, which fall due as follows: 
       2008 2007 
       £ million £ million
Within one year       8.1 6.6
In the second to fifth years      17.8 15.2

Note
1  During 2008, under the programme of returning capital to shareholders, the Company repurchased 72.9 million Ordinary Shares on-market and 
52.9 million by way of a tender offer. All Ordinary Shares repurchased during the year were cancelled. The remaining 48.4 million Ordinary Shares 
which were held in treasury were cancelled during the year leaving no Ordinary Shares in treasury as at 31 December 2008 (2007 48.4 million). For 
the purposes of providing comparative data, the issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company (when treasury shares are taken into account and 
excluded from the calculation) as at 31 December 2007 was 792.4 million Ordinary Shares compared with 671.8 million as at 31 December 2008.
    
In accordance with the rules of the following share plans, share incentives were exercised during the year which resulted in  
new Ordinary Shares being allotted by the Company or existing Ordinary Shares being transferred from either the Spirent  
Employee Share Ownership Trust (“ESOT”) or Spirent Sharesave Trust (“SST”) as follows:

price is payable on the vesting of a performance share.
2   These exercise prices relate to the Caw Amended and Restated Stock Plan and are expressed in this table in sterling using the average exchange 
rate between pounds sterling and US dollars for the year. The actual exercise prices of these options are priced at either 15.03 US cents or 20.03 
US cents per share.
Description of employee share plans
a) 2005 Employee Incentive Plan (“EIP”)
On 4 May 2005, Spirent shareholders approved the EIP to replace the now closed ESOS (see (c) on page 84). The EIP is 
currently available for selected employees (including executive directors) on a similar discretionary basis as the ESOS. 
No price is payable on the grant of an award. The Company is able to grant share options, including HMRC approved 
options, share settled stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and performance shares under the EIP.
In normal circumstances, EIP options or SARs vest three years following grant provided the Company’s earnings per 
share (“EPS”) growth targets have been met over the three year performance period.

29. Authorised and issued share capital continued
In normal circumstances, EIP performance shares vest three years following grant provided the Company’s total 
shareholder return (“TSR”) targets have been met over the three year performance period.
For further information on the performance conditions for EIP share incentives please see Section 5(d) of the Report on 
directors’ remuneration.
SARs granted under the EIP will deliver the appreciation value (ie the aggregated increase in market value of an Ordinary 
Share over the base price of the SAR) in the form of Ordinary Shares. This “SARs approach”, which is also being utilised 
for the Spirent Stock Incentive Plan (see note (b) below), helps the Company manage its dilution headroom more 
efficiently as only the SAR gain and not the entire share value needs to be funded. Using a SARs approach, it is not 
possible to determine the precise level of dilution until the SARs are exercised. 2.2 million EIP SARs with an average 
base price of 50 pence were outstanding as at 31 December 2008 (2007 1.9 million SARs outstanding, 52 pence 
average base price). 216,959 EIP SARs were exercised in 2008 resulting in the issue of 77,867 Ordinary Shares (2007 
1,946 Ordinary Shares were issued on the exercise of 5,070 EIP SARs).
Options and SARs granted under the EIP expire on the tenth anniversary of their grant unless they have previously 
lapsed or been exercised.
b) Spirent Stock Incentive Plan (“SSIP”)
The SSIP was introduced in 2000. This discretionary plan is primarily targeted at US employees with grants normally 
determined by reference to the seniority and contribution of the individual, together with the performance of the 
relevant business and prevailing local market practice. Under the SSIP, grants are also permitted to selected newly hired 
and promoted employees on a monthly basis.
At the Annual General Meeting held in May 2008, shareholders approved the extension of the SSIP until the Company’s 
2009 Annual General Meeting. The current shareholder approved mandate regarding the annual dilution rate is  
0.5 per cent of the issued Ordinary Share capital for both the SSIP and EIP (see (a) on page 83) in aggregate.
27.5 million SSIP SARs with an average base price of 56 pence were outstanding as at 31 December 2008  
(2007 34.4 million SARs outstanding, 58 pence average base price). During 2008, 1.5 million Ordinary Shares  
were issued as a consequence of the exercise of 5.2 million SSIP SARs (2007 1.7 million Ordinary Shares resulted from 
the exercise of 6.7 million SSIP SARs).
Most awards made pursuant to the SSIP vest over four years, provided that the participant remains in employment. 
Vesting is not subject to a performance condition. Awards normally become 25 per cent exercisable on the first 
anniversary of the date of grant and thereafter in equal proportions on a monthly basis over a further 36 months. Any 
award not exercised by the seventh anniversary of grant will lapse.
The vesting of the SSIP awards made to Bill Burns, prior to his appointment as Chief Executive Officer, and to certain 
other key senior managers within the Communications group, are subject to the Company meeting EPS growth targets 
over the vesting periods. For further details on these performance conditions please see Section 5(d) of the Report on 
directors’ remuneration.
No price is payable on the grant of options or SARs and no options or SARs have been, or can be, granted at a discount 
to the market price.
c) 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme (“ESOS”)
The ESOS is now closed (however outstanding options may still be exercised) and has been replaced by the EIP referred 
to in (a) on page 83.

29. Authorised and issued share capital continued
Awards under the ESOS, normally determined annually, were at the sole discretion of the Remuneration Committee after 
considering recommendations made to it by the Chief Executive Officer. No price was payable on the grant of an option 
and no options were granted at a discount to the market price.
The normal exercise period for options granted under the ESOS is between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of 
grant. Options awarded under the ESOS were subject to the achievement of an EPS performance condition before they 
could be exercised. 
During 2008, all remaining share options awarded under the ESOS passed their EPS performance conditions and are 
now exercisable until they expire on the tenth anniversary of their respective grant dates, or in the case of terminated 
participants 12 months from the date of termination, if sooner.
d) Netcom Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan (“NARSOP”)
Spirent completed the acquisition of Netcom Systems, Inc. (“Netcom”) in 1999. $44.5 million of the total consideration 
was satisfied through the roll-over of outstanding options over Netcom shares into options over approximately  
23.8 million Ordinary Shares (as adjusted) on substantially similar terms as previously existed. All remaining  
outstanding options are fully vested and exercisable until they expire.
e) Zarak Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan (“ZARSOP”)
Out of a total consideration of approximately 44.9 million Ordinary Shares issued for the acquisition of Zarak Systems 
Corporation (“Zarak”) in 2000, approximately 3.8 million Ordinary Shares arose in connection with the roll-over of 
outstanding options over Zarak shares into options over Spirent Ordinary Shares on substantially similar terms as 
previously existed. Any remaining outstanding ZARSOP options have a ten year life from the original date of grant.
f) Caw Amended and Restated Stock Plan (“CARSP”)
Out of a total initial consideration for the acquisition of Caw Networks, Inc. (“Caw”) in 2002 of $49 million, 
approximately $4 million was in respect of Spirent Ordinary Shares and options which arose on the roll-over of 
outstanding options and shares under the previous Caw employee stock plan. The options and shares vested over 
a period ending in 2006 on substantially similar terms as previously existed. The options have a ten year life from 
the original date of grant. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement for Caw, an additional cash payment of 
78.8 US cents was payable as each share vested or upon the exercise of a vested option.
Unvested rolled-over options were capable of immediate exercise (ie prior to their respective vesting date) and any 
shares arising from such an event were held in the ESOT until the relevant vesting date. The option holder was entitled 
to the beneficial (but not legal) interest in the Ordinary Shares whilst they were held in the ESOT but they remained 
subject to forfeiture (with the original option exercise prices being refunded to the participant) if the participant’s 
employment was terminated prior to the vesting date. All CARSP options and resulting Ordinary Shares held in the ESOT 
have now fully vested.
In accordance with the original terms for acquiring Caw, in March 2004 Spirent allotted 4.3 million Ordinary Shares and 
issued 75,000 options following the achievement by Caw of certain technical and financial earn out targets. Participation 
in the CARSP entitled the participants to a share in the earn out. Any earn out payment for an outstanding CARSP option 
was made by increasing the number of shares subject to the option and decreasing the per share exercise price so as to 
preserve the existing aggregate total exercise price. Of the 4.3 million Ordinary Shares, 54,000 Ordinary Shares were 
issued to the ESOT in respect of unvested restricted shares, which remained subject to forfeiture prior to vesting. As a 
result of the earn out, the additional cash payment referred to above was adjusted to 66.9 US cents as each share 
vested or upon the exercise of a vested option.
The Ordinary Shares subject to rolled-over options from the acquisition of Netcom, Zarak and Caw, or granted under the 
SSIP, do not count towards ABI scheme limits. The plans mentioned in (c) to (f) above are closed to new entrants and no 
further awards of options can be made under them. 86

g) UK Savings Related Share Option Scheme (“SRSOS”) and the 2005 Sharesave Scheme
The SRSOS closed in 2005 and was replaced by the 2005 Sharesave Scheme. SRSOS options which remain 
outstanding may still be exercised prior to expiry, however no further grants can be made. Both schemes operate  
as HMRC approved Save-As-You-Earn schemes and are open to all UK employees, subject to a qualifying service  
period. Any future sharesave invitations will be made under the 2005 Sharesave Scheme, which is broadly similar  
to the SRSOS.
The employee enters into a Save-As-You-Earn contract with the Company’s savings carrier to save a regular sum of 
between £5 and £250 per month for a fixed period of either three or five years.
No price is payable on the grant of an option. The option exercise price is calculated by reference to the middle market 
closing price of an Ordinary Share on the business day prior to the beginning of the invitation period, discounted by up  
to 20 per cent, at the Board’s discretion. Options are normally exercisable within six months of the third, fifth or seventh 
anniversary of the contract commencement date, as elected by the option holder at the start of the contract.
The Company operates the SST to honour the commitment to deliver Ordinary Shares against the exercise of 
outstanding options under the SRSOS. Spirent Sharesave Trust Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spirent 
Communications plc, acts as sole trustee of the SST. During the year, 0.3 million Ordinary Shares were transferred to 
participants (2007 0.6 million).
No invitations have been made under either of these schemes since 2003.
h) US Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)
The ESPP enables the Company to grant eligible US employees the right to acquire Spirent American Depositary Shares 
using proceeds of a savings contract. When joining the ESPP, participants enter into a contract to save up to 15 per cent 
of basic salary (gross), subject to an individual maximum of $1,000 (net) per month, over a contract period of 12 
months by way of regular payroll deductions.
No offer has been made under this plan since 2003.
i) Global All Employee Share Purchase Plan (“GAESPP”)
The GAESPP was approved by shareholders in 2001 and offers employees in countries other than the UK or US an 
opportunity to share in the Company’s performance through share ownership. The GAESPP was implemented in Canada 
in January 2002 and operates on similar terms to the ESPP above, with participants entering into a 12 month contract 
to save up to 15 per cent of basic salary (gross), subject to an individual maximum of Cdn $1,000 (net) per month.
No offer has been made under this plan since 2003.
j) UK Employee Share Purchase Plan (“UK ESPP”)
On 4 May 2005, shareholders approved the UK ESPP, which is based on an HMRC approved share incentive plan, 
available to all UK employees (subject to a qualifying service period). The UK ESPP offers three ways to provide Ordinary 
Shares to employees: free shares, partnership shares and matching shares. The UK ESPP will operate in conjunction 
with a trust, which will hold the shares on the behalf of participants.
To date, no awards have been made under this plan.

k) Stock Appreciation Rights Plan (“SARP”)
The SARP was introduced in September 1999 as an interim incentive arrangement for the employees of Netcom 
following the closure of the NARSOP described in (d) on page 85 and subsequently for certain other employees in the 
Communications group. Under the SARP, recruitment, promotion and recognition awards over Ordinary Shares have been 
made in line with historic and local market practice. The operation of the SARP reflected as far as practicable the 
NARSOP. Accordingly, rights under the SARP vested over four years, 25 per cent vesting one year after the date of grant 
and the remainder vesting on a monthly basis over a further 36 months. Rights granted were not subject to the 
fulfilment of any performance conditions.
The SARP will deliver the appreciation value (ie the aggregated increase in the market value of an Ordinary Share over 
the rights price) in the form of existing Ordinary Shares which have been purchased in the market by the Company’s 
ESOT. The SARP is closed and no further grants can be made under it.
At 31 December 2008, the following rights were outstanding under the SARP:

The fair value of share incentives is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial  model. The following table gives the

30. Share-based payment continued
The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the previous 
two years which management considers to be the period which is likely to be most representative of future volatility. 
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate for the effects of non-
transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. For performance shares granted under the 2005 
Employee Incentive Plan, which have a market based performance condition, it has been assumed that there will be  
30 per cent vesting for valuation purposes.

Nature and purpose of reserves
A reconciliation of the opening and closing balance on each reserve is shown in the Reconciliation of movements in 
equity. The nature and purpose of each reserve within equity is as follows:
i)  Share premium account: this reserve records the consideration premium for shares issued at a value that exceeds 
their nominal value;
ii) Capital redemption reserve: this reserve arises in relation to share capital cancellation; 
iii) Capital reserve: this reserve arises in relation to share option plans in acquired companies; 
iv)   Translation reserve: this reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial 
statements of foreign subsidiaries; and
v)   Net unrealised gains and losses: this reserve records movements in the fair value of effective forward foreign 
currency exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments.
Investment in own Ordinary Shares
At 31 December 2008, an amount of £175.8 million (2007 £109.4 million) has cumulatively been deducted from 
retained earnings in relation to the cost of investment in own Ordinary Shares.

31. Reconciliation of movements in equity continued
At 31 December 2008, the ESOT held 7.1 million Ordinary Shares (2007 7.8 million Ordinary Shares) to satisfy awards 
under various share incentive plans. Of this number, 0.2 million Ordinary Shares were unconditionally vested at 31 
December 2008 (2007 0.2 million Ordinary Shares). At 31 December 2008, the SST held 0.9 million Ordinary Shares 
(2007 1.2 million Ordinary Shares) to satisfy awards made to UK based employees under an all employee share 
scheme. The market value of own Ordinary Shares held in trust, being in total 8.0 million Ordinary Shares (2007 
9.0 million Ordinary Shares), at 31 December 2008 was £2.9 million (2007 £5.6 million).
At 31 December 2008 the Company held no Ordinary Shares in treasury (2007 48.4 million). The market value of own 
Ordinary Shares held in treasury at 31 December 2007 was £30.0 million.
Cancellation of share premium and capital redemption reserves
On 24 November 2004, Spirent Communications plc was granted an order of the High Court for the approval of the 
cancellation of the share premium account and capital redemption reserve (the “Cancellation”) which stood at that  
date at £702.7 million and £0.7 million, respectively.
The Cancellation created a reserve in the financial statements of the Company which was applied to eliminate the deficit 
in distributable reserves. The balance of this reserve, created after the deficit in distributable reserves had been 
eliminated, was transferred to a special non-distributable reserve. During 2006 the Company transferred funds equal to 
the aggregate amount due to any creditors of Spirent Communications plc, who were creditors on 24 November 2004, 
and who still remained creditors, to a blocked trust account. Placing these funds in a blocked trust account in 
accordance with the undertakings made at the time of the Cancellation allowed the special reserve to be released to 
distributable reserves.
Capital redemption reserve
During 2008 the Company cancelled 174.2 million Ordinary Shares (2007 145.3 million) that had been the subject  
of the on-market share repurchase programme and tender offer and transferred £5.8 million (2007 £4.8 million) to the 
capital redemption reserve.
Capital reserve
In 2008 the reserve has been reduced by £2.2 million (2007 nil) in relation to share incentives which have been 
cancelled or have lapsed.
Share repurchase
During 2008 the Company repurchased 72.9 million Ordinary Shares on-market at a cost of £42.2 million (2007 
103.4 million at a cost of £66.8 million). In addition the Company undertook a tender offer whereby it repurchased 
52.9 million Ordinary Shares at a cost £24.8 million (2007 nil). All Ordinary Shares repurchased have been 
subsequently cancelled. 90

Independent auditors’ report to the members of 
Spirent Communications plc
We have audited the parent Company financial statements 
of Spirent Communications plc for the year ended 
31 December 2008 which comprise the Company balance 
sheet and the related notes 1 to 21 and the list of 
Principal divisions and subsidiaries. These parent 
Company financial statements have been prepared under 
the accounting policies set out therein. We have also 
audited the information in the Report on directors’ 
remuneration that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the Group financial 
statements of Spirent Communications plc for the year 
ended 31 December 2008. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as 
a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies 
Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the Company’s members those matters we 
are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, 
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the Company and the Company’s members as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions 
we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual 
Report, the Report on directors’ remuneration and the 
parent Company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable United Kingdom law and Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) 
are set out in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent Company financial 
statements and the part of the Report on directors’ 
remuneration to be audited in accordance with relevant 
legal and regulatory requirements and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent 
Company financial statements give a true and fair view 
and whether the parent Company financial statements and 
the part of the Report on directors’ remuneration to be 
audited have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in 
our opinion the information given in the Report of the 
directors is consistent with the financial statements. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company 
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not 
received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding 
directors’ remuneration and other transactions is  
not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report 
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited 
parent Company financial statements. The other 
information comprises only the Chairman’s statement,  
the Business review, the Board of directors, the Report of 
the directors, the Statement of directors’ responsibilities, 
the Directors’ statement on corporate governance, the 
unaudited part of the Report on directors’ remuneration, 
Financial history and Shareholder information. We 
consider the implications for our report if we become 
aware of any apparent misstatements or material 
inconsistencies with the parent Company financial 
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any 
other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the 
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, 
on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and 
disclosures in the parent Company financial statements 
and the part of the Report on directors’ remuneration to 
be audited. It also includes an assessment of the 
significant estimates and judgements made by the 
directors in the preparation of the parent Company 
financial statements, and of whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all 
the information and explanations which we considered 
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence 
to give reasonable assurance that the parent Company 
financial statements and the part of the Report on 
directors’ remuneration to be audited are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also 
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of 
information in the parent Company financial statements 
and the part of the Report on directors’ remuneration to 
be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
the parent Company financial statements give a true  •
and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of 
the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2008; 
the parent Company financial statements and the part  •
of the Report on directors’ remuneration to be audited 
have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 1985; and
the information given in the Report of the directors   •
is consistent with the parent Company  
financial statements.

Notes to the parent Company financial statements
1. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified for measurement of 
derivative financial instruments at fair value and in accordance with applicable UK law and UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles (UK GAAP).
As the Company is included in the consolidated financial statements, made up to 31 December each year, it is not 
required to present a separate profit and loss account as provided by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
New Accounting Standards
The Company has adopted Amendments to FRS 17 “Retirement Benefits” and the Amendment to FRS 26 and FRS 29 
“Reclassification of Financial Assets”. The adoption of these amendments had no impact on the net results or net 
assets of the Company.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. The carrying 
value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value 
may not be recoverable.
Purchased goodwill, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of assets acquired, is written off on a straight 
line basis from the date of acquisition over 20 years, being its anticipated useful life.
Tangible assets
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land. Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of all other assets, less residual 
value, on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives at rates which take into account commercial conditions at 
their location. Usual asset lives are as follows: 
Freehold buildings 50 years   
Plant and machinery 3 to 8 years  
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 
Building installations 20 years or lease period if less  
Fittings and equipment 3 to 8 years   
Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years   
Business systems software 4 years   
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment in periods if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Investments
Fixed asset investments, including investment in subsidiaries, are stated at cost and reviewed for impairment if there 
are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
Leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease on a straight line basis.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value. Cost includes all costs in bringing each 
product to its present location and condition, being the full manufacturing cost on a first-in-first-out basis, including all 
attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity. Net realisable value represents the selling price less further 
costs to be incurred to completion and on sale. 95

Trade and other debtors
Trade debtors, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an 
allowance for any uncollectable amounts. An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is 
no longer probable. Bad debts are written off when identified.
Provisions
Provisions are recorded when the Company has a present, legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event for 
which it is probable that it will be required to settle by an outflow of resources and for which a reliable estimate of the 
amount of the obligation can be made. Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the 
current best estimate.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision shall be the present value of the  
expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Company, the revenue can be reliably 
measured and when the Company has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership. In 
addition, revenue is only recognised when collectability is probable.
For the sale of services, revenue is recognised in accounting periods in which the service is rendered.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet 
date. All exchange profits and losses are taken to the profit and loss account.
Product development
Expenditure is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when it becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The 
Company’s policy is not to undertake any trading activity in financial instruments. Such derivative financial instruments 
are stated at fair value. 
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is 
entered into, and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at the reported balance sheet date. 
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is 
documented at its inception. This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the 
nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration. Such hedges are 
expected at inception to be highly effective. 96
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2008
Financial statements
1. Significant accounting policies continued
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are used to hedge foreign exchange exposures arising on forecast receipts 
and payments in foreign currencies. The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is calculated by 
reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to 
changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability; or cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to the 
variability in cash flows that is due to the risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction.
In relation to cash flow hedges (forward foreign currency exchange contracts) to hedge firm commitments or highly 
probable forecast transactions and which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the proportion of the gain or loss 
on the remeasurement of the fair value of the hedging instrument that is deemed to be effective is recognised in equity 
and the ineffective portion is recognised in the profit and loss account.
When the firm commitment or highly probable forecast transaction results in the recognition of an asset or liability, the 
associated gains and losses that have previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of 
the carrying amount of the asset or liability at the time the asset or liability is recognised.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken 
to the profit and loss account.
Gains or losses arising on hedging instruments, which are cancelled due to termination of the underlying exposure, are 
taken to the profit and loss account immediately.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when 
their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts.
Pensions
The Company operates two defined benefit pension plans for the benefit of employees. These plans require 
contributions to be made to separately administered funds, based on triennial actuarial valuations. Other plans are 
defined contribution in nature.
The assets of the defined benefit plans are measured at their market value at the balance sheet date and the liabilities 
of the plans are measured using the projected unit credit method. The discount rate used to measure the plans’ 
liabilities is the current rate of return on an AA corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liabilities. The 
extent to which the plans’ assets exceed or fall short of the plans’ liabilities is shown as a surplus or deficit in the 
balance sheet net of deferred tax.
The regular service cost of providing retirement benefits to employees in defined benefit plans is charged to operating 
profit in the year together with the cost of providing benefit improvements in respect of past service and gains or losses 
arising on settlements and curtailments.
A credit for the expected return on the plans’ assets and a charge for the increase during the period in the present value 
of the plans’ liabilities because the benefits are one year closer to settlement, are included in other finance income or 
expense in the profit and loss account. Differences arising between the actual and expected returns on the plans’ 
assets together with changes in the actuarial assumptions are included in the statement of total recognised gains  
and losses.
Contributions payable to the other defined contribution plans are charged to the profit and loss account in the year for 
which they are due.

Treasury shares       
Spirent Communications plc Ordinary Shares held by the Company are classified in shareholders’ equity as treasury 
shares and are recognised at cost and shown as a deduction from retained earnings. Consideration received for the 
sale of such Ordinary Shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the 
original cost being taken to retained earnings.       
       
Employee benefits       
When an employee has rendered service to the Company during an accounting period, short term benefits expected to 
be paid in exchange for that service are recognised in the same accounting period.     
  
Dividends paid        
The interim dividend is included in the financial statements in the period it is approved by the directors, and the final 
dividend in the period it is approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.     
  
Share-based payment       
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which 
they are granted. The fair value is determined using a binomial model.       
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised as a cost to the Company or as an addition to the cost of 
investment in the subsidiary in which the relevant employees work, over the vesting period of the equity-settled 
transactions with a corresponding adjustment to reserves. Any payments received from the Company’s subsidiaries in 
respect of these share-based payments result in a reduction in the cost of investment.     
  
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a 
market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided 
that all other vesting conditions are satisfied.       
       
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had 
not been modified. In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of 
the modification, as measured at the date of modification.       
       
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense 
not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled 
award and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated 
as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.    
   
The Company has an employee share trust for the granting of certain share incentives to employees. Shares are held by 
the  employee share trust, treated as treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity. 
      
Tax       
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.     
  
The tax currently payable represents the amount expected to be paid or recovered in respect of taxable profit for the 
year and is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.  
     
Deferred tax is provided on an undiscounted basis on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the 
balance sheet date except as referred to below. Amounts provided are calculated with reference to tax rates that are  
expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.      
 
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable 
taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.  98
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2008

1. Significant accounting policies continued
Deferred tax is not provided on gains on the disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, 
unless there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned. Provision will not be made where it is 
considered more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only 
when the replacement assets are sold.
2. Employees
Please refer to the Report on directors’ remuneration on pages 32 to 41 for disclosures relating to the emoluments, 
share incentives and long term incentive interests and pensions of the directors.
3. Pensions
Defined benefit plans
The defined benefit plans are in the United Kingdom and comprise the Spirent Communications plc Staff Pension & Life 
Assurance Plan (“Staff Plan”) and the Spirent Communications plc Retirement Cash & Life Assurance Plan (“Cash 
Plan”). These plans have been combined for the purposes of the following disclosures. There is in addition a UK 
unfunded plan.
The most recent actuarial valuation, at 1 April 2006, of the plans’ assets and the present value of the defined benefit 
plans’ obligations, using the projected unit credit method, have been used and updated by our independent actuaries.
i) The key financial assumptions used were:
       2008 2007 
       % %
Infl ation       3.0 3.4
Rate of increase in pensionable salaries     3.5 4.1
Rate of increase for pensions in payment pre 2001 service    3.6 3.6
Rate of increase for pensions in payment post 2001 pre April 2005 service   2.9 3.4
Rate of increase for pensions post April 2005 service    2.1 2.4
Rate of increase in deferred pensions     3.0 3.4
Rate used to discount plan liabilities     6.0 5.7
Expected rate of return on plan assets     5.2 5.9
Spirent Communications plc employs a building block approach in determining the long term rate of return on plan 
assets. Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns 
consistent with widely accepted capital market principles. The assumed long term rate of return on each class of asset 
is set out within this note. The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected 
return of each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the plans.
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements. The 
assumptions are such that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 21.7 years (2007 21.6 years) 
if they are male and for a further 24.0 years (2007 24.0 years) if they are female. For a member who retires in 2028 at 
age 65 the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 22.9 years (2007 22.8 years) after retirement if 
they are male and for a further 25.0 years (2007 25.0 years) after retirement if they are female.
The approximate impact to the past service liabilities of changing these main assumptions is as follows:
Reducing the discount rate by 0.1 per cent per annum. This would increase past service liabilities by £1.8 million. •
Increasing the life expectancy of a current 65 year old by one year (by modifying the standard mortality tables using  •
an appropriate scaling factor). This would increase past service liabilities by £3.1 million.
There will also be an impact on the future service cost but given the small active population in these plans this is likely 
to be insignificant.

The recognition of the surplus is restricted in both 2008 and 2007 to the present value of economic benefits available 
in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans. As a result only £2.1 million of 
the £2.8 million surplus has been recognised on the balance sheet at 31 December 2008. At 31 December 2007 only 
£3.0 million of the £7.7 million surplus was recognised.

The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised since 1 January 2003 in the Company’s statement of 
total recognised gains and losses is £12.4 million loss (2007 £11.3 million loss). The directors are unable to determine 
how much of the pension plan deficit recognised on 1 January 2003 and taken directly to equity of £41.9 million in the 
Company is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension plans. Consequently, the 
directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the 
Company’s statement of recognised gains and losses before 1 January 2003.

Expected cash contributions for 2009 for these plans are £0.3 million. 
     
The above plans are funded and have full UK HM Revenue & Customs tax-exempt approval. Certain members, whose  
salaries were in excess of the HM Revenue & Customs statutory earnings cap, have had their benefits increased 
through unapproved, unfunded arrangements, to the level that would otherwise have applied in respect of basic salary 
only. The  Company has contractually agreed to pay the additional retirement benefits itself and a provision is made in 
respect of this obligation in the balance sheet at 31 December 2008 of £0.6 million (2007 £0.7 million). This represents 
the actuarial value as confirmed by the Company’s pension advisers, of the unapproved benefit entitlements accrued at 
that date. The value is assessed and reviewed on a market value basis in line with the main plan valuation. There are no 
experience gains or losses on the unfunded plan in the period from 2004 to 2008.     
 
Defined contribution schemes      
The Company also maintains defined contribution pension plans for employees. Employer contributions into these plans 
for 2008 were £0.7 million (2007 £0.7 million).

Description of employee share plans
a) 2005 Employee Incentive Plan (“EIP”)
On 4 May 2005, Spirent shareholders approved the EIP to replace the now closed ESOS (see (c) below). The EIP is 
currently available for selected employees (including executive directors) on a similar discretionary basis as the ESOS 
and any awards will be subject to prior satisfactory individual performance. No price is payable on the grant of an award. 
The Company is able to grant share options, including HMRC approved options, share settled stock appreciation rights 
(“SARs”) and performance shares under the EIP.
In normal circumstances, EIP options or SARs vest three years following grant provided the Company’s earnings per 
share (“EPS”) growth targets have been met over the three year performance period.
In normal circumstances, EIP performance shares vest three years following grant provided the Company’s total 
shareholder return (“TSR”) targets have been met over the three year performance period. 
For further information on the performance conditions for EIP share incentives please see Section 5(d) of the Report on 
directors’ remuneration.
SARs granted under the EIP will deliver the appreciation value (ie the aggregated increase in market value of an Ordinary 
Share over the base price of the SAR) in the form of Ordinary Shares. This “SARs approach” will help the Company 
manage its dilution headroom more efficiently as only the SAR gain and not the entire share value needs to be funded. 
Using a SARs approach, it is not possible to determine the precise level of dilution until the SARs are exercised.
Options and SARs granted under the EIP expire on the tenth anniversary of their grant unless they have previously 
lapsed or have been exercised.
b) Spirent Stock Incentive Plan (“SSIP”)
The SSIP was introduced in 2000. This discretionary plan is primarily targeted at US employees with grants normally 
determined by reference to the seniority and contribution of the individual, together with the performance of the 
relevant business and prevailing local market practice. Under the SSIP, grants are also permitted to selected newly hired 
and promoted employees on a monthly basis.
At the Annual General Meeting held in May 2008, shareholders approved the extension of the SSIP until the Company’s 
2009 Annual General Meeting. The current shareholder approved mandate regarding the annual dilution rate is  
0.5 per cent of the issued Ordinary Share capital for both the SSIP and EIP (see (a) above) in aggregate.
Most awards made pursuant to the SSIP vest over four years, provided that the participant remains in employment. 
Vesting is not subject to a performance condition. Awards normally become 25 per cent exercisable on the first 
anniversary of the date of grant and thereafter in equal proportions on a monthly basis over a further 36 months. Any 
award not exercised by the seventh anniversary of grant will lapse.
The vesting of the SSIP awards made to Bill Burns, prior to his appointment as Chief Executive Officer, and to certain 
other key senior managers within the Communications group, are subject to the Company meeting EPS growth targets 
over the vesting periods. For further details on these performance conditions please see Section 5(d) of the Report on 
directors’ remuneration.
No price is payable on the grant of options or SARs and no options or SARs have been, or can be, granted at a discount 
to the market price.
c) 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme (“ESOS”) 
The ESOS is now closed (however outstanding options may still be exercised) and has been replaced by the EIP referred 
to in (a) above.
Notes to the parent Company financial statements continued 109
Spirent Communications plc
Annual Report 2008
Financial statements
16. Capital and reserves continued
Awards under the ESOS, normally determined annually, were at the sole discretion of the Remuneration Committee after 
considering recommendations made to it by the Chief Executive Officer. No price was payable on the grant of an option 
and no options were granted at a discount to the market price.
The normal exercise period for options granted under the ESOS is between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of 
grant. Options awarded under the ESOS were subject to the achievement of an EPS performance condition before they 
could be exercised.
During 2008, all remaining share options awarded under the ESOS passed their EPS performance conditions and are 
now exercisable until they expire on the tenth anniversary of the their respective grant dates, or in the case of 
terminated participants 12 months from the date of termination.
d) UK Savings Related Share Option Scheme (“SRSOS”) and 2005 Sharesave Scheme 
The SRSOS closed in 2005 and was replaced by the 2005 Sharesave Scheme. SRSOS options which remain 
outstanding may still be exercised prior to expiry, however no further grants can be made. Both schemes operate as 
HMRC approved Save-As-You-Earn schemes and are open to all UK employees, subject to a qualifying service period. 
Any future sharesave invitations will be made under the 2005 Sharesave Scheme, which is broadly similar to  
the SRSOS.
The employee enters into a Save-As-You-Earn contract with the Company’s savings carrier to save a regular sum of 
between £5 and £250 per month for a fixed period of either three or five years.
No price is payable on the grant of an option. The option exercise price is calculated by reference to the middle market 
closing price of an Ordinary Share on the business day prior to the beginning of the invitation period, discounted by up 
to 20 per cent at the Board’s discretion. Options are normally exercisable within six months of the third, fifth or seventh 
anniversary of the contract commencement date, as elected by the option holder at the start of the contract.
The Company operates the SST to honour the contractual commitment to deliver Ordinary Shares against the exercise  
of outstanding options under the SRSOS and Spirent Sharesave Trust Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spirent 
Communications plc, acts as sole trustee of the SST. During the year, 0.3 million Ordinary Shares were transferred  
to participants (2007 0.6 million).
No invitations have been made under either of these schemes since 2003. 110

17. Share-based payment
The total charge for the year relating to employee share-based payment plans is as follows:
       2008 2007 
       £ million £ million
1995 Executive Share Option Scheme     0.1 0.3 
2005 Employee Incentive Plan      0.2 –
All employee share plans      0.1 0.1
       0.4 0.4
All schemes are equity settled.
The fair value of share incentives is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial model. The following table gives the 
assumptions made in arriving at the share-based payment charge:
       2008 2007
Weighted average share price (pence)     25.0 61.0 
Weighted average fair value (pence)     34.0 24.0 
Expected volatility (%)      45.0 40.0
Expected life (years)       4.5 4.5
Risk free rate (%)       3.7 4.7
Dividend yield (%)       2.0 nil
The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the previous  
two years which management considers to be the period which is likely to be most representative of future volatility.  
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of  
non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. For performance shares granted under the 2005 
Employee Incentive Plan, which have a market based performance condition, it has been assumed that there will be  
30 per cent vesting for valuation purposes.
18. Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 8 “Related Party Disclosures” in relation to disclosing 
transactions with its subsidiaries.
19. Subsidiaries 
A list of the significant investments in subsidiaries, including the name, country of incorporation and proportion of 
ownership interest is given on page 111 of this Annual Report.
20. Capital commitments and contingent liabilities
There were no capital commitments at 31 December 2007 or 31 December 2008.
Spirent Communications plc has provided indemnities of £0.5 million (2007 £0.4 million) for certain ongoing business 
obligations under letters of credit for subsidiary companies.

Dividends
Shareholders are able to choose how they receive their 
dividends:
direct to their bank account; •
reinvested in Ordinary Shares; •
paid by cheque; or •
paid in foreign currencies. •
The quickest and most efficient way to receive your 
dividends is to have them paid direct to your bank 
account. It saves waiting for funds to clear and reduces 
the paper and postage we use. To change how you receive 
your dividends either log on to www.shareview.co.uk or 
contact the Company’s registrar, Equiniti.
Dividend reinvestment plan
The Company has introduced a Dividend Reinvestment 
Plan (“DRIP”) provided by Equiniti Financial Services

their cash dividend to buy additional shares in the 
Company, so increasing their shareholding. Additional 
information, including details of how to participate, 
can be obtained from the Company’s website at 
www.spirent.com and from Equiniti on 0871 384 2623.
Electronic communications
At its 2008 AGM the Company passed a resolution 
allowing it to communicate with shareholders by means 
of the Company’s website and an invitation to sign up for 
this method of communication will be sent to 
shareholders with the 2009 AGM documentation. 
Electronic communications provide significant benefits 
for shareholders and the Company in terms of timeliness 
of information, reduced environmental impact and cost 
and the Board would encourage investors to participate 
in the programme.

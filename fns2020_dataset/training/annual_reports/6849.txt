Results
It is my welcome task to report a very good set of figures for the
52 weeks to 29 April 2007. The results this year include a first
time contribution of 34 weeks from Hardys & Hansons, which we
acquired in September 2006, and a full year from Belhaven, which
includes 22 weeks of non-comparable trading. All profit figures in
this statement are shown before exceptional items.
Our revenue for the year increased by 12% to £917.5m and
operating profit by 14% to £218.1m. We therefore raised our
profit margin once again and it now stands at 23.8%. I am
particularly pleased that all four of our trading divisions produced
profit figures which were ahead of last year’s, as this underlines
the strength we draw from our business model.
Profit before tax and exceptional items increased by 17% to
£139.8m and our earnings per share by 16% to 64.8p. This is the
thirteenth successive year in which we have delivered compound
annual growth in earnings per share of 10 per cent or more.
Dividend
The board has taken the decision to increase the total dividend for
the year by 14% which will help to raise the yield for
shareholders. We recommend a final dividend payment of 16.45p
which will produce a total dividend of 22.9p for the year. If
approved, the final dividend will be paid on 10 September to those
shareholders on the register at the close of business on 3 August. 
Acquisition
We acquired Hardys & Hansons plc on 5 September last year. They
had a long history as an integrated brewer and pub company,
based at Kimberley in Nottinghamshire, and their assets included
268 pubs, of which 83 were run under management and 185 as
tenancies or leaseholds. Many Hardys & Hansons people have
joined our business, and have been welcomed to contribute
towards our future success, and the properties have now been
fully integrated into our estate.
Disposal
As part of the continual process of wanting to improve the quality
of our trading assets, we have sold 191 pubs during the year. This
included one particular package of 155 properties, which were
widely spread across our trading area and raised £56.5m.
The board
We have two new members of the board this year. Ian Durant
joined us as a non-executive director in March and has become a
member of our audit committee. He formerly served as finance
director for two different listed companies in the Jardine
Matheson group and was more recently chief financial officer of
Sea Containers Ltd. We look forward to benefiting greatly from his
broad property, retail and financial experience.
In April we appointed Jonathan Lawson as managing director of
our local pubs division. This followed our decision to split Pub
Company into two specialist divisions, to provide more focus to
the business and to allow the potential further expansion of our
managed estate without prejudicing our flat line management
structure. Jonathan was retail operations director of Sainsbury’s
convenience stores and will, we believe, bring a valuable fresh
perspective to running our local pubs.
These two arrivals followed two departures. I thanked Alan
Bowkett for his service as a non-executive director in last year’s
report and he left after the AGM. I would now like to do the same
for Mark Angela, who was managing director of Pub Company
until leaving us in April this year. Mark was with us for just over
three years, during which time our managed estate expanded
greatly, particularly through the acquisition of the Laurel pubs in
2004. I would like to thank him for his contribution to the
continued success of our Pub Company during his time with us.
People
Our business is all about people and we have a huge number of
very good people. Some have worked for the company for many
years and some have joined in the last year, but everyone’s
efforts towards the well-being and success of Greene King are
fully appreciated and crucial to our future. I would like to thank all
of our people for being part of a proud and determined team.
GREENE KING ANNUAL REPORT 2006/07 
TIM BRIDGE
CHAIRMAN
2 July 2007  CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
INCORPORATING THE BUSINESS REVIEW
5
Once again, Greene King’s results for the financial year 2006/7
show strong growth right across our businesses. Revenue was up
12%, operating profit up 14% and profit before tax up 17%. As
throughout this document, the profit figures are shown before
exceptional items. This result has delivered adjusted earnings per
share up 16% to 64.8p, and has allowed the board to recommend
a full-year dividend up 14% to 22.9p.
We have thus continued our run of uninterrupted earnings
growth, which has spanned over four decades.
We aim to achieve sustainable, consistent growth in organic sales,
and in the value of our assets, augmented by appropriate
acquisitions at the right price. We focus on the efficiency of our
operations, and our success in this area allows us both to reinvest
in the business and to continue to grow margins.
We strive continually to evolve our offer to meet customers’ ever-
growing demands. Our focus is always on our customers, and our
approach is built on developing and leveraging our key assets to
meet their expectations: a high-quality estate, first-rate people,
and strong brands and trading formats.
With our largely freehold estate, we focus primarily on suburban
and community sites rather than the more volatile high street. We
will continue to evaluate appropriate acquisition opportunities
and attractive individual sites. Actively managing our property
portfolio is central to our business. As well as expanding the
estate, we churn regularly to uphold and improve the average
standard. Having both managed and tenanted/leased divisions
means we can also transfer sites both ways between these
business models, to optimise their individual potential.
We place great value on recruiting the best pub managers and
area managers, and on developing long-term partnerships with
tenants and lessees. It was a particular pleasure this year that in
the Association of Licensed Multiple Retailers’ area management
awards, Greene King managers were the winners in both the
managed and tenanted/leased classes. The team, from the board
down, features a blend of talents and diverse career backgrounds,
which combine to make a formidable force in the market. 
The Greene King brand is a powerful asset, both with consumers
and in the trade – representing all that is good not only in real ale,
but also in the great British pub. This year, we demonstrated our
commitment to it by taking our brand onto prime time television,
with our ‘Sign of a Great Pub’ sponsorship of ITV1’s Ant & Dec’s
Saturday Night Takeaway. We have long believed that there is a
vital role both for branded outlets, such as our Hungry Horse family
value pubs; and a diverse set of individual locals. At the end of the
GREENE KING ANNUAL REPORT 2006/07  financial year we formalised this distinction, and better positioned
both strands for further growth, by creating two new divisions from
our managed estate: Destination Pubs and Local Pubs.
We are heavy investors in advertising and other brand marketing.
This, alongside our rigorous quality standards, enables us to ensure
that our ale brands continue to trade at a premium to the market. 
Pub Company
During 2006/7, we had an average of 781 managed pubs trading
in England and Wales in our Pub Company division. A combination
of strong organic growth, targeted investment, the Hardys &
Hansons acquisition, estate churn and careful cost control has
delivered strong profit growth.
Operating profit rose 8% to £110.7m on revenue up 6% at £546.0m. 
Total like-for-like sales were 3.4% ahead, continuing our record
over a number of years of steady, sustainable sales growth. We do
not chase sales growth for its own sake, but seek to build
customer loyalty and margin.
The operating profit margin was 20.3%, an improvement of 0.5
percentage points on 2005/6, continuing our long run of margin
growth, despite major cost pressures during the year, especially in
energy and Sky TV.
In the run-up to the smoking ban, we have pursued further
development programmes for our mealtime, late-evening food, soft
drinks and wine ranges, and added branded coffee offers in many
outlets, and improved the quality of our outside trading areas.
Within Pub Company, we invested £20.8m in some 70 major
property improvements. Additionally, £12.6m went on
maintenance capex, with a further £8.5m spent on repairs from
the revenue account. These figures exclude the investments we
have made in facilities relating specifically to the smoking ban.
Pub Company began the financial year with 761 pubs. 83 pubs
were added from the Hardys & Hansons estate, 32 pubs were
divested and 21 transferred to Pub Partners, as part of our
ongoing programme of estate re-balancing. 5 were transferred to
Belhaven and 2 were acquired. The closing balance was therefore
788 sites, segmented as follows: 
In March we won The Publican’s ‘Pub Company of the Year’ award.
This is the third time our managed division has won the accolade.
It is a great testament to the quality of our business, and the
efforts of all our employees.
The number of managed pubs in Greene King has risen by over
50% since 2000. At the end of the financial year, we re-shaped
our managed houses business, creating two new divisions. This
move creates headroom for potential further growth, while
retaining a flat management structure and keeping the whole
organisation as close as possible to the customer. It has been
achieved without any increase in cost. The new divisions are:
• Destination Pubs (278 sites): focused on branded or strongly-
formatted pubs, most of which are food-intensive. This division
is led by Jonathan Webster, formerly chief executive of Hardys
& Hansons.
• Local Pubs (510 sites): focused on community, town-local and
town-traditional pubs, where more decision-making on the
‘feel’ and activities of the outlet will be devolved to local level,
to reflect their individual markets. To lead this division,
Jonathan Lawson joins us from Sainsbury’s Local, where he was
instrumental in delivering top-line growth through
entrepreneurialism among local store managers.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
INCORPORATING THE BUSINESS REVIEW
Pub Partners
Pub Partners is our tenanted and leased pubs division in England
and Wales. Underlying sales growth, margin management and
churning of the estate have combined to deliver a 6%
improvement in operating profits per pub. This, together with the
effect of an additional 107 pubs trading on average in the division,
has delivered operating profit growth of 15% year on year.
The operating profit of £74.7m was on revenue up 10% to £164.0m.
The operating profit margin was 45.5%, up 2.2 percentage points on
the previous year. Like-for-like sales rose 1.7%.
A total of £10.8m was invested across the Pub Partners estate,
including 55 major investments started in the year. An additional
£5.7m went on maintenance capex, and £4.6m on repairs from
the revenue account. These figures exclude additional monies
spent by licensees.
At the start of the financial year, 1,353 pubs were trading. The
Hardys & Hansons acquisition brought 185 more sites, and 21
pubs transferred in from Pub Company. We also sold the 142 pubs
which we felt were most exposed to the smoking ban, well ahead
of the ban. The closing balance was therefore 1,417 pubs.
An average of 1,431 sites traded over the year, 94% of them
bearing Greene King branding. Almost 80% are tenanted, with the
balance on a lease agreement. In both business models we are
aiming to build partnerships, and lead the industry in terms of
support and ways of working. This was acknowledged in the
Morning Advertiser annual survey (September 2006), where our
area managers scored the highest in terms of receiving an
‘excellent’ rating, and we were seen as making the most effort to
‘become a better partner‘ by licensees. 
To capture more sales in wines, spirits and minerals we have
introduced a new tenancy agreement which gives even more
attractive prices on these products. We are making more sites
available for lease, to attract a greater number of entrepreneurial
licensees. To retain control over the quality of the asset and the
trading style adopted by the licensee, we have launched a new
lease agreement, assignable only after four years.
We have provided extensive support to tenants to help them
prepare for the smoking ban, with an assisted purchase scheme
for smoking shelters, and provision of assistance with marketing
and planning applications.
Brewing Company
Brewing Company is our brand management, brewing and
distribution business in England and Wales. Following a very
strong second half performance, revenue was up 4% on the
previous year, to £91.1m, while operating profit was up 12% to
£23.0m. The operating profit margin was therefore 25.2%, an
improvement of 1.8 percentage points from 2005/6.
Our brand strategy leads on Greene King IPA in the on-trade and
Old Speckled Hen in the off-trade – each supported by the other;
by our other main brands Abbot Ale and Ruddles; and by an
extensive portfolio of specialist and seasonal ales. Both Greene
King IPA and Old Speckled Hen further grew their market shares,
and total own-brewed volume was up 2.1% against a beer market
down by -1.7%* and an ale market down by -7%*.
Greene King IPA, Britain’s No. 1 cask ale, became the Official Beer
of England Rugby in October. We are delighted to have Greene
King IPA associated with rugby in the year of the rugby World
Cup. The launch of Greene King IPA Chilled provides access to the
growing category of extra cold beer. 
Old Speckled Hen, the best-selling premium ale in supermarkets,
was re-launched in a new livery and bottle. In the on-trade, the
gravity was lowered to 4.5% ABV, to build distribution and rate of
sale. The results have been encouraging, with the brand growing
7% last year in the on-trade.

Belhaven
* 2005/6 numbers on pro-forma basis
Belhaven’s results were comfortably ahead of our expectations in
2005 when Greene King acquired the Scottish business, and we
are particularly encouraged by Belhaven’s strong finish to the
financial year.
Belhaven’s revenue, trading profit and trading profit margin all
grew year on year, a significant achievement in the first year of
the Scottish smoking ban.
Each part of Belhaven contributed to the success. Belhaven’s
brewing business significantly outperformed competitors with
on-trade beer volumes up 2.2% on the preceding year in a market
which was down by 7.2%. Belhaven brand sales volumes were up
2.4% with Belhaven Best, Scotland’s on-trade market leading
draught ale, improving volume by 5.6%.
Belhaven’s managed pubs grew both sales and margin. A
combination of new openings and over 25% growth in food sales
compensated for a slight decline in beer sales and machine income.
The tenanted/leased business also performed well, and benefited
further from estate churn and improved wholesale beer margins. 
26 pubs were added during the financial year mainly through
single site acquisitions and there were 17 disposals of smaller,
lower-quality units, leaving the estate at the close of the year at
299 houses (200 tenanted / leased and 99 managed).
Hardys & Hansons
On 5 September we completed the acquisition of Hardys &
Hansons plc. The acquisition brought us 268 sites: 83 managed
and 185 tenanted. 97% of the jobs at Hardys & Hansons were
retained. Most of the pubs are in the East Midlands, which is adjacent
to our heartland; and the acquisition has extended our core territory
in a very efficient way from a sales and distribution perspective. I
described it at the time as a “hand-in-glove fit” and so indeed it has
proved. At the time of the deal, we estimated £5m annual synergies,
£3m of them in the first full year. Capture of these synergies is on
track. Additionally, we are now gaining operational know-how about
the running of larger-format food pubs. I am delighted that Jonathan
Webster accepted my invitation to stay with Greene King and lead
our new Destination Pubs division.
Disposal of 155 pubs
On 1 December, we completed the sale of 155 pubs to Admiral
Taverns, for the sum of £56.5m. These pubs generated historic
pre-overhead EBITDA of £5.3m. Along with the deal, we secured
an attractive beer supply agreement with Admiral for their entire
estate in England. We will continue to dispose of, as well as to
acquire, sites in a timely manner and at the right price, in order to
optimise the quality of our estate.
Capital efficiency
We are committed to maximising value to shareholders through a
combination of acquisitions, organic investment and return of
surplus funds. Key to this is finding the appropriate balance
between retaining financial flexibility on the one hand, and
driving balance sheet efficiency on the other. Due to the strong
cash generation of our business, and the changes we have made
to our debt structure, our fixed charge cover currently stands at
2.8x, which we believe is now sub-optimal.
We therefore intend to move towards fixed charge cover of 2.3x
over the next twelve to eighteen months. This ratio we will
continue to keep under close review.
Of the funds thus generated, we intend to return at least £100m to
shareholders in financial year 2007/8, in the form of share buy-
backs, additional to the £28m of buy-backs already executed this
financial year. The balance will be available to fund a combination of
further acquisitions, on which we have a strong track record of value-
creative deals; organic investment; and the return of additional
funds to shareholders in the form of further share buy-backs.
Unlocking property value
Greene King has in place a securitisation arrangement covering
1,632, or 65%, of our pubs, representing EBITDA of £165.4m.
There remain, therefore, 872 or 35% of our pubs outside the
securitisation arrangement.

GREENE KING ANNUAL REPORT 2006/07   The board has reviewed in detail a wide range of options to
maximise the value release from these unsecuritised assets,
including a separate Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), an
extension of the existing securitisation, and the creation of an
‘OpCo/PropCo’ structure with a joint-venture partner. 
The board believes that an OpCo/PropCo structure with a joint-
venture partner for all or a proportion of the unsecuritised part of
the estate may deliver the best balance between realising value
and retaining some operational control. With the right joint-
venture partner, and on the right terms, we believe that we could
benefit from additional skills and disciplines which will further
help us to unlock property value from our estate. Assuming the
right conditions, we would anticipate a transaction during the
course of this financial year. Throughout this process, we remain
committed to achieving and maintaining balance sheet efficiency.
The smoking ban in England
The smoking ban in enclosed public spaces in England has now
come into effect. Although it is too early to measure actual
results, we believe we are very well placed both to meet the
challenges and to capitalise on the opportunities presented by
the ban, for the following reasons:
• We have high-quality sites, over 95% of which have usable
exterior areas
• Our preparations for the ban have stretched over a number of
years, gradually introducing non-smoking areas and building
‘smoking solutions’ into developments
• We have also over a number of years been broadening both our
customer base among women and families, and our sales mix to
elevate the importance of food 
• Our exposure to all major trade channels in Scotland means we
have been able to ‘learn in advance’ and adapt plans from
Belhaven’s experiences
• Specific actions preparatory to the ban, including the
installation of smoking shelters and marketing and
communications programmes, have been delivered on schedule.
In total we will have spent £10m on smoking ban projects
Current trading and outlook
Trading in the first eight weeks of the current financial year has
been in line with our expectations. Total like-for-like sales in our
managed houses in England and Wales were up 1%; underlying
total like-for-like sales, excluding the World Cup effect, were up by
3%. Like-for-like sales at Pub Partners were up 1%, while Brewing
Company's own-brewed volume sales were up 6%. Belhaven Best
sales were up 6%.
We are well prepared for the smoking ban, which has just come
into force in England. The actions we have taken, combined with
the quality and positioning of our estate, will enable us to meet
the challenge and to grasp the opportunity, as we widen our
customer base.
We are confident that we will continue to deliver a strong
performance throughout the course of the year.
The intrinsic quality of our assets, combined with the talents of
our team, and the benefit of recent acquisitions, provide exciting
opportunities to deliver further underlying growth in the future.
Furthermore, our plans to release capital from our balance sheet
and to unlock value from our property estate will generate
substantial additional value for our shareholders.

GREENE KING ANNUAL REPORT 2006/07 
We are pleased to report strong revenue growth to £917.5m, an
increase of 12% on last year, and, through improving margins,
operating profit growth to £218.1m, an increase of 14% on last
year, which are covered in the chairman’s statement and chief
executive’s review. In combination with further improvements in
financing, our profit before tax and exceptional items has grown
to £139.8m delivering adjusted earnings per share of 64.8p, an
increase of 16%. As the graph below shows, it is equally pleasing
to see that adjusted earnings per share have continued the
growth trend and now represents the 13th consecutive year of
growth at a compound rate in excess of 10% per year. The
strength of the trading performance underpins the proposed final
dividend of 16.45p per share to give a full year dividend of 22.9p
per share, an increase of 14%. At the end of the year, we remain
well placed for the future with fixed charge cover at 2.8 times.
*All years adjusted for 2-for-1 share split in September 2005.
2004 and earlier years are reported under UK GAAP ruling at the
time. 2005 and later years are reported under IFRS.
Continued investment
We have invested over £90m into our existing business over the
year, including £45.4m on pub developments and preparations for
the smoking ban in England and Wales, and £21.5m on ensuring
that our estate remains in good condition through ongoing repairs
and maintenance.
Cash flow growth
We continue to focus on delivering strong cash flows. Net
cashflow from operating activities of £172.2m was over £50m
higher than this time last year, from higher operating profits as
well as strong working capital management. After funding the
dividends and continued investment in the estate, we had £50m
of positive cashflow.
Acquisitions
We acquired the entire issued share capital of Hardys & Hansons
plc on 5 September 2006 for a consideration of £270m, as
covered in the chairman’s statement and chief executive’s
review. This was funded through a combination of very
competitive bank debt and a loan note alternative of £102.9m.
We are pleased with the integration, performance and synergy
capture to-date.
Belhaven, acquired in October 2005, has exceeded our
expectations as an acquisition, both operationally and on the
synergy capture front, beating the target of £3m in its first full
year of operation to be overall ahead of plan.
Disposals
As part of our ongoing churn policy, a package of 155 pubs was
sold to Admiral Taverns in December 2006 for £56.5m, achieving
a good 10.7 times pre-central overhead EBITDA and realising a
profit of £15m. This allows us to focus on higher opportunity food
businesses and smoking-ban insulated sites.
Share purchases
During the year, we purchased 1.0m shares for our employee
benefit trust at an average price of 941p per share as part of
our ongoing support for employees to exercise share options.
In addition, we have returned £34m to shareholders through
the repurchase for cancellation of 3.1m shares at an average
price of 1076p per share, representing 2.0% of the issued
share capital.
Financing, property and treasury
Our strong business strategy and high quality freehold estate
allowed the issuance of £600m gross securitised bond finance in
March 2005, and in May 2006 a further £550m gross securitised
bond finance was raised as a tap of the original securitisation. We
used these funds to repay existing bank facilities and to fund the
early redemption of the debentures. With interest rate hedging to
fix 96% of our debt, this gives us a strong and efficient balance
sheet with blended interest rate of 5.7%.
There remains 872, or 35%, of our pubs outside of the
securitisation vehicle. As covered in the chief executive’s review,
the board remains committed to finding the right balance
between financial flexibility and driving balance sheet efficiency
to allow continued maximisation of value to shareholders. With
this aim in mind, and in addition to the share buy-back programme
covered below, we anticipate being able to put an OpCo/PropCo
structure, with a joint venture partner, into place during the
1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007

FINANCIAL REVIEW
IAN BULL
FINANCE DIRECTOR
2 July 2007
current financial year, subject to favourable market conditions.
The proceeds will be used to return further funds to shareholders
or fund further acquisitions.
We have also worked closely with our banking partners to put 
into place a 5-year bank borrowing facility of £550m which not
only demonstrates the confidence the eight banks have in Greene
King but also gives a reduction in rates against our existing
syndicated facility. 
At the end of the year, our net debt of £1,435.5m was higher by
£188.8m over the same time last year. Without the investment in
Hardys & Hansons plc and the share buy-backs, net debt would
have been reduced by £120.9m.
Capital efficiency
With the agreed net debt/EBITDA covenants and fixed charge
cover, we continue to be able to financially support the business
strategy and growth with the strength and flexibility of the
balance sheet, to the extent that our fixed charge cover at year
end is too conservative at 2.8 times. We therefore intend to move
towards a fixed charge cover of 2.3 times, over the next twelve to
eighteen months. 
We will return up to £100m of the funds generated to
shareholders by way of share buy-back, in addition to the £28m
already returned in the new financial year. The balance will be
available for a combination of organic investment, further
acquisitions and further share buy-backs.
Pensions
The group maintains a defined contribution scheme, open to all
new employees and a number of defined benefit schemes, which
are all closed to new entrants. The net pension liability now
stands at £40.2m (£50.2m last year).
Summary
We are pleased with another year of strong growth operationally
and financially, and have continued to invest in and grow both our
core business and acquisitions as well as to harvest profitable
assets. Long term financing at competitive rates, combined with
our healthy operational cash flows, asset backed business model
and strong, flexible balance sheet, gives us both options and
confidence in the future and the opportunity to return funds to
shareholders, in what will no doubt be a big year of transition for
the industry. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
15
GREENE KING ANNUAL REPORT 2006/07 
Taking our corporate responsibilities seriously not only makes
good business sense but also helps foster a reputation as a good
corporate citizen. We believe we have made good progress over
the last few years and we continue to explore further ways in
which we can ensure that we act in a socially responsible manner
throughout the business.
Environment
At a time of great public interest in global warming, considerable
focus has been placed on how we can reduce our carbon emissions.
To do that we need to understand the amount of power we use.
Accordingly, over 700 remote-read electricity meters have been
installed in our managed pubs throught the UK in the last 12
months. A range of initiatives has also been introduced to reduce
electricity consumption, from energy packs which turn off
equipment and lights when a pub is closed to a "turn it off"
campaign aimed at our staff. In addition, 25,000 ordinary light bulbs
have been replaced with low-energy versions. Across our managed
pubs these measures have produced a saving equivalent to 19m
KwH or 10,000 tonnes of carbon. Our tenants are encouraged to
participate in similar programmes through the provision of advice,
energy saving stickers and the ability to purchase low-energy light
bulbs in our share and save programme.
We are now working on an energy policy which will define the
actions to be taken when we refit pubs, so that the design
incorporates the latest energy conservation technology for
cookers, fridges, boilers, air conditioning and insulation and such
like, where they can be shown to have cost benefits over the life-
cycle of the equipment. Gas usage has also been targetted – in
Scotland alone gas usage improvement is running at 12%,
achieved by reducing the use of central heating and making
better use of catering equipment. 
Water consumption in our managed pubs has also been a key
focus area in the last 12 months. Over 150 remote-read water
meters have been installed and initiatives introduced to ensure
early identification of leaks. Pubs are set targets for usage so that
water wastage can be minimised and water saving equipment
has been installed. Approximately one-third of our pubs have so
far been covered, reducing our annual water consumption by over
180,000 cubic metres.
In Bury St Edmunds, where our brewing operations and head
office are based, we reduced our electricity consumption by
430,000 kWh, our gas consumption by more than 320,000 kWh
and our CO
2
emissions by more than 850 tonnes, as a result of
greater focus on the efficient use of boilers, the reduction of
leaks, improved insulation in our production areas and initiatives
such as a "turn it off" campaign for our head office. The energy
required to produce each packaged barrel is now 20% lower than
it was at the start of the year, whilst our head office used 13%
less electricity than the prior year.
In Bury St Edmunds effluent is discharged into the public sewer
under consent from the local water treatment company. As a
result of a focus on reducing losses and revised programmes to
use the minimum amount of water without compromising quality,
the volume of effluent produced was 29,000 cubic metres, or
11%, less than last year. The effluent is monitored and
procedures and equipment are in place to minimise and contain
any possible spillages to the ground or storm drain around our
production areas.
Investment has also been made in the Belhaven brewery, to
enable it to minimise waste. Measuring systems have been
installed and procedures to identify and repair leaks have been
enhanced. Tight control of the combined heat and power plant
has led to a reduction of 26% over the prior year in the annual
gas consumption. Carbon emissions have been reduced by over
700 tonnes as a result of this and of careful control of brewing
tank temperatures.
Fuel emissions have been reduced by the installation of our own
bottling line at Old Speckled Hen Hall, on the outskirts of Bury St
Edmunds. This has enable us to remove more than 400
movements per year of road tankers (or 170,000 road miles) to
other bottling companies across the UK.
Production waste materials are, wherever possible, used in an
environmentally friendly manner. Spent grain from our brewing
process is sold as animal feed, and in 2006 over 2,700 tonnes
of surplus yeast slurry were also converted to animal feed or
sold to the makers of Marmite, compared with over 1,000
tonnes last year. Over 100 tonnes of office waste were recycled
during the year (a 100% increase compared with last year) and
a number of initiatives, including the on-line application system
for Pub Partners, have reduced paper usage. 
Conservation of the flood meadows in Bury St Edmunds continues.
A responsible attitude to alcohol and visiting pubs
It is fundamental to us that we should continue to promote our
beers responsibly. We aim to celebrate real beer by promoting its
taste and flavour as opposed to its bulk consumption, with
campaigns such as 'Beer with Food Week', and our ‘Beer To Dine
For’ campaign. Our promotional materials carry clear and concise
messages encouraging the responsible consumption of alcohol.
Our advertisements are not designed to appeal to under 18s and
none of our brand advertising focuses on the alcoholic strength of 16
GREENE KING ANNUAL REPORT 2006/07 
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
the beer, suggests any association with bravado or aggressive
behaviour, nor implies that consumption can lead to social or
sexual success. 
We remain a key supporter of the Publican trade magazine's
'Proud of Pubs' campaign, in which pubs pledge not to serve
underage drinkers or anyone who is drunk, to support our local
communities and respect local residents and businesses. In our
managed pubs we support the 'Challenge 21' initiative, track
attempts by under-age drinkers to order alcoholic drinks and
operate a proof-of-age scheme; ‘all you can drink’ promotions and
heavily discounted prices are not a feature of our managed pubs.
We train our retail staff on how to manage difficult situations in a
calm, safe and considered manner and provide security training
for all our new managers. Security systems, including CCTV, are in
place in all our English managed pubs, backed up by central
monitoring systems in 240 of them. 90% of our managed pubs
participate in the local Pub Watch scheme, an initiative designed
to promote a safer environment for people to work and socialise in.
We encourage our tenanted and leased pubs to follow our lead in
this area. All such pubs have received Challenge 21 posters, check
ID stickers and training guidance for staff.
Smoking
Both our managed and tenanted/leased divisions have developed
training and operational guidance so that pubs can ensure that
they become smoke-free and clean environments for both
employees and customers. All sites have received regular
communications to highlight the changes in the law and been
supplied with the legislative guidance and official signage.
Alongside this we have developed a kit to enable our pubs to
conform to the changes more easily with sensitive reminders to
customers on table tent cards and toilet posters.
We banned smoking at the bar in all our managed houses 18
months ago and banned smoking back of house completely from
10 June, to prepare our employees for the changes in advance
of 1 July.
In Scotland our management team effected a seamless transition
to smoke-free pubs. Wherever possible external areas were
created to provide our customers with as much shelter and
comfort as possible. Training programmes for staff and clear
signage for customers resulted in total compliance with the new
legislation in all our managed and tenanted houses, with the
exception of one or two minor incidents.  Employees
We have a clear understanding of the need to recruit and retain
talented staff if we are to meet our aim of being the best pub and
beer company in the UK. With best quality customer service being
a key priority, we focus closely on the training of all customer-
facing employees. A set of common values applies to all our
employees, from senior managers to bar staff, and we have
policies on a range of issues from equal opportunities to flexible
working. Employees have the opportunity to express their views
and receive information about the company on a regular basis. 
All our employees are offered access to a stakeholder-compliant
defined contribution pension scheme. Many of our employees
have benefited from the range of employee share schemes on
offer, including a sharesave scheme open to all and a profit-sharing
scheme open to employees with the requisite qualifying service. 
Tenants
Pub Partners prides itself on providing the best possible support
to tenants to help them succeed with their businesses. 1800
licensees were trained during the year, on courses covering
subjects ranging from finance, marketing and cellar management
to health and safety and security. New training programmes are
constantly being introduced. Over 200 licensees were trained in
our Go for Growth campaign, and our share and save programme
provides real benefits to our tenants in areas such as electricity,
food, credit card machines and furniture. 
We believe there should be a fair division of the economic profit
in our tenanted houses and so we charge commercial market
rents, raised annually in line with RPI and with rent reviews
carried out every five years. By encouraging open book
accounting for our new tenants, we can help them recognise early
on if there are issues and offer appropriate support. Our longer
lease agreements provide for rent to be calculated on a fair
maintainable turnover basis and by following our code of practice
any agreements with our licensees are transparent to them. Our
new partnership advantage agreement is designed to help
tenants by allowing them access to wholesale competitive prices
for wines, spirits, minerals and small pack beer, in conjunction
with an adjustment to the pub's current rental figure.
In Scotland we helped provide external areas for smokers at our
tenanted houses and our training programmes focused on
assisting tenants to comply with the smoking ban and to help
them with fire risk assessment. This year the emphasis will
switch to helping our tenants prepare to meet the significant and
challenging requirements of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005.
Health and safety 
We are committed to providing a safe and secure environment for
both our employees and our customers. Safety management
includes the use of detailed risk assessments, which are audited
to ensure compliance, in accordance with models suggested by
the Health and Safety Executive. Health and safety training is
provided as a core competency for all house managers. Managed
houses are subject to a weekly health and safety audit which is
centrally collated and retained. A more detailed health and safety
and food safety audit is undertaken at least every six months
with the support of third party auditors. Risk reduction measures,
such as checks on gas and electrical fittings and fixtures, kitchen
flue cleaning and fire detection and warning systems, are
centrally administered. An annual fire risk assessment is also
undertaken in every managed pub. Our Brewing Company won
two gold awards at the prestigious RoSPA Occupational Health
and Safety Awards 2007.
Charities and community
We believe that pubs should be at the heart of the community
they serve and we are committed to being an active and positive
contributor to local communities. Where employees, licensees or
free trade customers want to help good local causes, we often
offer help by donating prizes or additional funds. Significant
amounts of money can be raised for many different charitable
causes in this way.

FOR THE FIFTY-TWO WEEKS ENDED 29 APRIL 2007

GREENE KING ANNUAL REPORT 2006/07 
Corporate information
The consolidated financial statements of Greene King plc for the
52 weeks ended 29 April 2007 were authorised for issue by the
board of directors on 2 July 2007. Greene King plc is a public
limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The company's shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Statement of compliance
The group’s financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
as adopted by the EU as they apply to the financial statements of
the group for the 52 weeks ended 29 April 2007 applied in
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
1. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 1985
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. They are presented
in pounds sterling, with values rounded to the nearest hundred
thousand, except where otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial
statements of Greene King plc, its subsidiaries and its related
party, Greene King Finance plc. Greene King Finance plc is a
special purpose entity set-up to raise bond finance for the group,
which is consolidated as a quasi-subsidiary. The financial
statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting
year as the parent company with adjustments made to their
financial statements to bring their accounting policies in line with
those used by the group.
The results of subsidiaries are consolidated, from the date of
acquisition, being the date on which the group obtains control,
and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control
ceases. Intercompany transactions, balances, income and
expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the
previous financial year except for the following:
International Accounting Standards (IAS 39): Financial guarantee
amendment – Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Commitee
(IFRIC) 4: Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease
IFRIC 8: Scope of IFRS 2
There is no impact in the current period and no changes to
comparatives are deemed required from the adoption of these
standards.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over
the fair value of the assets (including previously unrecognised
intangible assets) and liabilities (including contingent liabilities)
acquired. Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for
impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired,
and is stated at cost less any impairment in value.
For the purposes of impairment testing goodwill is allocated at
business segment level which is the lowest group of cash
generating units where goodwill is monitored by management.
Allocation is based on expectations of where benefits from the
synergies of the combination will result. On disposal of a
subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the
determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill amortised prior to the conversion to IFRS on 3 May 2004
has not been reinstated and the net book value of goodwill at
that date has been carried forward as the carrying value. Prior to
May 1998, goodwill was written off to reserves. Such goodwill
has not been reinstated and is not included in determining profit
or loss on disposal.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost on
transition to IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and any
impairment in value.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful life of the asset.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Freehold and long leasehold
buildings are depreciated to their estimated residual values over
periods up to fifty years and short leasehold improvements are
depreciated to their estimated residual values over the shorter of
the remaining term of the lease or useful life of the asset.
Residual value is reviewed at least at each financial year-end and
there is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or
exceeds, book value. Plant and equipment assets are depreciated
over their estimated lives which range from three to twenty years.
Residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are
reviewed for all categories of property, plant and equipment and
adjusted, if appropriate, at each financial year end.
An item of property, plant and equipment is de-recognised upon
disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from
its use. Profit or loss on de-recognition is calculated as the
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying
amount of the asset, and is included in the income statement in
the year of de-recognition. Impairment
Non financial assets
Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment
purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash
inflows independent of the cash inflows of other groups of assets.
An assessment is made at each reporting date whether there is
an indication of impairment or reversal of impairment. If an
indication exists, the group makes an estimate of the recoverable
amount of each asset group, which is the higher of the assets' fair
value less costs to sell and value-in-use, calculated using the
identified cashflows of the asset groups.
An impairment loss is recognised where the recoverable amount
is lower than the carrying value of assets, including goodwill. If
there is an indication that any previously recognised impairment
losses may no longer exist or may have decreased, a reversal of
the loss may be made only if there has been a change in the
estimates used to determine the recoverable amounts since the
last impairment loss was recognised. The carrying amount of the
asset is increased to its recoverable amount only up to the
carrying amount that would have resulted, net of depreciation,
had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Impairment losses and any subsequent reversals are recognised
in the income statement.
Goodwill
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may be impaired.
Impairment is determined by the recoverable amount of a
business segment. Where this is less than the carrying value of
the business segment an impairment loss is recognised
immediately in the income statement. This loss cannot be
reversed in future periods.
Finance costs and income
Finance costs are expensed to the income statement using 
the effective interest method and are not capitalised. Finance
income is recognised in the income statement using the effective
interest method.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable
value. Raw materials are valued at average cost. Finished goods
and work in progress comprise materials, labour and attributable
production overheads where applicable, and are valued at
average cost.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at
bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original
maturity of three months or less. For the consolidated cash flow
statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash
equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are recognised when the group becomes
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are de-
recognised when the group no longer controls the contractual
rights that comprise the financial instrument, normally through
sale or when all cash flows attributable to the instrument are
passed to an independent third party.
Financial assets
Financial assets are classified as either financial assets at fair
value through profit and loss, loans and receivables, held-to-
maturity investments or available-for-sale financial assets. The
group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial
recognition and, where appropriate, re-evaluates this designation
at each financial year-end.
The group makes trade loans to publicans who purchase the
group's beer. Trade loans are non-derivative and are not quoted in
an active market and have therefore been designated as 'Loans
and receivables', carried at amortised cost using the effective
interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in income when
the loans and receivables are de-recognised or impaired, as well
as through the amortisation process.
The group assesses at each balance sheet date whether any
individual trade loan is impaired. If there is evidence that an
impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of loss is
measured as the difference between the loan's carrying amount
and the expected future receipts, (excluding future credit losses
that have not been incurred), discounted at the loan's original
effective interest rate. The loss is recognised in operating profit.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recorded at their original invoiced amount
less an allowance for any doubtful amounts when collection of
the full amount is no longer considered probable.
Trade payables
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their
nominal value.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of
the consideration received, net of issue costs. After initial
recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured
at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

GREENE KING ANNUAL REPORT 2006/07 
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The group uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to
interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate loans, notes and bonds.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value, if any, and
carried on the balance sheet as an asset or liability. Subsequent
measurement is at fair value determined by reference to market
values for similar instruments. If a derivative does not qualify for
hedge accounting the gain or loss arising on the movement in fair
value is recognised in the income statement.
Hedge accounting
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedge relationship must be
designated and documented at inception. Documentation must
include the group's risk management objective and strategy for
undertaking the hedge and formal allocation to the item or
transaction being hedged. The group also documents how it will
assess the effectiveness of the hedge and carries out
assessments on a regular basis to determine whether it has been,
and is likely to continue to be, highly effective.
Hedges can be classified as either fair value (hedging exposure to
changes in fair value of an asset or liability), or cash flow (hedging
the variability in cash flows attributable to an asset, liability, or
forecast transaction). The group uses its interest rate swaps as
cash flow hedges.
Cash flow hedge accounting
The effective portion of the gain or loss on an interest rate swap
is recognised directly in equity, whilst any ineffective portion is
recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement
in the same period that the financial income or expense is
recognised, unless the hedged transaction results in the
recognition of a non-financial asset or liability whereby the
amounts are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the
asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or
exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, amounts
previously recognised in equity are held there until the previously
hedged transaction affects profit or loss. If the hedged
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or
loss recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income
statement.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Defined benefit pension schemes
The group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes
which require contributions to be made into separately
administered funds. The cost of providing benefits under the
schemes is determined separately for each plan using the
projected unit credit actuarial method on an annual basis. The
current service cost is charged to operating profit. Any actuarial
gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement of
recognised income and expense in the period in which they occur.
Past service costs are recognised in the income statement on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period or immediately if the
benefits have vested. When a settlement or curtailment occurs
the obligation and related scheme assets are re-measured and
the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement in
the same period.
The interest cost on scheme liabilities and the expected return on
scheme assets are shown as a net amount on the face of the
group income statement.
The defined benefit asset or liability recognised on the balance
sheet comprises the present value of the schemes' obligations,
less past service costs not yet recognised, and less the fair value
of scheme assets. Defined benefit assets are restricted to the
extent that they are considered recoverable.
Defined contribution pension schemes
The cost of the group's defined contribution pension schemes
amounts to the value of contributions made. Contributions are
charged to the income statement as they become payable.
Post-employment healthcare benefit
The group also provided certain additional post-employment
healthcare benefits to employees which are unfunded. The cost
of providing these benefits is determined on the same basis as
the defined benefit pension schemes.
Share based payments
Certain employees and directors receive equity-settled
remuneration, whereby they render services in exchange for
shares or rights over shares. The fair value of the options granted
is measured using a Black-Scholes model, at the date at which
they were granted. No account is taken in the fair value calculation
of any vesting conditions, other than market conditions. The fair
value of shares and options granted is recognised as an employee
expense with a corresponding increase in equity spread over the
period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled ending on
the relevant vesting date. The cumulative amount recognised as
an expense reflects the extent to which the vesting period has
expired, adjusted for the estimated number of shares and options
that are ultimately expected to vest. The periodic charge or credit
is the movement in the cumulative position from beginning to end
of that period. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest
provided vesting is not conditional on market related conditions.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as
additional share dilution in calculating earnings per share figures.
In accordance with the exemption allowed under IFRS 1 for first
time adopters, no expense is recorded in respect of grants made
under the above schemes prior to 7 November 2002.
Own shares
Own shares consist of treasury shares and shares held within an
employee benefit trust. The group has an employee benefit trust
for the granting of shares to applicable employees. 
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from
shareholders' equity. Subsequent consideration received for the
sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any
difference between the sale proceeds from the original cost being
taken to revenue reserves. No gain or loss is recognised in the
performance statements on transactions in treasury shares.
Revenue
Generally, revenue represents external sales (excluding taxes) of
goods and services, net of discounts. Revenue is recognised to
the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow
to the group and is measured at the fair value of consideration
receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes or
duty. Revenue principally consists of:
Goods
Drink and food sales
Recognised at the point at which goods are provided either
wholesale or in the group's outlets.
Services
Accommodation sales
Recognised at the point at which the services are provided.
Rental income
Recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Machine income
Net takings recognised as earned.
Operating leases
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and
benefits of ownership are classified as operating leases. Lease
payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement
on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease premiums paid on entering into or acquiring operating
leases represent prepaid lease payments and are held on the
balance sheet as current (the portion relating to the next financial
period) or non-current prepayments. These are amortised on a
straight-line basis over the lease term.
Taxes
Income tax
The income tax charge comprises both the income tax payable
based on profits for the year and the deferred income tax. It is
calculated using taxation rates enacted or substantively enacted
by the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount
expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
Income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is
recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary
differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and their carrying values in the financial
statements.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary timing
differences except where the deferred tax liability arises from the
initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a
transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of
the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable
profit or loss and in respect of taxable temporary differences
associated with investments in subsidiaries where the timing of
the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it
is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the
foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary
differences and carry forward of unused tax losses to the extent
that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against
which the deductible temporary differences and the carry
forward of unused tax losses can be utilised except where the
deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary
difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an
asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business
combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither
accounting profit or taxable profit or loss and, in respect of
deductible temporary differences associated with investments in
subsidiaries, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the
extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will
reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be
available against which temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or
part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised
deferred tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date
and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that
future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be
recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates
that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is
recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are defined as items of income or expense
which, because of their nature, size or expected frequency, merit
separate presentation to allow a better understanding of the
financial performance in the period.
New standards and interpretations not applied
A number of standards and interpretations were issued by the
IASB and IFRC with an effective date after the date of these
financial statements and which have not been early adopted by
the group. These are as follows:
IFRS 7 - Financial instruments: Disclosures
IAS 1 - Amendment - Presentation of Financial Statements:
Capital Disclosures
IFRS 8 - Operating Segments
IFRIC 8 - Scope of IFRS 2
IFRIC 9 - Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives
IFRIC 10 - Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment
IFRIC 11 - IFRS 2 - Group and Treasury Share Transactions
IFRIC 12 - Service Concession Arrangements
The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these
standards or interpretations will have a material impact on the
group's financial statements in the period of initial adoption.
Adoption of IFRS 7 will require additional information on the
group's financial instruments. Adoption of IAS 1 will require
additional disclosure relating to capital management. There will
be no impact on reported income or net assets from either adoption. 
Significant accounting judgments and estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to
make judgments, estimates and assumptions in the application of
accounting policies that affect reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, income and expense. The group bases its estimates and
judgments on historical experience and other factors deemed
reasonable under the circumstances, including any expectations
of future events. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and assumptions considered to be significant are
detailed below:
Impairment of goodwill
The group determines whether goodwill is impaired on at least an
annual basis. Details of the tests and carrying value of the assets
are shown in note 14. This requires an estimation of the value in
use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is
allocated. Value in use calculations require assumptions to be
made regarding the expected future cash flows from the cash-
generating unit and choice of a suitable discount rate in order to
calculate the present value of those cash flows. If the actual
cashflows are lower than estimated, future impairments may be
necessary.
Residual values
Residual values of property are determined with reference to
current market property trends. If residual values were lower than
estimated, an impairment of asset value and reassessment of
future depreciation charge may be required. Useful economic lives
are reassessed annually which may lead to an increase or
reduction in depreciation accordingly.
Pension liabilities
The present values of pension liabilities are determined on an
actuarial basis and depend on a number of actuarial assumptions
which are disclosed in note 9. Any change in these assumptions
will impact on the carrying amount of pension liabilities.
Taxation
Judgment is required when determining the provision for taxes as
the tax treatment of some transactions cannot be finally
determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the
tax authorities. Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is
probable that the benefit will be obtained. Tax provisions are
made if it is possible that a liability will arise. The group reviews
each significant tax liability or benefit to assess the appropriate
accounting treatment. 2. Segment information
The group's primary reporting format is business segments and its secondary format is geographical segments. 
The group's business operations are divided into four core trading segments which are managed separately. Pub Company covers the
results of managed houses, Pub Partners covers the results of tenanted houses, Brewing Company covers brewing beer, marketing and
selling, all predominantly in England. Belhaven covers the results of our Scottish operation which includes managed and tenanted houses
and brewing and selling beer. Corporate includes central costs and central assets/liabilities. To aid comparability, the 2005/6 segmental
figures have been adjusted to re-analyse the Ridley's business from Brewing Company to Pub Partners and Corporate in accordance with
the 2006/7 treatment. 
Results for the 34 weeks of trading of the acquired Hardys & Hansons business have been integrated into the Pub Company, Pub Partners
and Brewing Company segments. In 2006, the Belhaven results reflect 30 weeks of trading since acquisition. 
Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arm's length basis.

Risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds with the same life as the expected option life. Expected volatility
is based on historical volatility of the company's share price which assumes that the past trend in share price movement is indicative of
future trends. Expected life of options has been taken as the mid-point of the relevant exercise period. This is not necessarily indicative
of future exercise patterns. 
No other feature of the equity instruments granted was incorporated into the fair value measurement.
The weighted average fair value of options and contingently issued shares granted during the period under the ESOS and SAYE schemes

The SIP shares are issued to employees after the period end at the market price ruling at the date of grant. As such, this is their fair value
and the assumptions stated above are not relevant for this scheme.

8. Share based payment plans
The group operates four types of share-based payment arrangements; executive share option plans (‘ESOS’), a senior management long-
term incentive plan (‘LTIP’), general employee share option plan (‘SAYE’) and a share incentive plan (‘SIP’).
The general terms of each plan are detailed in the directors' remuneration report on pages 66 to 70. All are equity settled. 
The total expense recognised for the period arising from share-based payment transactions is £4.8m (2006: £3.1m), all of which relates
to equity-settled transactions. 
The fair value of equity-settled options and LTIP contingently issued shares are estimated using a Black-Scholes model. The model inputs
used to calculate the fair values of grants during the period were as follows: Movement in outstanding options and rights during the period is as follows:
ESOS Weighted average

(2006: 0.4m) at the end of period. The options have not been modified and therefore are not accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.

The options and shares granted under the LTIP are at nil cost therefore the weighted average exercise price for rights outstanding at the
beginning and end of the period, granted, forfeited and exercised during the period is £nil (2006: £nil).
ESOS, SAYE and LTIP
Options were exercised on a range of dates. The weighted average share price through the period was 956p in 2007 and 685p in 2006.
The rights outstanding at 29 April 2007 under the LTIP had an exercise price of £nil (2006: £nil) and a weighted average remaining
contractual life of 2.1 years (2006: 1.8 years). The outstanding options for the ESOS scheme had an exercise price between 264p and 813p
(2006: 232p-746p) and for the SAYE scheme between 285p and 865p (2006: 220p - 585p). The weighted average remaining contractual
life was 7.9 years for the ESOS (2006: 8.0 years) and 2.9 years for the SAYE scheme (2006: 3.7 years).
SIP
The cost of the SIP is accrued at the year-end based on the expected value of payout. The amount accrued at 29 April 2007 for the current
year's service is £2.4m (2006: £2.2m) disclosed in note 6. The shares issued during the period to employees were in relation to their
services in the prior period. The number of shares issued was 0.3 million with a share price on date of grant of 844p. The SIP shares are
held within an external trust until the employee elects to sell.

33 9. Pensions
The group maintains a defined contribution scheme, which is open to all new employees, and a number of defined benefit schemes. During
the year a defined benefit pension obligation has been acquired as a result of the Hardys & Hansons acquisition.
The group also has a past service liability in relation to post-employment medical benefits offered to employees to cover any medical costs
after employment. The benefit is no longer given to new employees.
Defined contribution pension scheme 
Member funds for the defined contribution scheme are held and administered by the Prudential Assurance Company. The total cost
recognised in operating profit for the period was £2.1m (2006: £1.8m).
Defined benefit pension schemes and post-employment benefits
The group maintains the following defined benefit schemes which are all closed to new entrants and have had full actuarial valuations in
the last four years: Greene King Pension Scheme (closed 2 May 1997, last valued 5 April 2003), Morland Pension Scheme (closed 12
December 2000, last valued 5 April 2003), Tolly Cobbold Pension Scheme (closed 29 July 2002, last valued 1 December 2004), Belhaven
Pension Scheme (closed 31 October 2005, last valued 31 March 2005), and the Hardys & Hansons Pension Scheme (closed 1 July 2003,
last valued 30 April 2004).
Member funds for the defined benefit schemes are held in separate funds independently of the group's finances and are administered by
pension trustees. Pension benefits are related to members' final salary at retirement and their length of service.The group has opted to
recognise all actuarial gains and losses immediately via the statement of recognised income and expense.

The total contributions to the defined benefit pension schemes in the following period are expected to be £6.7m (2006: £6.4m) for the group. 
The values of the schemes' liabilities have been determined by qualified actuaries based on the results of the last actuarial valuation,
updated to 29 April 2007 using the following principal actuarial assumptions:
2007 2006
Discount rate 5.6% 5.2%
Expected rates of salary increases 5.0% 4.8%
Expected pension payment increases 3.1% 2.9%
Rate of inflation 3.2% 3.0%
Healthcare cost increase 9.0% 9.0%
Mortality pre-retirement AM92/AF92 -3 AM92/AF92 -3
Mortality post-retirement (members not yet at National retirement age) PMA/PFA92 c=2030 PMA/PFA92 c=2030
Mortality post-retirement (members past National retirement age) PMA/PFA92 c= 2010 PMA/PFA92 c=2010
Mortality assumptions are based on standard tables adjusted for scheme experience and with an allowance for future improvement in life
expectancy. Overall expected rate of return on assets is established by applying brokers' forecasts to each category of scheme asset. 
The net liability of the schemes and other post-employment benefits, as recognised in the balance sheet, is summarised below:

Factors that may affect future tax charges 
On 21 March 2007 the Government announced a reduction in the rate of corporation tax from 30% to 28% with effect from 1 April 2008.
It is estimated that this will result in a reduction in the deferred tax liability of approximately £13m in next year's financial statements. 
The Government also announced a reduction in the rate of capital allowances from 25% to 20% (and to 10% on fixtures) and the phased
abolition of industrial buildings and hotel allowances. The changes to capital allowances will have no impact on the total tax charge in the
financial statements. We are currently unable to estimate the impact of the abolition of industrial buildings and hotel allowances as the
legislation has not been published.

GREENE KING ANNUAL REPORT 2006/07  12. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of £108.6m (2006 - £89.9m) by the
weighted average number of shares in issue during the period (excluding own shares held) of 151.0m (2006 - 148.4m). 
Diluted earnings per share has been calculated on a similar basis taking account of 2.3m (2006 - 2.3m) dilutive potential shares under
option, giving a weighted average number of ordinary shares adjusted for the effect of dilution of 153.3m (2006 - 150.7m).
Adjusted earnings per share excludes the effect of exceptional items and is presented to show the underlying performance of the group
on both a basic and dilutive basis.

A two-for-one share split was completed during the prior period. Historic earnings per share have been restated accordingly.

All goodwill was purchased as part of business combinations. As from 3 May 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, goodwill is no longer
amortised but is subject to annual impairment testing.
14. Impairment testing of goodwill
Goodwill has been allocated to business segments, the lowest group of cash-generating units in the group at which goodwill is monitored
internally, based on the extent that the benefits of acquisitions flow to that segment. 
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated £180.8m (2006: £130.0m) to Pub Company, £161.8m (2006: £118.9m) to Pub
Partners, £138.7m (2006: £129.8m) to Brewing Company, and £126.4m (2006: £126.4m) to Belhaven. 
The recoverable amount of each segment was determined based on a value-in-use calculation, and in all cases exceeded the carrying amount.
The key assumptions used for all business segments are the discount rate applied to cash flow projections of 9.0% (2006: 9.0%) and the
projected cashflows beyond the one year budgets extrapolated using a growth rate in line with an expected long-term inflation rate of
2.0% (2006: 2.0%), which is below the long-term average growth rate for the industry. Other commercial assumptions relating to market
growth, market share and sales prices have been made based on historic trends adjusted for management estimates of future prospects.

Valuation
The licensed estate properties were valued by the group's own professionally qualified chartered surveyors, as at 20 December 2003, on
the basis of existing use value, in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' Appraisal and Valuation Standards. A
representative sample of properties was also valued by external valuers, Gerald Eve Chartered Surveyors and Property Consultants, who
confirmed that the values were consistent with their appraisal. Frozen revaluation has been taken as deemed cost on the transition to IFRS,
therefore no historic cost analysis is provided.
Up to 1999 the brewery and depots were valued at depreciated replacement cost and other properties at open market value. These
valuations have been retained but they have not been updated. Subsequent additions have been included at cost or, in the case of
acquisitions, at fair value.

Goodwill has arisen primarily due to expected operating synergies and the difference between property fair value and expected value-in-use. 
The main fair value adjustments relate to the revaluation of the freehold properties acquired, recognition of related deferred tax liability
on these revaluations and, in relation to Belhaven, the recognition of a defined benefit pension liability. 
The fair value of properties acquired was established following a review that was carried out by qualified surveyors employed by the
company. Retained properties have been revalued at their existing use value and properties subsequently disposed have been valued 
at their fair value less costs to sell. The value of other current assets and liabilities have been adjusted to amounts to be realised or 
paid respectively. 
The fair values presented in the interim statements were provisional due to the proximity of the acquisition to the interim date. The
principal change is due to the subsequent disposal of a number of properties on 1 December 2006 which gave a better indication of their
previous fair value.
The net cashflow impact of the acquisition was:

Cash paid (172.0) (222.8)

From the date of acquisition, Hardys & Hansons plc has contributed £12.2m operating profit to the group results. As a result of integrating
the Hardys & Hansons operations, it is no longer practical to identify the related cashflows for Hardys & Hansons separately. Prior to
acquisition the results of Hardys & Hansons were prepared under UK GAAP, using different accounting policies and bases, and therefore a
proforma trading result has not been produced.

Bank overdrafts
Overdrafts are utilised for the day to day management of cash. The group has facilities of £35.0m available with interest linked to base rate.
Bank loans - unsecured
A new 5-year revolving credit facility was signed on 26 April 2007, giving the group a committed facility of £550.0m. An amount of
£235.0m was drawn down under this facility at the year-end and utilised to repay outstanding amounts under the group's previous
revolving credit facilities, which were cancelled with effect from 27 April 2007, leaving £315.0m undrawn. The amounts drawn down bear
interest at a margin above LIBOR, with commitment payment on the undrawn portions. Interest is payable at each renewal date which vary
in maturity. Although the individual draw-downs are repayable within 12 months of the balance sheet date, the group expects to renew
this funding. Immediate renewal is available under the facility until April 2012 hence the related debt has been classified as non-current.
Final repayment of the total drawn-down balance is due as one payment on the agreement repayment date.
The effective interest rate for £190.0m of the £235.0m drawn-down is 5.61% with the remaining £45.0m at a rate linked to LIBOR. 
The fixed rate loan attracts interest at 6.775% and is payable annually. The principal is repayable over the term of the loan by annual
payments in accordance with the payment schedule.
Securitised debt
On 7 March 2005, £600.0 million of bonds were issued in connection with the securitisation of 904 of the group's pubs held in Greene
King Retailing Limited. The bonds are secured over the properties and their future income streams and were issued by Greene King Finance
plc. The funds were used to repay existing bank facilities and pay related issue costs.
On 8 May 2006, a further £550 million of bonds were issued as a tap of the original securitisation, involving an additional 801 of the
group's pubs, held in Greene King Retailing Limited. These were issued under substantially the same terms as the original securitisation.
The funds were used to repay existing bank facilities, pay related issue costs of £4.3m and early redemption of the debentures, incurring
an accelerated interest cost of £0.7m, debenture redemption costs of £4.0m, and swap termination costs of £4.7m.

*** carrying value is net of related deferred finance fees. 
Repayment of nominal is made by quarterly instalments, in accordance with the repayment schedule, within the date ranges shown above.
Payment of interest is made on quarterly dates for all classes of bond. All of the floating rate bonds are fully hedged using interest rate swaps.
The Class A1, A2, A3, and A4 bonds rank pari passu in point of security and as to payment of interest and principal, and have preferential
interest payment and repayment rights over the Class B bonds. The Class B1 and B2 bonds rank pari passu in point of security, principal
repayment and interest payment. 
The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Greene King Retailing
Limited, a group company. These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions on
its ability to move cash to other group companies. Due to disposal of a number of the securitised properties during the year there is £90.8m
of cash held in secured accounts which can only be used for specified purposes by the securitisation vehicle.
Loan notes - unsecured
The group issued new loan notes during the year in connection with the Hardys & Hansons acquisition. These have a maturity date of
September 2011 and bear interest at a margin below LIBOR, payable semi-annually. The effective interest rate for £75m of the loan notes
is 4.57% after taking into consideration the effect of interest rate swaps, with the remaining £27.9m at LIBOR -0.5%. These loan notes
are redeemable on demand of the holders on any of the interest payment dates and as such have been classified as current debt. Loan
notes maturing on 31 December 2010 bear interest at LIBOR -0.75%, payable semi-annually and are redeemable on demand of the holders
on any of the interest payment dates. The remaining loan notes maturing on 16 August 2006 were repaid in full at that date.
11.25% Loan from associate - secured
Interest was payable on the loan semi-annually. The loan was repayable in one instalment and was secured by a first floating charge over
the group's principal trading companies. In connection with the securitisation tap, this loan was repaid on 8 May 2006 and all associated
obligations and security were discharged on that date.
7.75% Debenture - secured
Interest was payable on the debentures semi-annually. The debentures were repayable in one instalment and were secured by a first
floating charge over the group's principal trading companies. In connection with the securitisation tap, these debentures were repaid on 8
May 2006 and all associated obligations and security were discharged on that date.

24. Financial instruments
The primary treasury objectives of the group are to identify and manage the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business
needs, and provide secure and competitively priced funding for the activities of the group. If appropriate, the group uses financial
instruments and derivatives to manage these risks.
The principal financial instruments held for the purpose of raising finance for operations are bank loans and overdraft, securitised bonds,
loan notes, cash and short term deposits. Other financial instruments arise directly from the operations of the group, such as trade
receivables, payables, and trade loans. 
Derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, are used to manage the interest rate risks related to the group's operations
and financing sources. No speculative trading in derivative financial instruments is undertaken.
The main risks from the group's financial instruments are cash flow interest rate risk and credit risk. The policy for managing each of these
risks is set out below.
Interest rate risk
Exposure to changes in interest rates on the group's borrowings is reviewed with regard to the maturity profile and cash flows of the
underlying debt. The group uses a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate debt with exposure to market interest rate fluctuations
primarily arising from the floating rate instruments. The group operates a policy that no less than 95% of the overall interest exposure
should be hedged. The group enters into interest rate swaps to manage the exposure. The swaps are designated as cashflow hedges at
the date of contract included within the accounts, and tested for effectiveness every 6 months.
Credit risk
The policy for third party trading is that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
Receivable balances are also monitored on an on-going basis and provided against where deemed necessary to limit the exposure to bad
debts to a non-significant level.
Other financial assets includes trade loans, cash, and certain derivative instruments. Credit risk is the risk of default by the counterparty
to discharge their obligation, the maximum exposure of the group is the carrying amount of these instruments.
There is no requirement for collateral and there are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the group.
Cash flow hedging
At 29 April 2007, the group held 6 (2006: 23) interest rate swap contracts, with a nominal value of £265.0m (2006: £497.5m), designated
as hedges of the cash flow interest rate risk of £265.0m (2006: £497.5m) of the group's variable rate borrowings (excluding bonds), and
are held on the balance sheet as a fair value asset of £3.5m (2006: liability of £5.1m). The cashflows occur quarterly and semi-annually,
receiving a variable rate of interest based on the base rate or LIBOR, which ranged from 4.50% to 5.67% (2006: 4.50% to 4.95%), and
paying a fixed rate ranging from 4.53% to 5.09% (2006: 4.40% to 6.96%). Remaining contract maturity dates range from September 2007
to June 2011.
At 29 April 2007, the group also held 2 (2006: 1) interest rate swap contracts for a nominal value of £435.0m (2006: £150.0m), entered
into as part of the securitisation and subsequent securitisation tap. A net fair value asset of £2.3m (2006: liability of £12.2m) has been
recognised on the balance sheet in respect of these contracts which are designated cash flow hedges against £435.0m (2006: £150.0m)
of variable rate bonds, receiving a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR and paying a weighted average fixed rate of 4.947% (2006: 5.155%).
The contract maturity dates are December 2034 and March 2036. The bonds and interest rate swaps have the same critical terms.
Changes in cash flow hedge fair values are recognised in the hedging reserve to the extent that the hedges are effective. The cashflow
hedges have been assessed as being highly effective during the period and are expected to remain highly effective over the remaining
contract lives. Interest rate risk
The following tables set out the group's exposure to interest rate risk and the maturity profile for each class of interest bearing financial
asset and financial liability.

The interest on variable rate financial instruments is repriced at intervals less than 1 year. The interest on fixed rate financial instruments
is fixed until the maturity of the instrument. Investments, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables are not included in
the above as they are non-interest bearing and are not subject to interest rate risk.
Financial assets
Financial assets relate to trade loans receivable. Included in the fixed rate trade loan balance above is £14.1m (2006: £12.9m) in relation
to loans with settlement related to purchase levels and which therefore do not have a set repayment profile. The write-down of these loans
has been taken on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the loan as an approximation of the write-down. This is not necessarily
the actual write-down that will occur.
The fixed rate trade loans had a weighted average interest rate of 1.02% (2006 - 1.01%) and a weighted average period of 6.23 years
(2006 - 7.25 years). Interest rates on variable trade loans are linked to base rate.

Share premium account
Share premium represents the excess of proceeds received over the nominal value of new shares issued.
Capital redemption reserve
Capital redemption reserve arose from the purchase and cancellation of own share capital, and represents the nominal amount of the share
capital cancelled.
Hedging reserve
Hedging reserve adjustments arise from the movement in fair value of the group's derivative instruments used as an effective hedge, in-
line with the accounting policy disclosed in note 1.  Own shares
Own shares relates to shares held in treasury and by the employee benefit trust. At 29 April 2007 1.0m shares (2006 - 1.0m) were held
in treasury and 1.2m shares (2006 - 0.9m) by the employee benefit trust (EBT). The market values at that date were £10.5m and £12.8m
(2006 - £7.1m and £6.2m) respectively. 
During the period 1.0m (2006 - 0.7m) shares were repurchased for £10.0m (2006 - £4.8m) cash and held in treasury or by the employee
benefit trust. 0.7m (2006 - 0.8m) shares held by the employee benefit trust were transferred for £2.2m (2006 - £2.2 million) to satisfy
awards under the long term incentive plan and options exercised under the executive share option scheme. 
The employee benefit trust is independently managed and has purchased shares in order to satisfy outstanding employee share 
options and potential awards under the long term incentive plan. None of the shares held at the period end have been allocated to specific
option arrangements.
Goodwill
The cumulative amount of goodwill written off to retained earnings in respect of acquisitions made prior to May 1998 amounts to £89.7
million (2006 - £89.7 million).

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS
FOR THE FIFTY-TWO WEEKS ENDED 29 APRIL 2007
GREENE KING ANNUAL REPORT 2006/07  We have audited the group financial statements of Greene King
plc for the period ended 29 April 2007 which comprise the group
income statement, the group balance sheet, the group cash flow
statement, the group statement of recognised income and
expense and the related notes 1 to 32. These group financial
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set
out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial
statements of Greene King plc for the period ended 29 April 2007
and on the information in the directors’ remuneration report that
is described as having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body,
in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
company's members those matters we are required to state to
them in an auditors' report and for no other purpose. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the
company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report,
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and
the group financial statements in accordance with applicable
United Kingdom law and International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out
in the statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the group financial statements in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the group financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the group
financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given
in the directors' report is consistent with the financial statements.
The information given in the directors' report includes that specific
information presented in the chief executive’s review
incorporating the business review and the financial review, cross
referred from the business review section of the directors' report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our
audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects
the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of
the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We
are not required to consider whether the board’s statements on
internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on
the effectiveness of the group’s corporate governance
procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the annual report and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited group financial
statements. The other information comprises only the directors’
report, the chairman’s statement, the chief executive’s review
incorporating the business review, the financial review, the
corporate social responsibility report and the corporate
governance statement. We consider the implications for our
report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or
material inconsistencies with the group financial statements. Our
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of
evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the group
financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the
significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the
preparation of the group financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the group financial statements are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the group
financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion :
• the group financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of
the state of the group’s affairs as at 29 April 2007 and of its
profit for the period then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the
IAS Regulation; and
• the information given in the directors' report is consistent with
the group financial statements.

Directors 33. Accounting policies
Basis of accounting and presentation
The accounts are prepared on a going-concern basis, in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting and financial
reporting standards in the United Kingdom (UK GAAP). They are prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of derivatives,
where the company uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate loans, notes and bonds.
Revaluation of properties
Fixed asset licensed properties are revalued at least every five years on an existing use basis and the surplus or deficit reflected in the balance
sheet. Interim valuations are performed in the third year, or sooner if there is evidence of a material change in value. Valuations of other fixed
asset properties were undertaken in 1999 and earlier years and in accordance with FRS 15 are retained but not updated. Surpluses and deficits
are taken directly to the revaluation reserve, except to the extent that the valuation falls below both historic cost and supportable
value-in-use, when they are taken to the profit and loss account, and on realisation are transferred to the profit and loss account reserve.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost and held as fixed assets on the balance sheet. Income is recognised from these
investments only in relation to distributions received from post-acquisition profits.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on timing differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their carrying values in the financial statements.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all timing differences except where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill
or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither the accounting profit
nor taxable profit or loss and in respect of taxable timing differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal
of the timing differences can be controlled and it is probable that the timing differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible timing differences and carry forward of unused tax losses to the extent that it is
probable that taxable profit will be available, against which the deductible timing differences and the carry forward of unused tax losses
can be utilised, except where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible timing difference arises from the initial recognition of an
asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting profit or
taxable profit or loss and, in respect of deductible timing differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax assets are
recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the timing differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will
be available, against which timing differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is not longer probable
that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets
are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will
allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the
liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the profit and loss account.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are recognised when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are
de-recognised when the company no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, normally through sale
or when all cash flows attributable to the instrument are passed to an independent third party.
The exemption has been taken per FRS 25.3C, whereby the company is exempt from producing disclosure required by the standard as the
group accounts contain disclosure that complies with FRS 25.
NOTES TO THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS
FOR THE FIFTY-TWO WEEKS ENDED 29 APRIL 2007

GREENE KING ANNUAL REPORT 2006/07  Finance costs and income
Finance costs are expensed to the profit and loss account using the effective interest method and are not capitalised. Finance income is
recognised in the profit and loss account using the effective interest method.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs. After initial recognition,
interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The company uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate loans, notes and bonds.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value, if any, and carried on the balance sheet as an asset or liability. Subsequent
measurement is at fair value determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. If a derivative does not qualify for hedge
accounting the gain or loss arising on the movement in fair value is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Hedge accounting
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedge relationship must be designated and documented at inception. Documentation must include the
company's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and formal allocation to the item or transaction being
hedged. The company also documents how it will assess the effectiveness of the hedge and carries out assessments on a regular basis to
determine whether it has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly effective.
Hedges can be classified as either fair value (hedging exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability), or cash flow (hedging the
variability in cash flows attributable to an asset, liability, or forecast transaction). The company uses its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.
Own shares
Own shares consist of treasury shares and shares held within an employee benefit trust. The company has an employee benefit trust for
the granting of shares to applicable employees.
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from shareholders' equity. Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such shares
is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds from the original cost being taken to revenue reserves. No gain
or loss is recognised in the performance statements on transactions in treasury shares.
Changes in accounting policies
The company adopted one new Financial Reporting Standard but this has no impact on the amounts reported in the financial statements.
The only standard that is relevant to the company is:
FRS 28 Corresponding amounts
34. Profit for the year

company's members those matters we are required to state to
them in an auditors' report and for no other purpose. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the
company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report,
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report, the
directors’ remuneration report and the parent company financial
statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law
and Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice) are set out in the statement of directors’
responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements
and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company
financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the
parent company financial statements and the part of the
directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also
report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the
parent company directors' report is consistent with the financial
statements. The information given in the directors’ report
includes that specific information presented in the chief
executive’s review incorporating the business review and the
financial review, cross referred from the business review section
of the directors' report. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not
kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the annual report and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent company
financial statements. The other information comprises only the
directors’ report, the chairman’s statement, the chief executives
review incorporating the business review, the financial review, the
corporate social responsibility report and the corporate
governance statement. We consider the implications for our report
if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the parent company financial statements. Our
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of
evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the parent
company financial statements and the part of the directors’
remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment
of the significant estimates and judgments made by the 
directors in the preparation of the parent company financial
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the parent company financial statements and the
part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited are free
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent
company financial statements and the part of the directors’
remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the parent company financial statements give a true and fair
view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of the state of the company's affairs as at
29 April 2007; 
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the
directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
• the information given in the directors' report is consistent with
the parent company financial statements.

Activities and business review
Greene King plc is the holding company for a group whose principal
activities are operating managed, tenanted and leased public
houses, brewing beer, and wholesaling beers, wines, spirits and
soft drinks. In accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act
1985, as amended, the company is required to produce a business
review containing a fair review of the business of the company and
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the
company. Shareholders are referred to the chief executive's review,
the financial review and the corporate social responsibility report

balanced and comprehensive analysis of the development and
performance of the business of the group during the financial year
and the position of the group at the end of the year.
Directors
Details of the current directors are given on page 18. Nine of these
directors held office throughout the period, whilst Ian Durant was

articles of association, Ian Durant and Jonathan Lawson will retire at
the forthcoming AGM and, being eligible, offer themselves for
election. Alan Bowkett served as a non-executive director until 
1 September 2006 and Mark Angela as an executive director  until
16 April 2007.
Under article 85 of the company's articles of association Rooney
Anand and Norman Murray retire by rotation and, being eligible,
offer themselves for re-election at the forthcoming AGM. In
addition, Howard Phillips, who has served on the board since June
1998, offers himself for re-election as required by the provisions of
the combined code.

GREENE KING ANNUAL REPORT 2006/07 
DIRECTORS’ REPORT Share capital authorities
A number of resolutions will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM
in connection with the company’s share capital:
• Share allotment authority
This resolution seeks to renew the authority of the directors to
allot securities in the company up to an aggregate nominal
amount of £6,114,709, being the authorised but unissued
capital of the company and representing approximately 33.3
per cent (excluding any shares held in treasury) of the issued
ordinary share capital as at 1 July 2007 for up to fifteen months
after the AGM or until the date of the AGM in 2008, whichever
is earlier. The directors consider that this authority is desirable
to allow the company to retain flexibility, although they have
no present intention of exercising this authority.
• Dis-application of statutory pre-emption rights
This resolution seeks to renew the authority of the directors to
dis-apply pre-emption rights and allot equity securities for cash
in connection with a rights issue and otherwise and to sell
ordinary shares held in treasury (see below) up to an aggregate
nominal amount of £917,206, being approximately 5 per cent
of the ordinary share capital, in issue at 1 July 2007 for up to
fifteen months after the AGM or until the date of the AGM in
2008, whichever is earlier.
• Authority for the purchase of own shares
This resolution seeks to renew shareholders’ authority for the
company to make market purchases of its own shares, as
permitted by article 8 of the articles of association for up to
fifteen months after this AGM, or until the date of the AGM in
2008, whichever is earlier. The directors would only purchase
and cancel shares after taking into account the effects on
earnings per share and the benefits for shareholders generally.
Pursuant to the Companies Act 1985 (as amended), the
company can hold any shares which are repurchased as
treasury shares and either re-sell them for cash, cancel them,
either immediately or at a point in the future, or use them for
the purposes of its employee share schemes. The directors
believe that it is desirable for the company to have this choice.
Holding the repurchased shares as treasury shares will give the
company the ability to re-sell or transfer them quickly and cost-
effectively and will provide the company with additional
flexibility in the management of its capital base. No dividends
will be paid on, and no voting rights will be exercised in respect
of, treasury shares.
Shares held as treasury shares will not automatically be
cancelled and will not be taken into account in future
calculations of earnings per share (unless they are
subsequently re-sold or transferred out of treasury).
The authority that will be sought contains several important
restrictions, being:
• the authority is limited to a specified period of time and only
permits the company to purchase on the London Stock
Exchange shares of 12
1 / 2 
p each with a total nominal value of
£1,834,412, being approximately 10 per cent of the
company’s current issued share capital;
• the minimum price per share which may be paid is the
nominal value;
• the maximum price per share that may be paid is 105 per cent
of the average closing market price for the company’s shares
as shown in the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for
the five business days immediately preceding the purchase.
In accordance with the Listing Rules, the company will not, save
in accordance with a pre-determined, irrevocable and non-
discretionary programme, repurchase shares in the period of
two months immediately preceding the preliminary
announcement of its annual or interim results or, if shorter,
between the end of the financial period concerned and the time
of a relevant announcement or, except in accordance with the
Listing Rules, at any other time when, in terms of the model
code, the directors would be prohibited from dealing in shares.
The full exercise of all options outstanding at the date of this
report would require the issue of 4,775,687 ordinary shares. This
represents 3.25% of the current issued share capital (excluding
any shares held in treasury) and 3.62% of what the share capital
would be if the proposed authority to purchase the company's
own shares had been obtained and exercised in full. The company
has issued no warrants to subscribe for share capital.
Substantial shareholdings
As at 1 July 2007, the last practical date prior to the date of this
report, the company has been notified of the following interests
in 3 per cent or more of the issued share capital of the company.
AXA S.A  15.7 per cent
Deutsche Bank  6.0 per cent
Legal & General Group plc  3.5 per cent
Communications with shareholders
At the forthcoming AGM a resolution will be put to shareholders
to make a number of changes to the articles of association, in
order to comply with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 in
relation to communications with shareholders. The Companies
Act 2006 provides a mandatory statutory regime for
communications by and to a company. A number of changes to
the articles are therefore proposed to ensure that the articles are
in line with the company communication provisions of the
Companies Act 2006. Further details of the proposed changes are
set out in Appendix 1 to the notice of meeting.
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
61
GREENE KING ANNUAL REPORT 2006/07  Whilst the company does not propose, given the nature of its
shareholder base, to seek individual shareholder consent to
permit communication with such shareholders by means of
publication on the company's website, the company does wish to
continue to be able to communicate with shareholders via the
website, for those shareholders who are interested in signing up
to e-communications. Shareholders wishing to do so should refer
to the shareholders information page for further information on
how to register via www.greeneking-shares.com.
Charitable donations
Donations by the company for charitable purposes made during
the period amounted to £15,900 (2006 - £21,100). The group
makes no political donations.
Payments to suppliers 
The group understands the benefits to be derived from
maintaining good relationships with its suppliers and where
possible enters into agreements over payment terms. Where such
terms have not been agreed it is the group policy to settle
invoices close to the end of the month following invoicing. This
policy is dependent on suppliers providing accurate, timely and
sufficiently detailed invoices. Payment in respect of 49 days’
average purchases from trade creditors was outstanding at the
end of the period (2006 - 41 days).
Directors' and officers' indemnity insurance
The group has taken out insurance to indemnify, against third
party proceedings, the directors of the company whilst serving on
the board of the company and of any subsidiary. This cover
indemnifies all employees of the group who serve on the boards
of all subsidiaries. These indemnity policies subsisted throughout
the year and remain in place at the date of this report.
Financial instruments
The group's policy on the use of financial instruments is set out
in note 24.
Post balance sheet events
Details of events occurring after the year end are set out in
note 31.
Directors' statement as to disclosure of information to
auditors
The directors who were members of the board at the time of
approving the directors' report are listed on page 18. Having
made enquiries of fellow directors and of the company's auditors,
each of these directors confirms that:
• To the best of each director's knowledge and belief, there is no
information relevant to the preparation of their report of which
the company's auditors are unaware, and
• Each director has taken all the steps a director might
reasonably be expected to have taken to be aware of relevant
audit information and to establish that the company's auditors
are aware of that information.
Auditors
Ernst & Young LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in
office and a resolution to re-appoint the firm as the company's
auditors will be proposed at the AGM.
Annual general meeting 
The AGM will be held at 12 noon on Tuesday 4 September 2007
at the Millennium Grandstand, Rowley Mile Racecourse
Conference Centre, Newmarket, Suffolk. The notice of the AGM is
set out on page 76.
The directors consider that all of the resolutions set out on the
notice of AGM are in the best interests of the company and its
shareholders as a whole and recommend that shareholders vote
in favour of each of them.

GREENE KING ANNUAL REPORT 2006/07 
DIRECTORS’ REPORT Composition of the remuneration committee
The remuneration committee is appointed by the board and
currently comprises Howard Phillips, chairman, Norman Murray
and Jane Scriven, all of whom are regarded by the board as
independent non-executive directors.
Terms of reference and reporting
The committee determines, and annually reviews, all elements
of executive directors’ remuneration. It approves all contracts of
executive directors, and any compensation arrangements
arising from their termination. It also approves all grants of
share options and LTIP allocations to directors and executives
and reviews best practice in executive remuneration. The
committee is made aware of the salary levels of certain senior
employees.
Advisers to the remuneration committee
The committee has taken external advice on general remuneration
levels and comparator information from New Bridge Street Consultants,
who do not provide any other services to the company. Advice is also
obtained, where appropriate, from the company's legal advisers,
Linklaters. The committee also received internal advice from Rooney
Anand, chief executive, in determining appropriate remuneration and
incentive packages for the other executive directors.
Remuneration policy
The company operates in a highly competitive market and must
attract, motivate and retain high quality directors. The committee
considers current market practice and makes comparisons with
turnover, market capitalisation and operational details against a
selection of other companies. The committee has regard to pay
and conditions elsewhere within the group. No director makes a
decision relating to his own remuneration. Individual directors
leave the meeting when their own remuneration is being
discussed. A significant proportion of each executive director’s
potential remuneration is performance-related, thus aligning the
directors’ interests with those of shareholders and encouraging
performance at the highest levels.
Components of directors' remuneration
The remuneration package of each executive director consists of
the following elements:
Annual pay
Annual pay reflects the responsibilities, market value and
sustained performance level of executive directors. Pay is
reviewed annually or when a change in responsibility occurs.
Benefits in kind
The range of taxable benefits available to executive directors is
listed on page 66.
Bonus
Bonus payments are determined by the remuneration committee
and awarded where justified by performance. For the financial
year 2006/7 and for future financial years, the executive
directors have been and will be eligible to receive an annual
incentive bonus, the maximum amount being 100% of annual
pay, for the achievement of stretch targets. The targets are a
combination of personal and financial performance targets
agreed in advance by the committee, with the financial targets
relating to operating profit and profit before tax and exceptional
items. The performance targets are commercially sensitive and
are therefore excluded from this report. 
Pensions
Tim Bridge is a deferred member of the group's defined benefit
and supplementary pension schemes. He is entitled to receive a
pension equivalent to 1/45th of his final pensionable earnings for
each year of service, with a pro rata payment for part years,
subject to HMRC limits. Final pensionable earnings will be
determined by reference to his earnings immediately prior to him
ceasing to be chief executive. The scheme also provides a cash
lump sum accrual. 
The pension arrangements for Rooney Anand, Justin Adams, Ian
Bull, David Elliott and, whilst he was a director, Mark Angela are on
a defined contribution basis. They all have self-invested personal
pension schemes to which the company makes a contribution. A
scheme will also be established in due course for Jonathan
Lawson. Contribution rates for the directors are 25% for Rooney
Anand, as chief executive, and David Elliott, on an age-related
basis, and 20% for the remainder of the executive directors. No
element of remuneration other than annual pay is treated as
pensionable and the retirement age for the schemes is sixty.
Justin Adams, David Elliott and Jonathan Lawson participate and,
whilst he was a director, Mark Angela participated in a group
death-in-service insurance scheme. Death benefits in excess of
the HMRC maximum, where applicable, were provided through
additional insurance. Since A-Day, life assurance provision for
Rooney Anand and Ian Bull has been through an HMRC approved
excepted life policy. The cost of this insurance is disclosed as a
non-cash benefit in the emoluments table below. 
Executive share option scheme
Executive directors and other senior employees are rewarded for
delivering long-term performance by the phased granting of
share options. The group's executive share option scheme offers
the executive directors an annual grant with a value up to the
level of their annual pay. In certain exceptional situations, the
remuneration committee can issue shares with an exercise cost
up to 2
1 / 2
times annual pay. The committee approves all grants of
share options to directors and does not grant options at a
discount to the prevailing closing price.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
63
GREENE KING ANNUAL REPORT 2006/07  Options can only be exercised between the third and tenth
anniversary of the date of grant and then only if the stretching
performance conditions have been met. These conditions relate
to the growth in audited adjusted earnings per share. Awards
granted prior to September 2005 require growth to exceed RPI
inflation by 3% per annum, measured over any of the periods of
3, 4 or 5 financial years of the company, starting with the year in
which the award is granted. Awards granted from September
2005 onwards require growth to exceed RPI inflation by 4% per
annum compound, measured over the period of 3 consecutive
financial years of the company, starting with the year in which
the award is granted.
Earnings per share growth has been chosen as the most
appropriate performance measure as it directly aligns the
individual incentive arrangement with the long-term interests of
shareholders. The specific performance measures were selected
to ensure that options can only be exercised if shareholders had
first benefited from material earnings growth in real terms over a
number of years. 
Long-term incentive plan
The company also operates a long-term incentive plan (LTIP) for
the benefit of the executive directors and a limited number of
senior executives, to reward them for delivering superior long-
term performance. No executive director will in any year receive
an award which is greater than their annual pay.
The awards granted under the LTIP will only vest if the company’s
growth in earnings per share is equal to or greater than the
increase in RPI plus 4% per annum compound over the three
consecutive financial years starting immediately before the
award. At this level, 25% of the award (rounded down to the
nearest 1,000 shares) will vest.
100% of the award will vest if the company’s growth in earnings
per share is greater than the increase in RPI plus 10% per annum
over the same three-year period. There is a pro-rata scale
(rounded down to the nearest 1,000 shares) between the
minimum level of RPI plus 4% and the maximum level of RPI plus
10%. If the targets are not met, the award will lapse.
As with the executive share option scheme, earnings per share
growth has been chosen as the most appropriate performance
measure as it directly aligns with the long-term interests of
shareholders. The performance target will be reviewed for
subsequent awards by the remuneration committee to ensure
that it is sufficiently challenging.
Employee share schemes
In common with all other employees, the executive directors are
also entitled to participate in the sharesave and share incentive
schemes, which are offered once each year by the company.
Further details of these schemes are given later in this report,
together with the directors’ entitlements under them.
Remuneration from other companies
Until 1 March 2007 Rooney Anand served as a non-executive
director of Pursuit Dynamics plc, a company unconnected with
the group, and was entitled to receive and retain for his
personal benefit £30k per annum from that company by way of
director's fees. 
Remuneration for non-executive directors
The fees paid to the chairman and the other non-executive
directors are determined by the board as a whole. They are
agreed after taking external advice and making market
comparisons, and relate to the services of the directors in
connection with the company’s business. The non-executive
directors do not have service agreements and cannot participate
in the pension scheme, the bonus scheme or the share option
schemes. 
Service agreements
Newly appointed executive directors are offered a service
agreement with a notice period of one year. In the event of the
employment of an executive director being terminated, the
committee would pay due regard to best practice and take
account of the individual’s duty to mitigate their loss. 
Rooney Anand, Justin Adams, Ian Bull, David Elliott and Jonathan
Lawson, whose contracts with the company commenced on 6
August 2001, 5 September 2005, 9 January 2006, 3 November
1998, and 10 April 2007 respectively, are all subject to one year
notice periods. Those contracts do not contain any additional
terms relating to compensation for termination of employment.
The terms of Rooney Anand's appointment as chief executive
were agreed and set out in a letter dated 24 December 2004.
Mark Angela's employment with the company ended on 16 April
2007. Details of the payments made to him after termination of
his contract are set out in the directors' emoluments section.

1992, receives a pension of £15,527.20 pa in excess of his scheme entitlements. As required by law, both of these figures are stated net
of their company-funded pension in payment at 31 March 1997.

All figures adjusted for 2-for-1 share split in September 2005
* The figures in the table represent the facts as at the last date of Mark Angela's employment, 16 April 2007. Subsequent to the year end,
the remuneration committee determined that Mark Angela should be permitted to exercise the options granted to him in August 2004, for
a period of six months following the date of the remuneration committee's decision. The options granted in 2005 and 2006 lapsed.
No options were exercised and no changes were made during the period to the terms and conditions of any options then outstanding
(2006: 184,000 options exercised for a total gain of £681,420) . Since the year end, there have been no options exercised and no other
changes to the date of this report. 
Options can only be exercised if a performance condition has been met. This condition relates to the growth in audited adjusted earnings
per share and is as follows:
• for options granted on or after 4 January 2002 and prior to September 2005, the growth must exceed RPI inflation by 3% per annum
compound, measured over any of the periods of 3, 4 or 5 consecutive financial years of the company, starting with the year in which the
award is granted,
• for options granted during or after September 2005, the growth must exceed RPI inflation by 4% per annum compound, measured over
the period of 3 consecutive financial years of the company, starting with the year in which the award is granted. Long-term incentive plan

All figures adjusted for two-for-one share split in September 2005
* The figures in this table represent the facts as at the last date of Mark Angela's employment, on 16 April 2007. Subsequent to the year
end, the remuneration committee determined, as permitted by the rules of the scheme, that he should be entitled to receive a proportion
of the benefits due to him under the 2004 LTIP award, based on his length of service since the date of the award, taking into account
the extent to which the performance condition had been met during the relevant period. The 2005 and 2006 awards lapsed.
The adjusted market price of the shares on 9 October 2003 was 431.75p, on 10 December 2004 was 635p, on 4 August 2005 was 655.5p
and on 2 August 2006 was 813p.
All awards granted under the LTIP will only vest if the company’s growth in earnings per share is equal to or greater than the increase in
RPI plus 4% per annum compound over the three consecutive financial years starting immediately before the award. At this level, 25% of
the award (rounded down to the nearest 1,000 shares) will vest.
100% of the award will vest if the company’s growth in earnings per share is greater than the increase in RPI plus 10% per annum over
the same three year period. There is a pro-rata scale (rounded down to the nearest 1,000 shares) between the minimum level of RPI plus
4% and the maximum level of RPI plus 10%. If the targets are not met, the award will lapse.
Details of the awards which vested during the year, the notional gain before tax achieved by each director and the number of shares
retained on vesting are shown below. Total gains made by directors under the LTIP in the period ended 29 April 2007 amounted to
£1,679,430 (2006 - nil)

Sharesave scheme
The company has operated an HMRC approved sharesave scheme for a number of years. Options are granted over the company’s ordinary
shares, at an option price which, at board discretion, is at a discount of up to 20 per cent of the closing price at the time of granting.
The company has historically granted all such options at a 20 per cent discount. 
The directors’ interests in options granted under the sharesave scheme were as follows:

All figures adjusted for the 2-for-1 share split in September 2005
* The figures in the table represent the facts at the time of his departure. Following his departure these options lapsed.
Mark Angela exercised an option over 2,628 shares at a price of 351p per share on 2 April 2007, when the closing price of the company's
shares was 1104p, so achieving a notional gain of £19,789. He retained the shares issued to him on the exercise of the options. David
Elliott’s option can be exercised between 1 April and 30 September 2009. Justin Adams' option can be exercised between 1 April and 30
September 2012. 
All options outstanding at 29 April 2007 were granted at an option price below the year-end closing price.
Share incentive plan
The company operates an HMRC approved share incentive plan, in which free shares are appropriated annually in September to reward
employees who at the date of appropriation were employed throughout the whole of the previous financial year and remain employed on
the appropriation date. The number of shares each participating employee receives is determined by reference to the year-on-year increase
in the company’s profits. The directors’ beneficial interests in Greene King shares resulting from participation in this scheme are reflected
in their shareholding data in the directors' report, and the expected value of their entitlements for the 2006/7 year is included in non-cash
benefits in the remuneration table, as the shares have not yet been awarded.
Shareholders will be asked to vote on this remuneration report, as an ordinary resolution, at the company’s AGM.
Approved by the board of directors on 2 July 2007.
Howard Phillips
Chairman of the remuneration committee
2 July 2007 Governance structure
The board
The board considers that it is vital to ensure that there is an
appropriate range of skills and experience among its members,
and that the objectivity and integrity of members should be
exemplary. The board currently comprises a non-executive
chairman, five other non-executive directors and five executive
directors. The directors’ biographies are on page 18.
There have been a number of changes during the year. Ian Durant
joined the board as a non-executive director on 16 March 2007
and Jonathan Lawson as managing director of the local pubs
division on 10 April 2007. Alan Bowkett retired on 1 September
2006 and Mark Angela left on 16 April 2007.
All of the directors are subject to election by shareholders at the
first annual general meeting after their appointment to the board
and to re-election by shareholders every three years thereafter.
In addition, any non-executive director who has served for more
than nine years is subject to annual re-election.
The division of responsibilities between the chairman and the
chief executive has been clearly established, set out in writing
and agreed by the board. The job descriptions are available on
request. The chairman has primary responsibility for running the
board and devotes such time to his role as is necessary to
properly discharge his duties. The chief executive has
responsibility for executing the company's strategy and achieving
operational and financial goals.
The board has a formal schedule of matters which are reserved
for its decision, including approval of the long term objectives and
strategy, approval of budgets and financial statements including
the report and accounts, acquisitions and disposals, changes to
the structure of the group and overall corporate governance
issues. It reviews trading performance and considers major capital
expenditure and acquisition opportunities. Management is
delegated the task of the detailed planning and implementation
of the company's strategy. 
Information and training
Full and timely information is provided to the board to enable it to
properly discharge its functions. All directors have access to the
advice and services of the company secretary and are provided
with the opportunity to question management as required.
Explanations of issues and legislative changes affecting the
industry have been provided to the board during the year. 
The training needs of the board are regularly reviewed. There is
an agreed procedure, set out in writing, for directors, in
furtherance of their duties, to take independent professional
advice at the company’s expense. The company has in place
directors' and officers' liability insurance.
Newly-appointed directors receive a full and appropriate
induction on joining the board to acquaint them with the
company, the board and the relevant policies and procedures. This
takes the form of meetings with other board members and the
provision of an induction pack containing relevant information.
Performance evaluation
The board believes it is appropriate to undertake a regular
performance evaluation of the board, its committees and
individual directors. This is done when deemed appropriate by
means of a questionnaire distributed to all board members,
covering a wide range of matters including board structure and
composition, board processes, communications with shareholders
and corporate governance matters, the responses to which are
then discussed with the directors by the chairman and the chief
executive. An evaluation was undertaken at the beginning of the
financial year. The board is satisfied that an open dialogue exists
between all board members enabling issues to be raised and dealt
with as they occur rather than waiting for the next formal
evaluation process, and accordingly believes that it and its
committees are operating effectively.
The performance of Tim Bridge, chairman, was also reviewed at
the beginning of the financial year. The process was conducted
by the non-executive directors, led by Howard Phillips, the senior
non-executive director, taking into account the views of the
executive directors.
The performance of the executive directors is reviewed annually
by the remuneration committee in conjunction with their annual
pay review and the payment of bonuses.
Independence of non-executive directors
The non-executive directors have a particular responsibility to
ensure that the strategies proposed by the executive directors
are carefully examined and fully discussed. Their independence
and objectivity are of paramount importance. The board believes
that they all have a range of skills and experience which will help
the company and that their understanding of the company, its
strategy and operations increases over the years.
The board is satisfied that all of the non-executive directors were
independent throughout the year, being free from any
relationship with the executive management which could result
in any conflict or affect their independent judgment, and that
they all remained independent in character and judgment. Alan
Bowkett, who joined the board as a non-executive director in
1993, retired at the AGM in September last year.
None of the independent non-executive directors participates in
the share option schemes or long-term incentive plan operated by
the company and none was dependent on the fees received from
the company as their primary source of income.
The senior independent non-executive director is Howard Phillips,
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

GREENE KING ANNUAL REPORT 2006/07  72
GREENE KING ANNUAL REPORT 2006/07 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
who was appointed to the board in June 1998, has never been
employed by the company and has had diverse business interests.
The board considers that he remains independent from
management in both character and judgment, that his
performance continues to be effective and that he continues to
demonstrate commitment to the role. Howard Phillips has served
more than nine years on the board and so will be subject to re-
election at the forthcoming AGM. He was asked to remain on the
board for a further year, until the AGM in 2008, to provide
continuity at a time of a number of board changes.
Tim Bridge took over as chairman of the board on 2 May 2005.
The board noted that, because of his long tenure as a director, he
did not meet all of the independence criteria set out in the
combined code. However, the board was, and remains, confident
that the strength of character and independent judgement that
he exhibited as chief executive would continue in his role as
chairman. The board is satisfied that his performance as chairman
is effective and that he demonstrates continued commitment to
the role. Tim Bridge is also a non-executive director of William
Ransom & Son plc and Weatherbys Ventures Limited but these
are not regarded as significant commitments and do not impact
upon his ability to perform his role as chairman effectively.
Meetings and attendance
Board meetings are scheduled to be held nine times a year. There
is also a strategy day and a pub away-day for the full board each
year. Between meetings, as required, the board can be in frequent
contact to progress the company’s business and if necessary,
board meetings can be held at short notice. Where possible,
however, ad hoc committees of the board are appointed to deal
with matters which it is known will need to be dealt with
between scheduled board meetings. If directors are unable to
attend meetings they are given the opportunity to be consulted
and comment in advance of the meeting. The chairman holds
regular informal meetings with the non-executive directors
without the executive directors being present.
The table below sets out the attendance record of each director at scheduled board and board committee meetings during the year.

(6) Jane Scriven was appointed as a member of the remuneration committee with effect from 23 November 2006. She has attended

The board has established an audit committee, a remuneration
committee and a nomination committee, each of which has
formal terms of reference governing its method of operation.
Each of the terms of reference, which are available on request
and will be available for inspection at the annual general
meeting, reflect the provisions of the combined code and have
been approved by the board.
Set out below are reports from each of the nomination
committee, audit committee and remuneration committee.
Nomination committee report
During the year the nomination committee was chaired by Tim
Bridge, and the other members of the committee were Alan
Bowkett (until his retirement), Howard Phillips and Norman
Murray. Apart from the chairman, all members were considered by
the board to be independent.
The committee's role is to propose candidates for appointment to
the board, to review regularly the structure, size and composition
of the board and make recommendations to the board with regard
to any adjustments that are deemed necessary. 
The committee met three times during the year, with two of the
meetings being held to deal with the appointment of the new
directors. The chief executive, at the request of the committee,
attends its meetings.
The appointment of Ian Durant as a non-executive director was
made following a search by external search consultants, who
were employed to assist in the process by drawing up a short list
of candidates. The chairman, chief executive and all the non-
executive directors were then given the opportunity to meet Ian
Durant. Having considered his other commitments and on
receiving confirmation that he would accept the appointment, the
committee recommended his appointment to the board from 16
March 2007.
The appointment of Jonathan Lawson as managing director of the
local pubs division was made following a search by external
search consultants, who were employed to assist in the process
by drawing up a short list of candidates. The chairman and chief
executive interviewed him and recommended his appointment to
the committee. Having considered his qualifications and
experience and on receiving confirmation that he would accept
the appointment, the committee recommended his appointment
to the board from 10 April 2007.
All directors are subject to re-election by shareholders following
their appointment and subsequently in every third year. The
nomination committee undertakes a review of all directors who
are due for re-election to determine whether or not to recommend
their re-appointment. 
Audit committee report
The audit committee is chaired by Norman Murray and the other
members of the committee during the year were Alan Bowkett
(until his retirement), Howard Phillips (until 27 April), Jane Scriven,
John Brady and Ian Durant (the latter two from 16 March). All
members are considered by the board to be independent. The
board is satisfied that Norman Murray has recent and relevant
financial experience, being a chartered accountant who has
already chaired audit committees of other UK listed companies
and is also currently President of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of Scotland.
The role of the audit committee is to review the results of the full
year audit and approve the interim results in each case prior to
their submission to the board. It is also responsible for reviewing
the company's internal financial control and risk management
systems, advising the board on the appointment of external
auditors, overseeing the relationship with the external auditors,
reviewing the company's whistleblowing procedures and
considering the need for a full internal audit function. 
The committee had three meetings during the year and on each
occasion the finance director attended. The external auditors
attended all of the meetings. In addition, the chairman of the
committee regularly meets with the external audit partner to
discuss matters relevant to the company.
The audit committee continuously monitors the relationship
with the auditors and assesses their performance, cost-
effectiveness, objectivity and independence. It agrees the
scope of the audit work and discusses the results of the full
year audit and interim review each year. The board is satisfied
that the auditors are independent of the company and that best
practice is being observed.
During the year the company made limited use of specialist
teams within Ernst & Young LLP for non-audit work such as
taxation advice and transaction support. The audit committee
has established a policy in relation to the use of Ernst & Young
LLP for non-audit work. The company will award non-audit work
to the firm which provides the best commercial solution for the
work in question. Pieces of work estimated to be in excess of an
agreed level are put out to tender unless agreed otherwise by
the chairman of the audit committee. Limits of authority have
been placed on the ability of the finance director and the
chairman of the audit committee to approve specific
engagements, with fees in excess of those limits being subject
to approval of the committee.
The company has a limited internal audit function which focuses
on the group's managed house divisions, where the greatest
financial risks are perceived to exist. Elsewhere within the group
a combination of the external audit procedures and the types of
financial risks involved are felt to be such that a wider internal
audit function is not required.

Remuneration committee report
During the year the remuneration committee was chaired by
Howard Phillips and the other members were Alan Bowkett (until
his retirement), Norman Murray and Jane Scriven (from 23
November 2006). All the members were considered by the board
to be independent. 
The role of the committee includes determining the remuneration
policy for the executive directors and the chairman and fixing the
total individual remuneration package of each of the executive
directors, considering the granting of share options and awards
under the long-term incentive plan and determining bonuses
payable to the executive directors.
The remuneration committee met three times during the year.
The chairman and the chief executive, at the request of the
committee, attend its meetings. The chairman does not
participate in any discussions relating to his own remuneration.
The chief executive is consulted by the committee on its
proposals, but does not participate in any discussions relating to
his own remuneration.
Details of the company's policies on remuneration, service
contracts and compensation payments are set out in the
remuneration report on pages 63 to 70.
Communication with shareholders
Shareholder communication is regarded as a key priority for the
board, with the annual report and interim statements being the
principal media used. In addition, the AGM is fully utilised as a
means of communicating directly with private shareholders, who
have a full opportunity to ask questions. The board aims to
ensure that all members of the board, including in particular the
chairmen of the board committees, are available to answer
questions at the AGM.
All substantive items of business at shareholders’ meetings are
dealt with under separate resolutions, including a resolution to
adopt the report and accounts. The chairman announces the
results of the proxy voting on each resolution after it has been
dealt with on a show of hands. The notice of meeting is issued in
compliance with both the articles and the combined code and is
sent to shareholders a minimum of twenty working days before
the meeting. 
There is a regular dialogue with institutional shareholders,
including meetings after the announcement of the year end and
interim results. The board receives regular reports from the chief
executive on the meetings he and the finance director have with
principal shareholders. The senior independent non-executive
director, Howard Phillips, is available to shareholders if they have
concerns about governance issues which the normal channels of
contact have failed to resolve.
The company maintains a web site (www.greeneking.co.uk) to
provide up-to-date, detailed information on the company’s
operations and brands, which includes a dedicated investor relations
section. All company announcements are available on this site, as
are copies of slides used for presentations to investment analysts.
Directors' responsibility statement
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and
the group and company financial statements, in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.
UK company law requires the directors to prepare group and
company financial statements for each financial year. Under that
law the directors are required to prepare the group financial
statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and
have elected to prepare the company financial statements in
accordance with UK Accounting Standards.
The group financial statements are required by law and IFRS as
adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position and
performance of the group. The company financial statements are
required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs
of the company.
The Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such financial
statements that references in the relevant part of that Act to
financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to
their achieving fair presentation.
In preparing each of the group and company financial statements,
the directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently.
• Make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
• For the group financial statements, state whether they have
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU.
• For the company financial statements, state whether applicable
UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any
material departures disclosed and explained in the company
financial statements.
• Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and the
company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that
its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.  They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group
and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also
responsible for preparing a directors’ report, directors’
remuneration report and corporate governance statement that
comply with that law and those regulations.
Going concern
The directors expect the group to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future and have, therefore, used
the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Internal control 
The board acknowledges its responsibility for the group's
systems of internal control and for reviewing their effectiveness.
Such systems can only be designed to manage, and not to
eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. They
can provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the
group’s assets are safeguarded and that the financial information
used within the business and for external reporting is reliable. 
The company has assessed the key risks to which it is exposed
and has formalised the control environment needed to address
these and other issues. There are processes in place which are in
accordance with the guidance of the Turnbull Committee on
internal control. The board has adopted a formal risk policy and
regularly reviews risk management and internal controls,
including key performance indicator data on the significant risks
faced. The executive directors routinely consider the effective
management of risk throughout the business at their regular
meetings. This group oversees the development of risk
management strategies, the implementation of suitable
management actions and monitors progress made. The audit
committee receives regular reports on risk issues within the
business. 
The board is ultimately responsible for the company’s system of
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. A formal
assessment of the risk and control environment in place during
the period and to the date of this report has been undertaken,
based on detailed reports from, and subsequent discussions with,
senior management. No significant problems were disclosed in
these reports.
The control environment comprises the elements set out below:
• Internal control and risk management process
The directors routinely monitor all aspects of risk management
and internal control, and regularly assess the data on the
significant risks faced. Major risks are identified, the financial
implications of each risk assessed and the adequacy and
effectiveness of the associated control environment analysed.
Any issues arising from this process are discussed with
operational management as needed. Appropriate steps are
then taken to mitigate and monitor the effect of these risks.
Data on the key exposures is reviewed regularly by the
executive directors and the audit committee of the board.
• Internal audit
The controls over the group’s managed houses are enhanced by
an internal audit team and the availability of comprehensive
information from the EPOS till system. On behalf of the board,
the audit committee assesses the scope of the internal audit
functions within the group, including seeking the views of the
external auditors.
• Annual budgets
Detailed annual budgets covering all financial aspects of the
group’s business are evaluated and approved by the board. The
actual results are compared against these budgets on a four-
weekly basis and variances analysed in order that any
appropriate action can be taken.
• Capital and project control
There are clearly defined evaluation and approval processes for
acquisitions and disposals, capital expenditure and project
control. These include escalating levels of authority, detailed
appraisal and review procedures and post-completion reviews
of all major projects to compare the actual outcome with the
original plan. Certain transactions are reserved for approval by
the board. Limits of delegated responsibility and areas of
authority have been identified for employees.
• External audit
The audit committee reports to the board on matters discussed
with the auditors during the course of the statutory audit and
interim review.
Exception summary
The company is committed to ensuring that high standards of
corporate governance are maintained. The board considers that
the company has complied with the combined code, except in the
following areas. 
A.3.2
A.3.2 requires that at least half the board, excluding the chairman,
should comprise independent non-executive directors. During the
period from 1 September, when Alan Bowkett retired, to 16
March, when Ian Durant was appointed as a new non-executive
director, this requirement was not met, in that during that time
the board comprised the chairman, four non-executive directors
and five executive directors. The board believes that the process
of recruiting non-executive directors should not be hurried and it
was keen to select the right person irrespective of time.

GREENE KING ANNUAL REPORT 2006/07 
Appendix 1
Summary of proposed changes
to the articles of association
General
The proposed amendments reflect recent changes in the law in
relation to the electronic communications regime and certain
other minor consequential changes required by the Companies
Act 2006 (the "Act").
Existing company legislation permits companies to communicate
with shareholders electronically in respect of certain types of
information. However, the Act allows all shareholder information
(including company notices, documents and other information) to
be sent by or to companies either in hard copy, electronic form
(such as email or fax) and, in certain cases, by publication on a
website. If shareholders are invited to agree that a company may
send or supply shareholder information by means of a website,
those who do not respond within 28 days are deemed to have
agreed to a company communicating shareholder information to
them by means of a website. Where shareholders agree (or are
deemed to have agreed) to communication of shareholder
information by means of a website, they must be notified by post
(or, where applicable, email) of the availability of the relevant
documents or information on the website, together with all
relevant access details.
Shareholders should note that the company does not propose to
alter its current method of inviting shareholders to consent to
electronic communications at this stage. However, the new
legislation provides for maximum flexibility in the future. If the
company does seek to implement these changes, specific consent
will be sought from shareholders at that time. 
Interpretation
Certain definitions and expressions used throughout the articles
been amended, and others added, to align them with definitions
used in the Act. Where the articles referred to provisions of the
Companies Act 1995 which have been repealed, amendments are
proposed so that the articles refer instead to the replacement
provisions.
Authentication of documents by electronic means
The proposed amendments to articles 69, 88, 122 and 142 derive
from the company communication provisions in the Act, providing
for the authentication of documents sent by electronic means.
Electronic proxies and written resolutions of directors
The proposed amendments to articles 70 and 96 clarify that a
proxy or written resolution of the directors can be passed using
electronic means.
Communications with members
The company communication provisions of the Act provide a
mandatory statutory regime for communications by and to a
company. However, certain provisions of the Act may be
overridden and the proposed amendments to article 137, as well
as extending the company communication provisions to
communications provided under the articles ensuring consistency
with the Act, also provide that the existing deemed delivery
times for notices will continue.
Joint holders, deceased and bankrupt members
The proposed new articles 138 and 139 override the statutory
regime in the Act in relation to joint holders, deceased and
bankrupt members. They are clearer and more favourable to the
company than the equivalent provisions in the Act, and reflect the
substance of the existing articles (but extend the scope of the
provisions to all documents and information to which a
shareholder is entitled, not merely notices).
Overseas members
The proposed amendments to article 140 will mean that the
company will continue not to be required to send notices,
documents and information to a shareholder who has not
supplied a postal address within the United Kingdom, subject to
the provisions of the Act. 
Suspension of postal services
The proposed amendments to article 141 ensure that notice of a
meeting is deemed given by advertisement of a notice in a
newspaper in situations where, because of a postal strike, the
company is unable to send out hard copies of the notice of
meeting.
Notes
1 To be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting (and for the
purpose of the determination by the company of the number
of votes they may cast), members must be entered on the
company’s register at 12 noon on 2 September 2007, or, if the
meeting is adjourned, 48 hours before the time fixed for the
adjourned meeting. Changes to the register after 12 noon on
2 September 2007 will be disregarded in determining the
rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
2 Every member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting is
entitled to appoint one or more proxies to attend and, on a
poll, vote instead of them. A proxy need not be a member.
Any instrument appointing a proxy (a form is included with
this notice) together with the power of attorney or other
authority (if any) under which it is signed must be received
by the registrar not less than 48 hours before the time
appointed for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting. 78

share scheme can instruct the trustees to vote on their
behalf by completing the form of direction.

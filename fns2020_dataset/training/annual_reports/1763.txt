years. This allows all shareholders to have their votes recognised

In 2010, we anticipate growth for three of our four operating groups, whilst at Land & Armaments return on sales will
improve as rationalisation and efficiency programmes progress. In aggregate, and despite a planned lower level of
land vehicle activity , the Group continues to expect growth for 2010 based on constant exchange rate assumptions.

BAE Systems Annual Report 2009 3
The composition of the Board
2
and its committees continues to evolve. 
In August, the Group announced that Sir Nigel Rudd, a non-executive
director , would retire from the BAE Systems plc Board with effect from
31 December 2009. Carl Symon, a non-executive director , has been
appointed chairman of the Board’ s remuneration committee in place
of Sir Nigel. Phil Carroll, also a non-executive director , will retire at this
year’ s Annual General Meeting. I would like to thank Nigel and Phil for the
valuable contribution they have both made to the Board. T o ensure that
we maintain the necessary range of skills, knowledge and experience 
on the Board, two new non-executive directors, Paul Anderson and
Nick Rose, have recently joined the Board.
The Group announced the resignation of Walt Havenstein in June. Walt
was a director of BAE Systems plc, and Chief Operating Officer , President
and Chief Executive Officer of BAE Systems, Inc. Linda Hudson was
appointed as Walt’ s successor in October . 
Following consultation with members of the Board, the nominations
committee proposed that my office as a non-executive director and
chairman of the Board be extended until May 2013 subject to
shareholder approval.
The performance of the business reflects the valuable work performed 
by our highly dedicated workforce in support of our customers and, in
particular , those who work to maintain the security of ourselves and
others at home and around the globe. It was particularly gratifying to 
see the efforts of two of our 106,900 people recognised through formal
citations, including George Thompson, Business Development Director ,
BAE Systems Surface Ships, who was made an Officer of the Order of
the British Empire (OBE) for services to the shipbuilding industry, and
Glen Chappelle, a recently retired project manager with Global Combat
Systems in Glascoed, who was made a Member of the Order of the
British Empire (MBE) for services to the defence industry and to
industrial heritage.
Complementing this external recognition, we have for some years
operated a highly successful scheme for employees within BAE Systems,
the Chairman’ s Award for Innovation. The scheme now generates over
two thousand entries annually, encouraging and recognising innovation
across the Group.
BAE Systems is a conservatively managed business with a large order
book and long-term visibility across a large part of its broad business
base. The Board has recommended a final dividend of 9.6p making
a total of 16.0p for the year , an increase of 10% over 2008. At this
level, the annual dividend is covered 2.5 times by underlying earnings
(2008 2.6 times). Subject to shareholder approval at the 2010 Annual
General Meeting, the dividend will be paid on 1 June 2010 to holders
of ordinary shares registered on 23 April 2010.
Dick Olver Chairman
BAE Systems continues to build successfully on its position as one of
the world’ s largest, and most geographically diverse, defence companies. 
The Group comprises a broadly-based portfolio of businesses focused,
through a clearly defined strategy
1
, on the provision of defence, security
and aerospace capabilities in its global home markets. This strategy is
delivering good results from the Group’ s operations. 
Although constrained by weakened economies, defence and security 
are expected to remain a priority focus for governments across our home
markets. We will continue to seek growth in value for shareholders, but 
we are not complacent as to the challenges of the near term. Recognising
the economic difficulties facing many of our customers, BAE Systems will
continue to work closely with its customers to address their increasingly
complex and often urgent requirements in the most cost-effective and
affordable way .
On 5 February 2010, the Company announced a global settlement with
the UK Serious Fraud Office and the US Department of Justice, which
concluded the lengthy investigations commenced by those two authorities
in 2004 and 2007, respectively .
Pursuant to the agreement with the Department of Justice, the Company
agreed to plead guilty to one charge of conspiring to make false
statements to the US government relating to certain regulatory filings and
undertakings. The Company agreed to pay a fine of $400m (£248m) and
make additional commitments to the Department of Justice concerning
its ongoing compliance. Under the agreement with the Serious Fraud
Office, the Company agreed to plead guilty to one charge of breach of
duty to keep accounting records in relation to payments made to a former
marketing adviser in connection with the sale of a radar system by the
Company to T anzania in 1999. The Company agreed in relation to this
matter to pay an agreed penalty of £30m comprising a fine to be
determined by the Court with the balance paid as a charitable payment 
for the benefit of T anzania.
The Company very much regrets and accepts full responsibility for these
past shortcomings. These settlements enable the Company to deal
finally with significant legacy issues. In recent years, the Company has
systematically enhanced its compliance policies and processes with a
view to ensuring that the Company is as widely recognised for responsible
conduct as it is for high quality products and advanced technologies.
We continue to work to establish the highest standards of governance
in BAE Systems, and in this report, we describe the processes and
assurance that underpin our approach (see pages 78 to 84). I am pleased
to report that work to embed the highest standards of responsible
business conduct across the Group has progressed well, including an
accelerated implementation of the Woolf Committee recommendations.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
– Continued good demand for
high-technology capabilities
– Further significant multi-year
support contracts awarded
– Delivering growth from combat
aircraft programmes
– T ransitioning from peak activity
in land systems
Ian King Chief Executive
“BAE Systems has evolved to become one
of the world’ s leading defence companies
and is well positioned to weather
the pressures in its global markets. ” BAE Systems Annual Report 2009 5
The good operating performance of
BAE Systems in 2009 reflects the good
progress the Group has made in recent years,
developing the business within a well-defined
and consistently implemented strategic
framework
1
. That strategy underpins the
Group’ s aim to deliver sustainable growth
in shareholder value through a commitment
to T otal Performance for all its customers.
In June, BAE Systems completed the acquisition of Advanced Ceramics
Research, Inc. for $14m (£9m). The acquisition supports BAE Systems’
global Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) strategy, adding small UAS
platforms and ground segment capability to complement the Group’ s
existing UAS capabilities. 
A setback for the Group was the notification by the US Department of
Defense in August 2009 and, following a re-evaluation of the bids, in
February 2010 that a follow-on production contract for vehicles under
the Family of Medium T actical Vehicles (FMTV) programme had been lost. 
UK and rest of world business 
The outlook for UK defence spending remains difficult, but the Group has
a large order book reflecting the firmly contracted long-term programmes
that are a feature of BAE Systems’ UK-based business. 
The largest of those programmes, the T yphoon combat aircraft, is set
for further growth with increasing deliveries to both the four European
partner nations and to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 
BAE Systems is a leader in the provision of multi-year , capability-based,
support solutions. Approximately 40% of BAE Systems’ sales in 2009
are Readiness & Sustainment related activity. In addition to established
relationships in the UK, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Australia,
BAE Systems seeks to migrate its Readiness & Sustainment capabilities
to other markets. 
New multi-year UK support contracts were awarded in the year totalling
over £2bn. Such contracts included support and maintenance of Harrier
and T yphoon aircraft in service with the Royal Air Force, the T ype 45 anti-
air warfare destroyer (the Group’ s first major UK ship support contract),
and Spearfish and Sting Ray torpedoes in service with the Royal Air Force
and Royal Navy, respectively. 
The governments of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United
Kingdom also agreed detailed arrangements to provide support for
T yphoon operations for a three-year period. These arrangements will be
operated through a full availability service contract with BAE Systems.
Eight T yphoon aircraft were delivered in the year to the Saudi customer
under the 2007 Salam production contract.
In July, contracts were agreed by the four European partner nations
for 88 T ranche 3A T yphoon aircraft with a contract value to the Group
of approximately £2bn. The contracts extend visibility of T yphoon
production for the next five years. 
BAE Systems is also a significant participant on the US F-35 (Joint Strike
Fighter) programme with the combination of both airframe assembly
manufacture in the UK and electronic systems supplied from the
Group’ s US operations. The F-35 is expected to progress to high
volume production over the coming years. 
BAE Systems is a resilient business, well positioned to weather the
pressures that result from the recent turbulence in global economies.
The Group operates primarily in its seven home markets, and has a wide
portfolio of products and capabilities serving defence customers across
the air , land and sea domains. Many of the Group’ s programmes are
subject to long-term contracts, and some include agreements designed
to address and safeguard national capabilities. 
Alongside its established defence-related activities, BAE Systems has
a growing position in national security with a focus on information-based
intelligence capabilities. The acquisition of Detica in September 2008
was a further step in the implementation of the Group’ s security strategy.
BAE Systems is well placed to address opportunities in security
markets, such as increasing focus on cyber threats. 
The Group’ s geographic spread of business extends the diversity of its
customer base. The strategy, to identify long-term sustainable markets
around the globe and address those markets by building local industrial
positions, is working to good effect. India has been identified as the Group’ s
seventh home market and, in November , an agreement was signed with
Mahindra & Mahindra to establish a joint venture in land systems.
Rapid changes in the nature and evolution of threats around the world
have resulted in corresponding changes in priorities for many of the
Group’ s customers. BAE Systems recognises that agility in addressing
customers’ requirements is becoming a key competitive discriminator . 
Defence budgets in both the UK and the US are expected to come under
further pressure, and with expectations of a more challenging business
environment ahead, the focus on driving performance and efficiency in
the business will be key . Cost reduction measures are being aggressively
implemented across the Group. 
US business
In the US, overall defence spending remains robust but the investment
accounts, from which the Group derives significant business, are expected
to be stressed by the continued cost of high tempo operations and rising
manpower costs.
In April 2009, the US Secretary of Defense announced a reprioritisation
of programmes that is expected to continue to shape US defence
procurement. Many of BAE Systems’ activities are well aligned to those
announced priority changes. In February 2010, the US Quadrennial
Defense Review was published along with the US defence budget for the
Fiscal Y ear 2011 (FY11). The FY11 base budget identifies an increase
of 3.4% and within this base budget the investment account allocations
were at the upper end of the Group’ s planning assumptions.
The Group’ s high technology capabilities in the US are expected
to continue to be in demand. The business has a strong record of
innovation, rapidly generating advanced, but cost effective, solutions
to address complex problems. 
1. We understand and support our customers’ national security and
other requirements;
2. We assess carefully our products and services with the objective that
neither BAE Systems nor our customers are exposed to significant
reputational risk;
3. We work to BAE Systems’ values in all that we do; and
4. We are as open as practicable about the nature of our business.
RESPONSIBLE TRADING PRINCIPLES

STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK p10 DIRECTORS’ REPORT: BUSINESS REVIEW OVERVIEW
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED

seek improvements to safety across all aspects of our business. The
Product Safety Review we recently announced, headed by Nigel Whitehead,
Group Managing Director , Programmes & Support, further demonstrates
the importance we place on safety . We will work with our customer , the UK
Ministry of Defence, to ensure that any learning benefits our current and
future workload.
We are also deeply saddened to report the death of one of our employees
during deployment of communications equipment in Australia. We are
reviewing the cause of this accident and co-operating fully with the
regulatory investigation.
BAE Systems aims to achieve leadership standards of responsible
business conduct through its programme to address the 23
recommendations of the Woolf Report. As a consequence, we reviewed
all Group policies and governance processes during 2009, and have
incorporated appropriate changes in the Operational Framework
effective January 2010. A further key focus during 2009 was the rolling-
out of a Group-wide Code of Conduct for employees as part of the drive
to embed high standards of business conduct.
In addition, we have also launched Responsible T rading Principles
(see page 5). All trading is to be undertaken in accordance with
these principles and consistency of this approach is key in defining
BAE Systems’ reputation. T ogether with our global Code of Conduct,
these underpin the way we do business. 
BAE Systems is not complacent and recognises the difficulties in
the wider economies in which it operates, but it is a broadly-based
and robust business with a large order book. It has been agile in
developing the business, adapting its capabilities in anticipation
of changing requirements. 
The result is a continuously evolving business with a good track record
of identifying and exploiting growth opportunities whilst re-focusing the
business towards the future priority needs of our customers. 
Ian King Chief Executive
In October , BAE Systems completed the acquisition of VT Group’ s 45%
shareholding in BVT , creating a wholly-owned subsidiary , BAE Systems
Surface Ships Limited. The acquisition followed an agreement with the
UK Ministry of Defence in July defining a T erms of Business Agreement
setting out a 15-year partnering arrangement, including lead roles for the
business on defined surface shipbuilding and support programmes. A
significant element of the workload underpinned by this agreement is the
manufacture of the Royal Navy’ s new class of two 65,000 tonne aircraft
carriers. Following award of manufacturing contracts, steel cutting
commenced in July , marking the start of build of the first of class. The
Royal Navy also saw Astute, the first of a new class of nuclear powered
attack submarines, commence sea trials in November . 
BAE Systems identifies unmanned systems as an increasing priority
amongst its customers, driven by rapidly evolving requirements often
to meet urgent operational needs. BAE Systems is developing a range
of unmanned system solutions to meet those requirements. 
In the UK, the Group is developing three unmanned air platforms. A small
high endurance air system, Herti, has been operationally deployed. A large
twin-engined air platform, Mantis, commenced flight trials in October just
19 months after conception. A third development platform, T aranis,
a stealthy unmanned combat air system, is in-build. 
People and Total Performance
BAE Systems is dependent on the skills and capabilities of its people.
The Group sets high standards for the training and development of
employees, and is a major employer of apprentices and graduates. The
Group maintains robust processes for career development including
succession planning for its senior executives. 
Programme execution is an important and easily recognisable
embodiment of performance but, in addition, we target an integrated
approach to performance, embracing all aspects of our corporate
existence. The Group wants to be recognised as a company committed
to developing a culture of T otal Performance. Successfully embedding
this approach will be a key differentiator for the Group. T otal Performance
focuses not just on what we do but also how we do it. It is about
every aspect of the way we do business; Customer Focus, Financial
Performance, Programme Execution and Responsible Behaviour .
Delivery of the Group’ s Corporate Responsibility agenda is an essential
part of embedding a T otal Performance culture across the Group. 
Our focus on safety remains a top priority . The tragic loss of Nimrod XV230
over Afghanistan in 2006 and the subsequent Haddon-Cave report
published in October have only strengthened our resolve to continuously
The Executive Committee is the forum chaired by the Chief Executive in which the operating group and functional leaders

DIRECTORS’ REPORT: BUSINESS REVIEW GROUP PERFORMANCE

RISK MANAGEMENT
Effective management of risks and opportunities is essential to the delivery of the Group’ s objectives, achievement of sustainable shareholder value and protection of its reputation. The Group’ s approach to risk management is aimed at the early identification of key risks, and then removing or reducing the likelihood and effect of risks before they occur , and dealing effectively with them if they crystallise. The Group is committed to the protection of its assets, which include human, property and financial resources, through an effective risk management process, underpinned where appropriate by insurance. The Group is committed to the effective management of material non-financial and reputational risks, including those arising in connection with safety and ethical issues. Reporting and monitoring The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that risk is effectively managed across the Group. Reporting within the Group is structured so that key issues are escalated through the management team, ultimately to the Board if appropriate. The underlying principles of the Group’ s risk management policy are that risks are continuously monitored, associated action plans reviewed, appropriate contingencies provisioned and this information reported through established management control procedures. The Board has delegated: – to the Audit Committee, the responsibility for reviewing in detail the effectiveness of the Group’ s system of internal control policies and procedures for the identification, assessment and reporting of risk; and – to the Corporate Responsibility Committee, the responsibility for monitoring and reviewing the Group’ s performance in managing social, environmental, ethical and reputational risk. Both the Audit and Corporate Responsibility committees report the findings of their reviews to the Board.
Business risk management The responsibility for risk identification, analysis, evaluation, mitigation, reporting and monitoring rests with line management. Guidance for managers is given in the Group’ s Risk Management Policy in the Operational Framework and, in respect of projects, in the Lifecycle Management (LCM) Framework. Identified risks are documented in controlled risk registers showing: the risks that have been identified; characteristics of the risk; the basis for determining mitigation strategy; and what reviews and monitoring are necessary . Each risk is allocated an owner who has authority and responsibility for assessing and managing it. In addition, the Group has a six-monthly Operational Assurance Statement (OAS) process, which is mandated by the Group’ s Operational Framework. The OAS is in two parts: a self-assessment of compliance with the Operational Framework; and a report showing the key risks for the relevant business. T ogether with independent reviews undertaken by Internal Audit, and the work of the external auditors, the OAS forms the Group’ s process for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal controls. The output from the risk assessment processes are collated and reviewed by the Executive Committee to identify those issues where the cumulative risk, or possible reputational impacts, could be significant. The Executive Committee’ s risk workshops allocate management responsibility for the management of the most significant non-financial risks to the Group. The non-financial risk register is also reviewed regularly by the Executive Committee to monitor the ongoing status and progression of mitigation plans. In addition, it is also reviewed on a regular basis by the Board and Corporate Responsibility Committee. As with any system of internal control, the policies and processes that are mandated in the Operational Framework are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. Principal risks In light of the global economic environment, an additional risk in respect of the Group’ s dependence on component availability, subcontractor performance and key suppliers has been disclosed this year (see page 49).

2009 performance
The Group delivered another year of strong performance, exceeding financial
targets for underlying EBITA
1
and net cash.
Overall, programme execution has been good, as reflected in the strong financial
performance of the Group. T argets for programme margin variation and schedule
adherence were achieved in the year .
The milestones for the Woolf implementation programme in respect of Group
processes and policies, and the global Code of Conduct, were substantively
achieved. Revised processes and policies were incorporated in the Operational
Framework effective 1 January 2010, and 95% of employees
2
were briefed and
trained on the Code. The results of an employee survey showed a positive trend 
in awareness of expected ethical standards. 
The Group exceeded its target to reduce the lost work day case rate by 10% over the
gap between 2008 performance and the best in class target, and its target for 60%
of major manufacturing sites reaching Level 4 on the Safety Maturity Matrix. 
All milestones towards the implementation of the strategic global initiatives were
met. Further discussion of these initiatives in the context of the Group’ s strategy
is set out later in this report. 
The Group has reduced its expectations for growth in the US market reflecting
increased defence budgetary pressures. In Electronics, Intelligence & Support, 
the Group remains focused on achieving strategic contract wins in information
technology , cyber , mission support and services. In Land & Armaments, the market 
is expected to provide export opportunities.
The targets to deliver eight T yphoon aircraft and agree the support solution
were achieved. Plans to develop the in-country industrial base to support the
modernisation of the Saudi armed forces are progressing.
In the air sector , all milestones agreed with the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) were
achieved. In the land sector , the Group continues to develop its strategies for UK
vehicle support with the MoD. In the naval sector , the signing of the 15-year T erms
of Business Agreement was achieved and the acquisition of VT Group’ s shipbuilding
business completed. 
The Group continues to successfully address export opportunities. 9% of sales
were to destinations outside the Group’ s home markets in 2009 (2008 12%). 
The Operational Assurance Statement (OAS) process requires businesses to
complete a formal review of compliance with the Operational Framework, including
operational and financial controls, and risk management processes, every six
months. The Group exceeded its target for an overall improvement in OAS scores.  DIRECTORS’ REPORT: BUSINESS REVIEW STRATEGY

GLOBAL DEFENCE MARKET The global defence market is expected to become increasingly challenging with government budgets under pressure following the nancial crisis and increased levels of uncertainty. This is set against a backdrop of ongoing operational commitments and the need to drive acquisition reform. Building on our global,multi-home market presence,leveraging our knowledge of our customers,our understanding of their requirements and our past performance,the Group has the capabilities and strategic exibility to respond to the challenges of the global defence market.
MARKET REVIEW
Australia In 2009,the Australian government released its Defence White Paper,‘Force 2030’,which sets out the Australian Defence Force’s (ADF) plans for substantial platform and technology acquisitions. The Australian government has committed to real growth in the defence budget of 3% to 2017-18,with further growth beyond. Following the acquisition of Tenix Defence in 2008,BAE Systems is the industry leader in the signi cant and growing Australian defence market. To help the Australian government meet its plans,BAE Systems Australia is committed to becoming the leading through-life capability partner to the ADF. Combining key skills in engineering and systems integration,BAE Systems is a leading provider of communications, electronic warfare systems,military air support,air defence,mission support systems,land combat systems,maintenance,garrison support and intelligence,surveillance and reconnaissance. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is expected to remain a growing market,defence spending accounting for approximately 7.7% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2008. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia remains a key home market for BAE Systems. Continuing its commitment to the country,the Group has increased the proportion of Saudi nationals employed in the business and made further investment in facilities in-country. Through technology transfer,focused investment,training and support,BAE Systems’ intention is to establish credible and sustainably pro table local suppliers to the Saudi armed forces. Sweden The Swedish defence budget is expected to remain at around 1.4% of GDP through to 2012. However,cuts to defence procurement are forecast and the Group’s Swedish business has restructured to align with anticipated future customer requirements. Within this context,BAE Systems continues to retain a leading position in the Swedish domestic land market. Core growth opportunities remain focused on products which support the Group’s export propositions and global land business,including the CV90 infantry ghting vehicle. South Africa Foreign investment in defence continues to be actively encouraged by the government of South Africa and defence is a priority for the country. Supporting the growing international requirement for mine protected vehicles,South Africa remains a hub of innovation and engineering for the Group’s land business. India The Indian government has a strong commitment to national defence,an increasing openness to foreign participation and signi cant requirements for new defence equipment. Against this backdrop,India became the Group’s seventh home market in 2009. Indian defence spending increased by an estimated 34% between 2008 and 2009. Further increases to the budget are expected. This is supported by strong forward growth projections for India’s GDP and a public commitment to the transformation of the Indian armed forces. While the government of India remains committed to developing its defence industrial base,it continues to source approximately 70% of its equipment from foreign suppliers and recognises the requirement for partnership to meet its domestic ambitions. The Group has re-af rmed its long-term commitment to the market,and is working to develop opportunities to support India’ s emerging defence and security requirements.
BAE Systems continues to deliver its strategy in selected home markets with attractive,sustainable opportunities to develop an industrial presence. Embedded as a key part of the defence industrial base,with strong customer relationships,BAE Systems is able to deliver capability as a domestic supplier in its established home markets. US The US remains the world’s largest single defence market, estimated to account for approximately 44% of global defence spending in 2008. Having experienced exceptional annual growth rates between 2001 and 2009,growth in the US defence budget is now expected to slow. The President’s 2011 budget request to Congress provides for a 7.7% increase in the procurement budget and a 3.4% overall increase in spending. BAE Systems is well positioned to support its customers in their changing programme priorities across the four domains of air,land, sea and cyber. BAE Systems continued to gain market share in 2008 and develop as a major supplier to the defence industrial base,being ranked number four among the leading suppliers to the US Department of Defense (see chart opposite). As a leading supplier of defence electronics,BAE Systems remains focused on achieving growth through strategic contract wins in information technology,cyber,mission support and services. The Group is capitalising on its positions in electronic warfare and infrared technologies,and a diverse mix of commercial and civil government businesses in such areas as ship repair,information technology and commercial aviation. Although the land market is expected to be impacted by changing priorities and decreases in operational tempo,the US Combat Systems business continues to focus on its domestic US customer through supporting the legacy product base. Positioned to capture emerging markets,the Group has leveraged internal expertise and focused internal investment to ensure innovative solutions in cybersecurity. The Group identi es power management as an emerging opportunity. UK Market conditions will continue to be challenging and uncertain whilst awaiting the nature and shape of defence priorities that the expected 2010 Strategic Defence Review will provide. The Group continues to position itself to ensure a sustainably pro table through-life business across the air,land and sea domains. In the air sector,the UK business secured the production contract for Typhoon Tranche 3A,which extends visibility of production for the next ve years. In the surface ship domain,a 15-year Terms of Business Agreement has been agreed with the UK Ministry of Defence,which sets out lead roles for the business on de ned surface shipbuilding and support programmes. Moving forward to capture new elements of the market,the Programmes & Support operating group secured over £3bn of support contracts in 2009. In addition,following the acquisition of Detica in 2008,the Group is positioned to gain scale in the security sector as budget priorities continue to emphasise intelligence and resilience capabilities.

Whilst the dif cult economic climate is expected to restrict governments’ spending,the Group is well positioned in Australia and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,and developing its position in India. These are markets in which defence spending is expected to increase over the medium term.
In 2008,BAE Systems was the fourth largest supplier to the US Department of Defense (DoD),up from sixth in 2007.
In 2008,BAE Systems was the second largest global defence supplier, up from third in 2007. This represented an expansion of business in the Group’s home markets and export markets.
The US continues to dominate global defence expenditure. It is estimated to account for approximately 44% 1 of the world’s total defence expenditure in 2008. As a major supplier in the US market, BAE Systems is well positioned to capture returns from this market.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT: BUSINESS REVIEW STRATEGY
20 www.baesystems.com
The land initiative was launched in 2008 following the acquisitions of Alvis (in 2004), United Defense (in 2005) and Armor Holdings (in 2007). The Group’ s Land & Armaments operating group has moved from a confederation of acquired businesses to an integrated global business. Global opportunities are pursued through all of the Land & Armaments operating group’ s lines of business. The strategy places increased importance on leveraging the Group’ s positions in Saudi Arabia, Australia and India. The Group’ s land sector business is adapting its business model for agility, flexibility and responsiveness. It is adjusting its product offerings to match the procurement priorities and order sizes of the global customer base. By realigning the business and tightly controlling costs, the land business remains a sustainable enterprise with a balanced risk profile that delivers shareholder value. The global businesses are investing in product offerings designed to provide unparalleled performance capabilities for competitive prices. The diversification of the Group’ s land portfolio, coupled with its adaptive strategy, enables flexibility and agility in the marketplace.
R&S encompasses and expands upon traditional support activities. It can be defined as the range of activities used in the preparation of a force to a mission-ready state and the support of this force (during preparation for military operations, the operations themselves and in their aftermath) over a period of time, potentially through life. Through-life support has long been a differentiating value proposition for the Group, offsetting the variability in equipment procurement budgets, and the Group has an innovative range of R&S tools, processes, capabilities and contracting approaches. Product support services and associated R&S represented approximately 40% of 2009 sales for BAE Systems. The R&S initiative was launched in 2009 to explore opportunities for extracting further growth from the global R&S market by leveraging the Group’ s established R&S services in new geographies and sectors. Specifically, the Group aims to position for third party support, move up the value chain, and maximise and defend the Group’ s original equipment manufacturer R&S position. Through tailored integration of its R&S services and cross business collaboration, BAE Systems is well placed globally to extend its footprint in R&S services to a wider range of products and platforms. The R&S initiative is moving into its implementation phase and the lines of business are positioned to accelerate growth in this key market. 
The clear drivers for the UAS strategy, launched in 2008, were the opportunities that the global market for UAS presented for the Group’ s new and existing capabilities. The UAS initiative ensures a collaborative approach to sharing expertise, technology and best practice across the Group’ s home markets. BAE Systems is at the forefront of autonomous technologies and continues to develop complete integrated systems, such as Herti, Mantis and T aranis in the UK, as well as critical systems capabilities and technologies in ground station and mission systems in the UK and US, and autonomous flight control systems in Australia. In June, BAE Systems acquired Advanced Ceramics Research, Inc. in the US, which provides three small and tactical UAS platforms (the Coyote, Silverfox and Manta), as well as related support capabilities. Key customer programmes that are critical to executing the UAS initiative in each home market have been identified and the strategy is being aligned across the respective businesses. T ogether with the other global initiatives, the UAS initiative is targeted to deliver tangible business opportunities and long-term growth for the Group.
The objective of the land initiative is to create and sustain a global land business, leveraging the Group’ s capabilities and its home market strategy to achieve a pre-eminent position in selected markets.
The R&S initiative focuses on the growing worldwide market for third party platform and systems support. This is an area of opportunity in all of the Group’ s home markets.
The emerging security strategy concentrates on helping the Group’ s government and private sector customers strengthen border and transportation security, develop cybersecurity, and combat terrorism and organised crime.
The UAS initiative aims to deliver tangible business opportunities in each of the Group’ s home markets, enabling specialist teams to leverage the best of BAE Systems’ global capability for its customers, and to provide a route into the international market for its UAS products and services. 
Type 45 – BAE Systems’ multi-year contract, awarded in 2009 by the UK Ministry of Defence, will deliver in-service support to the Type 45 anti-air warfare destroyers. 
RG35 – BAE Systems continuously develops vehicles to support its customers’ operational needs. The new RG35 mine protected multi-purpose fighting vehicle, developed by the Group’ s Land Systems South Africa business and launched during 2009, combines high levels of survivability with the tactical capability of a modern combat vehicle.
Detica NetReveal® – The Detica NetReveal® solution for detecting fraud and organised crime has continued to show global sales growth. It is used by banks and insurers, government and law enforcement agencies.
Mantis – The next generation autonomous system, Mantis, completed its maiden flight in Woomera, South Australia, in October. Mantis, an advanced technology demonstrator medium-altitude long-endurance UAS, went from concept to flight in just 19 months.

Following the 2008 Executive Committee objective to progress development of the Group’ s home market security businesses and resulting acquisition of Detica in 2008, BAE Systems launched a global security initiative to address the global security market. Security encompasses intelligence and resilience, and can be understood as the collection of technologies and services which detect, monitor , deter and defeat potential threats to civilian welfare. The Group is focusing on its home markets, with significant emphasis on the US, UK and Australia, but also the emerging home markets in India and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In each of these markets, the Group has an opportunity to work with its customers in a position of trust throughout the lifecycle of their programmes – from consultancy to large scale systems integration. Significant progress has been made during 2009. The Electronics, Intelligence & Support operating group made investments to increase its cybersecurity capabilities for the US government, establishing a leading edge Network Operations Centre. In the UK, a team from across Programmes & Support won a significant security programme for a government client. BAE Systems Australia is working with Detica to pull through data analysis technologies, and develop a distinctive position in the Australian market for security-related services and solutions. In 2010, the Group plans to accelerate growth in this important sector , strengthening its large-scale information technology, solutions integration and managed services capabilities, and working closely with government and industry partners to address emerging trends.
The Group has four global initiatives in Land, Security, Readiness & Sustainment and Unmanned Aircraft Systems. These provide an important focus for the transfer of best practice across its home markets, leveraging appropriate skills and capabilities to meet the requirements of its customers, and grow the business.

STRATEGY IN ACTION
DRIVING GROWTH FROM INNOVATION
In the US,the Group’s Electronics,Intelligence & Support (EI&S) operating group is a focus for much of the Group’s research and development investment and is a leader in the development of many advanced technologies. It has an excellent track record of innovation and leveraging new business opportunities from the application of technology. As an example,BAE Systems has developed a range of high-precision solid state micro-bolometers (photon detectors). These chip-based detectors are manufactured at the Group’s in-house foundry and are used in a range of multi-spectral sensing products,including thermal weapon sights. In September,BAE Systems was one of two companies selected to participate in a programme to meet a requirement for a system of sensors to provide 24-hour all-weather visibility to operators of military armoured ground vehicles. The Group has developed a solution that includes placing cameras,utilising the solid state detector technology, inside the vehicle light clusters. The Driver’s Vision Enhancer Family of Systems gives the vehicle occupants a surveillance and situational awareness capability in darkness or reduced visibility caused by fog or smoke. The solution is highly cost effective and requires minimal change to the vehicle and its armour structure. In addition to developing high growth potential business from technologies,such as multi-spectral sensing,BAE Systems also identi es growth from advanced power management technology. It has already supplied more than 2,000 hybrid electric drive systems, forming part of integrated power management systems for urban transit buses.
Driver’s Vision Enhancer Family of Systems
NAVAL SECTOR INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY
The establishment of an industrial strategy for UK naval shipbuilding has been an important element in securing long-term stability for that sector.
In October,BAE Systems completed the acquisition of VT Group’s 45% shareholding in BVT Surface Fleet. The acquisition followed an agreement with the UK Ministry of Defence in July de ning a Terms of Business Agreement setting out a 15-year partnering arrangement, including lead roles for the business on de ned surface shipbuilding and support programmes. In December 2008,the rst of six Type 45 anti-air warfare destroyers, HMS Daring,was accepted off contract and the second ship,HMS Dauntless,in December 2009. Production of Type 45 continues through to 2012. In July, rst steel was cut for the Royal Navy’s new class of two 65,000 tonne aircraft carriers following award of manufacturing contracts in July 2008. The aircraft carrier programme is a signi cant element of the workload covered by the Terms of Business Agreement. Looking beyond the Carrier programme,the Group is engaged on a concept design for the UK Future Surface Combatant programme, due to enter service around the end of the next decade to replace the Royal Navy’s Type 23 frigates.

ACTUAL/EXPECTED TYPHOON AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES The Typhoon combat aircraft programme is set for increased deliveries. The programme is transitioning from the approximately 36-a-year production rate under the rst, Tranche 1,phase to the planned 50-a-year rate for Tranche 2, including deliveries to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. With the signing of contracts in 2009 to launch Tranche 3,the third phase of the programme,deliveries to the four European partner nations are contracted through to 2015. In addition,Typhoon aircraft deliveries on the Saudi programme extend to 2017. Typhoon export opportunities are being pursued in a number of other markets.
BAE Systems is a signi cant participant on the Lockheed Martin-led F-35 Lightning II programme,manufacturing aft airframe and empennage products in the UK,supplying air vehicle systems through its UK supply chain,and electronic warfare and ight control systems supplied from the Group’s US operations. The very large scale requirement for F-35 aircraft includes replacement of many combat aircraft types currently in service in the US with signi cant numbers of aircraft in the current eets reaching the end of their operational lives throughout the next decade. The F-35 programme is expected to progress towards a production rate of approximately 200 aircraft ayeartomeetdemandintheUS and around the world. In addition to the valuable business expected from production of these aircraft over many years, BAE Systems will also participate in their through-life support.

TARGETED INVESTMENTS RE-SHAPING THE BAE SYSTEMS BUSINESS
Following the merger of British Aerospace plc and GEC’ s Marconi Electronic Systems business in 1999, the Group has grown
and developed through improvements in business performance, organic growth, and targeted acquisitions and disposals. Over
the last ten years, the Group has invested over £7.5bn in the acquisition of defence and security businesses consistent with
delivery against clear strategic objectives. These acquisitions have, in part, been financed by strategic business disposals with
proceeds exceeding £2.5bn. 
Electronics, Intelligence & Support: The
acquisition in 2000 of two former Lockheed
Martin businesses, Control Systems and
Aerospace Electronics Systems, established
the Group as a world leader in digital engine
controls, flight controls and electronic
warfare solutions.
Land & Armaments: The acquisitions of
Alvis in 2004, United Defense in 2005 and
Armor Holdings in 2007 were key to the Group
establishing a global land systems business.
Programmes & Support: The acquisition
of Detica in 2008 provided access to
government security business. The
acquisition of VT Group’ s shipbuilding
business has further strengthened the
Group’ s global maritime business.
International: The acquisition of T enix Defence
in 2008 positioned the Group as Australia’ s
largest defence contractor .
An active programme of targeted acquisitions
and disposals has contributed towards 
the re-shaping of BAE Systems as a high
performing business.

KPI BAE Systems Annual Report 2009 13
Excluding the share of the order book of Airbus, the Group’ s 20% share in which was sold during 2006, the Group’ s order
book has grown from £25.0bn in 2000 to £46.9bn at the end of 2009. As illustrated below, 51% of this is represented
by the Group’ s top 15 programmes and the remaining 49% is spread across the four operating groups. Many of these
programmes are conducted under long-term contracts, and a substantial proportion includes the provision of through-life
capability and support. The diverse range of programmes provides the Group with a broad business base. 
Whilst the Group’ s US businesses are engaged in significant multi-year contracts, these contracts typically provide that
performance beyond the first year is contingent upon the receipt of funding. The US government typically authorises funding
on an annual basis and incremental orders are, therefore, recorded as funding is received.

OUR CUSTOMERS
Customer Focus is a key element of the Group Strategic
Objective of T otal Performance.
– T argeted improvement in schedule adherence achieved
The Group’ s core businesses are mostly defence-related, selling
products and services primarily in its home markets and to other
national governments, both directly and indirectly through other defence
and aerospace companies. In many cases, these relationships extend
over decades and span the full product and service lifecycle from initial
concept definition, through the system development phase, into
production and then on to support for the system in service. 
Throughout the product and project lifecycles, the Group engages
extensively with its customers and undertakes customer satisfaction
surveys as part of its drive for continuous performance improvement,
aligning with the Group Strategic Objective of T otal Performance.
The Group’ s largest customers are the governments of the United
Kingdom, United States, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Australia. In
the US, BAE Systems is subject to the Special Security Agreement
that safeguards US national security interests, as a result of which
BAE Systems is allowed to supply products and services of a highly BAE Systems Annual Report 2009 15
Expenditure on subcontracts can represent a significant
portion of project cost, with effective management of this
expenditure being a key value driver for the Group.
– Managing major subcontractors is a key strategic capability
– T op 1,000 suppliers to be provided with the Group’ s global
Code of Conduct and encouraged to work to equivalent
standards
– Global database of at-risk suppliers compiled in 2009
The benefits of capability-based contracting, combined with ongoing
budget pressures, have led many customers to demand a more
integrated partnering approach to meet their requirements. Best
practice in managing major subcontracts is embedded in the Group’ s
processes, guidance and training to help deliver on commitments to
customers, aligning with the Group’ s Strategic Objective of T otal
Performance through programme execution. 
Managing relationships with suppliers is an essential part of developing
systems integration and through-life management capabilities. The
Group is committed to improving supply chain relationships and working
together with other companies, large and small, in each of its home
markets to deliver better value and innovation for its customers.
This year , an additional principal risk relating to the Group’ s dependence
on component availability, subcontractor performance and key suppliers
has been disclosed. In light of global economic conditions, the Group
has reviewed strategically important suppliers globally to assess their
financial health. 
The Group is engaged in significant R&D programmes
in support of the platforms, systems, services and capabilities
that it provides to its customers.
– 2009 R&D expenditure was £1,153m (2008 £1,044m),
of which £220m (2008 £211m) was funded by the Group
The Group’ s R&D activities cover a wide range of programmes and
include performance innovations, improvements to manufacturing
techniques and technology to improve through-life support of products.
The Group funds strategic R&D across the business, particularly in the
Electronics, Intelligence & Support operating group, and the four global
initiatives of Land, Security, Readiness & Sustainment and Unmanned
Aircraft Systems. Customers fund directly much of the near-term product
development work undertaken by the Group.
BAE Systems has launched an investment partnership aimed at
small and medium sized enterprises and academia to identify new
technologies, and help bring them to market. As well as providing
financial support, BAE Systems offers expertise and resources, such
as the use of test and evaluation facilities. Current projects focus on
the areas of cybersecurity and biometrics.
OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D)
The Group’ s intellectual property can make a significant
contribution to its competitive advantage.
– The Group filed patent applications covering over 250
new inventions in 2009
– BAE Systems now has a total portfolio of patents and patent
applications covering approximately 2,000 inventions
internationally
Intellectual property is created every day, taking many forms, both
in tangible products and ‘know how’. The Operational Framework
mandates a policy to protect the Group’ s intellectual property through
appropriate use and observance of intellectual property law, so that
returns made from the investment in R&D and technological innovation
are protected, and commercial and business innovations are 
adequately safeguarded.

sensitive nature to the US government. In Australia, BAE Systems is
subject to an Overarching Deed with the Commonwealth of Australia
that protects their national security and other interests, and allows
the Group to own certain Australian defence-related industrial assets.
Agreements between the governments of the United Kingdom and
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia relating to defence co-operation programmes
remain essential to the development of the Group’ s business in
Saudi Arabia.
Delivery of the Group’ s corporate responsibility agenda supports its
reputation and contributes to successful long-term relationships with
customers. Our commitment to be recognised as a leader in responsible
business conduct and to achieve leadership safety performance is
particularly important.
Lifecycle Management (LCM), which is mandated under the Operational
Framework, provides a structured approach to managing the Group’ s
commitments and investments throughout product and project lifecycles,
promoting the application of best practice management and facilitating
continuous improvement. Programme margin variation and schedule
adherence are regularly reviewed to monitor contract profitability and
milestone achievement.

GLOBAL DEFENCE MARKET
The global defence market is expected to become increasingly challenging with government budgets under pressure
following the financial crisis and increased levels of uncertainty. This is set against a backdrop of ongoing operational
commitments and the need to drive acquisition reform.
Building on our global, multi-home market presence, leveraging our knowledge of our customers, our understanding of
their requirements and our past performance, the Group has the capabilities and strategic flexibility to respond to the
challenges of the global defence market.

Whilst the difficult economic climate is expected to restrict governments’
spending, the Group is well positioned in Australia and the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia, and developing its position in India. These are markets in
which defence spending is expected to increase over the medium term.
In 2008, BAE Systems was the fourth largest supplier to the
US Department of Defense (DoD), up from sixth in 2007. 
In 2008, BAE Systems was the second largest global defence supplier ,
up from third in 2007. This represented an expansion of business in
the Group’ s home markets and export markets.
The US continues to dominate global defence expenditure. It is
estimated to account for approximately 44%
1
of the world’ s total
defence expenditure in 2008. As a major supplier in the US market,
BAE Systems is well positioned to capture returns from this market.

1 Based on BAE Systems’ internal analysis. BAE Systems Annual Report 2009 17
Australia In 2009, the Australian government released its Defence
White Paper , ‘Force 2030’, which sets out the Australian Defence
Force’ s (ADF) plans for substantial platform and technology
acquisitions. The Australian government has committed to real growth
in the defence budget of 3% to 2017-18, with further growth beyond.
Following the acquisition of T enix Defence in 2008, BAE Systems is the
industry leader in the significant and growing Australian defence market.
T o help the Australian government meet its plans, BAE Systems
Australia is committed to becoming the leading through-life capability
partner to the ADF . Combining key skills in engineering and systems
integration, BAE Systems is a leading provider of communications,
electronic warfare systems, military air support, air defence, mission
support systems, land combat systems, maintenance, garrison
support and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is expected
to remain a growing market, defence spending accounting for
approximately 7.7% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2008. 
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia remains a key home market for
BAE Systems. Continuing its commitment to the country , the Group
has increased the proportion of Saudi nationals employed in the
business and made further investment in facilities in-country .
Through technology transfer , focused investment, training and
support, BAE Systems’ intention is to establish credible and
sustainably profitable local suppliers to the Saudi armed forces.
Sweden The Swedish defence budget is expected to remain at around
1.4% of GDP through to 2012. However , cuts to defence procurement
are forecast and the Group’ s Swedish business has restructured to
align with anticipated future customer requirements.
Within this context, BAE Systems continues to retain a leading position
in the Swedish domestic land market. Core growth opportunities
remain focused on products which support the Group’ s export
propositions and global land business, including the CV90 infantry
fighting vehicle.
South Africa Foreign investment in defence continues to be actively
encouraged by the government of South Africa and defence is a priority
for the country. Supporting the growing international requirement for
mine protected vehicles, South Africa remains a hub of innovation
and engineering for the Group’ s land business.
India The Indian government has a strong commitment to national
defence, an increasing openness to foreign participation and
significant requirements for new defence equipment. Against this
backdrop, India became the Group’ s seventh home market in 2009.
Indian defence spending increased by an estimated 34% between
2008 and 2009. Further increases to the budget are expected. This
is supported by strong forward growth projections for India’ s GDP and
a public commitment to the transformation of the Indian armed forces.
While the government of India remains committed to developing its
defence industrial base, it continues to source approximately 70% of
its equipment from foreign suppliers and recognises the requirement
for partnership to meet its domestic ambitions. 
The Group has re-affirmed its long-term commitment to the market, and
is working to develop opportunities to support India’ s emerging defence
and security requirements.
BAE Systems continues to deliver its strategy in selected home
markets with attractive, sustainable opportunities to develop an
industrial presence. Embedded as a key part of the defence industrial
base, with strong customer relationships, BAE Systems is able
to deliver capability as a domestic supplier in its established
home markets. 
US The US remains the world’ s largest single defence market,
estimated to account for approximately 44% of global defence
spending in 2008. Having experienced exceptional annual growth
rates between 2001 and 2009, growth in the US defence budget
is now expected to slow. The President’ s 2011 budget request to
Congress provides for a 7.7% increase in the procurement budget
and a 3.4% overall increase in spending.
BAE Systems is well positioned to support its customers in their
changing programme priorities across the four domains of air , land,
sea and cyber . BAE Systems continued to gain market share in 2008
and develop as a major supplier to the defence industrial base, being
ranked number four among the leading suppliers to the US Department
of Defense (see chart opposite).
As a leading supplier of defence electronics, BAE Systems remains
focused on achieving growth through strategic contract wins in
information technology, cyber , mission support and services. The
Group is capitalising on its positions in electronic warfare and infrared
technologies, and a diverse mix of commercial and civil government
businesses in such areas as ship repair , information technology and
commercial aviation. 
Although the land market is expected to be impacted by changing
priorities and decreases in operational tempo, the US Combat
Systems business continues to focus on its domestic US customer
through supporting the legacy product base. 
Positioned to capture emerging markets, the Group has leveraged
internal expertise and focused internal investment to ensure innovative
solutions in cybersecurity. The Group identifies power management
as an emerging opportunity. 
UK Market conditions will continue to be challenging and uncertain
whilst awaiting the nature and shape of defence priorities that the
expected 2010 Strategic Defence Review will provide. The Group
continues to position itself to ensure a sustainably profitable 
through-life business across the air , land and sea domains. 
In the air sector , the UK business secured the production contract for
T yphoon T ranche 3A, which extends visibility of production for the next
five years. In the surface ship domain, a 15-year T erms of Business
Agreement has been agreed with the UK Ministry of Defence, which
sets out lead roles for the business on defined surface shipbuilding
and support programmes.
Moving forward to capture new elements of the market, the Programmes
& Support operating group secured over £3bn of support contracts in
2009. In addition, following the acquisition of Detica in 2008, the Group
is positioned to gain scale in the security sector as budget priorities
continue to emphasise intelligence and resilience capabilities.

The land initiative was launched in 2008 following the acquisitions 
of Alvis (in 2004), United Defense (in 2005) and Armor Holdings 
(in 2007). The Group’ s Land & Armaments operating group has
moved from a confederation of acquired businesses to an integrated
global business.
Global opportunities are pursued through all of the Land & Armaments
operating group’ s lines of business. The strategy places increased
importance on leveraging the Group’ s positions in Saudi Arabia,
Australia and India.
The Group’ s land sector business is adapting its business model 
for agility, flexibility and responsiveness. It is adjusting its product
offerings to match the procurement priorities and order sizes of
the global customer base. By realigning the business and tightly
controlling costs, the land business remains a sustainable enterprise
with a balanced risk profile that delivers shareholder value.
The global businesses are investing in product offerings designed 
to provide unparalleled performance capabilities for competitive
prices. The diversification of the Group’ s land portfolio, coupled with
its adaptive strategy, enables flexibility and agility in the marketplace.
The objective of the land initiative is to create and sustain 
a global land business, leveraging the Group’ s capabilities
and its home market strategy to achieve a pre-eminent
position in selected markets.
The emerging security strategy concentrates on helping 
the Group’ s government and private sector customers
strengthen border and transportation security, develop
cybersecurity, and combat terrorism and organised crime.
RG35 – BAE Systems continuously develops vehicles to support its customers’
operational needs. The new RG35 mine protected multi-purpose fighting vehicle,
developed by the Group’ s Land Systems South Africa business and launched during
2009, combines high levels of survivability with the tactical capability of a modern
combat vehicle.

LAND & ARMAMENTS OPERATING GROUP p60
Following the 2008 Executive Committee objective to progress
development of the Group’ s home market security businesses
and resulting acquisition of Detica in 2008, BAE Systems launched
a global security initiative to address the global security market.
Security encompasses intelligence and resilience, and can be
understood as the collection of technologies and services which
detect, monitor , deter and defeat potential threats to civilian welfare. 
The Group is focusing on its home markets, with significant emphasis
on the US, UK and Australia, but also the emerging home markets in
India and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In each of these markets, the
Group has an opportunity to work with its customers in a position of
trust throughout the lifecycle of their programmes – from consultancy
to large scale systems integration. 
Significant progress has been made during 2009. The Electronics,
Intelligence & Support operating group made investments to increase
its cybersecurity capabilities for the US government, establishing
a leading edge Network Operations Centre. In the UK, a team from
across Programmes & Support won a significant security programme
for a government client. BAE Systems Australia is working with Detica
to pull through data analysis technologies, and develop a distinctive
position in the Australian market for security-related services
and solutions.
In 2010, the Group plans to accelerate growth in this important
sector , strengthening its large-scale information technology, solutions
integration and managed services capabilities, and working closely
with government and industry partners to address emerging trends.
The Group has four global initiatives in Land, Security, Readiness & Sustainment and Unmanned Aircraft Systems. These
provide an important focus for the transfer of best practice across its home markets, leveraging appropriate skills and
capabilities to meet the requirements of its customers, and grow the business. BAE Systems Annual Report 2009 21
R&S encompasses and expands upon traditional support activities.
It can be defined as the range of activities used in the preparation of
a force to a mission-ready state and the support of this force (during
preparation for military operations, the operations themselves and
in their aftermath) over a period of time, potentially through life.
Through-life support has long been a differentiating value proposition
for the Group, offsetting the variability in equipment procurement
budgets, and the Group has an innovative range of R&S tools,
processes, capabilities and contracting approaches. Product support
services and associated R&S represented approximately 40% of
2009 sales for BAE Systems.
The R&S initiative was launched in 2009 to explore opportunities for
extracting further growth from the global R&S market by leveraging the
Group’ s established R&S services in new geographies and sectors.
Specifically, the Group aims to position for third party support, move
up the value chain, and maximise and defend the Group’ s original
equipment manufacturer R&S position. Through tailored integration
of its R&S services and cross business collaboration, BAE Systems
is well placed globally to extend its footprint in R&S services to a wider
range of products and platforms.
The R&S initiative is moving into its implementation phase and 
the lines of business are positioned to accelerate growth in this 
key market. 
The clear drivers for the UAS strategy, launched in 2008, were the
opportunities that the global market for UAS presented for the
Group’ s new and existing capabilities. 
The UAS initiative ensures a collaborative approach to sharing
expertise, technology and best practice across the Group’ s 
home markets.
BAE Systems is at the forefront of autonomous technologies and
continues to develop complete integrated systems, such as Herti,
Mantis and T aranis in the UK, as well as critical systems capabilities
and technologies in ground station and mission systems in the UK
and US, and autonomous flight control systems in Australia.
In June, BAE Systems acquired Advanced Ceramics Research, Inc.
in the US, which provides three small and tactical UAS platforms (the
Coyote, Silverfox and Manta), as well as related support capabilities.
Key customer programmes that are critical to executing the UAS
initiative in each home market have been identified and the strategy
is being aligned across the respective businesses.
T ogether with the other global initiatives, the UAS initiative is targeted
to deliver tangible business opportunities and long-term growth for
the Group.
The R&S initiative focuses on the growing worldwide market
for third party platform and systems support. This is an area
of opportunity in all of the Group’ s home markets.
The UAS initiative aims to deliver tangible business
opportunities in each of the Group’ s home markets, enabling
specialist teams to leverage the best of BAE Systems’ global
capability for its customers, and to provide a route into the
international market for its UAS products and services. 
Type 45 – BAE Systems’ multi-year contract, awarded in 2009 by the 
UK Ministry of Defence, will deliver in-service support to the Type 45 anti-air 
warfare destroyers. 
Mantis – The next generation autonomous system, Mantis, completed its maiden flight
in Woomera, South Australia, in October. Mantis, an advanced technology demonstrator
medium-altitude long-endurance UAS, went from concept to flight in just 19 months.

shipbuilding has been an important element in securing 
long-term stability for that sector . 
In October , BAE Systems completed the acquisition of VT Group’ s
45% shareholding in BVT Surface Fleet. The acquisition followed an
agreement with the UK Ministry of Defence in July defining a T erms
of Business Agreement setting out a 15-year partnering arrangement,
including lead roles for the business on defined surface shipbuilding
and support programmes. 
In December 2008, the first of six T ype 45 anti-air warfare destroyers,
HMS Daring, was accepted off contract and the second ship,
HMS Dauntless, in December 2009. Production of T ype 45 continues
through to 2012. 
In July, first steel was cut for the Royal Navy’ s new class of two 65,000
tonne aircraft carriers following award of manufacturing contracts in
July 2008. The aircraft carrier programme is a significant element of
the workload covered by the T erms of Business Agreement. 
Looking beyond the Carrier programme, the Group is engaged on a
concept design for the UK Future Surface Combatant programme,
due to enter service around the end of the next decade to replace
the Royal Navy’ s T ype 23 frigates.

STRATEGY IN ACTION
DRIVING GROWTH FROM INNOVATION
In the US, the Group’ s Electronics, Intelligence & Support
(EI&S) operating group is a focus for much of the Group’ s
research and development investment and is a leader in
the development of many advanced technologies. It has
an excellent track record of innovation and leveraging new
business opportunities from the application of technology. 
As an example, BAE Systems has developed a range of high-precision
solid state micro-bolometers (photon detectors). These chip-based
detectors are manufactured at the Group’ s in-house foundry and are
used in a range of multi-spectral sensing products, including thermal
weapon sights. 
In September , BAE Systems was one of two companies selected to
participate in a programme to meet a requirement for a system of
sensors to provide 24-hour all-weather visibility to operators of military
armoured ground vehicles. The Group has developed a solution that
includes placing cameras, utilising the solid state detector technology ,
inside the vehicle light clusters. The Driver’ s Vision Enhancer Family
of Systems gives the vehicle occupants a surveillance and situational
awareness capability in darkness or reduced visibility caused by fog
or smoke. The solution is highly cost effective and requires minimal
change to the vehicle and its armour structure. 
In addition to developing high growth potential business from
technologies, such as multi-spectral sensing, BAE Systems also
identifies growth from advanced power management technology. It
has already supplied more than 2,000 hybrid electric drive systems,
forming part of integrated power management systems for urban
transit buses.

ACTUAL/EXPECTED TYPHOON AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES
The T yphoon combat aircraft
programme is set for increased
deliveries. The programme
is transitioning from the
approximately 36-a-year
production rate under the first,
T ranche 1, phase to the planned
50-a-year rate for T ranche 2,
including deliveries to the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 
With the signing of contracts in 2009 to launch T ranche 3, the third
phase of the programme, deliveries to the four European partner
nations are contracted through to 2015. In addition, T yphoon aircraft
deliveries on the Saudi programme extend to 2017. T yphoon export
opportunities are being pursued in a number of other markets.
BAE Systems is a significant participant on the Lockheed Martin-led 
F-35 Lightning II programme, manufacturing aft airframe and
empennage products in the UK, supplying air vehicle systems through
its UK supply chain, and electronic warfare and flight control systems
supplied from the Group’ s US operations. 
The very large scale requirement for F-35 aircraft includes replacement
of many combat aircraft types currently in service in the US with
significant numbers of aircraft in the current fleets reaching the
end of their operational lives throughout the next decade.
The F-35 programme is expected
to progress towards a production
rate of approximately 200 aircraft
a year to meet demand in the US
and around the world. In addition
to the valuable business
expected from production of
these aircraft over many years,
BAE Systems will also participate
in their through-life support.

The OAS requires that each part of the
business completes a formal review of
its compliance against the Operational
Framework, including operational and
financial controls, and risk management
processes, every six months. 
The level of application of mandated policies
is assessed against defined scoring criteria.
Where scores are below the minimum
standard, action plans to achieve the
minimum standard are implemented. 
OPERA TIONAL ASSURANCE ST A TEMENT (OAS)
The global Code of Conduct was launched in
January 2009. It defines the principles and
standards of responsible business conduct
we expect of employees wherever they work
globally. During the year , the Code was
communicated to employees through team
briefings. Employees received online or
classroom-based training on the Code
and were also asked to acknowledge that
they understood and would comply with
its requirements.
GLOBAL CODE OF CONDUCT
The number of incidents resulting in days
lost to injuries is monitored and actions
taken to minimise the risk to our employees
and our operations, and drive continual
performance improvement. In previous
reports, days lost to work-related injuries
was used as the Group’ s key safety metric.
From 2009, this has been replaced by the
lost work day case rate, which focuses 
on the causes of accidents and enables 
a more meaningful comparison with 
other companies.
SAFETY 
With effect from 1 January 2010, new
and updated mandated policies have been
introduced as part of the implementation
of the Woolf Committee recommendations.
The businesses are required to develop
plans to implement these policies, and they
will be measured by the achievement of
milestones towards full implementation.
The briefing and training achievement of
95% includes our Surface Ships business
(approximately 7,000 employees) which
joined the Group on 30 October 2009.
The Executive Committee considers its
target to have been substantively met
and actively continues to ensure that the
remaining employees complete the Code
of Conduct programme. 
The Group targeted a 10% improvement in
the gap between 2008 performance and
the best in class target of 100 per 100,000
employees. In 2009, the improvement was
33%, exceeding the target. Incident rate
targets have been set by the operating
groups to reflect the progress required to
achieve the 2011 target of best in class.

Underlying EBITA Management uses an underlying profit measure to
monitor the year-on-year profitability of the Group, which is defined as
earnings before amortisation and impairment of intangible assets,
finance costs and taxation expense (EBITA) excluding non-recurring
items. This definition is referred to as Underlying EBITA. In order to
ensure that it continues to provide a measure of profitability that is
comparable over time, it has been amended to exclude all non-recurring
items. Underlying EBITA continues to be the measure of profit on which
segmental performance is monitored by management. As such, it is
disclosed in note 3 to the Group accounts on a segmental basis. 
Underlying EBITA

Non-recurring items are defined as items that are relevant to an
understanding of the Group’ s performance with reference to their
materiality, nature and function. The non-recurring items for the

Proﬁt on disposal of businesses comprised the finalisation of the
accounting gain recognised in 2008 on the disposal of the Group’ s

£238m included the accounting gain on the disposal of the Group’ s
interests in the businesses contributed to BVT (£121m), and profit
on disposals of the Surveillance & Attack business (£61m) and the
Group’ s interest in Flagship T raining (£56m). 
The pension accounting gain of £261m in 2009 has resulted from
pension benefit restructuring in the US. It has been excluded from
underlying EBITA
2
on the basis of its materiality and non-recurring
nature.
The regulatory penalties of £278m in 2009 reflect the global
settlement of the regulatory investigations by the US Department of
Justice and the UK’ s Serious Fraud Office referred to in the Chairman’ s
letter on page 3. These have been excluded from underlying EBITA
2
on the basis of their materiality and non-recurring nature.
Amortisation of intangible assets is £39m higher at £286m mainly for
the impact of a full year of charges in respect of the businesses acquired
in 2008.

FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
32 www.baesystems.com
Impairment of intangible assets of £973m primarily relates to the
goodwill and intangible assets acquired with Armor Holdings in 2007.
The impairment largely reflects the non-award of the follow-on Family of
Medium T actical Vehicles production contract (£592m) and the weaker
outlook for the US-based Products Group business (£264m). In addition,
£34m has been taken relating to the discontinued financial services
element of the Detica business. The prior year charge of £177m
included a reduction in the market value of the Group’ s interest in
Saab of Sweden (£120m) and a charge against the Products Group
(£40m). Further disclosure is provided in note 11 to the Group accounts.
Net ﬁnancial expense
1
was £707m (2008 net financial income £697m).
The underlying net interest charge increased to £195m (2008 £102m)
primarily on the cash cost of business acquisitions made in 2008, lower
interest received on cash held and the carrying cost of $1.5bn US bonds
issued in June 2009. A net expense of £512m (2008 net credit £799m)
arose from pension accounting, marked-to-market revaluation of
financial instruments and foreign currency movements, reversing much
of the net income recorded in 2008 from these items.
Taxation expense
1
reflects an effective tax rate of 28% (2008 26%),
which is expected to increase to 29% in 2010. The effective tax rate is
based on profit before taxation excluding goodwill impairment of £725m
and regulatory penalties (£278m). 
Basic loss per share, in accordance with IAS 33, Earnings per Share, was
1.9p (2008 earnings 49.6p). The reduction on 2008 mainly reflects the
impairments, regulatory penalties, and reversal of gains made in 2008
on marked-to-market revaluation of financial instruments and foreign
currency movements. 
Underlying earnings
3
per share was 40.7p (2008 37.1p), an increase of
10%. The increase in underlying earnings

The proposed dividend is covered 2.5 times by underlying earnings

of approximately two times.

Exchange translation, principally in respect of the Group’ s US-dollar
denominated businesses, reduced net assets by £302m.
The £1.0bn reduction in intangible assets to £11.3bn (2008 £12.3bn)
mainly reflects amortisation and impairment (£1.3bn), and adverse
exchange translation (£0.7bn), partly offset by the goodwill and
intangible assets recognised on the acquisition of VT Group’ s 45%
interest in BVT (£0.8bn).
The reduction in equity accounted investments and other investments
from £1,040m to £852m is largely due to the acquisition of VT Group’ s
45% interest in BVT in October 2009. BVT , now re-named BAE Systems
Surface Ships, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group and its balance
sheet, and associated purchased goodwill, are now consolidated on a
line-by-line basis.

The better than expected investment returns and the restructuring of
the US pension schemes has been outweighed by a reduction in real
discount rates resulting in the Group’ s share of the pension deficit
increasing to £4,637m from £3,325m at 31 December 2008. The real
UK discount rate of 2.2% at the end of 2009 compares with an historic
ten-year average of 2.9% (see table and chart below).

During the year , the Group contributed £225m into T rust for the benefit
of the Group’ s main pension scheme. This contribution is reported within
other investments – current (£211m including a fair value gain of £2m),
and cash and cash equivalents (£16m) in the consolidated balance
sheet at 31 December 2009. The use of these assets is restricted
under the terms of the T rust. The Group considers the contribution to
be equivalent to the other one-off contributions it makes into the Group’ s
pension schemes and, accordingly, presents a definition of the pension
deficit above to include this contribution.
A net deferred tax asset of £1,430m (2008 £1,115m) relating to the
Group’ s pension deficit is included within net tax assets and liabilities,
and disclosed in note 8 to the Group accounts.

CASH FLOW
Cash inﬂow from operating activities was £2,232m (2008 £2,009m),
which includes contributions in excess of service costs for the UK and
US pension schemes totalling £475m (2008 £321m).
There was an outflow from net capital expenditure and ﬁnancial
investment of £489m (2008 £503m), which included £94m
(2008 £183m) in respect of new residential and office facilities
in Saudi Arabia. 
Dividends received from equity accounted investments, primarily
MBDA, Saab and Eurofighter , totalled £77m (2008 £89m).
Assets contributed to Trust comprises the £225m of payments made
into T rust during the year for the benefit of the Group’ s main pension
scheme. As the use of these assets is restricted under the terms of
the T rust, they are excluded from the Group’ s definition of net cash.
Consistent with the presentation of other one-off contributions into the
Group’ s pension schemes, the contribution is presented within operating
business cash flow.
Interest increased to £186m (2008 £98m) largely reflecting the cash
cost of business acquisitions in 2008, lower interest received on the
Group’ s cash holdings and the carrying cost of the $1.5bn US bonds
issued in June 2009.
Taxation payments increased to £350m (2008 £261m) mainly as a
result of the higher taxable profits generated by the Group in 2008. 
Net cash outflow in respect of acquisitions and disposals was £253m.
This mainly comprises net payments made to acquire VT Group’ s
45% interest in BVT , including acquired cash (£315m), and Advanced
Ceramics Research, Inc. (£9m), less the deferred consideration received
relating to the 2008 disposal of a 50% interest in Flagship T raining
(£70m). In the prior year , the Group acquired MTC, T enix Defence and
Detica, and disposed of the Surveillance & Attack business and interest
in Flagship T raining for net cash consideration of £1bn.
The Group finances part of its investment in its US businesses through
an intercompany loan. As at 31 December 2009, $2.1bn (2008 $2.1bn)
of a total of $3.6bn (2008 $6.6bn) was hedged using a rolling
programme of short-term foreign exchange hedges. As a consequence
of the weakening of the US dollar , there has been a cash inﬂow from
matured derivative ﬁnancial instruments of £36m (2008 outflow
£440m) from rolling these hedges into 2010. 
Foreign exchange translation during the year , primarily in respect of
the Group’ s US dollar-denominated borrowing, increased reported cash
by £262m.

5 See note 26 to the Group accounts.
6 Cash received on customers’ account is the unexpended cash received from customers in advance of delivery which is subject to advance payment guarantees unrelated to Group performance. It is included within
trade and other payables in the Group’ s balance sheet. BAE Systems Annual Report 2009 35
The Group funds its operations through a mixture of equity funding
and debt financing, including bank and capital market borrowings.
At 31 December 2009, the Group’ s capital was £4,614m (2008
£6,893m), which comprises total equity of £4,727m (2008 £7,289m)
less amounts accumulated in equity relating to cash flow hedges of
£113m (2008 £396m). Net cash as defined by the Group was £403m
(2008 £39m).
The capital structure of the Group reflects the judgement of the directors
of an appropriate balance of funding required. The Group’ s policy is to
maintain an investment grade credit rating. The Group’ s dividend policy
is to grow the dividend whilst maintaining a long-term sustainable
earnings cover of approximately two times.
In 2010, the Group will initiate a programme to return up to £500m to
shareholders by way of a market purchase of shares. This programme is
set in the context of an appropriately balanced use of capital. In addition
to this accelerated return to shareholders, the Group will continue to
pursue its strategy of organic investment and investing in attractive
sectors of the defence market through selective acquisitions. 
The Group’ s treasury activities are overseen by the T reasury Review
Management Committee (TRMC). T wo executive directors are members
of the TRMC, including the Group Finance Director who chairs the
Committee. The TRMC also has representatives with legal and 
taxation expertise. 
The Group operates a centralised treasury department that is
accountable to the TRMC for managing treasury activities in accordance
with the framework of treasury policies and guidelines approved by
the Board. It is an overriding policy that trading in financial instruments
for the purpose of profit generation is prohibited, with all financial
instruments being used solely for risk management purposes.
The Group’ s treasury policies in respect of the management of debt,
interest rates, liquidity, currency and credit quality are discussed below.
All treasury policies remain under close review given the continuing
volatility in the financial markets.
Further disclosure on financial instruments is set out in note 30 to the
Group accounts.
The Group, through its internal audit department, monitors compliance
against the principal policies and guidelines (including the utilisation
against credit limits), and any exceptions found are reported to the TRMC.
Debt
The Group’ s objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity,
flexibility and cost of debt funding through the use of borrowings from
TREASURY
CAPITAL
a range of markets with a range of maturities, currencies and rates of
interest, reflecting the Group’ s risk profile.
All the Group’ s material borrowings are arranged by the central treasury
department and funds raised are lent onward to operating subsidiaries
as required. Surplus funds are lent back to the central treasury
department where appropriate.
The maturity profile of the Group’ s borrowings is as follows:
2009 2008

3,254 2,578
The maturity profile of the Group’ s borrowings is illustrated graphically
below and a more detailed analysis is provided in note 19 to the 
Group accounts.
In June 2009, the Group raised $1.5bn in the US bond market in order 
to finance debt maturities in 2010 and 2011. The financing was
accomplished through the issue of two tranches of notes, $500m due 
in June 2014 with a coupon of 4.95% and $1bn due in June 2019 with 
a coupon of 6.375%. The net incremental interest cost of this additional
debt funding was £23m during 2009.
A $500m 4.75% bond is due to be repaid in August 2010.
Generally, excluding the impact of acquisition or disposal financing,
net cash/debt as defined by the Group
4
is driven by the operational
performance of the Group’ s subsidiaries and equity accounted
investments, and the level of receipts on major contracts. Historically , the
net cash/debt position of the Group has been at its best at the year end.
It remains the Group’ s intention to ensure the business is funded
conservatively, and to be pro-active in accessing the bank and capital
markets in achieving this aim. 
Interest rates
The Group’ s objective is to mitigate its exposure to interest rate
fluctuations on borrowings and deposits through varying the proportion
of fixed rate debt relative to floating rate debt over the forward time
horizon by utilising derivative instruments, mainly interest rate swaps.
The Group’ s current interest rate management policy is that a minimum
of 50% (2008 25%) and a maximum of 75% (2008 75%) of gross debt is
maintained at fixed interest rates. At 31 December 2009, the Group had
62% (2008 73%) of fixed rate debt and 38% (2008 27%) of floating rate
debt based on a gross debt of £3.3bn including debt-related derivative
financial assets (2008 £2.6bn).
In 2009, $1bn of the $1.5bn debt issued in the year was converted to a
floating rate bond by utilising a series of interest rate swaps.

FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED

Liquidity
The Group’ s objectives are to:
– maintain adequate undrawn committed borrowing facilities; and
– control and monitor bank credit risk and credit capacity utilisation.
The Group has a committed Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) of £1.455bn
(2008 £1.5bn), which is syndicated amongst the Group’ s core relationship
banks and is available to meet expected general corporate funding
requirements. A £45m commitment in the RCF from Lehman Brothers
Commercial Paper Inc. was cancelled during 2009 following an all bank
consent process. The RCF also provides standby funding for the Group’ s
US Commercial Paper programme. The Group has not issued any
Commercial Paper during 2009. The RCF is contracted until 2012,
although the available amount for the final year reduces to £1.3bn.
The RCF remained undrawn throughout the year . 
Cash flow forecasting is performed by each line of business as part of the
Integrated Business Planning process and as part of the monthly reporting
cycle. The Group monitors a rolling forecast of liquidity requirements to
ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining
sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
The Group adopts a conservative approach to the investment of its surplus
cash. It is deposited with strong financial institutions for short periods.
Bank counterparty credit risk is monitored closely on a systematic and
ongoing basis. A credit limit is allocated to each institution taking account
of its market capitalisation, credit rating and credit default swap price.
For internal credit risk purposes, all transactions are marked-to-market
and the resultant exposure is allocated against the credit limit. The Group
had cash and short-term investments at 31 December 2009 of £3,904m
(2008 £2,624m), which was invested with 27 (2008 14) financial
institutions. The maximum amount deposited with any individual bank
as at 31 December 2009 was less than £300m (2008 £250m).
Currency
The Group’ s objective is to reduce its exposure to volatility in earnings
and cash flows as a result of movements in foreign currency exchange
rates. The Group is exposed to a number of foreign currencies, the most
significant being the US dollar .
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in
respect of foreign currency denominated transactions. T o mitigate this risk,
the Group’ s policy is to hedge all material firm transactional exposures,
unless otherwise approved as an exception by the TRMC, as well as to
manage anticipated economic cash flows over the medium term. The
Group aims, where possible, to apply hedge accounting treatment for all
derivatives that hedge material transactional foreign currency exposures.
The Group is also exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange
rates in respect of the translation of net assets and income statements
of foreign subsidiaries and equity accounted investments. The Group
does not hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on
the income statement or balance sheet of overseas subsidiaries and
equity accounted investments it regards as long-term investments.
Hedges are, however , undertaken in respect of investments that are 
not considered long-term or core to the Group. 
Credit quality
The Group’ s objective is to maintain an investment grade rating in order
to ensure access to the widest possible sources of finance and minimise
the cost of debt funding to support the efficient operation of the Group’ s
activities. This is achieved through the delivery of planned operating
cash flows, and management of its relationships with debt capital
market investors, banks and rating agencies.
Three credit rating agencies, Moody’ s Investors Service, Standard and
Poor’ s Ratings Services and Fitch’ s Investors Service, publish credit
ratings for the Group. During the year , all three maintained the outlook 
for their ratings as stable. 
As at 31 December 2009, the Group’ s long-term credit ratings provided
by these agencies were as follows:
Rating agency Rating Outlook Category 
Moody’s Baa2 Stable Investment grade 
Standard & Poor’ s BBB+ Stable Investment grade 
Fitch’s BBB+ Stable Investment grade 
The Group operates a policy of partial self-insurance, with the majority of
cover placed in the external market. The Group continues to monitor its
insurance arrangements to ensure the quality and adequacy of cover .
The Group insures its export contracts and associated on-demand bank
guarantees against political and corporate risks. The Group monitors
and benchmarks this insurance to ensure its adequacy and
appropriateness.
During 2009, the Group sought external validation of the credit rating
of those insurers who have a significant proportion of the insurance
portfolio. The views of a number of rating agencies and insurance
intermediaries were considered to assess the long-term stability of
the Group’ s insurers. It is the Group’ s policy that all its insurers have
a minimum credit rating of A-.
INSURANCE BAE Systems Annual Report 2009 37
The Group’ s significant accounting policies are outlined in note 1 to 
the Group accounts. Not all of these significant accounting policies
require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgements
or estimates. 
The following is intended to provide an understanding of those policies
that management considers critical because of the level of complexity ,
judgement or estimation involved in their application and their impact
on the consolidated financial statements. These judgements involve
assumptions or estimates in respect of future events, which can vary from
what is anticipated. However , the directors believe that the consolidated
financial statements reflect appropriate judgements and estimations,
and provide a true and fair view of the Group’ s financial performance
and position over the relevant period. 
Contract revenue and proﬁt recognition
A significant proportion of the Group’ s defence activities are conducted
under long-term contract arrangements and are accounted for in
accordance with IAS 11, Construction Contracts.
Revenue is recognised on such contracts when performance milestones
have been completed and accepted by the customer . 
No profit is recognised on contracts until the outcome of the contract
can be reliably estimated. Profit is calculated by reference to reliable
estimates of contract revenue and forecast costs after making suitable
allowances for technical and other risks related to performance
milestones yet to be achieved. 
Owing to the complexity of many of the contracts undertaken by the Group,
the cost estimation process requires significant judgement. It is based
upon the knowledge and experience of the Group’ s project managers,
engineers, finance and commercial professionals, and uses the Group’ s
contract management processes. Factors that are considered in
estimating the cost of work to be completed and ultimate profitability
of the contract include the nature and complexity of the work to be
performed, availability and productivity of labour , the effect of change
orders, the availability of materials, performance of subcontractors,
and availability of and access to government-furnished equipment. 
Cost and revenue estimates and judgements are reviewed and updated
at least quarterly, and more frequently as determined by events or
circumstances. When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed
total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately
as an expense. Contract costs comprise directly attributable costs,
including an allocation of direct overheads. Indirect overheads are only
regarded as contract costs when their recovery is explicitly allowed for
under the terms of the contract. Indirect costs are otherwise treated
as a period cost and are expensed as incurred. Material changes in
one or more of these estimates, whilst not anticipated, would affect
the profitability of individual contracts. 
Where goods are supplied under arrangements not considered to
represent construction contracts, as defined by IAS 11, sales are
recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have
been transferred to the buyer , recovery of consideration is probable,
there is no continuing management involvement and revenue and costs
can be reliably measured. 
Where services are rendered, sales are recognised in proportion to the
stage of completion when the stage of completion of the services, and
the related revenue and costs, can be measured reliably. 
Additional details concerning the Group’ s revenue recognition policy are
in note 1 to the Group accounts. 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Retirement beneﬁt plans
The Group accounts for post-retirement pension and healthcare plans
in accordance with IAS 19, Employee Beneﬁts. 
For defined benefit retirement plans, the cost of providing benefits is
determined periodically by independent actuaries and charged to the
income statement in the period in which those benefits are earned 
by the employees. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in 
the period in which they occur , and are recognised in the statement of
comprehensive income. Past service cost is recognised immediately
to the extent the benefits are already vested, or otherwise is recognised
on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits
become vested. 
The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet
represent the present value of the defined benefit obligations as
adjusted for unrecognised past service cost and as reduced by the 
fair value of scheme assets. 
The main assumptions made in accounting for the Group’ s post-retirement
plans relate to the expected return on investments within the Group’ s
plans, the rate of increase in pensionable salaries, the rate of increase in
the retail price index, the mortality rate of plan members and the discount
rate applied in discounting liabilities. For each of these assumptions
there is a range of possible values and, in consultation with our actuaries,
management decides the point within that range that most appropriately
reflects the Group’ s circumstances. Small changes in these assumptions
can have a significant impact on the size of the deficit calculated
under IAS 19. 
The Group has allocated an appropriate share of the pension deficit to its
equity accounted investments and other participating employers using a
consistent and reasonable method of allocation which represents, based
on current circumstances, the directors’ best estimate of the proportion
of the deficit anticipated to be funded by these entities. The Group’ s
share of the pension deficit allocated to equity accounted investments
is included on the balance sheet within equity accounted investments. 
The valuing of assets and liabilities at a point in time rather than matching
expectations of assets and liabilities over time has no impact on 
short-term cash contributions to the pension plans. These funding
requirements are derived from separate independent actuarial valuations. 
Additional details concerning the Group’ s retirement benefit plans are
given in notes 1 and 21 to the Group accounts.
Intangible assets
In accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations, goodwill arising 
on acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalised and included in intangible
assets. Goodwill on acquisition of joint ventures and associates is
included in equity accounted investments. IFRS 3 also requires the
identification of other acquired intangible assets. The techniques 
used to value these intangible assets are in line with internationally 
used models, but do require the use of estimates which may differ
from actual outcomes. Future results are impacted by the amortisation 
period adopted for these items and, potentially, any differences 
between estimated and actual circumstances related to individual
intangible assets. 
Goodwill is not amortised, but is tested annually for impairment and
carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. The impairment
review calculations require the use of estimates related to the future
profitability and cash-generating ability of the acquired business.
Additional details concerning the Group’ s treatment of intangible 
assets and impairment reviews are given in notes 1 and 11 to the 
Group accounts.  DIRECTORS’ REPORT: BUSINESS REVIEW GROUP PERFORMANCE

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REVIEW
Corporate Responsibility is an integral part of
BAE Systems’ T otal Performance approach. T otal
Performance is about every aspect of the way we do
business: Customer Focus, Financial Performance,
Programme Execution and Responsible Behaviour .
T o reflect this, we aim to increasingly integrate our
reporting of Corporate Responsibility performance
into the Annual Report and increase the amount of
information available online. 
Our separate Corporate Responsibility Report is

HOW WE REPORT
Raj Rajagopal 
Managing Director ,
Corporate Responsibility
Continuing to embed a high performance culture, including delivery of our
Corporate Responsibility (CR) agenda, was one of our five Group Strategic
Objectives in 2009. Responsible behaviour is now further embedded in
our strategy as one of the four key elements of T otal Performance. 
T otal Performance focuses not just on what we do but also how we do it. 
It is about every aspect of the way we do business: Customer Focus,
Financial Performance, Programme Execution and Responsible Behaviour . 
Responsible business conduct and safety continued to be our priorities
for improving CR performance in 2009. These have been identified as
the issues with the most potential to impact the Group’ s reputation and
ability to operate. Achieving the highest standards in these areas will
build trust and enhance our relationships with stakeholders. Objectives
have been set to drive us towards leadership performance in both areas
and encourage adoption of consistent standards across the Group. 
Strong, visible leadership is essential to the delivery of our objectives.
In 2009, an average of 12.3% of the potential annual incentive for
Executive Committee members was allocated according to the Group’ s
achievement of key performance objectives for responsible business
conduct and safety. 
Other important aspects of our CR agenda include diversity and inclusion,
environmental sustainability , community involvement and education. 
Governance of Corporate Responsibility
Key performance indicators on our CR priorities are reported to the
Executive Committee on a quarterly basis and reviewed as part of
our Quarterly Business Review process. CR is an integral part of
our Operational Framework, and is subject to internal and external
assurance processes. 
The Managing Director Corporate Responsibility , Raj Rajagopal, supports
line leaders in driving the CR agenda and reports directly to the Chief
Executive. We established a global CR Forum in 2009 to support our
operating groups in fulfilling the Group’ s CR agenda. The CR Forum helps
to develop awareness and understanding of CR among our employees, and
embed sustainable improvements across our range of CR focus areas. 
Progress against CR objectives is reviewed quarterly by the CR Committee,
chaired by non-executive director Andy Inglis. The Committee provides
independent oversight, advice and strategic direction on social, ethical
and environmental issues that face the Group. The Committee’ s report
can be found on page 86.

BAE Systems is committed to becoming a recognised leader in responsible
business conduct. Our T otal Performance approach aims to establish a
clear understanding and shared commitment to responsible business
conduct from all our employees. 
The Woolf Committee – an external, independent committee
appointed by the BAE Systems Board and chaired by Lord Woolf,
former Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales – reported its findings
in May 2008. The Group established a three-year programme in
2008 to implement the Committee’ s 23 recommendations on how
BAE Systems could achieve a leadership position in responsible
business conduct.
2009 performance
The 2009 milestones for the programme, which focused on reviewing
and strengthening company processes and policies, and roll-out of the
Code of Conduct, have all been substantively achieved. The Board Charter
has been amended to include the Board’ s responsibilities for ensuring
high standards of responsible business conduct across the Group. The
remit of the CR Committee has been extended to include its responsibility
for oversight and reporting against those standards. All relevant policies
and processes have been agreed by the Executive Committee, and
incorporated into the Group’ s central system of governance, the
Operational Framework, at the beginning of January 2010.
Code of Conduct
The Code of Conduct, launched in January 2009, defines the principles
and standards of responsible business conduct we expect of all
employees. We intend that the Code will be reviewed regularly to ensure
it continues to meet best practice, with the first review being conducted
during 2010.
The Code of Conduct was communicated to employees in 2009
through team briefings. The briefings were designed to cover how the
Code of Conduct applies to employees in their daily work lives, and aimed
to create an environment where employees feel they can speak up, ask
questions and raise any issues relating to responsible business conduct. 
Employees were required to undertake either online or classroom-based
training on the Code of Conduct (see case study above). Approximately
91,000 employees in our wholly-owned businesses were briefed and
trained in 2009, representing approximately 95% of the workforce
1
. 
These employees were also asked to formally acknowledge that they
understood and would comply with the Code’ s requirements. By the
end of 2009, approximately 86% of the workforce
1
had provided their
written acknowledgement. 
Activity continues to ensure that the remaining employees complete
the Code of Conduct programme. Refresher training will begin in
2010. We have also updated our policy to ensure that breaches
of the Code of Conduct are subject to disciplinary procedures. 
The Group is not in a position to require our non-controlled joint ventures
or suppliers to adopt our specific standards (including operating an Ethics
Helpline) in their business activity. However , it is our aim that there is
clear understanding and a shared set of values governing how we do
business with our joint ventures.
RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT
In 2010, we plan to provide our top 1,000 suppliers with a copy
of our Code of Conduct and they will be encouraged to work to
equivalent standards.
Governance 
We have reviewed Group policies and governance processes in certain
areas in keeping with the Woolf Report recommendations. This includes
the development of a set of Responsible T rading Principles (see page 5). 
Our new and revised policies, including our Product T rading and Pursuit of
Export Opportunities policies, require us to make informed assessments
and decisions about the nature of our products and the business
opportunities we pursue. Products must be assessed against four
criteria: the type of product, its intended use, the end user and, for
exports, the country of sale.
The revised policy on offset (agreements with export customers to generate
work or create capability in their countries) requires us to ensure that robust
procedures are in place for assessing and committing to such agreements.
In the settlement reached with the US Department of Justice in February
2010 in connection with its investigation commenced in 2007, the
Company made commitments to the Department of Justice concerning
the Group’ s ongoing regulatory compliance, including the appointment
of an independent corporate monitor for a period of up to three years
to monitor the Company’ s compliance with such commitments.
Know the Code
Our objective in 2009 was to ensure that our employees are aware of
the Code of Conduct and understand how it applies to their day-to-day
working lives. During 2009, we trained approximately 91,000 employees
working in a wide range of roles in many countries around the world
using a range of training materials. 
As an example, our Military Air Solutions business in the UK used
mobile IT training facilities to enable manufacturing employees without
access to computers to take the online course in their normal place of
work. Where appropriate, employees were trained through classroom
sessions, during which they were encouraged to take part in interactive
case studies. 
Many employees took our online course, which explains the key aspects
of the Code of Conduct. The course guides staff through a series of
animated scenarios where employees are faced with typical ethical
dilemmas and includes a test to confirm understanding of the Code.

in response to the Woolf Report’ s 23
recommendations, and the launch and
roll-out of the global Code of Conduct. 
– In late 2009, a sample of approximately
10% of employees worldwide were
invited to participate in a survey on
the Group’ s approach to responsible
business conduct (see page 41
for results).
– Senior leadership each to lead
two employee focus/engagement
sessions to discuss the global
Code of Conduct and ethical issues.

in the Lost Work Days incident rate
compared with 2009. BAE Systems Annual Report 2009 41
In 2007, we created a Business Development Adviser Compliance Panel
(the ‘Panel’) for the review and assessment of adviser appointments
including for business development, security and offset advisers. All
appointments of lobbyists are required to be reviewed by the Panel, other
than certain domestic US appointments which are subject to separate
legislative controls. The Panel, which is required to advise the Company
as to whether it should proceed with an adviser appointment, is chaired
by independent third parties who are partners from leading law firms.
Our revised process for the appointment, selection and management
of advisers was described by the Woolf Committee as leading-edge
practice. All advisers added to the Company’ s adviser register in 2009
were appointed in accordance with a new global adviser policy introduced
from 1 January 2009, with the exception of a limited number of US
advisers who were already being assessed before the introduction of
the new global adviser policy. However , this limited group of US advisers
were also assessed by the Panel which recommended their appointment. 
In accordance with the settlement reached with the US Department of
Justice referred to above, the independent corporate monitor shall serve
as an ex-officio non-voting member of the Panel and the mandate of the
Panel shall be expanded to include review of certain other matters
relating to international business development.
Our policy on lobbying governments and other bodies has been revised 
to require all those lobbying externally on BAE Systems’ behalf to comply
with our Code of Conduct. From 2010, a report on lobbying activities
must also be provided to the CR Committee. 
An updated Gifts and Hospitality Policy sets out clear requirements 
for employees, including limits on the giving and receiving of gifts and
hospitality, together with recording of these activities. We have also
amended our Company Giving Policy to give clear guidance on all
Company donations.
Our Facilitation Payments Policy states that employees are prohibited
from making facilitation payments irrespective of whether or not they are
permitted by local laws, and requires employees to decline and report
any request for such payment.
Working to improve industry standards
BAE Systems is a member of both the Aerospace Industries Association
of America and the Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of
Europe, which agreed common Global Principles of Business Ethics for
the Aerospace and Defence Industry in October 2009. 
We are actively working with the UK defence industry to promote
the adoption of responsible business practices and we welcome the
publication of a draft Bribery Bill. The Bill aims to provide a comprehensive
scheme to deter bribery offences enabling courts and prosecutors to
respond more effectively to bribery in the public and private sectors
within the UK or abroad. 
BAE Systems, together with other leading multinationals, is supporting a
new Centre for Law and Ethics at University College London. The Centre,
established in October 2009, aims to promote debate on business
ethics and help companies promote an ethical corporate culture. 
Employee engagement
In late 2009, a representative sample (approximately 10%) of employees
worldwide were invited to participate in a survey on the Group’ s approach
to responsible business conduct. The survey covered the six questions
related to responsible business conduct included in our biennial full
employee opinion survey, which will next be held in 2010. 
Overall, 41% of the sample responded. The results confirm that almost all
respondents were aware of the ethical standards expected of them, with
75% of respondents believing that the Group demonstrates clear ethical
standards (see table below).
Whilst these results are generally positive, there remain areas for us to
focus on and improve.

ETHICS ENQUIRIES FROM EMPLOYEES DIRECTORS’ REPORT: BUSINESS REVIEW GROUP PERFORMANCE
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REVIEW CONTINUED
42 www.baesystems.com
The safety of employees and those using our products is critical to 
our business and an important responsibility. Our goal is to ensure
consistently good safety management across the Group in the short
term and to drive performance to a level comparable with the best
performing global companies by the end of 2011. 
In 2008, we put in place a four-year safety plan outlining the steps required
to move towards leadership in safety performance. Ensuring a common
understanding of our safety goals is a priority , particularly given the diverse
nature of our businesses, the different regulatory environments we operate
in and the range of safety risks we must manage.
A five-level Safety Maturity Matrix (SMM) is used to drive continual
improvement and to monitor progress across the Group. By 2011, our
target is for all our manufacturing sites to achieve Level 5 (best in class).
A Senior Safety Steering Group has been established comprising senior
safety leaders from each operating group, the Head of Safety Assurance
and the Deputy Managing Director Corporate Responsibility. 
2009 performance
Each line of business met SMM Level 3 requirements. This means that
they have in place systems aligned with occupational health and safety
standard OHSAS 18001 to address the majority of safety issues; that
they have a safety risk register; and that there is systematic training for
most employees in safety roles. Over 60% of major manufacturing sites
achieved Level 4, making the step-change to a proactive and integrated
approach to safety management across their operations. Internal audit,
in conjunction with senior safety managers, confirmed such achievement
of Level 4 through audits at 30 major manufacturing sites globally. 
In 2009, we reduced the total incident rate by 33% against the 10%
improvement target to 562 recorded injuries per 100,000 employees. 
SAFETY
All our operating groups are setting targets to reduce the rate of safety
incidents in line with achieving best in class performance by the end 
of 2011.
In previous reports, we have used days lost to work-related injuries
per 100,000 employees as our key safety metric. This year , we have
moved to reporting the lost work day case rate per 100,000 employees
(referenced as the incident rate within the safety objectives) to focus on
the causes of accidents and enable more meaningful comparison with
other companies. 
The main causes of major injury in 2009 across the Group continue to be
slips, trips and falls on the same level, accounting for 44% of recorded major
injuries. Other causes of major injury include falls from height (18%),
struck by moving (including flying/falling) object (13%) and injured while
handling, lifting or carrying (8%). Root cause analysis of types of incidents
will be carried out to identify common global issues and solutions.
We are deeply saddened to report the death of one of our employees
during deployment of communications equipment in Australia. We are 
reviewing the cause of this accident and co-operating fully with the
regulatory investigation. 
Product Safety Review following Haddon-Cave Report
Following the publication of the independent report by Charles Haddon-
Cave QC into the loss of Nimrod XV230 over Afghanistan in 2006,
BAE Systems has appointed Dr Chris Elliott FREng, a leading systems
engineer and barrister , to support and advise Nigel Whitehead FREng,
Group Managing Director , Programmes & Support, to undertake a review
of the Group’ s approach to product safety in the UK.
The review will examine current policies, processes, governance, actions
and behaviours associated with product safety and will be conducted by
a senior team of six people, with relevant qualifications and experience.
The team will work to help develop and enhance the Group’ s approach to
product safety and, where appropriate, understand how other industries
have addressed comparable matters. 
Focus on safety at US shipyards
Ship Repair sites in the US are developing a safety programme aimed
at creating an accident free workplace and to embed a safety culture
among employees. Compulsory safety training has been introduced
for all employees and managers. Safety performance is included in the
personal development review process for managers. Regular employee
safety surveys are used to help managers understand attitudes to
safety and identify areas for improvement. Three of the four Ship Repair
sites achieved Level 4 on the Safety Maturity Matrix in 2009 and safety
performance has improved significantly. 
Ship Repair’ s lost work day case rate demonstrated a 57%
improvement compared with 2008.

Reducing our impact on the environment and assisting suppliers to 
do the same, helps us to improve operational efficiency, reduce costs,
and ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. 
Product environmental performance is also of increasing interest 
to our customers. 
Our global Environmental Policy states our commitment to reducing
our impact on the environment and minimising the through-life impacts
of our products. This is also included in our Code of Conduct.
2009 performance
During 2009, our primary focus at a global level was on energy use.
We continued to monitor and report our energy use and business travel
on a Group-wide basis.
For the third year running, we have commissioned the Coefficient
Company to calculate our 2009 global carbon footprint and to help
improve our data collection methods. This analysis is scheduled to be
completed by the end of June 2010.
The Coefficient Company produced and provided an analysis of our
2008 global carbon footprint. Our carbon footprint has increased since
2007 for two principal reasons. Firstly, we have improved the coverage
and accuracy of our energy and business travel data across the Group.
Improvements in data have been supported by our work towards
preparing for the UK Carbon Reduction Commitment and the Australian
National Greenhouse & Energy Reporting Scheme. Secondly, new
businesses acquired during 2008 have brought with them associated
emissions, increasing our overall footprint. 
Fluctuations in our use of water , waste and volatile organic compounds
are heavily influenced by programme status. We continue to monitor and
manage this data at site and facility level, but no longer aggregate it at a
Group level.
Efforts to reduce energy use in our businesses this year included a new
£1m partnership with the University of Central Lancashire to develop
intelligent energy management systems. 
In the UK, an environmental sustainability framework was piloted to
help businesses plan for medium- and long-term risks and opportunities
associated with issues such as climate change, materials scarcity and
rising energy prices. The framework covers operational and product
impacts, and our supply chain, and will be rolled out across the Group. 
Product stewardship
Product environment working groups in the UK and US focus on assisting
the lines of business in complying with environmental legislation and
transferring best practice across the Group. A product environment
management handbook and e-learning course were launched in 2009, 
and these are supported by a Group-wide intranet site. 
ENVIRONMENT
Supply chain
Suppliers are expected to meet product safety and environmental
standards. BAE Systems is a signatory to the UK Ministry of Defence’ s
(MoD) Sustainable Procurement Charter and has committed to improve
standards in the defence supply chain by educating suppliers,
establishing performance measures and sharing best practice. 
Our Sustainable Procurement Working Group has published guidance 
to help employees carry out supplier sustainability risk and impact
assessments. These cover supplier performance on health and safety,
environment and business conduct, as well as employee awareness and
stakeholder dialogue. Assessments will be carried out as part of our
supplier management process from 2010. Sustainability training is
being developed in partnership with the UK’ s Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply and the US Institute of Supply Management, 
and will be launched in 2010.
Wind farm technology
BAE Systems has developed a systematic approach that helps wind
farm developers address the impact wind turbines have on radar . The
approach includes potential solutions ranging from modifications to
radar electronics to careful positioning of wind farms and radars, and

2009 performance
During 2009, we held a number of workshops attended by senior
management and functional groups to develop our inclusion agenda.
Our Operational Framework was reviewed to ensure it reflects the
Group’ s commitment to inclusion, and ensure it encourages the
behaviours and culture needed to underpin the Code of Conduct.
Senior leadership each committed to a personal inclusion objective,
such as mentoring, supporting women’ s network events and leading
focus groups with minority employee groups. 
A Global Diversity and Inclusion Working Group was launched in 2009 to
co-ordinate our approach to diversity and inclusion. A five-level Diversity
and Inclusion Maturity Matrix has been developed. This establishes a
consistent global benchmark, helping our operating groups to chart their
progress from meeting regulatory requirements (Level 1) to creating a
culture that embraces diversity as a source of competitive advantage
(Level 5). During 2010, each operating group will set targets against the
matrix reflecting their different stages of development.
Education and early careers
Education programmes in our home markets aim to interest young
people in science and engineering, and tackle perceptions that
engineering is a male career choice. In the UK, our schools road show
is in its fifth year , while in the US we continue to be a strategic partner
with FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and T echnology)
to encourage youth excitement for science, technology, engineering
and mathematics through robotics competitions. 
Other examples from across the Group are as follows:
– Concept2Creation in Australia encourages under 16s to work with
teachers and Group employees to develop a product or service. 
– In South Africa, the Group supports the education of children
from disadvantaged backgrounds as part of the South African
government’ s initiative to create a more equitable society. 
– BAE Systems is a lead sponsor of the Big Bang event, the UK’ s
largest ever national science, technology and engineering fair
for young people and teachers, attended by over 6,500 people. 
The Group partners with universities to develop courses that meet
the needs of our industry and provide placement opportunities for
undergraduates. As a partner in the development of the UK government’ s
new Diploma in Engineering for 14-19 year olds, the Group is helping to
ensure the programme addresses employers’ needs and puts students
in a stronger position when they enter the job market. 
We invest in recruiting and developing young people through our
graduate and apprenticeship programmes. In the UK, 352 graduates
joined the Group in 2009 and we are one of the biggest recruiters of
engineering apprentices, employing 283 new apprentices in the UK 
in 2009. 
Community involvement
Support for charities and community organisations helps foster good
relationships with the communities near our sites in the countries
in which we work. Providing opportunities for employees to volunteer
and fundraise for charity contributes to job satisfaction and a positive
working environment. 
The Company Giving Policy focuses on supporting the armed forces,
veterans and their families, as well as education projects with a science,
engineering and technology focus.
The Group makes donations to local, national and international
charities, and other not-for-profit organisations.
Charity Challenge is our Group-wide employee fundraising and
volunteering programme. In the UK, US and Australia, employees elect
partner charities for 18-month periods. During 2008/2009, our partner
charities were Sue Ryder Care (UK), Leukaemia Foundation (Australia)
and America Supports Y ou (US). 
Our total community investment (including our education programmes)
was £13.8m in 2009.
We work to ensure that BAE Systems has the right employees with the
right skills to serve customers in all our markets, now and in the future.
This activity is being delivered against a backdrop of skills shortages in
some areas of our industry, and intense competition for science and
engineering graduates in many of our home markets.
An inclusive workplace where all individuals are valued and respected,
encourages innovation, supports the retention of skilled employees 
and increases our attractiveness as an employer to potential recruits.
T raining and leadership programmes help us to develop the capabilities
needed in a changing marketplace and to support employees from 
all backgrounds to reach their full potential. We invest in the skills 
of our next generation of employees through our education and early
careers programmes.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY PERFORMANCE SUMMARY 
Responding to employee feedback
Following the 2008 employee opinion survey, the Executive Committee
agreed four performance improvement priorities in response to feedback
from employees. 
Progress in the four areas during 2009 includes:
Improvement priority Progress in 2009
Personal performance objectives
should be clear and measurable.
Properly recognise people for
doing a good job.
Business changes that affect us
should be communicated in a
timely manner .
Our working culture should enable
everyone to demonstrate high
standards of business conduct,
and to speak up and challenge
inappropriate behaviour . 
Operating groups continue to
improve performance objectives.
In particular , mid-year personal
development reviews are used
to refine objectives.
Efforts to ensure that managers
across the Group are aware of
tools they can use to recognise 
employee achievements.
Operating groups are continuing 
to improve communication from 
senior leaders on business
changes.
The roll-out of our Code of Conduct
has focused on creating an
environment where employees
feel they can speak up and raise
any concerns. 
Deloitte LLP have been engaged to provide assurance of CR data 
as follows:
– Reasonable assurance of business conduct performance data
(number of staff briefed, trained and who acknowledged the Code, 
and calls to the Ethics Helpline); and
– Limited assurance of other performance data relating to safety
(fatalities, major injuries (number and rate) and lost work day case
rate), business conduct (dismissals for reasons relating to unethical
behaviour) and HR data (gender , ethnicity and age diversity).

BAE Systems’ Businesses BAE Systems Annual Report 2009 47
Effective management of risks and opportunities is essential to
the delivery of the Group’ s objectives, achievement of sustainable
shareholder value and protection of its reputation. The Group’ s approach
to risk management is aimed at the early identification of key risks, and
then removing or reducing the likelihood and effect of risks before they
occur , and dealing effectively with them if they crystallise. The Group is
committed to the protection of its assets, which include human, property
and financial resources, through an effective risk management process,
underpinned where appropriate by insurance.
The Group is committed to the effective management of material 
non-financial and reputational risks, including those arising in 
connection with safety and ethical issues.
Reporting and monitoring
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that risk is effectively
managed across the Group. 
Reporting within the Group is structured so that key issues are escalated
through the management team, ultimately to the Board if appropriate.
The underlying principles of the Group’ s risk management policy are
that risks are continuously monitored, associated action plans reviewed,
appropriate contingencies provisioned and this information reported
through established management control procedures.
The Board has delegated:
– to the Audit Committee, the responsibility for reviewing in detail 
the effectiveness of the Group’ s system of internal control policies 
and procedures for the identification, assessment and reporting of 
risk; and
– to the Corporate Responsibility Committee, the responsibility for
monitoring and reviewing the Group’ s performance in managing 
social, environmental, ethical and reputational risk.
Both the Audit and Corporate Responsibility committees report the
findings of their reviews to the Board.
Business risk management
The responsibility for risk identification, analysis, evaluation, mitigation,
reporting and monitoring rests with line management. Guidance for
managers is given in the Group’ s Risk Management Policy in the
Operational Framework and, in respect of projects, in the Lifecycle
Management (LCM) Framework. 
Identified risks are documented in controlled risk registers showing:
the risks that have been identified; characteristics of the risk; the basis
for determining mitigation strategy; and what reviews and monitoring
are necessary . Each risk is allocated an owner who has authority and
responsibility for assessing and managing it. 
In addition, the Group has a six-monthly Operational Assurance
Statement (OAS) process, which is mandated by the Group’ s Operational
Framework. The OAS is in two parts: a self-assessment of compliance
with the Operational Framework; and a report showing the key risks for
the relevant business. T ogether with independent reviews undertaken 
by Internal Audit, and the work of the external auditors, the OAS forms
the Group’ s process for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of
internal controls.
The output from the risk assessment processes are collated and
reviewed by the Executive Committee to identify those issues where the
cumulative risk, or possible reputational impacts, could be significant.
The Executive Committee’ s risk workshops allocate management
responsibility for the management of the most significant non-financial
risks to the Group. The non-financial risk register is also reviewed
regularly by the Executive Committee to monitor the ongoing status
and progression of mitigation plans. In addition, it is also reviewed on
a regular basis by the Board and Corporate Responsibility Committee. 
As with any system of internal control, the policies and processes that
are mandated in the Operational Framework are designed to manage
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives,
and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against
material misstatement or loss.
Principal risks
In light of the global economic environment, an additional risk in respect
of the Group’ s dependence on component availability, subcontractor
performance and key suppliers has been disclosed this year (see 
page 49).

PRINCIPAL RISKS
DEFENCE SPENDING
The Group is
dependent
on defence
spending and
reductions in
such spending
could adversely
affect the Group.
Description: The Group’ s core businesses are primarily
defence-related, selling products and services directly
and indirectly primarily to the US, the UK, the Saudi Arabian
and other national governments. In any single market,
defence spending depends on a complex mix of political
considerations, budgetary constraints and the ability of the
armed forces to meet specific threats and perform certain
missions. Because of these factors, defence spending may
be subject to significant fluctuations from year to year . 
Although the Group expects growth in US defence spending to
slow, it believes it is well placed to support the US Department
of Defense’ s likely emphasis on force sustainment, readiness
and affordable transformation. The UK defence equipment
budget is expected to continue to be constrained, having
potential implications for the sustainability of long-term
funding for future defence technologies and engineering
capabilities in the UK. Saudi Arabia is expected to remain
one of the heaviest defence spenders in the world.
Impact: A decrease in defence purchases by the Group’ s
major customers could have a material adverse effect on the
Group’ s future results of operations and financial condition.
Mitigation: The Group’ s business is geographically spread
across seven home markets and its products are marketed
across a range of sectors within the defence arena. In
addition, the Group uses realistic assumptions to underpin
its financial and operational planning.
LARGE CONTRACTS
Certain parts 
of the Group’s
business are
dependent on a
small number of
large contracts.
Description: A significant proportion of the Group’ s 
revenue comes from a small number of large contracts.
These contracts individually are typically worth or potentially
worth £1bn or more including, but not limited to, those
contracts in the Programmes & Support and International
operating groups. 
Impact: The loss, expiration, suspension, cancellation or
termination of any one of these contracts, for any reason,
could have a material adverse effect on the Group’ s future
results of operations and financial condition.
Mitigation: The Group has a large forward order book and 
a well-balanced spread of programmes. An analysis of the
Group’ s order book by major programme and operating
group is presented on page 13. The Board regularly reviews
the Group’ s performance on these contracts, and the
Executive Committee continues to work closely with these
customers to ensure the Group’ s strategy is aligned with
theirs (refer to Strategy section on page 10).
CONTRACT TIMING
The timing of
contracts could
materially affect
the Group’s
future results
of operations
and financial
condition.
Description: The Group’ s operating performance and cash
flows are dependent, to a significant extent, on the award of
defence contracts.
Impact: Because the amounts payable under these
contracts can be substantial, the timing of award or failure to
receive anticipated orders could materially affect the Group’ s
operating results and cash flow for the periods affected.
Mitigation: The Board regularly reviews the Group’ s
performance with regard to contract awards, and the
Executive Committee actively manages the assets and
resources of the Group in line with the timing of awards.
GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS
The Group’s
largest customer
contracts are
government
contracts.
Description: The governments of the United Kingdom, 
the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are 
the Group’ s three largest end customers. Any significant
disruption or deterioration in the relationship with
these governments and a corresponding reduction in
government contracts would significantly reduce the
Group’ s revenues. Moreover , companies engaged in
the supply of defence-related equipment and services to
government agencies are subject to certain business risks
particular to the defence industry. These governments
could unilaterally cancel, suspend or amend their
contractors’ funding under existing contracts or eligibility 
for new contracts potentially at short notice. T erms and risk
sharing agreements can also be amended. In addition, the
Group, as a government contractor , is subject to financial
audits and other reviews by some of its governmental
customers with respect to the performance of, and the
accounting and general practices relating to, government
contracts. As a result of these audits and reviews, 
costs and prices under these contracts may be subject 
to adjustment. 
Impact: The termination of one or more of the contracts 
for the Group’ s programmes by governments, or the failure
of the relevant agencies to obtain expected funding
appropriations for the Group’ s programmes, could have 
a material adverse effect on the Group’ s future results 
of operations and financial condition. 
Mitigation: The Board regularly reviews the Group’ s
performance in these home markets, and the Executive
Committee continues to work closely with these
customers to ensure the Group strategy is aligned
with theirs (refer to Strategy section on page 10). FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS
The Group has
fixed-price
contracts.
Description: A significant portion of the Group’ s revenue
is derived from fixed-price contracts, although the Group
has reduced its exposure to fixed-priced design and
development activity which is in general more risk intensive
than fixed-price production activity . An inherent risk in these
fixed-price contracts is that actual performance costs may
exceed the projected costs on which the fixed prices for
such contracts are agreed.
Impact: The Group’ s failure to anticipate technical
problems, estimate costs accurately or control costs
during performance of a fixed-priced contract may reduce
the profitability of such a contract or result in a loss.
Mitigation: T o manage contract-related risks and
uncertainties, contracts are managed through the application
of the Lifecycle Management (LCM) business process
mandated by the Group’ s Operational Framework at the
operational level (refer to pages 15 and 84 for further
information on LCM). The consistent application of metrics is
used to support the review of individual contract performance
(refer to page 28 for KPIs relating to programme execution).
GLOBAL MARKET
The Group is
exposed to
risks inherent
in operating in
a global market.
Description: BAE Systems is a global company which
conducts business in a number of regions, including
the Middle East, and, as a result, assumes certain risks
associated with businesses with a broad geographical
reach. In some countries these risks include, and are
not limited to, the following: government regulations
and administrative policies could change quickly and
restraints on the movement of capital could be imposed;
governments could expropriate the Group’ s assets;
burdensome taxes or tariffs could be introduced;
political changes could lead to changes in the business
environment in which the Group operates; and economic
downturns, political instability and civil disturbances could
disrupt the Group’ s business activities. 
Impact: The occurrence of any such events could have a
material adverse effect on the Group’ s future operational
performance and financial condition.
Mitigation: The Group has a balanced portfolio with seven
home markets.
COMPONENT AVAILABILITY , SUBCONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE AND KEY SUPPLIERS
The Group is
dependent
upon component
availability,
subcontractor
performance and
key suppliers.
Description: The Group is dependent upon the delivery of
materials by suppliers and the assembly of components
and subsystems by subcontractors used in its products 
in a timely and satisfactory manner and in full compliance
with applicable terms and conditions. 
Impact: Some of the Group’ s suppliers or subcontractors
may be impacted by the current economic environment and
constraints on available financing, which could impair their
ability to meet their obligations to the Group. In addition,
some products require relatively scarce raw materials. 
The Group is generally subject to specific procurement
requirements, which may , in effect, limit the suppliers and
subcontractors the Group may utilise. In some instances,
the Group is dependent on sole-source suppliers. If any of
these suppliers or subcontractors fails to meet the Group’ s
needs, the Group may not, in the short term, have readily
available alternatives. While the Group enters into long-term
or volume purchase agreements with certain suppliers and
takes other actions to ensure the availability of needed
materials, components and subsystems, the Group cannot
be sure that such items will be available in the quantities the
Group requires, if at all. If the Group experiences a material
supplier or subcontractor problem, its ability to satisfactorily
and timely complete its customer obligations could be
negatively impacted which could result in reduced sales,
termination of contracts and damage to its reputation and
relationships with its customers. The Group could also incur
additional costs in addressing such a problem. Any of these
events could have a negative impact on the Group’ s future
results of operations and financial condition. 
Mitigation: The Group’ s procurement function is
responsible for establishing and managing end-to-end
integrated supplier arrangements. It is led by a member 
of the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee
continues to monitor this risk and the Group has
experienced no material negative impact to date. In light 
of global economic conditions, the Group has reviewed
strategically important suppliers globally to assess their
financial health.
BAE Systems Annual Report 2009 49 DIRECTORS’ REPORT: BUSINESS REVIEW GROUP PERFORMANCE
PRINCIPAL RISKS CONTINUED
50 www.baesystems.com
COMPETITION
The Group’s
business is
subject to
significant
competition.
Description: Most of the Group’ s businesses are focused
on the defence industry and subject to competition from
national and multi-national firms with substantial resources
and capital, and many contracts are obtained through a
competitive bidding process. The Group’ s ability to compete
for contracts depends to a large extent on the effectiveness
and innovation of its research and development programmes,
its ability to offer better programme performance than
its competitors at a lower cost to its customers, and the
readiness of its facilities, equipment and personnel to
undertake the programmes for which it competes. 
Additionally, in some instances, governments direct to
a single supplier all work for a particular programme,
commonly known as a sole-source programme. Although
governments have historically awarded certain programmes
to the Group on a sole-source basis, they may in the future
determine to open such programmes to a competitive
bidding process. Government contracts for defence-related
products can, in certain countries, be awarded on the basis
of home country preference. Therefore, other defence
companies may have an advantage over the Group for some
defence-related contracts on the basis of the jurisdiction in
which they are organised, where the majority of their assets
are located or where their officers or directors are located. 
Impact: In the event that the Group is unable adequately 
to compete in the markets in which it operates, the 
Group’ s business and results of operations may be
adversely affected.
Mitigation: The Group’ s strong global market positioning,
balanced portfolio, leading capabilities and performance
continue to address this risk (refer to pages 16 to 19 for
further information on the Group’ s positioning and portfolio).
PENSION FUNDING
The Group is
exposed to funding
risks in relation
to the defined
benefits under its
pension schemes.
Description: The Group operates certain defined benefit
pension schemes. At present, in aggregate, there is an
actuarial deficit between the value of projected liabilities 
of these schemes and the value of the assets they hold. 
The Group has put in place and is implementing deficit
recovery plans in line with agreements reached with the
respective scheme trustees based on actuarial advice 
and valuation results.
Impact: The amount of the deficits may be adversely
affected by a number of factors, including lower than
assumed investment returns, changes in long-term interest
rate and price inflation expectations, and greater than
anticipated improvements in members’ longevity. An
increase in pension scheme deficit may require the Group 
to increase the amount of cash contributions payable to
these schemes, thereby reducing cash available to meet
the Group’ s other obligations or business needs.
Mitigation: The performance of the Group’ s pension
schemes and deficit recovery plans are regularly reviewed
by both the Group and the T rustees of the schemes taking
actuarial and investment advice as applicable. The results
of these reviews are discussed with the Board and
appropriate action taken (refer to page 150 for further
details of the Group’ s retirement benefit plans).
CONSORTIA AND JOINT VENTURES
The Group is
involved in
consortia, joint
ventures and
equity holdings
where it does
not have control.
Description: The Group participates in various consortia,
joint ventures and equity holdings, exercising varying
and evolving degrees of control. While the Group seeks to
participate only in ventures in which its interests are aligned
with those of its partners, the risk of disagreement is
inherent in any jointly controlled entity, and particularly in
those entities that require the unanimous consent of all
members with regard to major decisions, and that specify
restricted rights.
Impact: In the event of disagreement within a consortium,
joint venture or equity holding and the business arrangement
failing to meet its strategic objectives or expected benefits,
the Group’ s business and results of operations may be
adversely affected.
Mitigation: The Group has formal systems and procedures
in place to monitor the performance of such business
arrangements and identify and manage any adverse
scenario arising.
EXPORT CONTROLS AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS
The Group is
subject to
export controls
and other
restrictions.
Description: A portion of the Group’ s sales is derived from
the export of its products. Many of the products the Group
designs and manufactures for military or dual use are
considered to be of national strategic interest. The export 
of such products outside the jurisdictions in which they
are produced is normally subject to licensing and export
controls and other restrictions. No assurance can be given
that the export controls to which the Group is subject will
not become more restrictive, that new generations of the
Group’ s products will not also be subject to similar or more
stringent controls, or that political factors or changing
international circumstances will not result in the Group
being unable to obtain necessary export licences. 
Impact: Reduced access to export markets could have
a material adverse effect on the Group’ s future results of
operations and financial condition. Failure to comply with
export controls and wider regulations could expose the
Group to fines and other penalties, including potential
restrictions on trading.
Mitigation: The Group has formal systems and policies in
place which are mandated under the Group’ s Operational
Framework to ensure adherence to regulatory requirements
and to identify any restrictions that could adversely impact
the Group’ s future activities. BAE Systems Annual Report 2009 51
ACQUISITIONS
The Group has
experienced
growth through
acquisitions.
Anticipated
benefits of
acquisitions may
not be realised.
Description: The Group has experienced growth through
acquisitions and continues to pursue acquisitions in order
to meet its strategic objectives. Integrating the operations
and personnel of acquired businesses is a complex
process. The Group may not be able to integrate the
operations of acquired businesses with existing operations
rapidly or without encountering difficulties. 
Impact: The diversion of management attention to
integration efforts and any difficulties encountered in
combining operations could adversely affect the Group’ s
business. The failure to manage growth by acquisition
while at the same time maintaining adequate focus on the
existing assets of the Group could have a material adverse
effect on the Group’ s business, future results of operations
or financial condition. In addition, failure to integrate
acquisitions appropriately creates the risk of impairments
arising on goodwill and other intangible assets. 
Mitigation: The Group has an established methodology 
in place to deliver the effective integration of acquisitions.
The Group has an established policy for monitoring
impairment risks. See note 1 to the Group accounts on
page 125 for further information on the Group’ s approach 
to impairment testing.
EXCHANGE RATES
The Group
is exposed
to volatility
in currency
exchange
rates.
Description: The global nature of the Group’ s business
means it is exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates
in respect of foreign currency denominated transactions,
and the translation of net assets and income statements 
of foreign subsidiaries and equity accounted investments.
The Group is exposed to a number of foreign currencies, 
the most significant being the US dollar . 
Impact: Significant fluctuations in exchange rates to 
which the Group is exposed could have a material adverse
effect on the Group’ s future results of operations and
financial condition.
Mitigation: In order to protect itself against currency
fluctuations, the Group’ s policy is to hedge all material firm
transactional exposures, unless otherwise approved as an
exception by the T reasury Review Management Committee, as
well as to manage anticipated economic cash flow exposures
over the medium term. The Group aims, where possible,
to apply hedge accounting treatment for all derivatives that
hedge material foreign currency exposures. The Group does
not hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements
on the income statement or balance sheet of overseas
subsidiaries and equity accounted investments it regards
as long-term investments. Hedges are, however , undertaken
in respect of investments that are not considered long-term
or core to the Group.
LAWS AND REGULATIONS
The Group is
subject to risk
from a failure to
comply with laws
and regulations.
Description: The Group’ s operations are subject to
numerous domestic and international laws, regulations and
restrictions. Non-compliance with these laws, regulations
and restrictions could expose the Group to fines, penalties,
suspension or debarment, which could have a material
adverse effect on the Group. The Group has contracts
and operations in many parts of the world and operates
in a highly regulated environment. The Group is subject to
the laws and regulations of many jurisdictions, including
those of the UK and US. These include, without limitation,
regulations relating to import-export controls, money-
laundering, false accounting, anti-bribery and anti-boycott
provisions. From time to time, the Group is subject to
government investigations relating to its operations. 
Impact: Failure by the Group or its sales representatives,
marketing advisers or others acting on its behalf to
comply with these laws and regulations could result
in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities resulting
in significant fines and penalties and/or result in the
suspension or debarment of the Group from government
contracts for some period of time or suspension of the
Group’ s export privileges.
Mitigation: During the year , the Group has continued to 
add to its resources dedicated to its legal and regulatory
compliance in order to further enhance its capability to
identify and manage the risk of compliance failure. Internal
and external market risk assessments form an important
element of the ongoing corporate development process.
Policies and procedures for the appointment of advisers
engaged in business development have been further
refined, and a uniform global policy and process has 
been established. In the settlement reached with the US
Department of Justice in February 2010 in connection with
its investigation commenced in 2007, the Company made
commitments to the Department of Justice concerning the
Group’ s ongoing regulatory compliance, including the
appointment of an independent monitor for a period of 
up to three years to monitor the Company’ s compliance 
with such commitments.

was £380m (2008 £380m). 
Electronic Solutions
Electronic Solutions continued to demonstrate its leadership position
in the electronic warfare market through Low-Rate Initial Production
(LRIP) awards for electronic warfare suites on the F-35 Lightning II. During
2009, orders totalled more than $220m (£136m). Deliveries on the first
four LRIP contracts will conclude in 2012, and future contract awards 
are anticipated to support aircraft deliveries to the US government and
international partner countries. 
US Army demand for thermal weapon sights drove deliveries of some
36,000 systems valued at $340m (£217m) in 2009 under the five-year
Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract. Cumulative orders
for these weapon sights exceed $500m (£310m) for 68,000 sights.
US Army orders for the Common Missile Warning Systems (CMWS)
totalled more than $100m (£62m) in 2009. CMWS is a helicopter missile
warning system that detects incoming missiles, rejects false alarms,
and cues the onboard infrared jamming system to the missile’ s location.
The system logged its millionth combat flight hour during the year .
T wo IDIQ contracts were received from the US Army for the Laser T arget
Locator Module and the Driver’ s Vision Enhancer Family of Systems. 
The lightweight target locators enable soldiers to quickly, safely and
accurately determine target coordinates in daylight or darkness, and 
the vision enhancement systems provide all-weather , day/night visibility
to operators of combat and logistics vehicles. Initial orders for the two
systems totalled $115m (£71m) in 2009.
The US Navy selected a BAE Systems-Alliant T echsystems team for 
the Joint and Allied Threat Awareness System (JATAS) technology
demonstration. JATAS is the next-generation missile warning system 
to protect US Navy and Marine Corps helicopters and tilt-wing aircraft.
Information Solutions
Some two-thirds of the line of business’ s activity is in support of the 
US intelligence community.
The Information Solutions business also positioned itself among the
largest providers of managed information technology services, receiving
a seven-year contract to manage Information T echnology (IT) operations
for the US T reasury, valued at up to $325m (£201m). 
The business received a contract for up to $148m (£92m) from the
US Department of Homeland Security to support the agency’ s fingerprint
image tracking programme.
In the government intelligence market, Information Solutions emerged
as a leader in analysis of full-motion video and other advanced imagery,
doubling the number of its own imagery analysts, and opening a facility 
to train analysts for the military and intelligence communities. 
BAE Systems’ prominent role in the information technology sector was
recognised by Computerworld magazine which named the business one
of the top 100 IT employers in the US.
Platform Solutions
Platform Solutions further expanded its leadership in hybrid propulsion
for urban mass transit. The HybriDrive® propulsion system made its
European debut, demonstrated on vehicles in partnership with UK-based
manufacturer , Alexander Dennis Limited. As part of a T ransport for
London trial programme, BAE Systems has hybrid propulsion systems
for 12 double-deck and five single-deck buses.
The business is well positioned for a hybrid bus production order for
London’ s transit fleet in 2010. The efficient, emissions-reducing hybrid
technology now powers more than 2,000 buses in North America and will

Our efficient, low-emission HybriDrive® propulsion technology has
been in service on buses since 1998. It is currently powering more
than 2,000 buses and transporting over a million passengers daily
in cities in North America and London. T o date, these buses have
accumulated more than 100 million miles, saved nearly 10 million
gallons of diesel fuel, and prevented more than 100,000 tons of
carbon emissions.

from Daimler Buses North America which received a 500-unit order
(with an option for 200 additional units) from the Seattle T ransit Agency.
Following the US Army’ s development of the Common Modular Power
System as its standard power management architecture for all legacy
and modern vehicles, the business received its first production contract
in support of the Paladin self-propelled howitzer .
Platform Solutions received the launch order for its holographic pilot
display technology. The UK Ministry of Defence selected the Q-Sight™
helmet-mounted display for its Lynx helicopter programme, a
development that positions the business for an expanded role in 
low-visibility operation of rotary wing aircraft. The technology provides
superior optical performance with reduced weight and cost.
Support Solutions
The US military’ s Human T errain T eams programme awarded the business
a $350m (£217m), five-year contract to support urgent needs for
recruitment, development and operational support of counter-insurgency
efforts. Human T errain T eams embed social scientists within combat
brigades to help tacticians in field environments understand local cultures.
A $320m (£198m), five-year US Army contract was received to provide
counter-Improvised Explosive Device (IED) operations and mission
support covering comprehensive, all-source intelligence analysis to
assist in the global counter-IED fight. 
The US Navy awarded a $233m (£144m) contract for engineering and
other services to support C4ISR (Command, Control, Communications,
Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) systems at
land-based facilities, and on platforms such as ships, submarines and
ground vehicles.
In the Ship Repair business, the US Navy’ s first ever full ship
modernisation was completed, a year-long, $31m (£19m) upgrade 
of the USS Bunker Hill. The maintenance, repair and modernisation
programme was concluded on time and met all critical milestones. 
Coyote Unmanned Aircraft System
BAE Systems, in partnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), completed the first successful test flight of
its small, electric-powered Coyote Unmanned Aircraft System. The
lightweight aircraft can be equipped with sensors or cameras to perform
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions while the host
aircraft remains in safe airspace. It also has potential uses in weather
forecasting. NOAA funded the test flight, a major step forward for this
innovative and one-of-a-kind system.
Laser Target Locator Modules
BAE Systems has been awarded a five-year Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-
Quantity contract to produce Laser T arget Locator Modules for the US
Army. The system provides an all-weather , lightweight, handheld laser
target locator system that allows soldiers to accurately identify target
locations while on foot, in daylight or at night, and in fog or smoke. DIRECTORS’ REPORT: BUSINESS REVIEW SEGMENTAL PERFORMANCE

United States
BAE Systems continued in its role as a premier combat systems 
supplier to the US Army Heavy Brigade Combat T eam (HBCT), providing
remanufacturing, reset and support for key brigade components.
BAE Systems was awarded $791m (£490m) of contracts for Bradley
Fighting Vehicles and $277m (£172m) of contracts for Hercules M88
Recovery Vehicles during 2009 while delivering more than 1,500
completed vehicles to the customer .
The business was awarded an initial $64m (£40m) Paladin Integrated
Management contract to modernise the M109A6 Paladin self-propelled
howitzer system, including the design, fabrication and testing of five
prototypes and two support vehicles. 
BAE Systems continued to build the FMTV trucks with contracts for
approximately $2bn (£1.2bn) per year to the end of 2010. Some 8,400
trucks were manufactured and delivered to the US Army in 2009.
A setback for the Group was the notification by the US Department of
Defense in August 2009 and, following a re-evaluation of the bids, in
February 2010 that a follow-on production contract for vehicles under 
the FMTV programme had been lost.
A new Euro V-compliant Global T actical Vehicle has been designed and
produced to address European market requirements. The vehicle was
unveiled at the biennial Defence Systems & Equipment international
exhibition in the UK in September .
The personnel security business secured over $371m (£230m) of
contracts for individual soldier protection, with contracts for Modular
Lightweight Load Carrying Equipment from the Defense Logistics Agency
as well as contracts for over 230,000 Outer T actical Vests.
As part of the ongoing realignment of the Land & Armaments business 
in the US, the business has implemented rationalisation programmes
reducing headcount by 12% and the closure of seven facilities. 
United Kingdom
Under the 15-year munitions partnering agreement with the UK
Ministry of Defence (MoD), delivery rates on small arms ammunition
continued at an average of one million rounds per day in support of
current operations. As committed under the agreement, £15m has
been invested so far in new manufacturing operations out of the total
programme for more than £120m. 
Significant work is underway to support operations in Afghanistan,
particularly in carrying out urgent operational upgrade work to vehicles
such as the Warrior and the new Panther , to continue to protect against
rapidly evolving threats. 
The business submitted competitive bids into both the Future Rapid
Effects System (FRES) Specialist Vehicle (SV) and Warrior upgrade
programmes, the outcomes of which are currently expected to be 
known in 2010.
The BAE Systems turret design is optimised for the new cased-telescoped
ammunition weapon system, the CT40, which was mandated by the UK
MoD for both the Warrior and FRES SV programmes.
With a new schedule on the T errier armoured tractor programme agreed
at the end of 2008, the MoD confirmed the production of 60 vehicles
with enhancements to improve protection beyond the original design.
Production began in early 2010.
Bradley
Land & Armaments continues to focus on Readiness & Sustainment
activity. In 2009, the US Army awarded BAE Systems a contract to
refurbish some of its heavy infantry vehicles. Through a public-private
partnership, BAE Systems will repair and upgrade 606 Bradley
Fighting Vehicles. This process mitigates the effect of combat use,
replaces battle damaged vehicles and provides the military with
vehicles in pre-deployment condition.

forces. A total of 158 M777s were delivered in 2009. The M777 system
has been deployed on operations in both Afghanistan and Iraq.
As part of its ongoing restructuring, the business announced over 500
job losses and the closure of three sites. 
Sweden
Contracts for 24 BvS10 Viking amphibious all-terrain vehicles were
awarded by the UK MoD for a value of £16m. All 24 will be of the new 
up-armoured MkII variant. In December , the BvS10 was selected
following a competition to supply vehicles to the French armed forces
and a contract for up to €220m (£196m) was awarded.
Export deliveries continued for CV90 vehicles and support to several
customers around the world, including the Netherlands, Denmark
and Sweden. 
The 155mm Archer self-propelled artillery system has been selected 
and confirmed by both Sweden and Norway with contracts for a total
of 48 systems expected to be signed in early 2010.
A successful legal appeal was made against the decision of the Swedish
Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) in June 2009 to choose a
competitor’ s vehicle for the Armoured Wheeled Vehicle programme.
The Administrative Court of Stockholm ruled in October that the FMV
must re-compete the procurement. The outcome of the competition is
currently expected in 2010.
The Swedish businesses have announced job losses in 2009, totalling
approximately 350, as a consequence of restructuring activity. 
South Africa
The South African business continued to deliver RG vehicles to several

Helping to raise awareness of careers in
engineering
In Minneapolis, to help raise awareness of careers in engineering, we run
a Minorities & Women in T echnology Programme, to provide female and
minority students who are interested in engineering and technology with
an opportunity to see engineering principles applied in a real-life work
setting. Our engineering employees mentor students and lead them
through a 20-week programme. The students work side-by-side with
engineers from various disciplines and during the programme rotate
across different fields of engineering to see how we deliver a final
product to the customer . 
M777
BAE Systems celebrated delivery of the 500th M777 howitzer to the US
military in 2009. The M777 is the world’ s first artillery weapon to make

Programmes & Support is driven by its existing strong order book, and the level of future UK
Ministry of Defence (MoD) funding to meet current UK armed forces operational requirements
and delivery of the Defence Industrial Strategy. A Strategic Defence Review will begin after the
general election in 2010.
In Military Air Solutions, growth is linked to increased combat aircraft production activity and 
in-service support performance.
Surface Ships is underpinned by the six-ship T ype 45 destroyer programme, the manufacturing
phase of the Queen Elizabeth Class carrier programme, export contracts and the 15-year T erms
of Business Agreement with the UK MoD. 
The Submarine Solutions business remains focused on the Astute programme, and on delivering the
concept design work for the Successor Programme. Follow-on orders for Astute are key to retaining
the skill base necessary to design and build a next-generation nuclear deterrent submarine.
Detica’ s reputation in the UK security market, repositioning to become a solution integrator and
the publication of the UK government cybersecurity strategy , mean the business is positioned to
benefit from continued government focus on intelligence, security and resilience.

New buildings keep the environment in mind
Additions to our site at Samlesbury are being designed and built to
meet demanding environmental criteria, and to reduce environmental
impacts and running costs. The low-energy buildings make maximum
use of daylight whilst minimising solar gain and incorporate innovative
design through the use of night-time cooling and natural ventilation
to reduce the need for air-conditioning. Designed also with energy
efficient heating systems, including a biomass boiler , and leading edge
lighting controls, these features in combination ensure that we meet a
requirement that 10% of the energy needs of the new developments
are provided from renewable sources. The site also has a small-scale
wind turbine that supplies the new site entrance building.  DIRECTORS’ REPORT: BUSINESS REVIEW SEGMENTAL PERFORMANCE

During 2009, International achieved sales
1
of £4,253m (2008 £3,333m).
The increase in sales

was predominantly a result of a full 12 months of
trading from the acquired T enix Defence business and entry into service
of T yphoon aircraft in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 
Underlying EBITA
2
was £442m (2008 £435m) generating a return on
sales of 10.4% (2008 13.1%). The reduction in return on sales is due 
to the low margin traded in the early stages of the Salam programme 
and the acquired T enix Defence business being at lower margins than
the average of this operating group.
Operating cash inflow

was £816m (2008 £163m).
CS&S International
BAE Systems has a major presence in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).
It acts as prime contractor for the UK/KSA government-to-government
defence agreement. It also holds certain direct contracts with the Saudi
government. Progress is ongoing to modernise the Saudi armed forces 
in line with the Understanding Document signed in December 2005
between the UK and KSA governments.
Around 4,900 people are employed by the Group in the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia, of whom approximately half are Saudi nationals. The
business continues to develop its presence in Saudi Arabia and remains
committed to developing a greater indigenous capability in the Kingdom.
This is being enhanced by the entry into service of the T yphoon aircraft
and the subsequent development of the T yphoon industrial base in 
Saudi Arabia.
Of the 72 T yphoon aircraft contracted in 2007 under the Salam
programme, eight were delivered in the year to the customer in line with
programme. The initial support solution contract was also agreed and
flying operations commenced. 
The business continues to support the operational capability of both 
the Royal Saudi Air Force and Royal Saudi Naval Forces. Significant
incremental orders totalling £1.2bn were received in the period for 
the T ornado Sustainment Programme (TSP) weapons contract, Naval
Minehunter Mid-Life Update and a multi-year Naval T raining Programme.
The C4I

programme remains challenging and discussions continue 
with the aim of agreeing the definition of a solution that meets the
customer requirement.
The first T actica land vehicles were delivered to the Saudi Arabia National
Guard in June and deliveries have continued through the second half of
the year . A contract for the support of T actica land vehicles has been
secured. Further opportunities are being pursued in support of the 
Royal Saudi Land Force’ s programme of capability enhancements and
equipment upgrades.
Australia
The Australian Government’ s Strategic Reform Programme plans
A$20bn (£10bn) in internal savings over the next decade through the
delivery of significant efficiencies. The business is engaged with the
Australian government and Australian Defence Force (ADF) in developing
plans and creating opportunities to deliver these efficiencies.
Significant contract awards in 2009 included a A$94m (£52m) contract 
to enhance and support the ground segment of the ADF’ s satellite
communications capability , contracts potentially worth up to A$570m
(£318m) to provide maintenance and upgrades for the Royal Australian
Navy’ s Seahawk and Australian Army’ s Black Hawk helicopter fleets and
Royal Australian Air Force’ s F/A-18 Hornet fighter aircraft, and a A$309m
(£172m) contract to build 36 hull modules for the Royal Australian Navy’ s
three new Air Warfare Destroyers. 
In the year , four inshore patrol vessels were delivered to the New Zealand
MoD and two offshore patrol vessels are expected to be delivered in 
the first quarter of 2010. Warranty claims relating to the supply of the
multi-role vessel in 2007 that were subject to mediation have been
satisfactorily resolved.
The business is a subcontractor to Boeing on the Wedgetail Airborne
Early Warning and Control programme. In the year , the business
delivered the majority of the ground subsystem and the air subsystem
entered the final acceptance testing phase. The business is working to
deliver the Electronic Warfare systems in support of the aircraft
integration programme.
Australia contract wins
BAE Systems Australia has secured a contract worth A$309m
(£172m) under the Royal Australian Navy’ s Air Warfare Destroyers
(AWD) programme to construct 12 hull modules for each of the three
destroyers. The business has secured a A$45m (£25m) contract to
install five new integrated satellite communications terminals on
board the AWD and Landing Helicopter Dock vessels. T wo contracts
with a combined value likely to be in excess of A$420m (£234m) to
carry out deeper maintenance on the Australian Seahawk and Black
Hawk helicopters have also been secured.

The Australian government has issued a revised request for the supply 
of medium and heavy tactical trucks under its Land 121 programme. The
Australian business is partnered with BAE Systems Land & Armaments
and Scania, and participated in the vehicle trial and evaluation
component of the programme. The results of this component, which 
will be known in the first half of 2010, will be used to down-select two
preferred tenderers with contract award expected in 2011.
The programme to supply two Landing Helicopter Dock ships to the 
Royal Australian Navy is progressing with numerous milestones
achieved, including the laying of the keel for the first ship, and the
successful completion of the Whole of Ship Detailed Design Review.
The completion accounting process continues with the former owners 
of the T enix Defence business in Australia and an expert has been
appointed to determine certain matters in dispute. 
MBDA (37.5% interest)
MBDA’ s performance in 2009 delivered an increasing return on sales 
on broadly unchanged sales volumes. 
Order intake in 2009 was strong and included Scalp Naval production in
France, a second year contract extension for the UK Complex Weapons
programme, and in export markets, Marte anti-ship missiles to the
United Arab Emirates, ground-based vertical launch Mica air defence
weapons to a Middle Eastern country, Storm Shadow stand-off missiles,
and Exocet anti-ship missiles.
Key domestic deliveries included Mica air-to-air missiles, T aurus 
stand-off missiles and Seawolf naval air defence missiles. Export
deliveries included Aster and Mistral surface-to-air missiles, Storm
Shadow stand-off missiles and Exocet anti-ship missiles.
Development programmes continue to progress well, with key
milestones being passed on the MEADS air-defence programme, Meteor
air-to-air missile programme, all Assessment Phases of UK Complex
Weapon Programmes and Scalp Naval stand-off missile programme.
Significant evidence has been gathered out of Sea Viper firing campaigns
during the year to support the overall system qualification, but an
investigation is currently underway to identify the cause of issues arising
during these campaigns as well as establishing a revised plan to support
the T ype 45 programme.
Saab (20.5% shareholding)
Saab’ s sales were SEK24.6bn (£2.1bn). Operating income was
SEK1.4bn (£115m) producing an operating margin of 5.6%, compared
with 0.7% in 2008. 
Key orders won during 2009 include a SEK700m (£61m) order 
within the civil security area, Gripen orders from the Swedish 
Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) of approximately SEK1bn (£87m)
to support operational capacity and future capability studies and a
SEK1.5bn (£130m) order from the United Arab Emirates for an airborne

In response to market conditions, Saab announced 670 redundancies
across its Dynamics and Commercial Aircraft areas of business during
the year .
Defence Land Systems India Private Limited (26% shareholding)
As a further step in our strategy of developing India as a home 
market, the business entered into a joint venture arrangement with
Mahindra & Mahindra Limited to create a new land systems-focused 
joint venture defence company based in India. The joint venture is
expected to be established in the first half of 2010.
Employees aid emergency communications in
ﬁre ravaged Victoria
In 2009, the Australian state of Victoria experienced the worst and
deadliest forest fires on record. Employees at a communications facility 
in rural Victoria found themselves at the centre of response efforts. They
worked closely with emergency services to supply and maintain lifesaving
radio communications used to coordinate response efforts with fire crews.
Employees provided support, configuring and maintaining trailer mounted
mobile radio stations used to boost signals between distant emergency
teams. The Group donated A$200,000 while our employees raised an
additional A$96,000 for the Australian Red Cross to help those in need. 
Joint venture agreement with Mahindra 
& Mahindra
In November , BAE Systems and Mahindra & Mahindra signed an
agreement to create a land systems, joint venture defence company,
based in India. The skills and knowledge of the two companies are an
excellent fit, and the values and vision which we share will allow this
venture to prosper and innovate. India was made the Group’ s seventh

commercial items, together with profits on sale of aircraft and lease
extension activity. 
A charge was taken in 2009 for a long-standing commercial dispute 
on an overseas defence equipment contract.
Operating cash outflow
3
in 2009 was £366m (2008 £66m). This
includes additional contributions in respect of UK pension schemes
totalling £310m (2008 £104m).
The commercial aircraft market continues to prove challenging in the
global economic downturn. Lease and sale discussions with operators
are ongoing with regard to current and future fleet requirements, and
marketing activity is focused on both uncontracted idle aircraft and 
those returning off lease.
Whilst support revenues have reduced due to lower demand for aircraft
components, this has been partially offset by increased revenues from
engineering and technical support services.
Whilst market conditions have impacted the general level of financing
available to airlines globally, the portfolio customer base remains
relatively robust and the business continues to closely monitor 
operator performance against default risk.
The balance sheet carrying value of aircraft in the Regional Aircraft
business (£189m) is based on the net present value of forecast future
net leasing or disposal income.
In the year , a settlement with the remaining insurer under the Group’ s
Financial Risk Insurance Programme was completed. Launched in January 2008, BAE Systems’
five-year partnership with UK Sport is helping
British athletes in their quest for success
at major sporting championships including
World Championships, and Commonwealth,
Olympic and Paralympic Games. The
partnership is managed by the Group’ s
Advanced T echnology Centre and provides
engineering support and state-of-the-art
technologies to sports ranging from cycling
to bob-skeleton. Our ongoing partnership
offers us an ideal opportunity to showcase
the importance of engineering.

David Parkes
COMPANY SECRETARY DIRECTORS’ REPORT: BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE
78 www.baesystems.com
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
In last year’ s report and accounts I made reference to the crisis in
financial markets and how this had caused directors to reflect on their
governance responsibilities. The ramifications of the financial crisis
have been wide reaching with many reflecting on possible corporate
governance failures and, towards the end of 2009, Sir David Walker
published his review of corporate governance in UK banks. His review
is a thorough analysis of corporate governance that, in many areas, is
applicable beyond the banking and finance industry . This was recognised
by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), which worked closely with 
Sir David and issued its own report on proposed changes to the Combined
Code, the UK’ s corporate governance code. There is never room for
complacency , and for me the most important message from both reports
is that collectively and individually we can, and need to, learn from
experience and continue to improve the way we run companies. We are
taking time in the first half of this year to carefully consider the detail in
the two reports and agree what we need to do to continue to move our
own governance processes forward.
The FRC report proposes that greater emphasis should be placed on the
principles in the Code, and recommends adopting certain new principles
and adding to existing ones. I wholeheartedly agree with this. The effective
working of a board is far too dynamic and complex to be appreciated and
understood through the application of ‘tick-box’ provisions. Focused and
insightful reporting on the Code’ s principles is an essential element of
the UK’ s governance model and for a number of years in these corporate
governance reports I have tried to provide shareholders with a meaningful
insight into corporate governance practices in BAE Systems based on
these principles. Sitting as it does within our report and accounts, this
report is an important statement on the governance of the Company
and forms part of our wider engagement with shareholders. There are
a number of aspects to this engagement ranging from the formal voting
on the resolutions we put to the Annual General Meeting (AGM) to
more informal aspects such as the contact I look to maintain with
key shareholders to assist them in the stewardship of their investments.
Shareholder voting on the continued appointment of a company’ s directors
is a powerful asset that underwrites the relationship between board and
shareholders. After careful analysis and consultation Sir David Walker
came down in favour of recommending that chairmen should stand for
annual shareholder re-election. Without doubt, the role of the board
chairman has developed a good deal since Sir Adrian Cadbury wrote
his far reaching report on corporate governance in 1992. The position
has become more clearly defined and is uniquely placed at the centre of
a company’ s governance arrangements. I am in agreement with Sir David’ s
analysis and will personally stand for annual shareholder re-election with
effect from this year’ s AGM. 
Board effectiveness
One of the recommendations in the Walker Report and the FRC’ s report
relates to the evaluation of board performance and the use of an external
facilitator to undertake this. We have used an external facilitator to
assist with our annual evaluation process for the last four years, and
this has helped to contribute to the effectiveness of the Board and its
committees. I see it as providing the directors with a tool that helps
us analyse our performance and agree what we need to do to continue
to improve. For me as Chairman, it provides a useful and constructive
means by which issues can be raised in a timely manner and dealt
with as part of the normal governance processes of the Board. Through
the evaluation process we regularly review how we operate as a board,
looking at areas such as:
“ A robust governance structure
underpins the delivery
of the Group’ s strategy . ”
Dick Olver Chairman BAE Systems Annual Report 2009 79
People – How effective is the Chairman? Do we have the right mix of
executive and non-executive directors around the board table? Are 
our succession planning processes effective in ensuring that we have 
non-executives with the right skills, knowledge and experience? How
well do we know the senior executives below board level and do we
have robust succession plans for the executive director positions? 
Information and Board processes – What do we need to do to ensure
that all directors develop a good understanding of the business? Are
directors receiving the information they require to make timely and
appropriate decisions? Do we manage directors’ induction and training
effectively? What do we need to do to ensure that we get maximum
value from the finite amount of time directors have together? Are
key issues understood, discussed and agreed upon and concerns
appropriately addressed? Does the board have the right key
performance indicators with which to monitor performance?
Behaviour – How effective are we at making decisions? Do board
members display appropriate behaviours that allow important matters
to be raised and openly discussed? Are all board members positively
engaged in decision making? Accepting that the chairman and chief
executive are key players in the board room, is their relationship
effective, both in relation to each other and the board as a whole?
For the last five years our annual board effectiveness evaluations
have been undertaken by Sheena Crane, an experienced consultant,
whose only interest with BAE Systems is her work with the Board. She
was appointed to perform this work in consultation with the Nominations
Committee. The evaluation process is based on the facilitator
interviewing each of the directors and recording their views on how the
Board and its committees work and on the performance of individual
directors. Feedback on board performance is presented to a meeting
of the Board, which agrees actions and objectives for the following year
based on the information the facilitator provides and the conclusions
that the Board derives from this. With regards to information on 
personal performance, I meet with each director and provide feedback
on a one-to-one basis, committee chairmen also get feedback on
committee performance. Importantly, feedback on my performance
in chairing the Board is provided by the consultant directly to our Senior
Independent Director , who discusses this with the other non-executive
directors before I meet with him to receive feedback.
The Combined Code requires that a board be supplied with information in
a timely manner in a form and quality appropriate to enable it to discharge
its duties. Describing how we apply this principle demonstrates the value
of performance evaluation in helping to develop directors’ information
requirements. Last year in the Board’ s objectives for 2009 we reported
that periodically we wished to take a more in-depth look at specific
programmes, which we believed would help directors to develop a deeper
understanding of the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) information they
receive on a regular basis. In 2009 the Board undertook a number of what
we term ‘deep dives’ in different areas of our business. For example, one
looked at the F-35 aircraft programme, which was done as part of a visit to
the UK production facility for this programme, allowing directors to engage
directly with members of the project team. 
Recognising the important role the Board plays in ultimately agreeing the
strategic direction the Company takes, we have also used the evaluation
process to refine how the Board is engaged in the review of strategy. For
example, following on from last year’ s evaluation we modified the strategy
review process and added an additional mid-year strategy workshop to
engage the Board more fully in our Integrated Business Planning process.
For the last four years we have provided details on the annual objectives
the Board has set following the evaluation process and information on
how we think we did in addressing the prior year’ s objectives. In the table
below we report on the evaluation we have just completed. 
BOARD PERFORMANCE – 2009 OBJECTIVES AND ACHIEVEMENTS
2009 achievements
– The Board held an additional mid-year strategy review to consider the initial output from the
Group’ s strategy and business planning process. Also, board meetings were held at Company
sites in the UK and US to provide directors with an opportunity to develop further their
understanding of the Group.
– The development of global markets was addressed through the Company’ s strategy and
business planning process, in which the Board was engaged on a regular basis. In addition,
the Chief Executive led the Executive Committee in developing management development
processes aimed at increasing global management mobility. The Nominations Committee
reviewed progress on this during the year .
– As reported elsewhere in this report, good progress has been made in implementing the 
Woolf Committee Report recommendations. Throughout the year , the Chief Executive updated
the Board and Corporate Responsibility Committee on progress. Board members participated
in an externally facilitated ethics training and awareness session aligned to the training
undertaken by employees as part of the Code of Conduct implementation programme.
– Where possible, the Board members have looked to assist Ian King in his first full year as
Chief Executive.
– Throughout 2009, the Board reviewed KPIs on a regular basis. In addition, it undertook a number
of ‘deep dives’ into particular parts of the business to help develop a greater appreciation of the
underlying businesses and the practical application of performance management.
– The Nominations Committee undertook a review of the Board succession priorities for the
next three years. This helped to guide non-executive director search activities undertaken 
in 2009 and has helped set future priorities.
2009 objectives
– Maximise the effectiveness of the strategy
planning process and continue to visit
operational sites to develop further the
Board’ s awareness and understanding 
of the Group.
– Continue to engage with management in
studying and developing the actions needed 
to exploit global markets.
– Support the Chief Executive in ensuring
the Woolf Report recommendations are
implemented across the Group, ensuring all
staff and external stakeholders are engaged.
– Provide support to the new Chief Executive
to ensure his success.
– Focus on KPIs, ensuring they continue 
to provide the right level of performance
oversight, and periodically take a more 
in-depth look at specific programmes.
– Ensure attention remains focused on 
near-term and long-term succession 
planning for the Board. DIRECTORS’ REPORT: BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE

Board and Group governance
At present, the BAE Systems Board comprises three executive directors,
nine non-executives (all independent) and myself as Chairman. Balance
is a key requirement when it comes to the composition of a board, not
only in terms of executives and non-executives but also with regards
to the mix of skills, experience and knowledge. Having a number of
executives on the Board, and also providing non-executives with regular
access to executives below the Board, helps to ensure that views
and perceptions are not dominated by a single executive voice. The
Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Chief Operating Officer (who
has specific responsibility for our US business) are all Board members.
In addition, other senior executives attend parts of Board meetings on
a regular basis primarily to provide the non-executive Board members
with a wider and more immediate view of operational issues affecting 
the Company – and it also helps with succession planning. Throughout 
the year senior operational and functional executives attended board
meetings, and on two occasions the Board and Executive Committee
participated in informal strategy review sessions. 
In our governance framework, the responsibilities of the Chairman
and the Chief Executive are separate, distinct and complementary. In
this we adhere to the principle in the Combined Code requiring a clear
division of responsibilities at the head of the company. Essentially, as
Chairman I am responsible for the effective working of the Board, whilst
the Chief Executive is responsible for the leadership and the operational
performance of the Company. The extract from our Board Charter below
details the specific responsibilities of these two roles. 
ROLES OF THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
BOARD PERFORMANCE – 2010 OBJECTIVES
– Maintain focus on developing the Company’ s strategy and make progress in achieving the Strategic Actions agreed by the Board in 2009.
– The Board and the Corporate Responsibility Committee to continue to monitor the development of a T otal Performance culture, including
implementation of the Woolf Committee’ s recommendations.
– Focus on monitoring operational performance, including cost and efficiency metrics.
– Continue to monitor the development of the competencies and culture required to support the growth of our home markets.
– The Chairman to facilitate continuing development for the non-executive directors, including their understanding and familiarity with the
Company’ s businesses, core processes and markets. BAE Systems Annual Report 2009 81
As reported elsewhere in these reports, during 2009 the Company
completed the initial phase of the implementation of the recommendations
in the Woolf Report. An analysis of this activity is a good illustration of
the different roles of the Board and the executive within our governance
framework. The Board appointed Lord Woolf to lead an independent expert
committee looking at the Company’ s ethical policies and processes. On
receipt of the report the Board asked the Chief Executive to implement
the recommendations and embed them into the Company’ s activities.
In considering how to achieve this, the Chief Executive spent a good deal
of time working with his senior executives to redefine the Group’ s values,
and ensuring that our processes and procedures reflect these values and
continue to provide us with a robust framework within which to deliver
strategic and operational performance. 
At a board meeting held in November last year , the Chief Executive
presented his proposals on how he wished to take the Company forward,
incorporating the recommendations in the Woolf Report into a coherent
set of values, policies and processes. In addition, the Board agreed
certain actions to ensure that it addressed the recommendations in the
Woolf Report concerning the directors, the Board and its committees in
particular . The changes agreed by the Board have been incorporated into
updated versions of the following documents that form the basis of the
Board’ s and the Group’ s governance framework:
Board Charter and Board Procedures Manual – the Charter sets out
the Board’ s governance principles, matters reserved for the Board,
and the specific responsibilities of the Chairman, Chief Executive and
Senior Independent Director . The Manual details certain duties and
rules governing the activities of directors, and also the processes and
ways of work that have been adopted by the Board.
Operational Framework – this document is based on principles of good
governance, and details the set of values, policies and processes that
guide the work and behaviour of Group employees and also includes a
clear system of delegated responsibilities.
The nature of the relationship between the Board and executive
management is reflected in our governance framework. The Board
Charter and Board Procedures Manual deal solely with the operation
of the Board and how it discharges its responsibilities; parts of these
documents reflect certain elements of the Company’ s Articles of
Association and the provisions of the Combined Code. The Charter and
Procedures Manual effectively only apply to the small group of individuals
who sit on the Board, and it is the Operational Framework and the Code of
Conduct that are the key documents for the Group as a whole, governing
the activities of all its employees. 
Whilst the Board is ultimately responsible for the success of the Company ,
given the size and complexity of its operations, all but the most important
matters are managed on a delegated basis by the Chief Executive and
the executives working for him. The Board appoints the Chief Executive
and monitors his performance in leading the Company and providing
operational and performance management in delivering the agreed
strategy. Specifically, he is responsible for developing, for the Board’ s
approval, appropriate values and standards to guide all activities
undertaken by the Company and also making recommendations on
appropriate delegated responsibilities. The Operational Framework
is the output from this process. It is a document that has evolved over
time, subject to a formal six monthly review process that culminates in
the Board’ s review and approval. In approving it the Board is agreeing
the following:
– Performance requirements and values – i.e. T otal Performance
and the Values underpinning it.
– Organisation structure – the roles and accountabilities of the
Board and certain senior individuals.
– Governance standards – the Group’ s trading principles,
internal controls, operational assurance framework and risk
management framework.
– Core business processes – covering business planning, project
management, mergers and acquisitions, individual executive
performance, and management of performance against business
objectives, measures and milestones.
– Delegated responsibilities – dealing with the Board’ s delegation
of authority concerning financial, commercial and legal matters.
We recognise that documenting a company’ s values, standards
and processes comprehensively is just one element of an effective
governance process. The essential requirement, and often the most
demanding, is to ensure that it is embedded and operating effectively
across a company’ s operations. The Board and its committees monitor
the application of values, standards and processes. This includes a
range of activities such as the formal review of the effectiveness of
internal controls (see page 85).
Shareholder engagement
The AGM is a core element of our engagement with all shareholders and
it would be wrong to think of it as little more than an event only involving
those who are able to attend the meeting. It works in a number of
different ways for different shareholders – whether they are large
institutional investors or smaller retail investors, all have the opportunity
to participate in this important element of the Company’ s governance. 
BAE Systems has over 100,000 shareholders, the vast majority of
whom do not wish or are unable to attend the actual meeting. However ,
all shareholders have the opportunity to ensure that their shares are
voted on. T o help facilitate this we provide the following:
– Electronic and postal voting – shareholders can vote on all the
resolutions either electronically via our website or by post.
– Questions & Answers – all shareholders have the opportunity to
submit questions by e-mail or post and we address the issues that
arise most frequently in these questions in the answers provided on
our website.
– Polls – all the resolutions detailed in the Notice of Meeting are voted
on by way of a poll. This ensures that all votes are counted on the
basis of one vote for every share held, as against voting on a show 
of hands which results in only attendees at the meeting deciding on
the resolutions.
– Results – we publish the results of the voting on all resolutions on 
our website.
Those who are able to attend our AGM have the opportunity to ask
questions and hear the views of other shareholders before deciding 
how to cast their votes. I want the AGM to be a rewarding experience 
for attendees, and in recent years we have striven to achieve this by
providing a video and a presentation on the Company’ s performance 
– in addition to the usual question and answer forum, and voting on the
resolutions. Also, after the meeting shareholders have the opportunity 
to meet directors informally over lunch. 
Succession planning
Succession planning is used by the Board to deliver two key
responsibilities, firstly to ensure that the Group is managed by
executives with the necessary skills, experience and knowledge,
and secondly to ensure that the Board itself has the right balance of
individuals to be able to effectively discharge its responsibilities. The
Nominations Committee has specific responsibilities in this area and
these are described more fully in the following reports. However , the
Board as a whole has a role to play in overseeing the development
of management resources in the Group. As with any other resource,
this has to be carefully managed with the aim of ensuring we have the
individuals with the right skills to meet the needs of an increasingly
complex and global business that is evolving all the time. Specifically,
the Board wants to see depth and quality in the ranks of individual
executives that one day will be candidates for appointment to board
positions. Robust processes are in place to help us in this task and DIRECTORS’ REPORT: BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED

progress is being made in developing the increasingly diverse management
resource required to continue to deliver our strategy of being the premier
global defence, security and aerospace company. We drew on these
processes during the year in Linda Hudson’ s appointment to the Board
as Chief Operating Officer , President and CEO of BAE Systems, Inc.
Our succession planning for non-executive directors is based on
maintaining over time a complement of eight such directors. At times
there will be slightly more or less as we recruit to fill actual or forthcoming
vacancies, for example Paul Anderson joined the Board in October 2009
in anticipation of Phil Carroll’ s retirement in May 2010 and Nick Rose
recently joined the Board following Sir Nigel Rudd’ s retirement at the end
of the year . The Nominations Committee actively manages non-executive
director succession based on anticipated retirement dates for existing
directors and looks to initiate focused search activity well in advance of
such dates. The membership of board committees is an important factor
in succession planning, particularly with regards to the individuals who
chair our Audit, Corporate Responsibility and Remuneration committees.
I am pleased to report that, when we were recruiting last year , there were
a number of excellent individuals available enabling us to select from
high-quality candidate short-lists.
The BAE Systems Board has changed a good deal in recent years and our
governance structure has evolved to keep pace with a complex and ever
changing company. We will continue to look to current and evolving best
practice as a guide in meeting the governance expectations of our
shareholders and the wider stakeholder community.
Dick Olver Chairman
Applying the principles of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance
The Board has structured its activities so as to incorporate the main and
supporting principles in the UK’ s Combined Code, recognising these to
be a sound statement of accepted good practice for a company such as
BAE Systems. The core activities of the Board and its committees are
documented and planned on an annual basis but this only forms the
basic structure within which the Board operates. The directors are
required to provide entrepreneurial leadership for the Company, relying
on the business skills and judgement that each director possesses. The
governance structure recognises this essential human element and the
role of the Chairman in ensuring that decisions are made by the directors
within a framework of prudent and effective controls.
The Board has adopted a document, the Board Charter , in which there 
is a statement of governance principles that guide the activities of the
Board and also details of the roles of the Chairman, Chief Executive and
the Senior Independent Director . The governance principles reflect the
main and supporting principles contained in the Combined Code, and
cover the following:
– Strategy – reviewing and agreeing strategy;
– Performance – monitoring the performance of the Group and also
evaluating its own performance;
– Standards and Values – setting standards and values to guide
the affairs of the Group;
– Oversight – ensuring an effective system of internal controls is
in place, ensuring that the Board receives timely and accurate
information on the performance of the Group and the proper
delegation of authority; and
– People – ensuring the Group is managed by individuals with the
necessary skills and experience, and that appointments to the 
Board are managed effectively.
The Board Charter states that the Chief Executive is responsible for 
the leadership and operational management of the Company within 
the strategy and business plan agreed by the Board. Included within 
the Charter is a schedule of matters that have been reserved for the
Board’ s decision. These include approving the vision, values, principles
of ethical conduct, overall governance structure of the Company, and its
strategy and business plans. Within the Board’ s delegated authorities 
it has reserved for itself, amongst other things, certain decisions
concerning contract bids and tenders, acquisitions and disposals 
of businesses, capital expenditure and Company-funded product
development expenditure.
A copy of the Board Charter can be found on the Company’ s website, 
or alternatively, can be obtained from the Company Secretary.
The Board
The Board comprises a non-executive chairman, nine non-executive
directors and three executive directors.
The attendance by individual directors at meetings of the Board and its
committees in 2009 is shown in the table opposite.
The Board considers all of the non-executive directors, with the exception
of the Chairman, to be independent for the purposes of the Combined
Code. Each of these directors has been identified on pages 76 and 77 
of this report.
Following appointment to the Board, directors undertake an induction
programme aimed at familiarising them with the Company. The
programme for directors joining during 2009 included the following:
– Directors’ duties, corporate governance and board procedures;
– Business planning and internal control processes;
– Strategy and planning;
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT BAE Systems Annual Report 2009 83
– Metrics used to monitor business performance;
– Investor relations;
– Corporate responsibility (including ethical business conduct, and
health and safety); and
– Internal Audit.
In addition to the above, as part of the induction process, new directors
will typically visit the Group’ s principal operations in order to meet
employees and gain an understanding of the Group’ s products and
services. On-going training is provided for the Board and individual
directors as required.
Mr Quarta is a partner in Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CDR) and Mr Olver is an
adviser to that firm. The Board has considered Mr Quarta’ s independence
in light of the provisions in paragraph A.3.1 of the Combined Code
concerning significant links with other directors through involvement with
other companies or bodies. Following review, the Board considers that,
for the purposes of the Code, their relationship through CDR does not
constitute a significant link. In reaching this determination the following
matters were taken into consideration:
– as an adviser to CDR Mr Olver has no management responsibilities or
oversight obligations in respect of CDR or any of its investments; and
– Mr Olver has no involvement with the companies that Mr Quarta is
a director of, or has management responsibility for , within CDR.
Mr Olver has undertaken to advise the Board should there be any
material change in his relationship with CDR whilst Mr Quarta has
an involvement with that firm.
In 2009, the Board was scheduled to meet eight times and in addition
one day was spent reviewing strategy. Additional Board meetings are
called as required and in total the Board met nine times during the year .
The Board has appointed Sir Peter Mason as the Senior Independent
Director . Amongst the duties undertaken by Sir Peter during the year was
to meet with the non-executive directors without the Chairman present to
discuss the Chairman’ s performance.
The Company’ s Articles of Association require that all new directors seek
re-election to the Board at the following Annual General Meeting (AGM).
In addition, all directors are required to stand down and seek re-election
to the Board at least once every three years.
The attendance by individual directors at meetings of the Board and its committees in 2009 was as follows:

The Board has set out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting their
reasons for supporting the re-election of those directors seeking 
re-election at the forthcoming AGM. 
Compliance with the provisions of the Combined Code
The Company was compliant with the provisions of the Combined Code
on Corporate Governance throughout 2009.
Internal control
The Company recently announced that it had reached a global
settlement with the US Department of Justice (DoJ) and the UK Serious
Fraud Office (SFO) in connection with long running investigations. 
These settlements enable the Company to deal finally with significant
legacy issues. The Board has reviewed the control failures associated
with the DoJ and SFO settlements and believes that the Company has
systematically enhanced relevant compliance policies and processes
since the conduct referred to in the settlements occurred. 
In 2007 the Board appointed an independent committee, the Woolf
Committee, to:
– identify the high ethical standards to which a global company 
should adhere;
– identify the extent to which the Company may currently meet these
standards; and 
– recommend the action that the Company should take to achieve 
such standards.
The Committee published its report in 2008 and made 23
recommendations for the Company aimed at achieving leadership
standards of responsible business conduct.
The Board believes that, under the leadership of the Chief Executive,
good progress has been made in implementing the recommendations 
in the Woolf Committee’ s report. All of the recommendations have been
embedded into the Operational Framework, which sets the values,
policies and processes that guide the work and behaviour of all Group
employees. Also, the Company has successfully rolled-out a code of
conduct for employees – an essential element of the drive to embed 
high standards of responsible business conduct across the Group.
The Board has conducted a review of the effectiveness of the Group’ s
system of internal controls, including financial, operational and
compliance controls and risk management systems, in accordance 
with the Combined Code and the T urnbull guidance (as revised). DIRECTORS’ REPORT: BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED
84 www.baesystems.com
BAE Systems has developed a system of internal control that was in
place throughout 2009 and to the date of this report, that encompasses,
amongst other things, the policies, processes, tasks and behaviours
that, taken together , seek to:
– facilitate the effective and efficient operation of the Company 
by enabling it to respond appropriately to significant operational,
financial, compliance and other risks that it faces in carrying out 
its business;
– assist in ensuring that internal and external reporting is accurate 
and timely, and based on the maintenance of proper records
supported by robust information-gathering processes; and
– assist in ensuring that the Company complies with applicable laws
and regulations at all times, and also internal policies in respect of
the standards of behaviour and conduct mandated by the Board.
Reporting within the Company is structured so that key issues are
escalated through the management team ultimately to the Board if
appropriate. The Operational Framework provides a common framework
across the Company for operational and financial controls, and is
reviewed on a regular basis by the Board. The business policies and
processes detailed within the Operational Framework draw on global
best practice and their application is mandated across the organisation.
Lifecycle Management (LCM) is such a process, and promotes the
application of best practice programme execution and facilitates
continuous improvement across the Group. It considers the whole life 
of projects from inception to delivery into service and eventual disposal,
and its application is critical to our capability in delivering projects to
schedule and cost.
Further key processes are Integrated Business Planning (IBP), Quarterly
Business Reviews (QBR) and T otal Performance Leadership (TPL). The
IBP, approved annually by the Board, results in an agreed long-term
strategy for each operating group, together with detailed near-term
budgets. The QBRs evaluate progress against the IBP and business
performance against objectives, measures and milestones. TPL drives
business success by linking individual goals to those of the organisation,
enabling employees to understand how their own success contributes to
the success of the whole business.
Whilst the quality of the control processes is fundamental to the overall
control environment, the consistent application of these processes is
equally important. The consistent application of world-class control
processes is a key management objective. The Company is committed to
the protection of its assets, which include human, property and financial
resources, through an effective risk management process, underpinned
where appropriate by insurance.
The Internal Audit team independently reviews the risk identification
procedures and control processes implemented by management. It
provides objective assurance as to the operation and validity of the
systems of internal control through a programme of cyclical reviews making
recommendations for business and control improvements as required.
The Board has delegated to the Audit Committee responsibility for
reviewing in detail the effectiveness of the Company’ s system of internal
controls. Having undertaken such reviews, the Committee reports to
the Board on its findings so that the Board as a whole can take a view
on this matter . In order to assist the Audit Committee and the Board in
this review, the Company has developed the Operational Assurance
Statement (OAS) process. This has been subject to regular review 
over a number of years, which has resulted in a number of refinements
being made.
The OAS requires that each part of the business completes a formal
review of its compliance against the Operational Framework, including
operational and financial controls, and risk management processes. It is
signed-off by the managing director of every line of business and relevant
functional directors. The OAS is completed every six months and
includes a formal assessment of business risk.
The overall responsibility for the system of internal control within
BAE Systems rests with the directors of the Company. Responsibility
for establishing and operating detailed control procedures lies with the
line leaders of each operating business. 
In line with any system of internal control, the policies and processes
that are mandated in the Operational Framework are designed to
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business
objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss. 
The responsibility for internal control procedures with joint ventures and
other collaborations rests, on the whole, with the senior management
of those operations. The Company monitors its investments and exerts
influence through board representation.
Going concern
The Group’ s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect
its future development, performance and position are set out in the
Operating group reviews on pages 54 to 73. The financial position of the
Group, including information on order book, cash flow, treasury policy and
liquidity, can be found in the Financial review on pages 30 to 36. Principal
risks are detailed on pages 48 to 51. In addition, the financial statements
include, amongst other things, notes on finance costs (page 134), loans
and overdrafts (page 148), and financial risk management (page 167).
After making due enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation
that the Group has adequate resources to continue operational existence
for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the
going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Relations with shareholders
The Company has a well-developed investor relations programme
managed by the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Investor
Relations Director . In addition, the Chairman is in regular contact with
major shareholders and looks to keep them informed of progress on
corporate governance matters. In order to assist in developing an
understanding of the views of major shareholders, each year the
Company commissions a survey of investors undertaken by external
consultants. The results of the survey are presented to the Board.
The Company maintains a comprehensive Investor Relations website
that provides, amongst other things, information on investing in
BAE Systems and copies of the presentation materials used for key
shareholders presentations. This can be accessed via the Company’ s
website, www.baesystems.com

Michael Hartnall 
Audit Committee Chairman
Governance 
The Audit Committee was in place throughout 2009. Nick Rose and
Ravi Uppal joined the Committee on 17 February 2010. All its members are
independent in accordance with provision A.3.1 of the Combined Code. 
Michael Hartnall has been chairman of the Committee since 2003.
He was formerly the finance director of a FTSE 100 company and is a
fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. 
The Committee has asked that the Chief Executive, Group Finance
Director , Director Financial Control, Reporting and T reasury, and the 
head of Internal Audit normally attend its meetings.
During the year , the Committee held individual meetings without Group
executives present, without the head of Internal Audit present, solely
with the head of Internal Audit present, and also solely with the external
auditors present. 
The external auditors and head of Internal Audit have direct access to 
the Chairman of the Committee.
The Committee may obtain at the Company’ s expense independent
professional advice on any matters covered by its terms of reference.
The Committee accepts that certain work of a non-audit nature is best
undertaken by the external Auditors. The Committee reviews regularly
the amount and nature of non-audit work they perform. It believes that
it is not appropriate to limit the level of such work by reference to a set
percentage of the audit work fee, as this does not take into account
important judgements that need to be made concerning the nature
of work undertaken to help safeguard the Auditors’ independence.
However , the Committee has agreed the following: 
– any non-audit work to be undertaken by the Auditors in excess of
£250,000 must be authorised by both the Chairman of the Audit
Committee and the Group Finance Director;
– no partner/director of the Auditor’ s worldwide audit team shall be
employed by the Group within two years of the conclusion of a relevant
audit;
– no qualified member of the worldwide audit team at manager level or
below is to be employed by the Group within two years of the conclusion
of a relevant audit; and
– no partner/director of the Auditors not associated with the audit is to
be employed by the Group without the approval of the Group Finance
Director and the Chairman of the Audit Committee. 
On an annual basis the Committee’ s effectiveness is reviewed as part 
of the Board’ s externally facilitated evaluation process.
The Committee met six times in 2009. 
Activities
The principal activities undertaken by the Committee in the period under
review are set out below.
Internal controls and risk 
– The Committee received and considered reports during the year from
the Group’ s Auditors, KPMG Audit Plc, and the Group’ s Internal Audit
function on the work they had undertaken in reviewing and auditing the
control environment, in order to assess the quality and effectiveness 
of the internal control system. 
– The Group’ s internal controls framework, which is based on a set of
core processes that have been developed over a number of years, is
documented in the Operational Framework (further information on
which is provided on page 81). T wice during the year , the Committee
reviewed the results of the Group’ s Operational Assurance Statement
(OAS) process, through which senior managers across the Group report
on the quality of their businesses’ implementation and compliance
with the policies mandated in the Operational Framework.

– safety;
– business conduct; and 
– diversity and inclusion.
At meetings held during the year the Committee reviewed progress

NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT Activities
The principal activities undertaken by the Committee in the period under
review are set out below.
Succession 
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the plans and processes
aimed at ensuring that the Company has a senior executive resource
with the necessary skills and experience to meet the Group’ s future
needs. On an annual basis the Committee receives a detailed report on
the Group’ s senior executive planning and development processes. This
covers the succession plans for key operational and functional positions
(including existing executive director appointments) and development
priorities and plans for individuals covered by the analysis.
The Committee also reviewed the long-term succession plans for non-
executive directors looking at the balance of skills and experience
available to the Board. In addition, this analysis was applied to the board
committees.
T wo non-executive recruitment priorities were identified by the Committee
during the year . On the basis of the analysis undertaken by the Committee
on the background, experience and skills required for these particular
positions, external search consultants, Zygos Partners, were engaged
to draw-up a long-list of possible candidates for the Committee’ s
consideration. Following further review, short-listed candidates met with
Committee members and candidates for nomination to the Board were
identified. All Board members were provided with the opportunity to meet
the candidates prior to formally considering their appointment. In addition,
the candidates were encouraged to undertake their own due diligence on
the Company , and, to this end, members of executive management were
made available to them. At the end of this process, Paul Anderson and Nick
Rose were appointed to the Board to serve as non-executive directors.
During the year , similar rigour was applied to the process used by the
Committee in the appointment of Linda Hudson to succeed Walt
Havenstein as head of our US business. The succession planning
processes that we have developed over the last few years had clearly
identified Linda as a succession candidate for this position and, after
validating the internal position against the external market using
professional search consultants, the Nominations Committee
nominated her for appointment.
Non-executive directors are appointed for a term of three years and prior
to the end of such a term the Committee is responsible for ensuring that
the individual director is consulted on whether he wishes to remain a
director , and if he does, to consider whether it would be appropriate
to recommend to the Board that he serve for a further three-year term 
(or shorter). 
During the year , Sir Nigel Rudd advised the Committee that, due to other
commitments, he did not wish to serve for a further term but agreed 
to remain on the Board until the end of 2009. Phil Carroll, who had
previously agreed to extend his term of office by one year , agreed to 
a further extension up to the date of the 2010 AGM. Having consulted 
with Mr Hartnall, the Committee agreed to extend his term of office for 
a third three-year term and agreed that it would plan for an appropriate
individual to be available to succeed him in due course as chairman 
of the Audit Committee.
Board committee membership
The Committee is responsible for nominating appropriate individuals 
for membership of the Board’ s committees. A number of changes were
made to committees during the year to ensure that they comprised
individuals with the necessary skills, knowledge and experience, and
also that they comply with the requirements of the Company’ s Articles 
of Association.
Conﬂict of interest
As required by the procedures adopted by the Board to deal with the
authorisation of potential conflicts of interest (in accordance with UK
company law), the Committee reviewed such authorisations previously
agreed by the Board and made recommendations regarding its renewal.
Board performance evaluation
In his capacity as Chairman of the Board, Mr Olver consulted the
Committee on the annual performance evaluation of the Board, the
committees and the directors. The Committee agreed it was appropriate
to continue to use the services of Sheena Crane, an experienced
consultant, to facilitate this.

Governance 
The members of the Committee are independent non-executive directors.
Following Sir Nigel Rudd’ s decision to retire from the Board at the end of
2009, the Board appointed Carl Symon as Chairman of the Remuneration
Committee in August 2009 in Sir Nigel’ s stead. 
Dick Olver , the Company’ s Chairman, also served as a member of the
Committee from 23 September 2009 until 17 February 2010. He was
deemed to be independent on his appointment as Board Chairman on
1 July 2004. Nick Rose was appointed to the Committee with effect 
from 17 February 2010.
The Chief Executive and, other than during the period when he served as a
committee member , the Company’ s Chairman, attend Committee meetings
by invitation only . They do not attend where their individual remuneration is
discussed and no director is involved in deciding his own remuneration.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
In 2009, the Committee met six times and details of attendance at these
meetings are provided in the Corporate Governance report on page 83. 
The Committee appointed Kepler Associates as its Independent Adviser
in 2007 to provide advice to the Committee and its individual members
on all aspects of the Committee’ s remit. Kepler Associates will not
undertake any work for the Company whilst they are retained as the
Committee’ s Independent Adviser . Representatives from Kepler
Associates have attended each of the Committee meetings during 2009
and will be in attendance at all meetings unless specifically requested
otherwise by the Committee. 
During the year , the Committee also received material assistance and
advice on remuneration policy from the Group’ s Human Resources
Director , Alastair Imrie, and the Human Resources Director , Group
Remuneration and Benefits, Graham Middleton. Dick Olver , Chairman,
and Ian King, Chief Executive, also provided advice that was of material
assistance to the Committee. 
Legal advice to the Committee has been provided by Linklaters who are
appointed by the Company , and who also provided services to the Company
during the year . The Committee is satisfied that the services provided to
it by Linklaters are of a technical nature and did not create any conflict of
interest. If a conflict of interest were to arise in the future, the Committee
would appoint separate legal advisers from those used by the Company . 
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), who are appointed by the Company 
and also provided services to the Company during the year , provided
detailed information on market trends and the competitive positioning 
of packages. Hewitt New Bridge Street, who are appointed by the
Committee, provided advice on the total shareholder return figures 
for assessing the performance condition under the Performance 
Share Plan (PSP).
On an annual basis, the Committee’ s effectiveness is reviewed as part 
of the Board’ s externally facilitated evaluation process. BAE Systems Annual Report 2009 91

Activities 
During the period under review, the Committee:
– Assessed the level of achievement against financial and non-financial
objectives under the annual incentive plan, and determined the levels
of payout as detailed on page 99.
– Considered the outcome of the performance conditions for the March
2007 Share Matching Plan (SMP) awards and share options; the real
growth in EPS over the three-year performance period exceeded 5% pa
so that the awards of share options and matching SMP shares vest 
in full.
– Considered the outcome of the performance condition for the March
2007 awards under the PSP; these lapsed as the total shareholder
return over the three-year performance period to the end of 2009 of 
-10.4% was below the median return of the global comparator group 
of aerospace and defence companies of -5.1%.
– Agreed the package for Linda Hudson on her appointment to the Board
as President and Chief Executive Officer , BAE Systems, Inc., and an
executive director of BAE Systems plc. 
– Agreed the Chief Executive’ s recommendation to leave salary and
incentive levels for executive directors unchanged for 2010. 
– Agreed significant changes to US pension arrangements to ensure
they remain affordable and competitive.
– Retained the same performance conditions for 2010 awards under
the SMP and the PSP despite the challenging economic environment. 
– Increased the proportion of the annual incentive measured against
safety and business conduct objectives from approximately 12.6% 
to 15% to further reinforce key aspects of the Group’ s Corporate
Responsibility agenda.
– Retained the requirement for one-third of executive directors’ annual
incentives (25% for EC members and other senior executives) to be
compulsorily deferred into the SMP .
– Retained the requirement for executive directors and EC members 
to build up a shareholding over time of at least 200% of salary. 
– Decided to introduce a claw back arrangement on in-year annual
incentives, and future awards under the SMP and PSP prior to vesting. 
– Consulted with major shareholders on aspects of remuneration
strategy and policy. 
The Company’ s remuneration strategy, policy and details of 
executive remuneration are set out on pages 93 to 111 of this

Activities 
The Board has approved the following guidelines to be used by the
Committee when discharging its responsibilities: 
– fees shall be sufficient to attract and retain individuals with the necessary
skills, experience and knowledge required to ensure that the Board is
able to discharge its duties effectively;
– in setting fees the Committee shall have regard to the amount of time
individual non-executive directors are required to devote to their duties,
and also the scale, complexity and international nature of the
business, and the responsibility involved;
– fees payable to non-executive directors shall be paid in cash and shall
not be performance-related; and
– non-executive directors shall not participate in the Company’ s share-
based incentive schemes or pension scheme. 
The Committee meets each year to consider the fees paid to the non-
executive directors. Having reviewed the time commitments expected of
non-executive directors and the market competitive positioning of existing
fee levels, the Committee agreed in January 2010 to make no changes to
their fees at the current time as detailed on page 104.

– Set base salary at around median of the relevant market
competitive level
– Reward stretching superior performance with upper quartile reward 
– Provide an appropriate balance between: 
– short-term and long-term reward
– fixed and variable reward
– with the balance becoming more long-term and more highly
geared with seniority
– Directly align short-term and long-term reward through compulsory
deferral of annual incentive into the Share Matching Plan
– Provide a competitive package of benefits
REMUNERATION POLICY
Following the annual review in November 2009, the Committee concluded that the current remuneration strategy remains
appropriate, and intends to continue with the executive remuneration policy as detailed in this report in 2010 and subsequent
years for executive directors and Executive Committee (EC) members, and this policy will be flowed down to the most senior
executives within the Group globally (approximately 280) to create a consistent global approach to reward. The principles of
the remuneration strategy are applied consistently across the Group below this level, taking account of seniority and local
market practice. The Committee will continue to consult on material changes with principal shareholders. 
REMUNERATION STRATEGY , POLICY AND PACKAGES 
2009 remuneration review 
The 2009 review not only considered the Company’ s executive remuneration packages against the market, but also the Company’ s performance
to date and its corporate strategy for the next five years. 
Information on the market for comparable management positions was provided by PwC so that the Committee could form a view as to where
to position the various elements of the package relative to comparable companies. 
The methodology used was to construct appropriate comparator groups for the individual positions, taking account of company size, scale of
operations and breadth of role. The comparator group for the UK executive directors comprised the FTSE 50 companies (excluding financial
services and retail) with market capitalisation nearest to that of BAE Systems. The Committee believes that using market capitalisation creates
alignment between the value placed on the Company and the value placed on the executives who manage it. The six largest companies were also
excluded as were several others to arrive at a comparator group of 23 companies (12 larger and 11 smaller) which the Committee believed
appropriate for benchmarking UK executive directors’ packages. 
For the President and Chief Executive Officer of BAE Systems, Inc., regression analysis was used on US aerospace, defence and general industry
sector data to produce appropriate market figures consistent with the size and scale of the US business, adjusting where necessary to reflect the
extra responsibility for her plc board role. 
The base salary , total cash reward (base salary plus annual incentive), total direct reward (total cash reward plus long-term incentives) and total
reward (total direct reward plus pension) were analysed at the lower quartile, median and upper quartile for the relevant posts in the comparator group
companies. This gives the Committee a view on the competitiveness of the individual elements of the package as well as the package as a whole.  DIRECTORS’ REPORT: BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE
REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
94 www.baesystems.com
The Committee also reviewed market trends around the individual elements of remuneration to ensure that the structure of the package stays
in line with market practice. The remuneration structure overall also takes account of the performance of the individual, the Company as a whole,
and the pay and conditions of Group employees. 
Overall conclusion
Overall, the review indicated that the structure and level of the packages were not out of line with the market, although the base salaries for both the
Chief Executive and the President and Chief Executive Officer of BAE Systems, Inc., who are both relatively new to their roles, were slightly behind
their respective benchmarks. Having taken account of the current economic climate, the challenges facing the business going forward and the pay
environment for employees in general, the Committee agreed the Chief Executive’ s recommendation that salary and incentive levels for executive
directors remain unchanged for 2010. As part of the overall review of remuneration strategy and in order to maintain the alignment between reward
and performance, the Committee agreed clawback arrangements intended to cover situations for example, where results are restated or otherwise
turn out to be materially inaccurate or where the executive’ s employment can be terminated for cause. These arrangements are to be applied
in respect of the compulsorily deferred element of the in-year annual incentive, the 2010 PSP and SMP awards, and their respective equivalents
in future years.
Incentives 
The Group’ s strategy is set out on page 10 along with the Group Strategic Framework. This explains how the Group’ s strategy is delivered through
the Group Strategic Objective, which is to deliver T otal Performance through Customer Focus, Financial Performance, Programme Execution and
Responsible Behaviour . Underpinning the drive for T otal Performance are the Group’ s Values – T rusted, Innovative and Bold. The Group will focus 
on six Strategic Actions, which emphasise the home market strategies and are underpinned by the Integrated Business Plan (IBP), which sets out
the individual businesses’ plans for the next five years in terms of strategy, actions and performance, making sure they are aligned to collectively
deliver the Strategic Actions and the Group’ s strategy. 
Each year , the Board agrees the EC’ s top ten objectives which are those key to delivering the Group’ s strategy. These are set out on page 11 and 
are used as the basis to set the individual objectives for the executive directors and EC members which are agreed by the Chairman, Dick Olver , 
and the Committee. These then flow down to the senior leadership team to ensure that all businesses within the Group are aligned with the overall
Group strategy. 
The remuneration strategy incentivises and rewards executives to deliver their contribution to the achievement of the Group’ s strategy through the
combination of short-term incentives targeted at business performance, Group performance, personal performance and leadership behaviours,
and long-term incentives targeted at Group performance. T o directly align short-term and long-term reward, executive directors will be required to
invest at least one-third of their net 2010 annual incentive into the Share Matching Plan (SMP) when the annual incentive is paid in 2011. Further
investment can be made on a voluntary basis up to a maximum investment of half their net annual incentive. 
Annual Incentive Plan 
The annual incentives for 2010 continue to focus on a combination of in-year financial performance, and longer-term performance and risk
management (both business risk and reputation risk). T wo-thirds is driven off in-year financial performance and one-third based on driving
performance, and improvement in safety and business conduct objectives (reinforcing the importance of key aspects of the Group’ s Corporate
Responsibility agenda) combined with the other objectives supporting the Group’ s strategy. T o further reinforce the importance of the Group’ s
Corporate Responsibility agenda, the proportion of the annual incentive driven off safety and business conduct objectives increases from
approximately 12.6% in 2009 to 15% for 2010.
The financial targets are derived from the IBP , and are based on earnings and cash targets as these are seen as the key indicators of both short-
term and long-term financial performance and value creation, and are supported by the Company’ s major shareholders. At Group level, EPS is used
whereas EBITA
1
is used to measure earnings performance at a business level. Previously cash targets have been based on net cash/debt at the
year end. T o incentivise improved phasing of cash generation throughout the year , a combination of year end and average quarterly net cash/debt
was introduced for 2009 and this will continue for 2010. As last year , the payout for achieving on-target performance against the in-year financial
targets remains at 40% of maximum. In relation to the profit element, due to the stretching nature of the plan, the Committee has introduced for
2010 a threshold paying 20% of maximum. Payout for performance between targets is calculated on a straight-line basis.
The table below summaries the overall structure of the annual incentives for executive directors. 
Proportion of annual incentive
Performance measure 2009 2010
In-year financial 66.6% 66.6%
Safety and ethics/business conduct 12.6% 15.0%
Other objectives 20.8% 18.4%
The Committee believes that the annual incentive targets for the executive directors are stretching but achievable. The structure of the 2010
annual incentive plan for each of the executive directors is summarised in their individual sections on pages 96 to 98. 
Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) 
The Company operates two LTIPs (having ceased awards of share options in 2008) – the Performance Share Plan (PSP) and the Share Matching
Plan (SMP). No changes have been made for the 2010 awards apart from the introduction of a clawback provision detailed above. Full details of 
the PSP and SMP are contained on pages 100 and 101. 
The combination of the annual incentive plan, SMP and PSP provide a balance between short-term cash reward and longer-term share-based reward
as illustrated opposite for the Chief Executive. The proportion of the incentive package delivered through longer-term performance is significantly
higher at stretch payout than at on-target payout, demonstrating that the package supports the achievement of superior long-term performance and
strongly aligns the interests of executives to those of shareholders through a long-term reward being delivered in shares. The second graph shows
1 Earnings before amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, finance costs and taxation expense.  BAE Systems Annual Report 2009 95
which performance metrics are driving the value of the incentives. This shows that,at on-target performance,the higher inﬂuence of the annual
incentive means that in-year measures drive almost 40% of the package value,with long-term EPS (which underpins the SMP and half the PSP
awards) accounting for a similar proportion. But,at stretch performance,the inﬂuence of the annual incentive is reduced,and the SMP and PSP
account between them for nearly three-quarters of the value of the incentive package,with the most important drivers of value becoming long-term
EPS and share price. This shows that achieving strong performance on the in-year measures is important but,in order to maximise the value of their
incentive package,executives need to drive growth in long-term EPS and share price.

Personal shareholding policy
The Committee has agreed a policy whereby all executive directors are required to establish and maintain a minimum personal shareholding equal
to 200% of base salary. As a minimum,a holding equal to 100% of base salary must be achieved as quickly as possible using shares vesting or
options exercised through the executive share option schemes or long-term incentive schemes,by using 50% of the shares that vest or 50% of the
options which are exercised on each occasion. Thereafter,executive directors are required to increase their personal shareholding gradually,on
each occasion using 25% of the shares that vest or 25% of the options exercised each year,until a personal shareholding equal to 200% of annual
base salary is achieved and maintained. These limits are reviewed periodically. A similar arrangement applies to senior executives eligible for
share-based long-term incentives with limits aligned to the levels of awards made under these plans.
Details of the directors’ personal shareholdings are shown in Table A on page 105.
Pension provision
No changes to the pension arrangements for uK executive directors were made in 2009. A review of uK executive pension arrangements is planned
for 2010.
A major review of uS pensions was undertaken in 2009 to take account of the rapidly changing uS pension market and new funding rules which
come into effect in 2011. As a result of this review,a number of signiﬁcant changes were agreed which impact both existing employees and new
hires. These also simplify the arrangements going forward by consolidating the numerous legacy plans to provide a much simpler structure for
future service beneﬁts. These changes effectively:
– Froze the legacy ﬁnal salary plans at the end of 2009,with future service for these members being provided by the 2006 Career Average Cash
Plan together with a standard 85% Company match on up to 6% of salary in the deﬁned contribution plan (known as the 401(k) Plan). The 2006
Plan provides a cash sum at retirement of 10% of career pay (salary and bonus).
– Bonuses will no longer be pensionable in the 401(k) plans.
– Only a 401(k) plan will be provided for new hires.
– Employees who currently have only a 401(k) plan will move to a standardised plan with either a 50% or 100% Company match (depending on their
business) on up to 6% of salary.
The Committee had previously agreed that,from 2008,where bonuses are pensionable,their pensionability is limited to 150% of base salary.
Linda Hudson is a member of the 2006 Plan and had a supplementary pension arrangement (SERP) which sought to match the pension
arrangements provided by her previous employer. This uplifted her 2006 Plan accrual from the normal 10% of pay to 15% of pay. Effective in 2010,
the SERP providing this additional beneﬁt was reduced in line with the average impact for other uS employees such that,from 1 January 2010,her
2006 Plan accrues at the rate of 14.1% of career pay. DIRECTORS’ REPORT: BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE

Performance in 2009 
The structure of the 2009 Annual Incentive Plan was set out in last year’ s Remuneration report and is summarised in the individual sections for
each of the executive directors on pages 96 to 98. 
Financial performance 
2009 was a good year in terms of financial performance following the Group’ s strong performance of recent years. At the Group level, EPS performance
was above target, but some way short of stretch performance, whilst stretch performance was achieved on both cash targets. At the operating group
level, Programmes & Support and International both exceeded their profit targets but did not hit stretch. Both achieved their stretch cash targets.
Electronics, Intelligence & Support and Land & Armaments both hit their stretch profit targets and, whilst both exceeded their cash targets, they did
not achieve their stretch cash targets. BAE Systems, Inc. achieved stretch performance on both profit and year end cash and, whilst exceeding its
average cash target, fell short of its stretch target. The US pension accounting gain and the regulatory penalties were excluded from the calculation
of growth in the Group’ s underlying EPS performance for incentive purposes.
Non-ﬁnancial performance 
Page 7 set outs the EC’ s top ten objectives for 2009 and the assessment of performance against these, whilst page 40 provides more detailed
information on the performance against the specific objectives relating to safety and business conduct. Each senior executive also had a personal
safety objective and a personal business conduct objective. 
Business conduct: All the Group objectives in relation to business conduct were achieved, including those personal to the individual executive
directors and EC members. In particular , the 2009 milestones for the Woolf implementation programme were substantively achieved, including
the launch of the global Code of Conduct and communication of this to employees through team briefings. 
A sample of employees worldwide were invited to participate in a survey on the Group’ s approach to responsible business conduct which showed
a trend increase across all six areas, including an increased awareness of the ethical standards expected. 
Safety: The executive directors and EC members conducted the required safety reviews. The minimum safety Level 3 standard was achieved across
all lines of business and, at Group level, over 60% of major manufacturing sites reached Level 4. The total incident rate across the Group fell by 33%
against the 10% improvement target.
Other aspects of performance: Against the remaining top ten Group objectives, excellent progress has been made. Accordingly, the Committee
agreed an overall rating of 6.5 out of 7.5. This sets the starting point with further adjustment, up or down, depending on the assessment of the
individual executive’ s overall performance and leadership behavioural performance. 
Accordingly, the Committee determined the payout under the 2009 Annual Incentive Plan as follows:
2009 annual incentive payout Ian King Linda Hudson* George Rose
% of stretch 83.0% 87.9% 80.9%
% of base salary 186.7% 179.4% 121.4%
Amount (’000) £1,680 $296 £755
* The figures for Linda Hudson are in respect of the period from her appointment to the Board. 
In addition: 
– The real growth in EPS over the three years to 2009 exceeded 5% pa so that the awards of share options and matching SMP shares granted in
2007 vest in full.
– The Company’ s TSR for awards of shares made in March 2007 under the PSP did not exceed the median position when compared against the
comparator group of 18 other defence and aerospace companies, and accordingly lapsed.
The Committee also determined that the second tranche of shares and cash due to Mike T urner (the previous Chief Executive) on 1 September
2009 in respect of the special incentive awarded to him in October 2007, which vested in full on 1 September 2008, should be released.

shows the value by 31 December 2009, on a total shareholder return basis, of £100 invested in
BAE Systems on 31 December 2004 compared with the value of £100 invested in the FTSE 100
index. The FTSE 100 is considered to be an appropriate comparator for this purpose as it is a broad
equity index. As BAE Systems is a constituent member of the FTSE 100, it was deemed to be the
most appropriate general UK equity index. 
The graph above shows the value shareholders have achieved by their investment in BAE Systems
over recent years as compared to (i) the FTSE 100 index; (ii) the companies forming the sectoral
peer group for the Performance Share Plan; and (iii) the companies forming the comparator pay

Plan provisions
Performance conditions for grants of awards to be made under the Performance Share Plan and the Share Matching Plan in 2010 are detailed
below. Performance conditions for grants of awards made prior to 2010 are detailed on pages 106 and 107. 
Clawback arrangements have been introduced and will operate in respect of these two plans from the 2010 awards onwards. The arrangements
are intended to cover situations, for example, where results are restated or otherwise turn out to be materially inaccurate or where the executive’ s
employment can be terminated for cause.
Key features for PSP awards in 2010:
– awards of shares are granted based on a percentage of salary and share price at the date of grant;
– the shares are subject to satisfaction of three-year performance conditions;
– half the PSP award will be based on a Total Shareholder Return performance condition (PSP
TSR
) and the other half on an Earnings per Share
(PSP
EPS
) performance condition;
– in addition,there is a further test on the PSP
TSR
element to ensure that the TSR performance is supported by the underlying performance
of the Company;
– shares under award after satisfaction of the performance condition vest in three equal tranches at the end of years three,four and five; and
– shares under award attract dividends prior to vesting.
Proportion of the award capable of exercise: determined by the rate
of annual actual EPS growth over the three-year performance period,
with nil vesting at annual actual EPS growth of 5% or less and 100%
vesting at 11% growth as set out opposite (15% to 33% growth over
three years).
The rationale for the EPS performance measure is that major
investors consider EPS to be a key indicator of long-term financial
performance and value creation.

The graph opposite summarises the position on the TSR element
for all outstanding awards under the PSP as at 31 December 2009.
The coloured box shows the range of TSR required for 25% vesting
to full vesting, and the diamond shows BAE Systems’ TSR. The
proportion that would vest is shown in the boxes at the top of
the chart.
This shows that the March 2007 PSP award lapsed as the Company’s
TSR return was below that of the comparator group.
Key features for grants of awards in 2010:
– stand-alone share investment plan with the investment linked
to the award under the Annual Incentive Plan;
– participants are granted a conditional award of Matching Shares
against the gross value of the annual incentive invested;
– Matching Shares attract dividends during the three-year deferral
period, released on vesting of any Matching Shares;
– executive directors are required to invest one-third of their 2009
net annual incentive into the SMP; and
– maximum level of investment will be 50% of the net annual incentive.
Match and performance condition
– Nil match for actual EPS growth of less than 5% pa increasing
uniformly to a 2:1 match at 11% pa growth (15% to 33% growth 
over three years).
– Rationale for performance measure: major investors consider
EPS to be a key indicator of long-term financial performance and
value creation.
SHARE MATCHING PLAN (SMP)
SUMMARY OF TSR PERFORMANCE TO 31 DECEMBER 2009
PERFORMANCE CONDITION – PSP
TSR
Proportion of the award capable of exercise determined by:
(i) the Company’s TSR (share price growth plus dividends) ranking
relative to a comparator group of 18 other international defence
and aerospace companies as shown in the table opposite.
None of the shares vest if the Company’s TSR is outside the top
50% of TSRs achieved by the sectoral comparator group and 100%
vest if it is in the top quintile (i.e. top 20%) as set out opposite;
and
(ii) whether there has been a sustained improvement in the
Company’s underlying financial performance and whether it is
appropriate to release some or all of the awards. In taking such
a view, the Committee may consider (but not exclusively) the
following financial metrics: net cash/debt; EBITA
1
; order book;
turnover; risk and underlying project performance.
The rationale for TSR performance measures is that major investors
regard TSR as an important indication of both earnings and capital
growth relative to other major companies in the same sector and to
ensure that awards only vest if there has been a clear improvement
in the Company’ s performance over the relevant period.

Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
During 2009 the UK executive directors were eligible to participate in the all-employee free shares element of the Share Incentive Plan. As a result
of the Company’ s performance in 2009, all eligible employees (including the UK executive directors) will be entitled to receive shares worth £567. 
A similar arrangement operates for non-UK employees on a cash or shares basis depending on local tax and security laws.
The Company operates a share purchase arrangement (Partnership Shares) under the Share Incentive Plan. Under this arrangement, UK-based
employees (including executive directors) may purchase ordinary shares in BAE Systems by either monthly investments of between £10 and £125 
a month, or lump sum investments of between £10 and £1,500 in a tax year , both limited to 10% of salary if less. The Partnership Shares attract
Matching Shares. As the plan is an all-employee plan, the Matching Shares are not subject to performance conditions in accordance with legislation.
One free matching share is awarded for each Partnership Share up to a maximum of £63 per month. 
Dividends paid in respect of the shares in the Share Incentive Plan for UK-based employees are reinvested as Dividend Shares. 
Share usage for employee share schemes 
The Committee has agreed that, in respect of new issue or treasury
shares, shares representing no more than 1% (and no more than
0.5% for the executive schemes) of the Company’ s issued share
capital will be used in any one financial year for the grant of
incentives under all of the Company’ s employee share schemes.
The table opposite sets out the available dilution capacity for the
Company’ s employee share schemes on this basis. 
The Company currently intends to use new issue shares to satisfy
future share awards under the executive long-term incentive plans
up to the 0.5% annual dilution limit, and to use treasury shares
to satisfy awards of free shares and matching shares under the 
all-employee Share Incentive Plan. For outstanding options it is
intended that new issue shares will be utilised for the Executive
Share Option Plan.
Post-retirement beneﬁts
UK pension beneﬁts
UK executive directors are members of the BAE Systems Executive Pension Scheme (the ExPS) and members of the underlying employee pension
plans. As such, they are subject to the same contribution rates payable by employees of the underlying plans, and the benefits changes introduced
in 2006 for post-April 2006 service including the introduction of the Longevity Adjustment Factor , a reduction in the maximum level of pension
increases and a change in the definition of Pensionable Pay. 
The ExPS tops up the underlying employee plan to provide a target benefit for executive directors payable from normal retirement age of 1/30th
of Final Pensionable Pay (FPP) for each year of ExPS pensionable service (subject to a maximum of two-thirds of FPP). FPP is defined as base salary
averaged over the last 12 months prior to leaving service in respect of service accrued to 5 April 2006 and 36 months prior to leaving in respect
of service from 6 April 2006. The ExPS also provides a lump sum death-in-service benefit equal to four times base salary at date of death, and a
spouse’ s death-in-service pension equal to two-thirds of the prospective pension at normal retirement age. Children’ s allowances are also payable,
usually up to the age of 18. Spouses’ pensions and children’ s allowances are also payable upon death in retirement and death after leaving the
Company’ s employment with a deferred pension. Pensions are increased annually by the rise in the Retail Price Index subject to a maximum
increase of 5% per year in respect of pre-6 April 2006 service and 2.5% per year in respect of service from 6 April 2006. 
As a result of the 2006 age discrimination legislation, executive directors’ default retirement age is 65 but they retain any previous rights they had
to retire and draw their pensions without actuarial reduction for early payment at an earlier age. 
Following the changes made to take account of the Pensions Simplification tax changes which came into effect from April 2006, UK executives
reaching the Lifetime Allowance (LTA) are given a number of choices as previously reported. These are:
– remain in the pension scheme and pay any additional tax charge; or 
– opt out of the pension scheme (and so earn no further pension benefits in respect of future service) and instead receive a taxable salary
supplement. This supplement will be 30% of salary and 20% of salary for those senior executives with a two-thirds salary target after at least
20 years’ and 30 years’ service, respectively; or
– restrict scheme benefits to the value of the LTA with the remainder being provided directly from the Company as an unfunded promise. 
At retirement, the unfunded Company benefits can be either taken as pension or commuted in full for a taxable lump sum. 
The Committee reviews these arrangements each year in the light of developing market practice and believes they remain appropriate as they
provide executives with competitive pension benefits and choices for dealing with the LTA which may better suit their needs whilst being broadly 
cost neutral to the Company, are in line with market practice and do not compensate executives for changes in taxation. 
Ian King is a member of the BAE Systems 2000 Pension Plan (the 2000 Plan), applicable to former employees of Marconi Electronic Systems
(MES), and a member of the ExPS with a normal retirement age of 62. The 2000 Plan provides a pension of 1/50th of Final Pensionable Earnings
(FPE) for each year of pensionable service, payable from a normal retirement age of 65 and members pay contributions of 8% of Pensionable
Earnings. FPE under the 2000 Plan is the best three-year average of base salary and bonus in the ten Plan Y ears prior to leaving, less an offset for
State pensions. The Company decided in 2006 to limit pensionable bonuses in the 2000 Plan in the 2006/07 Plan Y ear to 20% of base salary and
to 10% of base salary for the 2007/08 Plan Y ear and thereafter . However , there is a guarantee that the FPE figure for benefits in respect of service
prior to 6 April 2007 will not be less than the FPE figure at 5 April 2007 to ensure that employees do not lose the benefit of contributions paid on
past bonuses. Ian King joined the ExPS in 1999 following the BAe/MES merger . Therefore Ian King’ s total pension is the sum of his 2000 Plan
benefits plus the top up from the ExPS.

George Rose is a member of the BAE Systems Pension Scheme paying contributions of 9.29% of base salary, and is a member of the ExPS with
a normal retirement age of 60. George Rose was affected by the previously applicable Inland Revenue earnings cap on approved pensions and
has an unapproved (i.e. non-tax qualified) pension arrangement to top up his benefits from the approved schemes. This was designed so that the
total pension from all sources would be broadly in line with the pension he would have received from the Group pension schemes had he not been
subject to the earnings cap. The Pension Simplification tax changes allowed the flexibility to remove the earnings cap for George Rose in respect of
service from April 2006, although some of his benefits will remain to be provided by means of an unfunded promise from the Company. No further
contributions will be paid into his funded unapproved top up arrangement. 
US pension beneﬁts
Linda Hudson is a member of the 2006 Plan which provides a cash sum at retirement equal to a percentage of career average pay (salary plus
bonus subject to a maximum bonus of 150% of salary). For service up to 1 January 2010, the cash sum accrued at the rate of 15% of career
average pay. Following the changes made in 2009, the cash accrual rate from 1 January 2010 will be 14.1% of career average pay. Executive
directors pay contributions at the same rates as other employees in the plan, being 1.5% of earnings. In 2009, Linda Hudson also received a
100% match on her contributions to her 401(k) plan up to a maximum contribution of 6% of earnings. From 1 January 2010, the match will be
85% up to a maximum contribution of 6% of salary.
Details of post-retirement benefits for each of the executive directors who served during 2009 are shown in T able D on page 111 and are calculated in
accordance with the requirements of Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. 
Other beneﬁts
Other benefits provided to the executive directors include a car allowance, the private use of a chauffeur-driven car and a cash allowance for 
medical examination. 
Executive directors’ service contracts
It is the Committee’ s policy that executive directors should normally have service contracts that provide for the Company to give the individual
12 months’ notice of termination. This policy has been chosen because it provides a reasonable balance between the need to retain the services 
of key individuals and the need to limit the liabilities of the Company in the event of the termination of a contract. The executive directors have
service contracts with Group companies and details of these are shown below.
Date of contract Unexpired term Notice period
Linda Hudson 26 October 2009 (amended 8 January 2010) Expiry date 31 December 2010* 90 days either party
Ian King 27 June 2008 No fixed term 12 months either party
George Rose 16 November 1998 (amended: 3 December 1999, No fixed term 12 months from the Company,
15 January 2004 and 17 October 2005) 6 months from the individual
* Subject to automatic renewal for one-year periods each year unless either party gives notice of non-renewal.
In the event of the termination of an executive director’ s contract it is the Committee’ s policy to seek to limit any payment made in lieu of notice to a
payment equal to the amount of one year’ s base salary. The service contracts for two of the executive directors (Ian King and George Rose) contain
specific provisions to the effect that the Company has the right to pay a sum equivalent to 12 months’ salary in lieu of notice.
Linda Hudson's contract of employment is subject to a fixed term (which ends on 31 December 2010) and automatically renews for one year periods
thereafter unless one party gives notice of non-renewal. Separately , there is a 90-day termination provision. If the employment is (a) terminated by the
Company (other than for cause as defined in the contract or in the event it is not extended following her 65th birthday) or (b) she resigns for a ‘Good
Reason’ (as defined in her contract), she is entitled to a termination payment equal to (i) one year’ s base salary , (ii) a pro-rated bonus for the relevant
financial year , and (iii) the continuation of 18 months’ medical benefits, plus a further 18 months’ subsidy of a portion of the premiums (or a cash
payment in lieu of this benefit).
No executive director has provisions in his or her service contract that relate to a change of control of the Company (and neither does the Chairman
nor the non-executive directors in their letters of appointment).
Walt Havenstein, who resigned as a director on 21 June 2009, had a service contract dated 1 December 2006 with a notice period of three months
from either party, and ceased to be a Group employee on 20 September 2009. Details of his salary package for 2009 were provided in the 2008
Annual Report and are reported in the tables on pages 109 to 111. No termination payments were made to Walt Havenstein, and all outstanding
long-term incentive awards and share options lapsed. 
Policy on external board appointments 
The long-standing policy of allowing executive directors to hold external non-BAE Systems-related non-executive directorships with the prior approval of
the Committee will continue. The Committee considers that external directorships provide the Company’ s senior executives with valuable experience
that is of benefit to BAE Systems. It is also considered appropriate for BAE Systems to contribute to the pool of non-executive expertise available for the
benefit of the wider business community, thereby reciprocating the benefit that it in turn has received from other organisations which have permitted
members of their senior management teams to serve on the BAE Systems Board. The Committee believes that it is reasonable for the individual
executive director to retain any fees received from such appointments given the additional personal responsibility that this entails. Such fees retained
by executive directors in 2009 were as follows: Ian King £40,000 and George Rose £79,500. 
Dick Olver was appointed Chairman on 1 July 2004. His appointment was for an initial fixed three-year term with effect from 17 May 2004 (the
date that he was appointed to the Board as a non-executive director) and was subsequently extended in 2007 for a second term of three years to 
16 May 2010. Following the approval of the Board under the chairmanship of Sir Peter Mason, Senior Independent Director , it was extended again
in 2009 for a third term to 16 May 2013 unless terminated earlier in accordance with the Articles of Association or with either party giving the
other not less than six months’ prior written notice. The Chairman’ s appointment is documented in a letter of appointment which is not a contract of
employment and he is required to devote no fewer than two days a week to his duties as Chairman. His appointment as Chairman will automatically
terminate if he ceases to be a director of the Company. His fee, which was set by the Committee at £600,000 per annum for the duration of his
second three-year term, will be subject to review in 2010.

* Subject to re-election at the AGM following their appointment and subsequently at intervals of no more than three years in accordance with the Company’ s Articles of Association. 
The non-executive directors are normally appointed for two consecutive three-year terms subject to review after the end of the first three-year period
and with any third term of three years being subject to rigorous review and taking into account the need progressively to refresh the Board. They do not
have periods of notice and the Company has no obligation to pay compensation when their appointment terminates. They are subject to re-election
at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) following their appointment and subsequently at intervals of no more than three years. Having completed
a three-year term of appointment, Sir Nigel Rudd retired from the Board on 31 December 2009 having originally been appointed to the Board on
10 September 2006. 
Non-executive directors are proposed by the Nominations Committee and are appointed by the Board on the basis of their experience to provide
independent judgement on issues of strategy, performance, resources and standards of conduct. 
The letters of appointment for non-executive directors detail the amount of time it is anticipated that the individual will need to devote to his or her
duties as a director , being 15 days per year plus ten additional days for chairing a committee or undertaking the role of Senior Independent Director .
The level of their fees is set by the Non-Executive Directors’ Fees Committee to reflect this time commitment and responsibility , and after reviewing
practice in other comparable companies. Having undertaken its review in January 2010, the Committee decided that the non-executive directors’
fees should remain unchanged at the current time as follows:
2009 and 2010 fee
Base fee £66,000
Additional fee for chairing committees:
Audit Committee £20,000
Corporate Responsibility Committee £20,000
Remuneration Committee £20,000
Additional fee for Senior Independent Director £20,000
T ravel allowance (per meeting)* £4,000
* The travel allowance of £4,000 per meeting is paid on each occasion that a non-executive director’ s attendance at a Board meeting necessitates air travel of more than five hours (one-way) to
the meeting location, subject to a maximum of six travel allowances per year .
The table below summarises the fee structure for 2009 and 2010.

TABLE B: SHARE OPTIONS AND LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP) AWARDS – IAN KING
A full description of the PSP is set out on pages 100 and 101. PSP awards granted since 2008 attract dividends prior to vesting.
PSP
TSR
– nil vesting if the Company’ s T otal Shareholder Return (TSR) at the end of the three-year performance period is outside the top 50% of
TSRs achieved by a sectoral comparator group; 25% vesting if TSR is at median (50%); and 100% vesting if TSR is in the top 20%, with vesting
on a straight-line basis between these two points.
PSP
EPS
– proportion of the award exercisable is determined by the rate of annual actual EPS growth over the three-year performance period, with
nil vesting at annual actual EPS growth of 5% or less, 100% vesting at 11% growth, and vesting on a straight-line basis between these two points.
Awards that satisfy the performance conditions at the end of year three are exercisable in three tranches at the end of years three, four and five.
No options have been granted under this Plan since 2007 and it is intended only to be used in future in exceptional circumstances. Options granted
under this Plan are normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of grant. The maximum duration of an option is ten years.
(i) 2005-2007 grants – 33.33% of each option grant is exercisable if the Company achieves on average real EPS growth pa of 3% but less than 4%
over the three-year performance period; 66.67% for real EPS growth pa of 4% but less than 5%; and 100% for real EPS growth of 5% or more.
(ii) 2004 grant – as in (i) but performance is retested at the end of year five against the full period from grant; and 
(iii) 2003 grant – as in (i) but performance is retested at the end of years four and five against the full period from grant.
(iv) 1999 grant (following the BAe/MES merger) under the predecessor Executive Share Option Scheme: the grant to George Rose was conditional
on the satisfaction of a performance condition based on the achievement of merger integration cost savings over a three-year performance
period; and the grant to Ian King could only be exercised if the pre-exceptional EPS for any three-year period over the ten-year option life
exceeded the sum of inflation for that period and real growth of 9% was achieved.

TABLE B: SHARE OPTIONS AND LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP) AWARDS – GEORGE ROSE
A full description of the SMP , under which awards are subject to a three-year performance period, is set out on page 101. SMP awards attract
dividends prior to vesting.
2009 award – nil match for actual EPS growth of less than 5% pa increasing uniformly to a 2:1 match at 11% pa growth.
2008 award – nil match for actual EPS growth of 5% pa or less, increasing uniformly to a 1:1 match for 8% pa growth.
2007 award – nil vesting for real EPS growth pa of less than 3% over the three-year performance period, with one-third of the matched award vesting
on average real EPS growth pa of 3% but less than 4%, two-thirds vesting with a growth rate of 4% but less than 5%, and full vesting at growth of 
5% or over .
Share price information 
The mid-market price for the Company’ s ordinary shares at 31 December 2009 was 359.5p (2008 376.75p). The range during the year was 306p
to 408.25p.
Aggregate amount of gains made by directors
The aggregate amount of gains made by directors from the exercise of share options in 2009, as calculated at the date of exercise, was
£1,268,104 (2008 £6,278,313). The net aggregate value of assets received by directors in 2009 from long-term incentive plans, as calculated
at the date of vesting, was £247,044 (2008 £1,931,858).
Rationale for key performance measures for PSP , ExSOP and SMP
EPS – importance to major investors as a key indicator of long-term financial performance and value creation.
TSR (and secondary ﬁnancial measure) – importance to major investors as an indication of both earnings and capital growth relative to major
companies in the same sector , and to ensure that awards only vest if there has been a clear improvement in the Company’ s performance over the
relevant period.

1 Resigned as a director on 21 June 2009 and ceased to be a Group employee on 20 September 2009.
2 As at 21 June 2009, the date that Walt Havenstein resigned from the Board, options and awards outstanding totalled 327,640 under ExSOP, 860,950 under the PSP , and 297,085 under 
the SMP .
In addition, Walt Havenstein had a cash-settled Stock Appreciation Right (SAR) over 53,010 ordinary shares granted on 27 November 2000 at a
SAR price of £3.73 exercisable from 27 November 2003 until 27 November 2010. This was exercisable only if growth in pre-exceptional EPS for
any three-year period over the ten-year life of the SAR exceeded the sum of inflation for that period and a growth requirement of 9%, which was met.
The SAR lapsed on 20 September 2009.
The 2004 and 2005 PSP awards and the 2005 ExSOP options granted to Walt Havenstein were granted under the Stock Appreciation Rights
Schedule to those plans. The exercise price referred to for the latter is the SAR price.
The Restricted Share Plan (RSP) was replaced by the SMP in 2007. The matching award of shares under the former RSP was not historically subject
to performance criteria as it was designed to retain key staff and encourage executives to re-invest in Company shares the cash bonuses that they
had earned under the annual bonus plan which was itself subject to performance conditions. 
Note: Awards granted to Walt Havenstein (a US national) under the PSP were technically characterised as long-term incentives rather than options
as, subject to the attainment of the performance condition, they were delivered automatically on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary of grant
without the need to exercise an option. They are shown in the top portion of the table for ease of comparison. Gains on delivered PSP awards for
Walt Havenstein are included in the directors’ gains on LTIPs figure on page 107 whilst PSP gains for the UK-based directors are included in the
share option gains figure.

are the same as those used in the calculation of cash equivalents from the schemes. For uS-based directors the assumptions are the same
as those used for accounting disclosures. The amount shown for Linda Hudson is at 26 October 2009. The increase in transfer value arising
from the change in assumptions is: Walt Havenstein: £53,887; Linda Hudson: £(1,858); Ian King: £855,144; George Rose: £429,879.

401(k) arrangement. Walt Havenstein was paid in uS dollars. Of the change in the accrued beneﬁt and the transfer value £(19,782) and
£(216,871),respectively,is due to currency movements.
4 Linda Hudson was appointed to the Board on 26 October 2009 and is a member of a uS retirement plan which provides a cash sum at
retirement equal to a percentage of career average pay. The accrued beneﬁt shown above is a cash lump sum amount payable at normal
retirement age. This beneﬁt comprises £44,379 from a contributory Qualiﬁed Plan and £302,709 from Non-Qualiﬁed Plans. In addition,
Linda Hudson participates in a Section 401(k) deﬁned contribution arrangement set up for uS employees in which the Company will match

OTHER STATUTORY AND REGULATORY INFORMATION CONTINUED
114 www.baesystems.com
At the 2009 AGM, the directors were given the power to issue new
shares up to a nominal amount of £29,396,313. This power will expire
on the earlier of the conclusion of the 2010 AGM or 30 June 2010.
Accordingly, a resolution will be proposed at the 2010 AGM to renew
the Company’ s authority to issue further new shares. At the 2009 AGM,
the directors were also given the power to issue new issue shares up to
a further nominal amount of £29,396,313 in connection with an offer
by way of a rights issue. This authority too will expire on the earlier of
the conclusion of the 2010 AGM or 30 June 2010, and a resolution
will be proposed at the 2010 AGM to renew this additional authority. 
Conﬂicts of interest 
As permitted under the Companies Act 2006, the Company’ s Articles
of Association contain provisions which enable the Board to authorise
conflicts or potential conflicts that individual directors may have. 
T o avoid potential conflicts of interest the Board requires the
Nominations Committee to check that any individuals it nominates
for appointment to the Board are free of potential conflicts. In addition,
the Board’ s procedures and the induction programme for new directors
emphasise a director’ s personal responsibility for complying with the
duties relating to conflicts of interest. The procedure adopted by the
Board for the authorisation of conflicts reminds directors of the need to
consider their duties as directors and not grant an authorisation unless
they believe, in good faith, that this would be likely to promote the
success of the Company . As required by law, the potentially conflicted
director cannot vote on an authorisation resolution or be counted in the
quorum. Any authorisation granted may be terminated at any time and
the director is informed of the obligation to inform the Company without
delay should there be any material change in the nature of the conflict or
potential conflict so authorised. The Nominations Committee has been
asked to review on an annual basis any authorisations granted and to
make recommendations to the Board as appropriate. 
Directors’ indemnities 
The Company has entered into deeds of indemnity with all its current
directors and those persons who were directors for any part of 2009
which are qualifying indemnity provisions for the purpose of the
Companies Act 2006. 
The directors of BAE Systems Pension Funds T rustees Limited,
BAE Systems 2000 Pension Plan T rustees Limited, BAE Systems
Executive Pension Scheme T rustees Limited and Alvis Pension 
Scheme T rustees Limited benefit from indemnities in the governing
documentation of the BAE Systems Pension Scheme, the BAE Systems
2000 Pension Plan, the BAE Systems Executive Pension Scheme and
the Alvis Pension Scheme, respectively, which are qualifying indemnity
provisions for the purpose of the Companies Act 2006.
All such indemnity provisions are in force as at the date of this 
Directors’ report.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
Annual Report and ﬁnancial statements 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, and
the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and parent company
financial statements for each financial year . Under that law they are
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and
applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial
statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable
law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view
of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company, and of their
profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and parent
company financial statements, the directors are required to:
– select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
– make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
– for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
– for the parent company financial statements, state whether applicable
UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial
statements; and
– prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent company
will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’ s
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that
its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to
them to safeguard the assets of the Group, and to prevent and detect

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Accounting policies  
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these 
consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless 
otherwise stated.  
Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements of BAE Systems plc have been 
prepared on a going concern basis as discussed in the Directors’ 
report on page 84 and in accordance with EU endorsed International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), International Financial 
Reporting Interpretations Committee interpretations (IFRICs) and the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds 
sterling and, unless stated otherwise, rounded to the nearest million. 
They have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as 
modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets,  
and other relevant financial assets and financial liabilities (including 
derivative instruments). 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with  
IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates  
and judgements. 
The directors consider the potential key areas of judgements 
required to be made in applying the Group’s accounting policies. 
These relate to:  
– the determination of the revenue recognition approach to apply  
to individual contracts; 
– the classification of financial assets or liabilities; 
– the classification of retirement benefit plans between defined 
benefit and defined contribution arrangements; and 
– the classification of investments as subsidiaries, equity accounted 
investments or otherwise. 
The directors do not consider that the practical application of the 
judgements is significantly uncertain or subjective in nature. 
An analysis and explanation of the critical accounting estimates  
and judgements used in producing this set of financial statements  
is made in the Directors’ report on page 37. 
Basis of consolidation 
The financial statements of the Group consolidate the results of the 
Company and its subsidiary entities, and include its share of its joint 
ventures’ results accounted for under the equity method, all of which 
are prepared to 31 December. 
Subsidiaries 
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. Control is the power 
to govern the operating and financial policies of the entity so as to 
obtain benefits from its activities. Subsidiaries include the special 
purpose entities that the Group transacted through for the provision 
of guarantees in respect of residual values, and head lease and 
finance payments on certain regional aircraft sold. The results of 
such subsidiaries are included in the consolidated income statement 
from the date of acquisition, up to the date of disposal. 
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the 
acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of the acquisition 
is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments 
issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, 
plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets 
acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a 
business combination are measured initially at their fair values at 
the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the 
fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired 
is recorded as goodwill. Previously held identifiable assets, liabilities  
and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity are revalued to their 
fair value at the date of acquisition, being the date at which the 
Group achieves control of the acquiree. The movement in fair value 
is taken to the asset revaluation reserve. 
Minority interests 
Upon initial acquisition of a minority interest, the interest of minority 
shareholders is measured at the minority’s proportion of the net fair 
value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
recognised. 
Equity accounted investments 
An entity is regarded as a joint venture if the Group has joint control 
over its operating and financial policies. Joint ventures are accounted 
for under the equity method where the Group’s income statement 
includes its share of their profits and losses, and the Group’s 
balance sheet includes its share of their net assets. 
Intangible assets 
Goodwill 
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible 
assets. Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures and associates  
is included in the carrying value of equity accounted investments. 
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal 
of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the 
entity sold. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to  
IFRS (1 January 2004) has been retained at the previous UK GAAP 
amounts, as any amounts related to intangible assets that would 
have been recorded in the acquired entity if it had applied IAS 38, 
Intangible Assets, at the date it was acquired by the Group were 
considered immaterial, after being tested for impairment at that 
date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 
has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any 
subsequent profit or loss on disposal. 
Research and development 
The Group undertakes research and development activities either  
on its own behalf or on behalf of customers. 
Group-funded expenditure on research activities is written off as 
incurred and charged to the income statement. 
Group-funded expenditure on development activities applied to  
a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved 
products and processes is capitalised as an internally generated 
intangible asset if certain conditions are met. The expenditure 
capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and  
related overheads. Capitalised development expenditure is stated  
at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
Capitalised development expenditure is amortised over the  
expected life of the product.  
Where the research and development activity is performed for 
customers, the revenue arising is recognised in accordance with  
the Group’s revenue recognition policy. 
Other intangible assets 
Acquired computer software licences for use within the Group are 
capitalised as an intangible asset on the basis of the costs incurred 
to acquire and bring to use the specific software. 
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable 
and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will 
probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one 
year, are recognised as intangible assets. Capitalised software 
development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses. Group-funded expenditure 
associated with enhancing or maintaining computer software 
programmes for sale is recognised as an expense as incurred.  BAE Systems Annual Report 2009 125
1. Accounting policies continued 
Trademarks and licences have definite useful lives and are carried  
at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
Intangible assets arising from a business combination are 
recognised at fair value, amortised over their estimated useful lives 
and subject to impairment testing. The most significant intangible 
assets recognised by the Group on businesses acquired to date  
are in relation to programmes. For programme-related intangibles, 
amortisation is set on a programme-by-programme basis over the  
life of the individual programme. Amortisation for customer-related 
intangibles is also set on an individual basis. 
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets. 
The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
Acquired computer software licences  2 to 5 years 
Capitalised software development 2 to 5 years 
Trademarks and licences  up to 20 years
Capitalised research and development expenditure  up to 10 years
Programme and customer related up to 15 years
Other intangibles up to 10 years
Property, plant and equipment 
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of  
self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct  
labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads. 
Depreciation is provided, normally on a straight-line basis, to  
write off the cost of property, plant and equipment over their 
estimated useful lives to any estimated residual value, using  
the following rates: 
Buildings 
 
up to 50 years, or the 
lease term if shorter 
Research equipment  8 years 
Computing equipment, motor vehicles and 
short-life works equipment  
3 to 5 years 
 
Aircraft  
 
up to 15 years, or the 
lease term if shorter 
Other equipment  
 
10 to 15 years, or the 
project life if shorter 
For certain items of plant and equipment in the Group’s US 
businesses, depreciation is normally provided on a basis consistent 
with cost reimbursement profiles under US government contracts. 
Typically this provides for a faster rate of depreciation than would 
otherwise arise on a straight-line basis. 
No depreciation is provided on freehold land and assets in the 
course of construction. 
The assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods 
are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet 
date. Where applicable, useful lives reflect the component 
accounting principle. 
Assets obtained under finance leases are included in property, plant 
and equipment and stated at an amount equal to the lower of the 
fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments  
at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses. 
Impairment 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s intangible assets, property, 
plant and equipment, and equity accounted investments are 
reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there  
is any indication of impairment as required by IAS 36, Impairment of 
Assets. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount 
is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that are not yet 
available for use, impairment testing is performed annually. All other 
assets are considered for impairment under the relevant standard. 
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of 
an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. 
The carrying value of an equity accounted investment comprises  
the Group’s share of net assets and purchased goodwill and is 
assessed for impairment as a single asset. 
The recoverable amount of assets carried at amortised cost is 
calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows, 
discounted at appropriate pre-tax discount rates.  
The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their fair 
value less cost to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, 
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present  
value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate. 
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash 
inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-
generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
An impairment loss in respect of assets, other than goodwill,  
carried at amortised cost is reversed if the subsequent increase  
in recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event 
occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.  
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.  
An impairment loss in respect of other assets is reversed if there 
has been a change in the estimate used to determine the 
recoverable amount.  
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s 
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no 
impairment loss had been recognised. 
Investment property 
Land and buildings that are leased to non-Group entities are 
classified as investment property. The Group measures investment 
property at its cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses. 
Depreciation is provided, on a straight-line basis, to write off the  
cost of investment property over its estimated useful life of up  
to 50 years. 
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and 
adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. 
Other investments 
The Group determines the classification of its other investments at 
initial recognition taking account of, where relevant, the purpose for 
which the investments were acquired. The Group classifies its other 
investments as follows: 
(a) loans and receivables: term deposits, principally comprising 
funds held with banks and other financial institutions, are carried 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method;  
(b) at fair value through profit or loss: financial instruments held for 
trading or designated by management on initial recognition. They 
are held at fair value and included in non-current assets unless 
management intends to dispose of the investment within 
12 months of the balance sheet date;  
(c) held to maturity: non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Group’s 
management has the positive intention and ability to hold  
to maturity; 
(d) available-for-sale: investments other than interests in joint 
ventures and associates and term deposits and not classified  
as (b) or (c) above. They are held at fair value.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
126 
1. Accounting policies continued 
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised at the date on 
which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Investments 
are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all 
financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss. 
Investments are derecognised when the rights to receive cash  
flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred 
and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards  
of ownership. 
Realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in 
the fair value of the investments classified as at fair value through 
profit or loss are included in finance costs in the income statement 
in the period in which they arise. Unrealised gains or losses  
arising from changes in the fair value of investments classified  
as available-for-sale are recognised in equity. When investments 
classified as available-for-sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated 
fair value adjustments are included in the income statement as 
gains and losses from investment securities within finance costs. 
The fair values of quoted investments are based on bid prices at  
the balance sheet date. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, including all relevant 
overhead expenditure, and net realisable value.  
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are stated at their amortised cost less 
impairment losses. A provision for impairment is established when 
there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect 
all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. 
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the 
debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default 
or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade 
receivable is impaired. Receivables with a short-term duration are  
not discounted. 
An impairment loss is reversed if the subsequent increase in 
recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring 
after the impairment loss was recognised. 
Amounts due from customers for contract work include long-term 
contract balances less attributable progress payments. 
Long-term contract balances are stated at cost, plus attributable 
profit, less provision for any anticipated losses. Appropriate 
provisions for any losses are made in the year in which they  
are first foreseen. 
Progress payments are amounts received from customers in 
accordance with the terms of contracts which specify payments  
in advance of delivery and are credited, as progress payments, 
against any expenditure incurred for the particular contract. Any 
unexpended balance in respect of progress payments is held in  
trade and other payables as customer stage payments or, if the 
amounts are subject to advance payment guarantees unrelated  
to company performance, as cash received on customers’ account. 
Cash received on customers’ account is excluded from net 
cash/(debt) as defined by the Group. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 
The global nature of the Group’s business means it is exposed to 
volatility in currency exchange rates. In order to protect itself against 
currency fluctuations, the Group’s policy is to hedge all material firm 
transactional exposures as well as to manage anticipated economic 
cash flow exposures over the medium term. The Group also uses 
interest rate derivative instruments to manage the Group’s exposure 
to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and deposits by varying 
the proportion of fixed rate debt relative to floating rate debt over the 
forward time horizon. The Group aims to achieve hedge accounting 
treatment for all derivatives that hedge material foreign currency 
exposures and those interest rate exposures where hedge 
accounting can be achieved. 
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold 
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. However, 
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted  
for as trading instruments. 
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, such instruments are stated at fair 
value at the balance sheet date. Gains and losses on derivative 
financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are 
recognised in the income statement for the period. 
Cash flow hedges 
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge  
of cash flows relating to a highly probable forecast transaction 
(income or expense), the effective portion of any change in the fair 
value of the instrument is recognised directly in reserves. Amounts 
recognised in reserves are recycled from reserves into the cost of 
the underlying transaction and recognised in the income statement 
when the underlying transaction affects profit or loss. The ineffective 
portion of any change in the fair value of the instrument is 
recognised in the income statement immediately.  
Fair value hedges 
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a fair value 
hedge, changes in the fair value of the underlying asset or liability, 
and gains and losses on the derivative instrument, are recognised  
in the income statement for the period.  
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, call deposits  
and other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of 
three months or less and which are subject to an insignificant risk  
of change in value. For the purpose of the cash flow statement,  
cash and cash equivalents also includes bank overdrafts that are 
repayable on demand. 
Loans and overdrafts 
Loans and overdrafts are recognised initially at fair value, less 
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
loans and overdrafts are stated at amortised cost or fair value  
in respect of the hedged risk where hedge accounting has been 
adopted, with any difference between cost and redemption value 
being recognised in the income statement over the period of the 
borrowings on an effective interest basis. 
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are stated at their cost. 
Provisions 
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has  
a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, 
it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required  
to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated. 
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the 
expected future cash flows at an appropriate pre-tax discount rate. 
A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products 
and services are sold. The provision is based on historical warranty 
data and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their 
associated probabilities. 
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group  
has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and  
the restructuring has either commenced or has been publicly 
announced. Future operating costs are not provided for. 
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected 
benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than 
the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.   
BAE Systems Annual Report 2009 127
1. Accounting policies continued 
Provisions for losses on contracts are recorded when it becomes 
probable that total estimated contract costs will exceed total 
contract revenues. Such provisions are recorded as write downs of 
work-in-progress for that portion of the work which has already been 
completed, and as liability provisions for the remainder. Losses are 
determined on the basis of estimated results on completion of 
contracts and are updated regularly. 
Pension obligations 
Group companies operate various pension plans. The Group has 
both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.  
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans 
are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred. 
For defined benefit retirement plans, the cost of providing benefits  
is determined periodically by independent actuaries and charged  
to the income statement in the period in which those benefits are 
earned by the employees. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised 
in full in the period in which they occur, and are recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income. Past service cost is recognised 
immediately to the extent the benefits are already vested, or 
otherwise is recognised on a straight-line basis over the average 
period until the benefits become vested. Curtailments due to the 
material reduction of the expected years of future services of current 
employees or the elimination of the accrual of defined benefits  
for some or all of the future services for a significant number of 
employees are recognised immediately as a gain or loss in the 
income statement. 
The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet 
represent the present value of the defined benefit obligations as 
adjusted for unrecognised past service cost and as reduced by the 
fair value of scheme assets.  
Tax 
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and 
deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in 
equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income  
for the year, using rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect  
of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the balance sheet liability 
method, on temporary differences between the carrying amounts  
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the 
amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary 
differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax 
purposes, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect 
neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to 
investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably  
not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred  
tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or 
settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax 
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will  
be realised. 
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of  
dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to  
pay the related dividend. 
Share-based payment compensation 
The Group issues equity-settled and cash-settled share options  
to employees. In accordance with the requirements of IFRS 2,  
Share-based Payment, the Group has applied IFRS 2 to all equity-
settled share options granted after 7 November 2002 that were 
unvested as of 1 January 2005 and all cash-settled options 
outstanding at the balance sheet date. 
As explained in note 25, equity-settled share options are measured 
at fair value at the date of grant using an option pricing model.  
The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on the Group’s estimate of the number of shares  
that will actually vest. 
Cash-settled share options are measured at fair value at the balance 
sheet date using an option pricing model. The Group recognises a 
liability at the balance sheet date based on these fair values, and 
taking into account the estimated number of the options that will 
actually vest and the relative completion of the vesting period. 
Changes in the value of this liability are recognised in the income 
statement for the year. 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange 
rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the 
exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. These exchange 
differences are recognised in the consolidated income statement 
unless they qualify for net investment hedge accounting treatment,  
in which case the effective portion is recognised directly in a 
separate component of equity. 
For consolidation purposes, the assets and liabilities of overseas 
subsidiary entities, joint ventures and associates are translated  
at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date. Income 
statements of such entities are translated at average rates of 
exchange during the year. All resulting exchange differences, 
including exchange differences arising from the translation of 
borrowings and other financial instruments designated as hedges  
of such investments, are recognised directly in a separate 
component of equity. 
Translation differences that arose before the transition date to IFRS  
(1 January 2004) are presented in equity but not as a separate 
component. When a foreign operation is sold, the cumulative 
exchange differences recognised since 1 January 2004 are 
recognised in the income statement as part of the profit or loss  
on sale. 
Revenue and profit recognition 
Sales include the Group’s net share of sales of equity accounted 
investments. Revenue represents sales made by the Company and 
its subsidiary undertakings, excluding the Group’s share of sales  
of equity accounted investments. 
Long-term contracts 
The majority of the Group’s long-term contract arrangements are 
accounted for under IAS 11, Construction Contracts. Sales are 
recognised when the Group has obtained the right to consideration  
in exchange for its performance. This is usually when title passes  
or a separately identifiable phase (milestone) of a contract or 
development has been completed and accepted by the customer. 
No profit is recognised on contracts until the outcome of the contract 
can be reliably estimated. Profit is calculated by reference to reliable 
estimates of contract revenue and forecast costs after making 
suitable allowances for technical and other risks related to 
performance milestones yet to be achieved. When it is probable that 
total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected 
loss is recognised immediately as an expense.

1. Accounting policies continued 
Goods sold and services rendered 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received 
or receivable, net of returns, rebates and other similar allowances.  
Revenue from the sale of goods not under a long-term contract is 
recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and 
rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery  
of the consideration is probable, there is no continuing management 
involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue and costs 
can be measured reliably. Profit is recognised at the time of sale. 
Revenue from the provision of services not under a long-term 
contract is recognised in the income statement in proportion to  
the stage of completion of the contract at the reporting date. The 
stage of completion is measured on the basis of direct expenses 
incurred as a percentage of total expenses to be incurred for 
material contracts and labour hours delivered as a percentage  
of total labour hours to be delivered for time contracts. 
Sales and profits on intercompany trading are generally determined 
on an arm’s length basis. 
Lease income 
Rental income from aircraft operating leases is recognised in 
revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. 
Lease incentives granted are charged to the income statement over 
the term of the lease. 
Leases 
Assets obtained under finance leases are included in property,  
plant and equipment at cost and are depreciated over their useful 
lives, or the lease term, whichever is the shorter. Future instalments 
under such leases, net of financing costs, are included within loans. 
Rental payments are apportioned between the finance element, 
which is included in finance costs, and the capital element, which 
reduces the outstanding obligation for future instalments, so as  
to give a constant charge on the outstanding obligation. 
Payments, including any incentives, made under operating leases  
are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis  
over the lease term. 
Assets held for leasing out under operating leases are included in 
property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and accumulated impairment losses. Rental income is recognised  
in revenue on a straight-line basis. 
Assets leased out under finance leases cease to be recognised in 
the balance sheet after the inception of the lease. Instead, a finance 
lease receivable, representing the discounted future lease payments 
to be received from the lessee plus any discounted unguaranteed 
residual value, is recorded as a long-term financial asset. Interest 
income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, taking 
into account the effective yield on the asset. 
Underlying EBITA 
Management uses an underlying profit measure to monitor the year-
on-year profitability of the Group, which is defined as earnings before 
amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, finance costs  
and taxation expense (EBITA) excluding non-recurring items. This 
definition is referred to as Underlying EBITA. In order to ensure that  
it continues to provide a measure of profitability that is comparable 
over time, it has been amended to exclude all non-recurring items. 
Underlying EBITA continues to be the measure of profit on which 
segmental performance is monitored by management. As such, it  
is disclosed in note 3 on a segmental basis. Non-recurring items  
are defined as items that are relevant to an understanding of the 
Group’s performance with reference to their materiality, nature  
and function. The non-recurring items for the current and prior  
years are presented on the face of the Group’s consolidated  
income statement. 
Finance costs 
Financial income comprises interest income on funds invested, gains 
on the disposal of available-for-sale financial assets, changes in the 
fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, and 
gains on hedging instruments that are recognised in profit or loss.  
Financial costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, unwinding 
of the discounts on provisions, changes in the fair value of financial 
assets at fair value through profit or loss, and losses on hedging 
instruments that are recognised in profit or loss. 
Borrowing costs which are directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of a qualifying asset (one that takes  
a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale) are 
capitalised as part of the cost of that asset, until such time as  
the assets are ready for their intended use or sale.  
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement  
in the period in which they are incurred. 
No borrowing costs were capitalised in the year ended  
31 December 2009. 
Dividends 
Equity dividends on ordinary share capital are recognised as a 
liability in the period in which they are declared. The interim dividend 
is recognised when it has been approved by the Board and the  
final dividend is recognised when it has been approved by the 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.

2. Changes in accounting policies  
With effect from 1 January 2008, the Group early adopted IFRS 8, 
Operating segments. The standard is concerned with disclosure only. 
Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2009 
With effect from 1 January 2009, the Group has adopted the 
following amendments to existing standards and interpretations: 
– IAS 1 (revised 2007), Presentation of Financial Statements,  
requires that the Group presents a ‘statement of comprehensive 
income’ and a ‘consolidated statement of changes in equity’ as 
primary statements. The standard is concerned with disclosure 
only and has no impact on the reported results or financial 
position of the Group; 
– IAS 23 (revised 2007), Borrowing Costs, requires borrowing costs 
which are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction  
or production of a qualifying asset (one that takes a substantial 
period of time to get ready for use or sale) to be capitalised  
as part of the cost of that asset. There is no longer an option  
to immediately expense those borrowing costs. Whilst this 
represents a change in the Group’s accounting policy, application 
of the revised standard is prospective i.e. applies to qualifying 
assets for which the commencement date for capitalisation is  
on or after 1 January 2009. This has not had an impact on the 
reported results or financial position of the Group; 
– Amendment to IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures,  
requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurement  
and liquidity risk. The amendment requires disclosure of fair  
value measurements by reference to a fair value measurement 
hierarchy. The amendment is concerned with disclosure only  
and has no impact on the reported results or financial position  
of the Group;  
– Amendment to IFRS 2, Share-based Payment: Vesting Conditions 
and Cancellations, provides clarification on the vesting conditions 
which should be included in the grant date fair value for 
transactions with employees and others providing similar services. 
This has had no impact on the reported results or financial 
position of the Group; and 
– Improvements to IFRSs 2008, the first standard issued under the 
International Accounting Standards Board’s annual improvement 
process. It amends 20 existing standards, basis of conclusions 
and guidance. The improvements include changes in presentation, 
recognition and measurement requirements and have had no 
significant impact on the reported results or financial position  
of the Group.  
In addition, the Group has reviewed the effect of the following 
amendments and interpretations endorsed during 2009 and effective 
for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, and 
has concluded that they have no impact on the Group’s accounts:  
– Amendments to IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation, and 
IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements: Puttable Financial 
Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation; 
– Amendments to IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement, and IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures: 
Reclassification of Financial Assets;  
– Amendments to IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of IFRS, and IAS 27, 
Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements: Cost of an 
Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate; 
– Amendments to International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (IFRIC) 9, Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives, and 
IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement: 
Embedded Derivatives; 
– IFRIC 12, Service Concession Arrangements; 
– IFRIC 13, Customer Loyalty Programmes; 
– IFRIC 14, IAS 19, Limit of a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum 
Funding Requirements and their Interaction;  
– IFRIC 15, Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate; and 
– IFRIC 16, Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation. 
Amendments to existing standards and interpretations that are not 
yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group 
The following EU endorsed amendments and interpretations to 
published standards are effective for accounting periods beginning 
on or after 1 July 2009, and have not been early adopted by  
the Group: 
– IFRS 3 (revised 2008), Business Combinations, introduces some 
significant changes in the accounting treatment for acquisitions. 
The most significant change for the Group will be the requirement 
to expense all acquisition-related costs. The impact on the Group’s 
reported results will be dependent on the specific transaction; and 
– Amendments to IAS 27, Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements: Changes in non-controlling interest with no change  
in control. The amendment requires that acquisitions of minority 
interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted 
for as transactions with equity holders and therefore no goodwill  
is recognised as a result of such transactions. The potential 
impact on the Group’s accounts will be dependent on the  
specific transaction. 
The Group has reviewed the effect of the following amendments and 
interpretations effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 July 2009 and does not expect them to have an impact on the 
Group’s accounts:  
– Amendment to IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement on Eligible Hedged Items; 
– IFRIC 17, Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners; and 
– IFRIC 18, Transfers of Assets from Customers. 
The following EU endorsed amendments to published standards  
are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2010, but have not been early adopted by the Group: 
– Amendment to IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation: 
Classification of Rights Issues.

3. Segmental analysis 
The Group has five reportable segments which are organised around a combination of the different products and services they provide and 
the geographical areas in which they operate: 
– Electronics, Intelligence & Support, based primarily in the US, designs, develops, produces and services systems and subsystems for  
a wide range of military and commercial applications. It comprises four lines of business: Electronic Solutions, Information Solutions, 
Platform Solutions and Support Solutions; 
– Land & Armaments, based primarily in the US, designs, develops, produces, supports and upgrades armoured combat vehicles, tactical 
wheeled vehicles, naval guns, missile launchers, artillery systems, munitions and law enforcement products; 
– Programmes & Support primarily comprises the Group’s UK-based air, naval and security activities; 
– International comprises the Group’s businesses in Saudi Arabia and Australia, and its interests in the pan-European MBDA joint venture, 
Saab of Sweden and Air Astana; and 
– HQ & Other Businesses comprises the regional aircraft asset management and support activities, head office and UK shared services 
activity, including research centres and property management. 
The Group has not aggregated any segments in arriving at the analysis. 
Management monitors the results of these operating groups to assess performance and make decisions about the allocation of resources. 
Segment performance is evaluated based on underlying EBITA
1
. This is reconciled below to the operating group result and the operating 
profit in the consolidated financial statements. Finance costs and taxation expense are managed on a Group basis.

Due to changes in UK tax legislation during the year, there are no unrecognised deferred tax liabilities arising on the aggregate temporary 
differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint ventures (2008 £332m). Any withholding tax due 
on the remittance of future earnings is expected to be insignificant.  BAE Systems Annual Report 2009 139

2 Other intangibles includes patents, trademarks, software and internally funded development costs. 
3 Amortisation is included in operating costs in the income statement. 
4 Adjustment on finalisation of provisional goodwill relating to the acquisition of MTC Technologies, Inc., Tenix Defence Holdings Pty Limited, Tenix Toll Defence Logistics Pty Limited, Detica Group 
Plc and IST Dynamics in 2008, and Armor Holdings, Inc. in 2007. The amounts are not considered material for the restatement of comparative information. 
5 Goodwill arising on the formation of the BVT joint venture in the year ended 31 December 2008 and goodwill associated with the Group’s initial 50% shareholding in Fleet Support Limited has 
been reclassified from equity accounted investments to intangible assets in accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations, in 2009 upon acquisition of VT Group’s 45% shareholding in the BVT 
joint venture. 
The Group has no indefinite life intangible assets other than goodwill. The Group’s approach to goodwill impairment testing is set out in the 
accounting policies on page 125. 
Impairment testing 
The Group’s goodwill of £10.2bn (2008 £10.9bn) is allocated across 23 cash-generating units (CGUs). In order to calculate the recoverable 
amount of the Group’s goodwill, all goodwill balances have been considered with regard to value in use calculations. These calculations  
use risk-adjusted future cash flow projections based on the Group’s five-year Integrated Business Plan (IBP) and include a terminal value 
based on the projections for the final year of that plan, with an inflationary growth rate assumption applied. The IBP process uses historic 
experience, available government spending data and the Group’s order book. Pre-tax discount rates, derived from the Group’s post-tax 
weighted average cost of capital of 7.72% (adjusted for risks specific to the market in which the CGU operates), have been used in 
discounting these projected risk-adjusted cash flows.   
BAE Systems Annual Report 2009 141
11. Intangible assets continued 
Significant CGUs 
The Group has three CGUs with allocated goodwill which is significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill. These are 
the US-based electronic warfare, network and mission solutions business in the Electronics, Intelligence & Support (EI&S) operating group 
(£2.6bn), and the US-based ex-United Defense Industries, Inc. (UDI) (£2.0bn) and ex-Armor Holdings, Inc. (Armor) (£1.7bn pre-impairment 
below) businesses in the Land & Armaments operating group. The key assumptions underpinning the cash flow projections for the EI&S 
CGU are the continuing demand from the US government for electronic warfare systems, mission solutions and other technology-based 
solutions, and from non-military agencies for network solutions. The key assumptions underpinning the cash flow projections for the  
Land & Armaments CGUs are the continued demand in the Group’s home markets and from exports for existing and successor military  
land and tracked vehicles, upgrade programmes and support. The pre-tax discount rates used to discount the risk-adjusted five-year cash 
flow projections were 9.9%, 9.8% and 10.3%, respectively. The growth rate assumption applied to the final year of these projections was  
3% (2% for Armor), reduced from 4% in the prior year reflecting increased uncertainty in the US defence budgets.  
Whilst there are no other CGUs with allocated goodwill balances exceeding 15% of the Group’s total goodwill balance, the majority of the 
projected cash flows within the remaining CGUs are underpinned by the expected continuation of levels of government spending on 
aerospace, defence and security, and the Group’s ability to capture a broadly consistent market share. 
The directors have not identified any reasonably possible material changes relating either specifically to the global military vehicle market, 
or to the levels of defence spending in the Group’s home markets, particularly in the US, that would cause the carrying value of goodwill  
to exceed its recoverable amount.  
Impairment – goodwill 
The total goodwill impairment charge of £725m mainly arises in three of the CGUs, Armor (£526m), Products Group, acquired as part of  
the Armor transaction in 2007 (£156m), and Detica (£34m). 
The Armor impairment charge reflects both the non-award of a follow-on contract for production of vehicles under the Family of Medium 
Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) programme and the subsequent impact on the growth prospects of the business. 
The Products Group impairment charge reflects a weaker outlook for the business as spending from customer discretionary budgets has 
reduced in both domestic and export markets. The pre-tax discount rate used was 9.5%. 
The Detica impairment charge relates to the discontinued financial services element of the business. The pre-tax discount rate used  
was 10.0%. 
Impairment – intangible assets 
The total intangible assets impairment charge of £248m comprises £240m relating to programme and customer related intangibles, and 
£8m relating to other intangibles. The charge impacts the EI&S (£8m), Land & Armaments (£236m) and International (£4m) operating groups. 
The charge relating to Land & Armaments includes £108m in respect of the Products Group business, £66m relating to the FMTV  
non-award and a number of individually small items each calculated on a programme-by-programme basis.

On 30 October 2009, the BVT Surface Fleet Limited (BVT) joint venture became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group after VT Group plc 
(VT) exercised its option to sell its 45% shareholding in BVT to BAE Systems (note 29). As part of the transaction, the Group’s shareholding 
in Fleet Support Limited also increased to 100% (2008 55%). On the date of the transaction, the Group gained full control of BVT, which 
was previously jointly controlled with VT. 
From 1 January 2009 to the date of completion, the Group equity accounted the results of BVT to reflect the Group’s 55% interest held. 
From the date of completion, the results and net assets of BVT, renamed BAE Systems Surface Ships Limited, have been consolidated  
in the Group’s accounts as a wholly-owned subsidiary. 
Goodwill of £225m arising on the formation of the BVT joint venture, comprising £177m on the initial formation of the joint venture and 
£48m reflecting adjustments to the provisional fair values assigned to the net assets acquired, and goodwill associated with the Group’s 
initial 50% shareholding in Fleet Support Limited (£28m), has been reclassified to intangible assets (note 11) in accordance with IFRS 3, 
Business Combinations. 
Included within purchased goodwill is £89m (2008 £94m) relating to the goodwill arising on acquisitions made by the Group’s equity 
accounted investments subsequent to their acquisition by the Group. 
The market value of the Group’s shareholding in Saab AB at 31 December 2009 was £229m (2008 £140m).

Cash flow hedges 
The hedged, highly probable forecast transactions denominated in foreign currency are predominantly expected to occur at various stages 
during the next 12 months. The majority of those extending beyond 12 months are expected to have been transacted within five years of 
the balance sheet date. 
Amounts debited to the hedging reserve in respect of cash flow hedges were £393m (2008 credit £469m). 
The amount reclassified from equity to the income statement was £nil (2008 £nil). The amount debited from equity and included in contract-
related non-financial assets and liabilities was £39m (2008 £32m). The ineffective portion recognised in the income statement that arises 
from cash flow hedges amounts to £nil (2008 £nil). 
Fair value hedges 
The loss arising in the income statement on fair value hedging instruments was £20m (2008 £37m gain). The gain arising in the income 
statement on the fair value of the underlying hedged items was £20m (2008 £38m loss). The ineffective portion recognised in the income

amounts relating to other financial liabilities, such as trade payables, are settled within the normal operating cycle of the business. 
The US$500m 4.75% bond, repayable 2010, was converted on issue to a floating rate bond by utilising interest rate swaps giving an 
effective rate during 2009 of 1.96%. 
The US$1bn 6.4% bond, repayable 2011, has been partially converted to a floating rate bond by utilising a series of interest rate swaps. 
US$500m has been swapped to a floating rate until maturity of the bond in 2011. This has been overlaid by US$300m of floating to fixed 
interest rate swaps that fix the interest payments at a lower rate than the original coupon. The effective interest rate during 2009 was 
5.29% with an interest rate split on the bond at 31 December 2009 being US$800m fixed and US$200m floating. 
The Class B and Class G certificates are repayable in 2011 and 2013, respectively, with fixed US$ coupon rates of 7.16% and 6.66%, 
giving a weighted average interest rate of 6.88%. At 31 December 2009, the gross outstanding principal due is US$772m. Of this balance, 
US$235m has been converted to a sterling floating rate bond by utilising a series of cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps which 
resulted in an effective interest rate during 2009 of 2.84% on this element. 
In 2009, two US bonds were issued with the following maturities, US$500m 4.95% bond, repayable 2014 and US$1bn 6.375% bond, 
repayable 2019. The US$500m 4.95% bond was converted on issue to a floating rate bond utilising a series of interest rate swaps giving 
an effective rate during 2009 of 1.08%. US$500m of the US$1bn 6.375% bond has been partially converted to a floating rate bond utilising 
a series of interest rate swaps that mature in December 2014 and give an effective rate during 2009 of 6.1%. 
The Albertville Hangar Bond is a floating rate bond with an effective interest rate of 3.06%. This bond has been converted to a fixed rate 
using a floating to fixed rate swap, fixing the rate at 3.52%. 
The US$500m 7.5% bond, repayable 2027, was converted at issue to a sterling fixed rate bond by utilising a cross-currency swap and has 
an effective interest rate of 7.73%.

21. Retirement benefit obligations 
Pension plans 
BAE Systems plc operates pension plans for the Group’s qualifying employees in the UK, US and other countries. The principal plans in the 
UK and US are funded defined benefit plans, and the assets are held in separate trustee administered funds. The plans in other countries 
are unfunded or defined contribution plans. Pension plan valuations are regularly carried out by independent actuaries to determine pension 
costs for pension funding and to calculate the IAS 19, Employee Benefits, deficit. 
The disclosures below relate to post-retirement benefit plans in the UK, US and other countries which are accounted for as defined  
benefit plans in accordance with IAS 19. The valuations used for the IAS 19 disclosures are based on the most recent actuarial valuation 
undertaken by independent qualified actuaries and updated to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the deficit  
of the plans at 31 December each year. Plan assets are shown at the bid value at 31 December each year. 
Post-retirement benefits other than pensions 
The Group also operates a number of non-pension post-retirement benefit plans, under which certain employees are eligible to receive 
benefits after retirement, the majority of which relate to the provision of medical benefits to retired employees of the Group’s subsidiaries  
in the US. The latest valuations of the principal plans, covering retiree medical and life insurance plans in certain US subsidiaries, were 
performed by independent actuaries as at 1 January 2009. These plans were rolled forward to reflect the information at 31 December 
2009. The method of accounting for these is similar to that used for defined benefit pension plans. 
The financial assumptions used to calculate liabilities for the principal plans are:

The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not 
necessarily occur in practice. The bid value of plan assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to 
significant change before they are realised, and the present value of plan liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long 
periods and thus inherently uncertain, as at 31 December are shown in the tables below. 
For its UK pension arrangements the Group has, for the purpose of calculating its liabilities as at 31 December 2009, continued to use 
PA 00 medium cohort tables based on year of birth (as published by the Institute of Actuaries) for both pensioner and non-pensioner 
members in conjunction with the results of an investigation into the actual mortality experience of plan members. In addition, this  
mortality has been subject to a minimum assumed rate of future annual mortality improvements of 1%. For its US pension arrangements, 
the mortality tables used for pensioners and non-pensioners are RP 2000 projected to 2010. The current life expectancies underlying  
the value of the accrued liabilities for the main UK and US plans range from 19 to 23 years for current male pensioners at age 65 and  
22 to 25 years for current female pensioners at age 65. 
The Group has a number of healthcare arrangements in the US. The long-term healthcare cost increases shown in the table above are 
based on the assumptions that the increases are 9% in 2009 reducing to 5% by 2015 for pre-retirement and 10% in 2009 reducing to  
5% for post-retirement.  
A summary of the movements in the retirement benefit obligations is shown below. The full disclosures, as required by IAS 19, are provided 
in the subsequent information.

21. Retirement benefit obligations continued 
The increase in the liabilities due to changes in assumptions is primarily due to a fall in corporate bond yields combined with an increase  
in the expected inflation rate which have combined to reduce the real discount rates used to calculate the liabilities of the pension plans  
as at 31 December 2009.  
The curtailment gain recognised in the year relates to pension benefit restructuring in the US. 
During the year, the Group contributed £225m into Trust for the benefit of the Group’s main pension scheme. The contribution is reported 
within other investments – current (£211m after a fair value gain of £2m) and cash and cash equivalents (£16m) in the consolidated 
balance sheet at 31 December 2009, and the use of these assets is restricted under the terms of the Trust. However, the Group considers 
this contribution to be equivalent to the other one-off contributions it makes into the Group’s pension schemes and, accordingly, presents 
below a definition of the pension deficit to include this contribution.

Total cumulative actuarial losses recognised in equity since the transition to IFRS are £3.4bn (2008 £1.4bn). 
Certain of the Group’s equity accounted investments participate in the Group’s defined benefit plans as well as Airbus SAS, the Group’s share 
of which was disposed of during the year ended 31 December 2006. As these plans are multi-employer plans the Group has allocated  
an appropriate share of the IAS 19 pension deficit to the equity accounted investments and to Airbus SAS based upon a reasonable and 
consistent allocation method intended to reflect a reasonable approximation of their share of the deficit. The Group’s share of the IAS 19 
pension deficit allocated to the equity accounted investments is included in the balance sheet within equity accounted investments.  
In the event that an employer who participates in the Group’s pension schemes fails or cannot be compelled to fulfil its obligations as  
a participating employer, the remaining participating employers are obliged to collectively take on its obligations. The Group considers  
the likelihood of this event arising as remote.

When setting the overall expected rate of return on plan assets, historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships 
between equities and bonds are preserved. This is consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher 
volatility generate a greater return over time. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before expected 
return assumptions are determined for each asset class. The overall expected return is established with proper consideration of 
diversification and rebalancing. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonableness and appropriateness.

Aircraft financing 
The provision includes probable exposures under residual value guarantees issued by the Group on previous sales transactions. The  
Group has provided residual value guarantees in respect of certain commercial aircraft sold. At 31 December 2009, the Group’s gross 
exposure to make future payments in respect of these arrangements was £48m (2008 £97m). The Group’s net exposure to these 
guarantees is covered by the provisions held of £32m (2008 £58m) and the residual values of the related aircraft of £12m (2008 £37m). 
Such costs are generally incurred within five years. 
Warranties and after-sales service 
Warranties and after-sales service are provided in the normal course of business with provisions for associated costs being made based  
on an assessment of future claims with reference to past experience. Such costs are generally incurred within three years post-delivery. 
Whilst actual events could result in potentially significant differences to the quantum but not the timing of the outflows in relation to the 
provisions, management has reflected current knowledge in assessing the provision levels. 
Reorganisations – continuing operations 
The costs associated with the reorganisation programmes are supported by detailed plans and based on previous experience as well as 
other known factors. Such costs are generally incurred within one to three years. There is limited volatility around the timing and amount  
of the ultimate outflows related to these provisions. 
Legal, contractual and environmental provisions 
The Group holds provisions for expected legal, contractual and environmental costs that it expects to incur over an extended period.  
These costs are based on past experience of similar items and other known factors and represent management’s best estimate of  
the likely outcome.  
Reflecting the inherent uncertainty within many legal proceedings, the timing and amount of the outflows could differ significantly from  
the amount provided. 
Other provisions 
There are no individually significant provisions included within other provisions.

23. Contingent liabilities and commitments 
Guarantees and performance bonds 
The Group has entered into a number of guarantee and performance bond arrangements in the normal course of business. Provision is 
made for any amounts that the directors consider may become payable under such arrangements. 
Operating lease commitments – where the Group is the lessee 
The Group leases various offices, factories, shipyards and aircraft under non-cancellable operating lease agreements. The leases have 
varying terms including escalation clauses, renewal rights and purchase options. None of these terms represent unusual arrangements  
or create material onerous or beneficial rights or obligations.

Special Share 
One Special Share of £1 in the Company is held on behalf of the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills (the Special 
Shareholder). Certain parts of the Company’s Articles of Association cannot be amended without the consent of the Special Shareholder. 
These articles include the requirement that no foreign person, or foreign persons acting in concert, can have more than a 15% voting 
interest in the Company, the requirement that the majority of the directors are British, the requirement that decisions of the directors at 
their meetings, in their committees or via resolution must be approved by a majority of British directors and the requirement that the Chief 
Executive and any executive chairman are British citizens. The effect of these requirements can also be amended by regulations made by 
the directors and approved by the Special Shareholder. 
The Special Shareholder may require the Company at any time to redeem the Special Share at par or to convert the Special Share into  
one ordinary voting share. The Special Shareholder is entitled to receive notice of and to attend general meetings and class meetings  
of the Company’s shareholders but has no voting right, nor other rights, other than to speak in relation to any business in respect of the 
Special Share. 
Treasury shares 
As at 31 December 2009, 43,952,360 (2008 55,038,953) ordinary shares of 2.5p each with an aggregate nominal value of £1,098,809 
(2008 £1,375,974) were held in treasury. During 2009, 11,086,593 treasury shares were used to satisfy awards and options under the 
Share Incentive Plan and the Save-As-You-Earn Share Option Scheme. 
Authorised share capital 
As agreed by the shareholders at the 2009 Annual General Meeting, the Company’s Articles of Association were amended with effect from 
1 October 2009 to remove the requirement for the Company to have an authorised share capital, the concept of which was abolished under 
the Companies Act 2006.

to the BVT joint venture on the acquisition of the remaining 45% interest in 2009. 
Translation reserve 
The translation reserve comprises all foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign 
operations.

BAE Systems ESOP Trust  
The Group has an ESOP discretionary trust to administer the share plans and to acquire Company shares, using funds loaned by the Group, 
to meet commitments to Group employees. A dividend waiver was in operation for shares within the ESOP Trust, other than those owned 
beneficially by the participants, for the dividends paid in June and December 2009.  
At 31 December 2009, the ESOP held 3,644,598 (2008 2,093,818) ordinary shares of 2.5p each with a market value of £13m (2008 £8m). 
The shares held by the ESOP are recorded at cost and deducted from retained earnings until such time as the shares vest unconditionally 
to employees.  
A dividend waiver was in operation during 2009 and remains over shares within the Company’s Share Incentive Plan Trust other than those 
shares owned beneficially by the participants. A dividend waiver was also in operation for the dividends paid in June and December 2009 
over shares in the Group All-Employee Free Shares Plan Trust other than those shares owned beneficially by participants. 
Capital 
The Group funds its operations through a mixture of equity funding and debt financing, including bank and capital market borrowings. 
At 31 December 2009, the Group’s capital was £4,614m (2008 £6,893m), which comprises total equity of £4,727m (2008 £7,289m), 
less amounts accumulated in equity relating to cash flow hedges of £113m (2008 £396m). Net cash as defined by the Group was  
£403m (2008 £39m). 
The capital structure of the Group reflects the judgement of the directors of an appropriate balance of funding required. The Group’s policy 
is to maintain an investment grade credit rating. The Group’s dividend policy is to grow the dividend whilst maintaining a long-term sustainable 
earnings cover of approximately two times.

29. Acquisition of subsidiaries 
Acquisition of subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2009 
The most significant acquisition made by the Group during the year ended 31 December 2009 was of the 45% shareholding in BVT  
Surface Fleet Limited (BVT) held by VT Group plc (VT). If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2009, combined sales of Group and 
equity accounted investments would have been £22.8bn, revenue £21.3bn and loss for the year ended 31 December 2009 £58m. 
BVT (now BAE Systems Surface Ships) 
On 30 October 2009, the BVT joint venture became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group after VT Group plc exercised its option to sell  
its 45% shareholding in BVT to BAE Systems. Consideration paid including transaction costs for the remaining 45% interest was £348m. 
The now wholly-owned company has been renamed BAE Systems Surface Ships Limited (Surface Ships). The Group previously held a 55% 
interest in BVT, and accounted for its share of the results and net assets of BVT in accordance with IAS 31, Interests in Joint Ventures. 
Total provisional goodwill arising amounted to £584m. This consists of £225m which arose on the initial formation of the BVT joint venture 
in the year ended 31 December 2008 and £359m arising on the acquisition of the 45% interest. 
In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2009, Surface Ships contributed revenue and profit after tax of £338m and £34m, 
respectively, to the Group’s consolidated results as a wholly-owned subsidiary. 
Surface Ships is a leading designer, manufacturer and integrator of surface ships and their support vessels. It delivers complex 
engineering, integration and through-life support across the lifecycle of a ship. Bringing Surface Ships into full ownership of BAE Systems 
further strengthens the Group’s global maritime business and is consistent with the strategy to establish a sustainable and profitable 
through-life business in air, land and sea. Surface Ships has a solid order book, a clear strategy to transform the UK maritime sector and  
a commitment to deliver existing and future programmes.  
The acquisition of BVT had the following effect on the Group’s assets and liabilities. The figures in the table below represent a 100% 
interest in BVT.

Advanced Ceramics Research  
The Group acquired Advanced Ceramics Research, Inc. in the US on 8 June 2009 for a consideration of $14m (£9m). The net assets and 
goodwill included in the Group’s consolidated balance sheet as a result of this acquisition are £1m and £8m, respectively. 
Acquisition of subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2008 
The Group acquired MTC Technologies, Inc. (MTC) in the US on 9 June 2008, Tenix Defence in Australia on 27 June 2008 and Detica Group 
plc (Detica) on 25 September 2008. If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2008, combined sales of Group and equity accounted 
investments would have been £19.0bn, revenue £17.2bn and profit for the year ended 31 December 2008 £1.8bn. 
MTC 
On 9 June 2008, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of MTC in the US for a cash consideration including transaction 
costs of $375m (£188m). Goodwill arising on consolidation amounted to £131m. 
Based in Dayton, Ohio, MTC provides technical and professional services, and equipment integration and modernisation for the US military 
and intelligence agencies. 
In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2008, MTC contributed revenue and loss after tax of £98m and £1m, respectively, to the 
Group’s consolidated results. 
The acquisition of MTC complements the existing US business in the Electronics, Intelligence & Support operating group. It allows for 
synergies in professional services, aircraft integration centres, and modification and sustainment. The opportunities presented by these 
circumstances do not translate to separately identifiable intangible assets, but represent much of the assessed value within the 
Electronics, Intelligence & Support operating group supporting the goodwill.

Tenix Defence 
Tenix Defence Holdings Pty Limited (Tenix Defence), a leading Australian defence contractor, comprises four businesses in the Land, 
Aerospace, Electronic Systems and Marine sector.  
On 27 June 2008, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Tenix Defence for a cash consideration including transaction 
costs paid of A$697m (£328m), subject to adjustment according to the level of working capital in the business at the acquisition date. 
In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2008, Tenix Defence contributed revenue, EBITA

 and loss after tax of £130m, £12m loss 
and £39m, respectively, to the Group’s consolidated results. Included within the loss after tax of £39m is an amortisation expense on 
intangible assets of £29m. 
The acquisition of Tenix Defence complements the existing Australian business enabling BAE Systems to establish a greater presence  
in the Australian defence market and in particular to expand into the Australian land and marine sectors. These opportunities do not 
translate into separately identifiable intangible assets, but represent much of the assessed value within Tenix Defence supporting the 
recognised goodwill.

Detica  
On 25 September 2008, the Group’s offer for the acquisition of Detica for £543m including assumption of net debt became wholly 
unconditional. Detica is a specialist business and technology consultancy with expertise in information exploitation, security and resilience, 
threat intelligence and customer insight. 
In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2008, Detica contributed revenue and profit after tax of £60m (UK £55m) and £1m, 
respectively, to the Group’s consolidated results. 
The acquisition of Detica provides access to UK and US government contracting opportunities in the intelligence, security and resilience 
market and significant cross-selling opportunities, particularly in our home markets. The combination of capabilities within Detica and 
BAE Systems will provide innovative solutions in this growing sector. The opportunities presented by these circumstances do not  
translate to separately identifiable intangible assets, but represent much of the assessed value within BAE Systems supporting the

Other acquisitions 
Other acquisitions included the acquisitions of 100% of the issued share capital of Tenix Toll Defence Logistics Pty Limited, formerly a joint 
venture between Tenix and Toll Holdings Pty Limited, for A$24m (£12m) and 100% of the issued share capital of IST Dynamics for £7m. As 
a result of these acquisitions, £7m of goodwill was generated in the year ended 31 December 2008. 
Certain of the fair values assigned to the net assets at the dates of acquisition were provisional, and in accordance with IFRS 3, Business 
Combinations, the Group has adjusted the fair values attributable to these acquisitions in the year ended 31 December 2009, resulting in a 
net increase in goodwill of £5m. This has not had a material impact on the consolidated accounts and, as such, the Group has not restated 
the balance sheet as at 31 December 2008.

Fair value of financial instruments 
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price at which one party would assume the rights and/or duties of another party. 
The fair values of financial instruments have been determined based on available market information at the balance sheet date, and  
the valuation methodologies listed below: 
– the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts are calculated by discounting the contracted forward values and translating at the 
appropriate balance sheet rates; 
– the fair value of both interest rate and cross-currency swaps are calculated by discounting expected future principal and interest cash 
flows and translating at the appropriate balance sheet rates; and 
– the fair value of loans and overdrafts has been estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate 
market-based interest rates prevailing at 31 December.  
Due to the variability of the valuation factors, the fair values presented at the balance sheet date may not be indicative of the amounts  
the Group would expect to realise in a current market environment.

Fair value hierarchy 
Effective 1 January 2009, the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, for financial instruments that 
are measured in the balance sheet at fair value. This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value 
measurement hierarchy: 
– Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  
– Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 
– Level 3 – Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

30. Financial risk management continued 
Collateral 
As shown above, the Group has entered into a number of financial derivative contracts to hedge certain long-term foreign currency and 
interest rate exposures. Cash collateral payments can be required to be made periodically to the counterparty dependent on the market 
value of these financial derivatives. Cash deposited in this way is treated as a non-current receivable and at 31 December 2009 totalled 
£11m (2008 £nil). 
Liquidity risk 
Cash flow forecasting is performed by each line of business as part of the Integrated Business Planning process and as part of the monthly 
reporting cycle. The Group monitors a rolling forecast of liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs 
while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities at all times so that it does not breach borrowing limits 
or covenants.  
Surplus cash held by the operating groups over and above balances required for working capital management is loaned to the Group’s 
centralised treasury department. Surplus cash is invested in interest bearing current accounts, term deposits, money market deposits and 
marketable securities, choosing instruments with appropriate maturities or sufficient liquidity to provide sufficient headroom as determined 
by the line of business cash forecasts.  
At 31 December 2009, the Group had a committed Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) of £1.455bn (2008 £1.5bn). The £45m commitment  
in the RCF from Lehman Brothers Commercial Paper Inc. was cancelled during 2009 following an all bank consent process. The RCF is 
contracted until 2012, although the available amount for the final year reduces to £1.3bn. The RCF remained undrawn throughout the year. 
Interest rate risk 
The objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations on borrowings and deposits 
through varying the proportion of fixed rate debt relative to floating rate debt over the forward time horizon by utilising derivative 
instruments, mainly interest rate swaps.  
The Group’s current interest rate management policy is that a minimum of 50% (2008 25%) and a maximum of 75% (2008 75%) of debt  
is maintained at fixed interest rates. At 31 December 2009, the Group had 62% (2008 73%) of fixed rate debt and 38% (2008 27%) of 
floating rate debt based on a gross debt of £3.3bn including debt-related derivative financial assets (2008 £2.6bn). 
The floating rate debt has been predominantly achieved by entering into interest rate swaps which swap the fixed rate US dollar interest 
payable on debt into either floating rate sterling or US dollars. At the end of 2009, the Group had a total of $1.9bn (2008 $1.3bn) of this 
type of swap outstanding with a weighted average duration of 4.2 years (2008 2.4 years). In respect of the fixed rate debt the weighted 
average period in respect of which interest is fixed was 6.4 years (2008 7 years). 
Given the level of short-term interest rates during the year, the average cost of the floating rate debt was 3.4% (2008 5.2%), 3.0% on  
US dollars and 2.3% on sterling (2008 3.5% on US dollars and 8% on sterling). The cost of the fixed rate debt was 6.3% (2008 6.8%).  
A change of 100 basis points in short-term rates applied to the average fixed/floating mix and level of borrowings would vary the interest 
cost to the Group by £12m (2008 £6m). 
In respect of cash deposits, given the fluctuation in the Group’s working capital requirements, cash is generally invested for short-term 
periods based at floating interest rates. A change of 100 basis points in the average interest rates during the year applied to the average 
cash deposits would vary the interest receivable by £17m (2008 £12m). 
Credit risk  
The Group is exposed to credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents to the extent of non-performance by its counterparties in respect  
of financial instruments. However, the Group has policies in place to ensure credit risk is limited by placing concentration limits. The  
Group has a credit limit system to manage actively its exposure to treasury counterparties. The cash and cash equivalents balance at  
31 December 2009 of £3,693m (2008 £2,624m) was invested with 26 (2008 14) financial institutions. The system assigns a maximum 
exposure based on the counterparty’s size, a composite credit rating and credit default swap price. These limits are regularly monitored  
and updated. The Group has material receivables due from the UK and US governments where credit risk is not considered to be an issue. 
For the remaining trade receivables no one counterparty constitutes more than 5% of the balance (2008 2%). 
The cash and cash equivalents of the Group are invested in non-speculative financial instruments which are usually highly liquid such  
as short-term deposits. The Group, therefore, believes it has reduced its exposure to credit risk through this process. 
Currency risk 
In order to protect itself against currency fluctuations, the Group’s policy is to hedge all material firm transactional exposures.  
The Group’s objective is to reduce its exposure to volatility in earnings and cash flows as a result of movements in foreign currency 
exchange rates. The Group is exposed to a number of foreign currencies, the most significant being the US dollar. 
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of foreign currency denominated transactions. To mitigate 
this risk, the Group’s policy is to hedge all material firm transactional exposures, unless otherwise approved as an exception by the Treasury 
Review Management Committee, as well as to manage anticipated economic cash flows over the medium term. The Group aims, where 
possible, to apply hedge accounting treatment for all derivatives that hedge material transactional foreign currency exposures. 
The Group is also exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of the translation of net assets and income statements 
of foreign subsidiaries and equity accounted investments. The Group does not hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the 
income statement or balance sheet of overseas subsidiaries and equity accounted investments it regards as long-term investments. Hedges 
are, however, undertaken in respect of investments that are not considered long-term or core to the Group.

The Group comprises a large number of subsidiary undertakings and it is not practical to include all of them in the above list. The list 
therefore only includes those subsidiary undertakings which principally affected the Group accounts.  
A full list of subsidiary, equity accounted investments and other associated undertakings as at 31 December 2009 will be annexed  
to the Company’s next annual return filed with the Registrar of Companies. 
No subsidiary undertakings are excluded from the Group consolidation. 
33. Events after the balance sheet date 
On 5 February 2010, the Group announced a global settlement with the US Department of Justice and the UK’s Serious Fraud Office in 
respect of investigations announced by these two authorities in 2007 and 2004, respectively. This is an adjusting event after the balance 
sheet date in accordance with IAS 10, Events after the Reporting Period, and, accordingly, the penalties totalling £278m have been reflected 
in the Group’s accounts for the year ended 31 December 2009. 
On 15 February 2010, the Group announced that it had been informed that the decision by the US Department of Defense not to award  
a follow-on contract for production of vehicles under the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) programme to BAE Systems had been 
confirmed. This is an adjusting event after the balance sheet date in accordance with IAS 10 and, accordingly, impairment of goodwill and 
other intangible assets amounting to £592m relating to the Armor Holdings, Inc. transaction and specifically the FMTV product line have 
been reflected in the Group’s accounts for the year ended 31 December 2009.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale 
financial assets, and financial assets and financial liabilities 
(including derivative instruments) at fair value through profit or  
loss, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in  
the United Kingdom (UK GAAP). The going concern basis has been 
applied in these accounts. 
In the Company’s accounts, all fixed asset investments (including 
subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures) are stated at cost (or 
valuation in respect of certain listed investments) less provisions  
for impairments. Dividends received and receivable are credited to 
the Company’s profit and loss account. In accordance with Section 
408(4) of the Companies Act 2006, the Company is exempt from the 
requirement to present its own profit and loss account. The amount 
of profit for the financial year of the Company is disclosed in note 12 
to these accounts. 
Relief under Sections 612 and 616 of the Companies Act 2006 is 
taken wherever possible. Accordingly, where such relief is available, 
the difference between the fair value and aggregate nominal value  
of shares is not recognised in either shareholders’ funds or cost  
of investment. 
Changes in accounting policies 
The following amendments to existing standards are applicable  
to the Company for the year ended 31 December 2009: 
– Amendments to FRS 2, Accounting for Subsidiary Undertakings, 
FRS 6, Acquisitions and Mergers, and FRS 28, Corresponding 
Amounts, update references to the Companies Act 2006 and  
the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Reports Regulations 
2008. These amendments have had no impact on the Company. 
– Amendments to FRS 8, Related Party Disclosures, reflects changes 
to the law introduced by the Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. This 
amendment is effective for accounting periods beginning on  
or after 6 April 2008. The Company is exempt from presenting 
FRS 8 disclosures as full equivalent disclosures are presented  
on a Group basis within the consolidated financial statements. 
– Amendments to FRS 20, Share-based Payment: Vesting Conditions 
and Cancellations, provide clarification on the vesting conditions 
which should be included in the grant date fair value for 
transactions with employees and others providing similar services. 
This has had no impact on the Company. 
– Amendments to FRS 29, Financial Instruments: Disclosures,  
require enhanced disclosures about fair value measurement  
and liquidity risk. The amendments require disclosure of fair  
value measurements by reference to a fair value measurement 
hierarchy. The Group’s consolidated financial statements for  
the year ended 31 December 2009 contain financial instrument 
disclosures which are consistent with the requirements of FRS 29, 
Financial Instruments: Disclosures. Consequently, the Company 
has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 29 not to present 
separate financial instrument disclosures for the Company. 
– Improvements to Financial Reporting Standards 2008. These 
improvements have had no impact on the Company. 
– Amendments to UITF Abstract 42 and FRS 26 – Embedded 
Derivatives, clarify the treatment of embedded derivatives and  
do not impact the Company. 
– UITF Abstract 46, Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign 
Operation. This has had no impact on the Company. 
The following amendments to existing standards are effective for the 
year ending 31 December 2010: 
– FRS 20, Share-based Payment – Group Cash-settled Share-based 
Payment Transactions;  
– FRS 25, Financial Instruments: Presentation; 
– Amendments to FRS 26, Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement – Eligible Hedged Items; and 
– Improvements to Financial Reporting Standards 2009. 
These amendments are not expected to have any impact on the 
Company’s accounts. 
Cash flow statement 
The Company is exempt under the terms of FRS 1 from the 
requirement to publish its own cash flow statement, as its cash flows 
are included within the consolidated cash flow statement of the Group. 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange 
rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the 
exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. These exchange 
differences are recognised in the profit and loss account unless they 
qualify for hedge accounting treatment, in which case the effective 
portion is recognised directly in a separate component of equity. 
Tangible fixed assets 
Depreciation is provided, normally on a straight-line basis, to write 
off the cost or valuation of tangible fixed assets over their estimated 
useful economic lives to any estimated residual value using the 
following rates: 
Buildings 
 
up to 50 years, or the 
lease term if shorter 
Computing equipment and short-life  
works equipment 
3 to 5 years 
 
No depreciation is provided on freehold land and assets in the 
course of construction. 
Impairment reviews are undertaken if there are indications that the 
carrying values may not be recoverable. 
Leases 
Assets obtained under finance leases are included in tangible fixed 
assets at cost and are depreciated over their useful economic lives, 
or the term of their lease, whichever is shorter. Future instalments 
under such leases, net of finance charges, are included within loans. 
Rental payments are apportioned between the finance element, 
which is charged as interest to the profit and loss account, and the 
capital element, which reduces the outstanding obligation for future 
instalments, so as to give a constant rate of charge on the 
outstanding obligation. 
Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the profit and 
loss account on a straight-line basis in arriving at operating profit. 
Investments 
The Company’s investment in shares in Group companies are stated 
at cost less provision for impairment. 
Tax 
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes 
account of taxation deferred because of timing differences between 
the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes. 
Deferred tax is recognised on an undiscounted basis in respect  
of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items  
for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not 
reversed by the balance sheet date where there is an obligation  
to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, in the future.   
  
BAE Systems Annual Report 2009 173
1. Accounting policies continued 
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits 
The Company contributes to Group pension plans operated in the 
UK. Details of the principal plans and the financial assumptions 
used are contained in the consolidated accounts of BAE Systems 
plc. As permitted by FRS 17, Retirement Benefits, the plans are 
accounted for as defined contribution plans, as the employer cannot 
identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the plans. 
The employer’s contributions are set in relation to the current service 
period and also to fund a series of agreed measures to address the 
pension scheme deficits. 
Share options and own shares held  
The Company issues equity-settled share options to Group 
employees. Equity-settled share options are measured at fair  
value at the date of grant using an option pricing model. The fair  
value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, 
based on the Company’s estimate of the number of shares that  
will actually vest. 
In accordance with UITF Abstract 25, National Insurance 
Contributions on Share Option Gains, the Company provides in full for 
the employer’s national insurance liability estimated to arise on the 
future exercise of share options granted, except where the employee 
has agreed to settle the employer’s national insurance liability as a 
condition of the grant of the options. 
As required under UITF Abstract 38, Accounting for ESOP Trusts, the 
cost to the Company of own shares held is shown as a deduction from 
shareholders’ funds within the profit and loss account. Consideration 
paid or received for the purchase or sale of the Company’s own 
shares in the ESOP trust is shown separately in the reconciliation  
of movements in shareholders’ funds. 
Dividends 
Equity dividends on ordinary share capital are recognised as a 
liability in the period in which they are declared. The interim dividend 
is recognised when it has been approved by the Board and the final 
dividend is recognised when it has been approved by the shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting.

Special Share 
One Special Share of £1 in the Company is held on behalf of the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills (the Special 
Shareholder). Certain parts of the Company’s Articles of Association cannot be amended without the consent of the Special Shareholder. 
These articles include the requirement that no foreign person, or foreign persons acting in concert, can have more than a 15% voting 
interest in the Company, the requirement that the majority of the directors are British, the requirement that decisions of the directors  
at their meetings, in their committees or via resolution must be approved by a majority of British directors and the requirement that the  
Chief Executive and any executive chairman are British citizens. The effect of these requirements can also be amended by regulations  
made by the directors and approved by the Special Shareholder. 
The Special Shareholder may require the Company at any time to redeem the Special Share at par or to convert the Special Share into  
one ordinary voting share. The Special Shareholder is entitled to receive notice of and to attend general meetings and class meetings  
of the Company’s shareholders but has no voting right, nor other rights, other than to speak in relation to any business in respect of the 
Special Share. 
Treasury shares 
As at 31 December 2009, 43,952,360 (2008 55,038,953) ordinary shares of 2.5p each with an aggregate nominal value of £1,098,809 
(2008 £1,375,974) were held in treasury. During 2009, 11,086,593 treasury shares were used to satisfy awards and options under the 
Share Incentive Plan and the Save-As-You-Earn Share Option Scheme. 
Authorised share capital 
As agreed by the shareholders at the 2009 Annual General Meeting, the Company’s Articles of Association were amended with effect from 
1 October 2009 to remove the requirement for the Company to have an authorised share capital, the concept of which was abolished under 
the Companies Act 2006.

Dividend mandate 
Shareholders can arrange to have their dividends paid directly into 
their bank or building society account, by completing a bank mandate 
form. The advantages to using this service are: 
– the payment is more secure than having a cheque sent by post; 
– it avoids the hassle of paying in a cheque; and 
– there is no risk of lost, stolen or out of date cheques. 
A mandate form can be obtained from our website, by contacting 
Equiniti, or you will find one attached to the tax voucher of your last 
dividend payment. Overseas shareholders can arrange for their 
dividends to be paid in their local currency and more information  
can be obtained from www.shareview.com/overseas 
Shareview service 
The Shareview service from our registrar, Equiniti, gives shareholders: 
– direct access to data held on their behalf on the share register 
including recent share movements and dividend details; and  
– the ability to change their address or dividend payment 
instructions online.  
To sign up for Shareview you need the ‘shareholder reference’ 
printed on your proxy form or dividend stationery. There is no charge 
to register. 
When you register with the site, you can register your preferred 
format (post or e-mail) for shareholder communications. If you select 
‘e-mail’ as your mailing preference, you will be sent shareholder 
communications, such as proxy forms and annual results, by e-mail 
instead of post, as long as this option is available. 
If you have your dividends paid straight to your bank account, and 
you have selected ‘e-mail’ as your mailing preference, you can also 
collect your tax voucher electronically. Instead of receiving the paper 
tax voucher, you will be notified by e-mail with details of how to 
download your electronic version. 
However, if you choose ‘post’ as your preference, you will be sent 
paper documents as usual. 
Visit the website at www.shareview.co.uk for more details. 
Details of software and equipment requirements are given on  
the website. 
Dividend reinvestment plan 
The Company offers holders of its ordinary shares the option to elect 
to have their dividend reinvested in shares purchased in the market 
instead of cash. If you would like to make this election, please 
request a dividend reinvestment plan mandate from our registrars:

Electronic shareholder communications 
Following approval of a resolution by shareholders at our 2007 
Annual General Meeting, the Company has been authorised to  
use electronic communications when sending information to our 
shareholders, as permitted by the Companies Act 2006. Using 
electronic communications helps us reduce the environmental 
impact of our business by limiting the amount of paper we use  
and assists us in managing our costs. We periodically consult  
with shareholders to check how they wish to receive information  
from us and a shareholder is taken to have agreed to website 
communications if a response has not been received. 
Any document or information required to be sent to shareholders  
is made available on the Company’s website and a notification of 
availability is sent. Shareholders who receive such a notification are 
entitled to request a hard copy of the document at any time and may 
also change the way they receive communications at any time by 
contacting Equiniti.   
 
BAE Systems Annual Report 2009 183
Shareholders may receive electronic communications in one  
of two ways: 
– via e-mail – This option is available though Shareview. 
Shareholders will receive an e-mail notification when a new 
document is made available; or 
– via our website – Shareholders will receive a notification by  
post when a new document is made available. 
Notwithstanding any election, the Company may, at its sole  
and absolute discretion, send any notification or information  
to shareholders in hard copy form. 
Warning to shareholders – boiler room scams 
Many companies have become aware that their shareholders have 
received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning 
investment matters. These are typically from overseas based ‘brokers’ 
who target UK shareholders, offering to sell them what often turn out 
to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments. These 
operations are commonly known as ‘boiler rooms’. These ‘brokers’  
can be very persistent and extremely persuasive. 
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, 
offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports.  
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice: 
– make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation;  
– check that they are properly authorised by the Financial Services 
Authority (FSA) before getting involved by visiting 
www.fsa.gov.uk/register ;  
– report the matter to the FSA either by calling 0845 606 1234 or 
visiting www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk; and 
– if the calls persist, hang up.  
If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will not be eligible  
to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation 
Scheme. The FSA can be contacted by completing an online form at 
www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/doing/regulated/law/alerts/overseas.shtml 
Details of any share dealing facilities that the Company endorses  
will be included in Company mailings. 
More detailed information on this or similar activity can be found  
on the FSA website www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk

NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
This year’s Annual General Meeting will be
held at 11:00am on 5 May 2010
at The Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre,
London SW1P 3EE
REAL PERFORMANCE. REAL ADVANTAGE.
This document includes the Notice of Meeting which sets out the
resolutions that shareholders are being asked to consider and vote on.
These resolutions are a very important part of the governance of the
Company and all shareholders are urged to vote, whether they are able
to attend the meeting or not.
The Board supports all of the resolutions to be put to the AGM.
You can vote on the resolutions put to shareholders either online or by
post as follows:
– Online – if you have accessed this notice electronically, you simply
need to click on the electronic voting icon on the Shareholder
Reporting website at www.baesystems.com/reporting/.
– By post – if you received the 2009 Report & Accounts, or a
notification that this is available to be viewed on our website, you will
also have received a proxy card. Instructions on voting can be found
on the proxy card.
It is good practice for companies to take a poll on all resolutions put to
shareholders and the Company has used such polls for a number of
years. This allows all shareholders to have their votes recognised
whether or not they are able to attend the meeting.
The results of the voting on the resolutions will be posted on the
Company’s website after the meeting.
If you are unable to attend the meeting, but have any questions on the
business to be discussed at the AGM, we would like to hear from you
ahead of the meeting. We will provide responses to the most frequently
raised topics and post these on our website as well as making them
available at the AGM. If you have received a paper copy of this notice,
you will have received a card you can use to ask such a question.
Shareholders reading this online will be able to submit a question via
the Shareholder Reporting website.
A buffet lunch will be provided for shareholders attending the AGM.

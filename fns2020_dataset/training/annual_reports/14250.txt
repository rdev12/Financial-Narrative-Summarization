Staff engagement
We encourage employees to promote best practice. Information and two
way consultation ensures that employees’ views are heard and considered
in relation to business issues. Numerous internal employee groups have
been formulated. An example being the Health and Safety Committee
that comprises senior staff, managers and staff to promote safe
working practices. 
The forum provides an opportunity for representatives from each area of
the business to meet with the aim of sharing information and discussing
business issues, and most importantly to submit employees ideas for
improvement. The forum works by representatives consulting with
their team to seek views that are then discussed and communicated
to the Board.
The Board is fully committed to ensuring the success of all employees
and trading divisions, by encouraging employees to express their views
in the full knowledge that confidentiality is of utmost importance.

SAFE – Trained to be better
SAFE (Silverdell Academy for Excellence) was born out of
the idea that the training for Asbestos Removal Operatives
was confined to three days to learn about all aspects of
the industry. The CSCS (Construction Skills Certification
Scheme) does not accredit asbestos removal training, 
and to date, the industry has relied on Regulatory
Guidelines (EH247).
As we see this, our Operatives and Supervisors needed 
to understand more about the structure of the building,
necessary safety aspects, how to deal with such a
hazardous waste product, compliance with the increasing
regulatory requirement and be in a position to make the
best recommendations about approach to a client on site.
To address this, we developed a modular, skill based
training system which is flexible, designed for our industry
needs to meet your needs. The training that is much wider
than current regulatory requirements enables our people 
to focus on enhanced levels of efficiency, lower levels of
defects, full compliance with regulations and at a lower
cost.
Accreditation:
The SAFE programme has been accredited by ARCA, 
is being assessed under the NVQ system to provide 
a standard level of qualification, and receiving a warm
welcome from all current regulatory bodies.
Developing SAFE to serve you:
The requirements of CAR 2006 (Control of Asbestos
Regulations) requires employees and the supply chain 
to have appropriate training to ensure they understand
their roles, responsibilities and how to approach them 
in accordance with the Management Plan, a regulatory
requirement. In response, we devised a ‘unique’ mobile
training facility that can deliver training where it is needed,
when it is needed and to who needs it most.
These facilities are an industry first, providing the ability 
for us to tailor your staff training to your needs in the
context of the work you undertake.
The benefits:
● Improved Health & Safety performance at your facilities
● Improve customer satisfaction, and better compliance
● Improved productivity, lower defects
● Consistency which is cost effective, for the client 
and contractor.

73888 PRE  10/1/08  16:02  Page 11 I am pleased to report the results for the year

In a year of highly satisfactory progress, the group
recorded a profit before tax of £2.2m on turnover 
of £38.5m. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation,
amortisation and share based payment charge 
were £5.1m.
Basic earnings per ordinary share were 2.4 pence and
adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share (based on
profit after tax adjusted for goodwill amortisation, share
based payments and finance charges on deferred
consideration) were 7.9 pence per ordinary share.
The directors do not recommend the payment 
of a dividend.
Following the acquisition of Redhill Analysts Limited,
Kitsons Group Limited and Swift (Asbestos) Holdings
Limited, the Company has achieved its initial strategic
goal: the nationwide provision of the full range of
asbestos services under three leading brands.
We are indebted to each and every group employee, 
all of whom have worked incredibly hard during our first
full year as a listed company. The work ethic instilled by
the senior management has been a major factor in our
success, aided by our ability to grant share options to
key staff as an additional incentive.
We have also strengthened the board during the year
and welcomed Chris Sims as Group Finance Director.
Chris was previously Finance Director of Brandon Hire
PLC and brings valuable experience in group reporting
and integration, investor relations, and mergers and
acquisitions. We are very appreciative of the efforts of
Simon Gunn who had been handling the group finance
function until Chris’s appointment; Simon continues as
Finance Director of Silverdell (UK) Limited.
We also appreciate the support shown by our
shareholders who have seen our share price double
since the original acquisition, Silverdell (UK) Limited, 
in July 2006.

potential ahead for the further development
of our company.

Non-Executive Chairman
73888 PRE  9/1/08  16:46  Page 13 This is the first full year’s trading of Silverdell Plc after its
admission to AIM as Bow Lane Capital Plc in April 2006
and the acquisition of Silverdell (UK) Limited in July 2006.
It has been a year of substantial development in line
with our stated strategy of providing a nationwide 
“one-stop-shop” for asbestos services.
At 30 September 2006, the group comprised Silverdell
(UK) Limited (“Silverdell (UK)”), one of the largest and
best known asbestos remediation businesses, with a
relatively small consulting division. Based in the South
East, but with offices in the Midlands, Yorkshire and
South Wales, Silverdell (UK) provided the platform for
future expansion.
Silverdell (UK) has had another record year in its first
year as part of the quoted group. Turnover increased 
by 42% to £30.5m and operating profit by 369% to
£4.6m, before a share of central costs. This was an
excellent performance, well ahead of expectations and
reflects the professionalism and dynamism of the people
in the business. Silverdell (UK) won the Construction
News Award for Asbestos Contractor of the Year for the
second year running in May 2007 and the Contract
Journal Award for SME Contractor of the Year in
October 2007, demonstrating the high regard in which
the company is held amongst its customers and peers.
Silverdell (UK) continues to develop long-term
relationships with its customer base. It has built an
enviable record of professionalism and service that 
is second to none in the industry and continues to 
win business from new customers such as Marks 
& Spencer and Shell.
Silverdell (UK) devotes significant time and resource
to health and safety and training. The company has
an exemplary record in respect of Health & Safety
Executive (“HSE”) inspections and Silverdell (UK)’s
Health & Safety Director has recently been appointed to
a group role in order to extend best practice to all group
companies. During the year, we introduced an industry
first – a fully equipped mobile training suite that can be
taken to customers’ sites to provide training with
minimum disruption.
Redhill Analysts Limited (“Redhill Analysts”) was
acquired by Silverdell Plc in December 2006. Redhill
Analysts is an asbestos and environmental consultancy
business whose turnover principally arises from
asbestos surveys, on-site air monitoring of remediation
activities and the provision of asbestos management
plans. In the nine month period since its acquisition
Redhill Analysts turnover was £4.5m and its operating
profit was £0.7m before a share of central costs. This
was slightly behind expectations, caused by the market
being somewhat slower in the summer months and the
requirement to add resource in anticipation of growth in
2007/08, which is underpinned by the very recent client
win of Thames Water.
Redhill Analysts is a very well known and respected
name in asbestos consultancy and has been a
prominent member of the Asbestos Removal
Contractors Association for a number of years. 
It has UKAS and ISO accreditation. 
Since the acquisition, there has been an increasing
trend towards joint tendering and sharing of information
between the group companies. Redhill Analysts is
benefiting from such opportunities and some large
contracts started in the autumn.
On 31 July 2007, Silverdell Plc acquired Kitsons Group
Limited, the ultimate owner of Kitsons Environmental
Europe Limited (“Kitsons”). Kitsons specialises in
asbestos remediation in the nuclear, industrial and
petrochemical sectors; with a head office in the North
West and branch offices in the Midlands, the North
East, and Scotland, it complements the group offering
well. The group now has branch representation
throughout the UK. 
Kitsons has some very long standing customer
relationships, built on reliable and high quality service
delivery, as well as significant visibility of income by
virtue of several long-term preferred supplier
relationships. The company has been successful in
recent asbestos remediation related tenders for nuclear
power station decommissioning and has recently
commenced work at Chapelcross; it is well positioned
to win further tenders due within the next twelve

months. Additionally, Kitsons carries out
corrosion remediation for large blue-chip
clients and has a scaffolding business,
principally for in-house purposes.
Trading in the two months that Kitsons has
been in the group has been very satisfactory
and in line with expectations, with turnover
of £3.7m and operating profit of £0.3m
before a share of central costs.
Kitsons has full ISO accreditation (ISO 9001,
ISO 14001 and ISO 18001) and an excellent
track record with the HSE.
On 1 October 2007, Silverdell (UK) acquired
Swift Asbestos (Holdings) Limited (“Swift”),
in line with our strategy of acquiring
earnings enhancing businesses that
complement our existing offering. Based 
in Southampton, where Silverdell (UK) had
no market presence, Swift specialises in
asbestos remediation in the hotel sector.
Swift has been rebranded “Silverdell” and
has been successfully integrated into
Silverdell (UK).
There are substantial opportunities to
leverage the benefits of the new group
structure over the forthcoming months. We
have already submitted tenders for work on
a group basis and this approach has been
well received in the market place. Work is
underway on cost synergies with some early
gains already in the areas of equipment hire
and insurance.
The asbestos services market continues 
to look favourable and the group is uniquely
placed to take advantage of this in terms 
of both organic growth and further
acquisitions, if and when the right
opportunities arise.

Directors’ Report
for the year ended 30 September 2007
73888 PRE  9/1/08  12:00  Page 18 Employee involvement
By means of formal announcements and informal discussions, the group has a policy of keeping employees informed
of all matters that concern them so that employees’ views can be taken into account when making decisions that
affect their interests.
Post Balance Sheet Events
Full disclosure of post balance sheet events is given in note 24 to the accounts.
Creditor payment policy
The group’s policy concerning payment of suppliers is either to agree terms of payment at the start of business with
each supplier or to ensure that the supplier is made aware of the group’s standard payment terms and in either case to
pay in accordance with its contractual or other obligations. The average number of days credit taken at 30 September
2007 was 52 days (2006: 38 days).
Financial Risk Management
It is, and has been throughout the year, the group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the group’s activities are credit, interest rate and liquidity risks. The policies for managing
each of these risks are summarised below.
Credit risk
The group’s principal financial assets are bank balances, trade and other receivables and amounts receivable from
clients under contracts.
The group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and contract receivables. The amounts presented in the
balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is 
an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the
cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by
international credit-rating agencies.
The group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties
and customers.
Interest rate risk
The group finances its operations through a mixture of equity and bank borrowings. The group borrows only in sterling, 
at both fixed and floating rates of interest to meet short term funding requirements and for financing acquisitions.
At the year end the group had finance leases/hire purchase agreements at fixed interest rates, and a bank overdraft at
floating interest rates. The long term bank loans were at both a rate fixed by an interest rate swap, and at floating rate.
The group’s policy is to review interest rate risks regularly in relation to their materiality compared to other operational risks.
Liquidity risk
The group only requires borrowings at certain times. The short term flexibility required is achieved by overdraft facilities.
The group has negotiated additional bank facilities to enable it to expand by acquisition and also to increase its
banking facilities for day to day purposes.
Foreign currency risk
The group does not have significant exposure to foreign currency risk.
Auditors
Each of the persons who is a director at the date of approval of this report confirms that:
● So far as the director is aware, there is no relevant information of which the company’s auditors are unaware; and
● The director has taken all reasonable steps that he ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the company’s auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of s234ZA of the Companies
Act 1985.
The company’s auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP , have expressed their wish to remain in office, and a resolution that
they be re-appointed will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

73888 PRE  9/1/08  12:00  Page 19 The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors
have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). The financial statements are required by law to
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the group and of the profit or loss of the group 
for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
● select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
● make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
● state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
● prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company
will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on
the company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities

Independent Auditors’ Report
To the members of Silverdell PLC
We have audited the group and parent company financial statements (the “financial statements’’) of Silverdell Plc for
Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Total Recognised
Gains and Losses and the related notes 1 to 25. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies
Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we
are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, 
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information
given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding
directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed. 
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report, as described in the contents section, and consider
whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. We consider the implications for our report if we 
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our
responsibilities do not extend to any further information outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the 
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments 
made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the group’s and company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion 
we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
● the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of the state of the group’s and the parent company’s affairs as at 30 September 2007 
and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
● the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
● the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.

Consolidated Cash Flow Statement
for the year ended 30 September 2007
73888 PRE  9/1/08  12:00  Page 24 Accounting convention
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with 
applicable laws and UK accounting standards. A summary of the principal accounting policies, which have 
been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding period, is set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and all its subsidiary
undertakings made up from the date of acquisition to 30 September 2007. Subsidiary undertakings are accounted 
for using the acquisition method.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisition represents the difference between the fair value of net assets acquired and the fair value
of the consideration given. Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised within fixed assets in the year in which it arises
and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life which is taken to be 20 years. Provision is made for
any impairment.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered)
using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet
date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in
the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the group’s taxable
profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax
assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only to the extent that, on the basis of all
available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the
future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be
rolled over, being charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing
differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Turnover
Turnover represents amounts receivable for services, excluding value added tax. Turnover is recognised in the
accounting period in which the related services are provided. Profit is recognised on long-term contracts, if the final
outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty, by including in the profit and loss account turnover and related
costs as contract activity progresses. Turnover is calculated by reference to the value of work performed to date as 
a proportion of the total contract value.
25
Accounting Policies
73888 NOTES  9/1/08  12:10  Page 25 Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. 
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life.
Leasehold property 10% on cost
Plant and machinery 10% on cost
Office equipment 16.6-25% on cost
Motor vehicles 25% on reducing balance
Stocks and Work in progress 
Work in progress is valued at the lower of direct cost plus an estimate of attributable overheads and net realisable
value. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred in the period 
to completion.
Long term contracts
Long term contract work in progress is stated at cost plus, where the outcome can be assessed with reasonable
certainty, estimated profits attributable to the stage of completion less provision for any anticipated losses and progress
payments received on account. Amounts recoverable on long-term contracts, which are included in debtors, are stated
at the net sales value of the work done less amounts received as progress payments on account. Excess progress
payments are included in creditors as payments on account. Cumulative costs incurred net of amounts transferred to
cost of sales, less provision for contingencies and anticipated future losses on contracts, are included as long-term
contract balances in stock.
Leased assets
Assets acquired under finance lease or hire purchase agreements with similar characteristics to owned assets are
capitalised and depreciated over the same period as equivalent owned assets and liabilities are set up for the capital
portions of the instalments. The interest portions of the instalments are charged to the profit and loss account in the
periods in which they fall due. Rentals on operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account in the periods 
to which they relate.
Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost (being purchase consideration and incidental costs) less provision
for any permanent diminution in value.
Pensions
The group operates an insured money purchase pension scheme. The group’s contributions are charged to the profit
and loss account each month and paid over to the scheme’s insurers by the end of the following month.
Share-based payment
The group has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based Payment.
The group issues share options to certain employees. Share options are measured at fair value (excluding the effect 
of non market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the share
options is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the group’s estimate of shares that will
eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
26
Accounting Policies continued
73888 NOTES  9/1/08  12:10  Page 26 Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes pricing model. The expected life used in the model has been
adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for behavioural considerations. The inputs into the Black-Scholes
model were: Weighted average Share Price: 95.0p, Exercise price: 95.0p, Vesting period: 3 years, Expected dividend
yield: Nil, Risk free interest rate: 5.22%, Volatility: 21. The volatility was determined by calculating the historical 
volatility of the company’s share price since it was admitted to the Alternative Investment Market.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the group after
deducting all of its liabilities.
27
73888 NOTES  9/1/08  12:10  Page 27 1 Segmental reporting
Principally, all turnover and profits derive from asbestos remediation and consulting and associated activities 
within the UK, and consequently no segmental or geographical analysis is presented.

The tax charge in future periods may be affected by changes in the UK tax legislation.
The group earns its profits primarily in the UK. Therefore the tax rate used for tax on profit on ordinary activities
is the standard rate for UK corporation tax, currently 30 per cent.
The group’s planned level of capital investment is expected to remain at similar levels of investment. Therefore,
it expects to be able to claim allowances in excess of depreciation in future years, at a similar level to the
current year.

As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account of the parent company
is not presented as part of these accounts. The parent company’s loss for the year was £1,629,000
(27 week period to 30 September 2006: loss £244,000).
8 Earnings per share
Basic earnings/(loss) per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the
weighted average number of ordinary shares in existence during the period.
Diluted earnings/(loss) per share is calculated as basic earnings per share adjusted to include dilutive potential
ordinary shares where fair value price exceeds option price, relating firstly to shares allotted under employee share
schemes and secondly to a warrant to Marwyn Neptune Fund LP .
Adjusted earnings per share is based on the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders, the share based
payment charge, amortisation of intangible assets, and finance charges on deferred consideration.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below:

Borrowing facilities
As at 30 September 2007, the group had an undrawn committed revolving credit facility of £6,000,000 and 
an overdraft facility of £2,000,000, all of which expires within one year.
The group’s bank overdraft and loan facilities are secured by debentures over the assets of the group. The
debenture agreement includes a fixed and floating charges over the assets of the group. Finance lease 
liabilities are secured on the assets to which the contracts relate.
The bank loan is at both fixed and variable rates of interest. £5,000,000 is subject to an interest rate swap; the
amount amortises by £250,000 per quarter and the rate on the amortised amount is fixed at 5.8%. The remainder
of the loan is at a variable rate over LIBOR. The overdraft is at variable rate over Bank base rate. The debentures
agreement includes a fixed and floating charges over the assets of the group. The finance leases are at variable
rates of interest. The weighted average interest rate on the fixed rate facilities is 5.8% for a weighted average
period of 4 years. No interest is payable on the deferred consideration.
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities
The following table provides a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the group’s
financial assets and financial liabilities at 30 September 2006 and 2007. Fair value is the amount at which a
financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction between informed and willing parties, 
other that a forced or liquidation sale, and excludes accrued interest. Where available, market values have been
used to determine fair values. Set out below the table is a summary of the methods and assumption used for 
each category of financial instrument.

Summary of methods and assumptions
Short term deposits and borrowings The fair value of short term deposits, loans and overdrafts
approximates to the carrying amount because of the short
maturity of these instruments
Interest rate swap Fair value is based on market price of comparable
instruments at the balance sheet date
As explained on page 19, the group’s policy is to hedge interest rate risk using interest swaps.
The table below shows the extent to which the company has off-balance sheet (unrecognised) losses in respect
of financial instruments used as hedges at the beginning and end of the year. It also shows the amount of such
gains and losses which have been included in the profit and loss account for the year and those gains and losses
which are expected to be included in the profit and loss account of subsequent years. The company has no
on-balance sheet (deferred) gains or losses.
All the gains and losses on the hedging instruments are expected to be matched by losses and gains on the
hedged transactions or positions.

Under the terms of the acquisition agreements in respect of Silverdell (UK) Limited and of Redhill Analysts Limited,
there is provision for the payments of deferred consideration.
The acquisition in agreement of Silverdell (UK) Limited provides for a payment of up to £6m in two equal tranches
depending on certain performance criteria of Silverdell (UK) Limited in the years ended 30 September 2007 
and 2008. The amount due of £3m in respect of year ended 30 September 2007 has been included in 
current liabilities. The deferred consideration may be satisfied by the issue of loan notes and ordinary shares 
in equal proportions.
In accordance with the requirements of FRS 25 this has been discounted back to its present value at the date of
acquisition. The discount is treated as a finance charge as time elapses until the date the consideration is paid.
The discount rate chosen is 8.5%.
The vendors of Redhill Analysts Limited may be paid up to £1.5m to be satisfied by £1.125m in cash and
£375,000 in issue of ordinary shares based on certain performance criteria in the year to 31 December 2007.
The directors consider that the performance criteria will not be met, and consequently no provision or liability
has been recognised.
The provision for deferred taxation in both years is entirely in respect of accelerated capital allowances and
share-based payment charge. This is not discounted.
In 2006, the group recorded a provision of £1.0m in respect of a contingent liability arising on the acquisition 
of Silverdell (UK) Limited as required by UK accounting standards. The company has a corresponding asset
relating to the indemnities from the vendors of Silverdell (UK) Limited in respect of this provision.

Equity-settled share option scheme
The company has a share option scheme for certain employees of the group. Options are exercisable at a price
equal to the average quoted market price of the company’s shares on the date of grant. The vesting period is 
three years. If the options remain unexercised after a period of five years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the group before the options vest.

The options outstanding at 30 September 2007 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 6.01 years.
In 2007, options over 415,000 shares were granted on 4 January 2007; over 150,000 shares on 12 June 2007;
and over 350,000 shares on 25 September 2007. The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options
granted on those dates is £1.27m. In 2006, options were granted on 19 July 2006. The aggregate of the
estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates is £2.26m.
The inputs into the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model are as follows:

Weighted average share price 95p 80.5p
Weighted average exercise price 95p 80.5p
Expected volatility 21.04 21
Expected life 3 Years 3 Years
Risk-free rate 5.22% 5.19%
Expected dividend yield 0% 0%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the group’s share price over the 
previous 1.5 years. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best
estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.

73888 NOTES  9/1/08  12:10  Page 44 By the very nature of our work, improving the quality of the environment in
which we live is significant. We assist clients in making informed decisions 
in relation to the wider environmental impacts and responsibilities. Client
benefits include reducing wasted resources consumed in management,
design, production and the costs of change, a critical aspect of planning.
We comply with all relevant legal obligations and regulations concerning the
environment, successfully adopting an approach of continuous improvement to
environmental protection measures. ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 accreditations
have been achieved throughout the group. Detailed environmental assessments
and environmental method statements are undertaken as part of the planning
process.
Silverdell seek to minimise energy costs throughout, and keep waste materials to 
a minimum. We are passionate about recycling embracing WRAP principles where
possible, and dispose of waste by the safest & most responsible means available
so as to reduce the environmental impact. We are committed to working
considerately and sensitively at all site destinations.
Planning: Produced effective asbestos management plans for many corporate
bodies within the public, private and industrial sectors on existing buildings,
infrastructure and on brownfield sites.
Energy: Water savers (Hippos and percussion taps) have been installed at main
offices. Time delayed lighting at main offices reduces energy consumption.
Vehicles: Our modern vehicles are pooled, we have a journey policy, and vehicle
management and maintenance is stringent. Vehicles are changed at 3 years or
100,000 miles. Responsible driving is actively encouraged corporately.
Plant: An extensive portfolio of plant is maintained both in-house, and through
approved suppliers. The need for the hiring of inefficient plant, upon which our
operators may be unfamiliar is reduced. Current and historic maintenance records
are retained to confirm compliance with manufacturers instructions.
Recycling: Metal frames for enclosures are used in preference to traditional
wooden frames that have to be discarded at the end of every job. Paper is
conserved, utilising the reverse side for all uses where there is no presentation 
to an external client.
Technology: Silverdell have developed innovative audio/visual technologies new 
to the industry designed to reduce potential exposure to asbestos and reduce
potential spread of fibres resulting from people entering a contaminated area.
Partnering: Where longer term frameworks can be established we achieve
reductions in cost, time, accidents and defects, whilst increasing the predictability
of cost and time, productivity and profitability for clients, through better
understanding of partner/client wants and needs.
Reducing Carbon Emissions:
Silverdell are committed to reducing our carbon footprint, and have invested 
in green belt land in Keeston, Kent, where 7000 native sapling trees have been
planted. The project provided the opportunity for local primary schools to plant
trees and learn about the natural environment – an initiative supported by the
Forestry commission and RSPB.
Silverdell are committed to investing in new sustainable plantations with the number
of saplings planted proportionate to volume of trade. Projects working with clients
have also born fruit designed to reduce the effects of carbon emissions.

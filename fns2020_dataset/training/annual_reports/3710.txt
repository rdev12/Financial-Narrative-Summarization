Chairman’s Statement
The results for the financial year ended 30 September 2005
reflect a continuation of the trends seen at the half year
with turnover 120% ahead of the previous financial year, a
record for Cobra of £7.7m (2004: £3.5m). The contracted
forward order book for the financial year 2006 currently
stands at £5.0m (Jan 2005: £2.7m). 
In 2005 Cobra generated £0.6m cash from operations (2004:
£2.0m outflow), a loss before tax of £0.4m (2004: £2.3m) and
after tax of £0.3m (2004: £2.4m loss). In the second half of
the financial year the Group traded profitably and was cash
generative. Cash at bank (inc short term deposits) at the end
of the financial year stood at £3.0m (2004: £3.2m), up from
£2.6m as at 31 March 2005, despite a further £0.8m of
capital investment in the year (2004: £3.2m).
This improvement came from our focus on North America,
which provided 79% of turnover (2004: 31%) reflecting the
region’s dominant position in the global biotechnology
market. Further investment in business development is
underway to increase Cobra’s penetration of this vitally
important market. Investment in manufacturing staff is also
ongoing to underpin the growing forward order book with
increased headcount at both the Keele and Oxford facilities.
The recruitment of internationally experienced senior
managers has also been completed to ensure that the
expanding capability is directed to meet the highest
regulatory standards in both the US and the EU.
We are also in discussions with two major customers
concerning their longer term requirements for Phase III
materials and commercial supply, which could have a direct
bearing on the scale and shape of any new capacity that
may become necessary, and in this regard facilities have
been identified in both Europe and North America. We
continue to review opportunities to expand our service
offering and a thorough review of potential partners in
Europe and North America is nearing completion.
During the year the Executive Directors have undertaken a
comprehensive risk assessment exercise. The allocation of
responsibility for each risk and its management is now
underway. A regular risk review will form part of the annual
cycle of governance procedures. 
Cobra has made a strong recovery in response to the
challenges faced in 2004, leading to a profit in the second
half of 2005. The Group has demonstrated its resilience,
flexibility and professionalism by widening its range of
services, increasing penetration of the North American
market and positioning itself to benefit from the growth in
demand for biopharmaceuticals and the contributions of all
employees in achieving this outcome are fully recognised. 
Cobra is now poised to move into the next stage of its
development as a profitable and leading provider of
specialist biomanufacturing services to the global
marketplace, based upon longer term supply agreements
with customers and agreements for products moving into
late stage development.

Chief Executive’s Review
Cobra’s business is the provision of manufacturing expertise
to accelerate the clinical development of our clients’
experimental drug candidates. Recently Cobra has
successfully adapted to a rapidly expanding market for these
specialist services evidenced by an average growth in
turnover of 45% over the past four reporting periods. The
strategy underpinning this growth has been our sales focus
in the North American market and broadening our offering
to cover manufacture of all types of biopharmaceuticals.
Cobra’s major client base, comprising 90% of turnover, is
small to medium sized biotech product development
companies. The appetite for investment in such companies
continues, particularly in North America and the prospects
for Cobra’s sustained expansion are encouraging.
Geographic Trends 
North America continues to dominate the biotechnology
industry both in terms of product development and global
investment. Penetration of the North American market is a
key target for Cobra and the focus of the sales and
marketing effort in this territory led to a 460% increase in
turnover during 2005 to £6.1m (2004: £1.1m). This represents
79% of turnover (2004: 31% 2003: 24%). Cobra now has
three sales staff operating in North America centred in the
West Coast, Mid West and East Coast biotechnology hubs.
Because of our location, the UK and Continental Europe
remain important potential markets for Cobra. However the
funding environment in Europe for small biotechnology
companies, particularly start-ups, is extremely tight and
turnover in these territories has dropped by 36% and 20%
respectively compared with 2004. Given the opening up of
the IPO market and other investment trends we expect that
the European market for Cobra’s services will increase over
the coming financial year.
Protein Products
Protein products dominate the world market for
biopharmaceuticals. The recent outstanding success of
biopharmaceutical based medicines (with current sales of
$60.0bn*) continues with the introduction of a number of
recent blockbuster products (e.g. Herceptin, Avastin,
Remicade and Humira). Growth of the biopharmaceuticals
market is double that of the conventional drugs’ market and
is driving further investment in the search for new protein
drugs. Development of this type of medicine has become
and will remain the major potential market for Cobra’s
services. Cobra has over ten years of technical experience in
the development of both microbial and mammalian protein
products. Over the past year turnover from protein
production has grown by 473% to £3.2m (2004: £0.6m) and
now constitutes 41% of sales (2004: 16% 2003: 26%). The
worldwide market for biomanufacturing services the
majority of which is protein manufacture is approaching
$2.0bn** and the market for supply of early stage products
$460m**. Cobra is successfully building a track record in this
expanding market by offering specialised manufacturing
services where the production process is non-standard and
development requires the application of innovative science. 
Virus Products
Turnover from virus manufacture has continued to expand,
up 78% compared with 2004. Virus manufacture is highly
specialised requiring specifically designed containment
facilities and expertise in the production of each particular
virus type. Over the past two years Cobra has gained
expertise in the manufacture of all the major types of
genetically engineered virus being developed for medical
intervention and this puts the Group in a strong position to
compete globally for large scale virus manufacturing
programmes. Another attraction of the virus business is that
relatively modest capacity is required to manufacture
commercial quantities of many virus products. Cobra has
already invested in such capacity and we are able to offer a
highly competitive ‘clone to market’ development package
in a relatively small but potentially profitable market.

Chief Executive’s Review
DNA Products
After experiencing a rapidly declining trading environment
in 2004, the manufacture of DNA products recovered
throughout 2005 by an impressive 32% but is still below the
level reached in 2003. We expect turnover from DNA
manufacturing to remain at this level in the short term.
Cell Products
Cell products are medicines where the active principle is a
bacterial cell itself, unlike Cobra’s other microbial products
which are products purified from such cells. In November
2005 we announced a long term manufacturing agreement
with Advaxis Inc, which gives Cobra an option on the
commercial manufacture of Advaxis’ products. Cobra also
owns a product development platform, called ORT-VAC,
which we continue to develop in collaboration with DSTL
(UK Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton
Down). Earlier in the year Cobra and DSTL scientists jointly
published a paper in the prestigious peer reviewed journal
Infection and Immunity demonstrating that in a pre-clinical
model a single dose of an ORT-VAC based vaccine can
protect against a lethal plague challenge.
Regulatory Environment
Cobra’s major source of income is from the supply of drugs
for clinical evaluation. In order to assure patient safety, the
manufacture of commercially marketed pharmaceutical
products is governed by a code of Good Manufacturing
Practice referred to as cGMP. Under the EU Clinical Trials
Directive enacted in July 2004, products for all clinical
evaluation must also be manufactured under full cGMP.
These standards must be met regardless of the subsequent
regulatory destination of the products manufactured and
compliance to these standards can account for more than
50% of the manufacturing cost. During 2005 I am pleased to
report that Cobra’s Keele and Oxford facilities underwent a
comprehensive review by the GMP Inspectorate of the UK
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency
(MHRA), and our licences were subsequently reaccredited for
the manufacture of all major types of biopharmaceutical.
Outlook for Cobra’s Services
Our market is small to medium sized public and well
established private biotechnology companies, which do not
possess the specialised manufacturing capacity required to
develop their products. Cobra is now working with several
companies whose products are showing much promise in the
clinic and the expectation is that these products will be
rapidly commercialised. Our corporate objective is to become
a manufacturing partner of these companies as their
products approach and gain regulatory approval.
A major step in Cobra’s development in 2005 was the
agreement with Auxilium Pharmaceuticals Inc on the
manufacture of their lead development product for Phase III
clinical trials (penultimate to commercialisation) and a long
term commercial manufacturing agreement with Advaxis
Inc. These agreements are an indication of how Cobra is
making progress towards its corporate goal of becoming a
major manufacturer of marketed biopharmaceutical
products.

North American turnover contributed £6.1m of the total in
2005 (2004: £1.1m) or 79%. This more than compensates for
the decline in turnover in all other territories. Turnover for
the UK stood at £1.3m (2004: £2.0m), Continental Europe
£0.2m (2004: £0.3m) and the Rest of the World £0.1m (2004:
£0.2m), which combined contributed 21% of the total
compared with 69% in 2004.
Financial Review
The financial performance for 2005 was an excellent
turnaround result. Turnover for 2005 increased by 120% to
£7.7m (2004: £3.5m), which resulted in an operating cash
inflow of £0.6m (2004: £2.0m outflow) and a loss after tax of
£0.3m compared with the £2.4m loss experienced in 2004.
The Group also spent £0.8m (2004: £3.2m) on essential
capital investment during the year, which was partially
funded by £0.2m of sale and leaseback financing and £0.2m
additional mortgage funding. As a result the Group closed
the financial year with cash at bank (including short term
deposits) of £3.0m (2004: £3.2m) and net funds of £0.5m
(2004: £0.9m).
Turnover
The turnover for the year was generated from 38 customers
worldwide, however the increase in the year can be directly
attributed to the Group’s focus on the North American
market and a shift towards the growing markets for both
protein and virus production.
Protein production contributed £3.2m or 41% of the total in
2005 (2004: £0.6m) and virus production contributed £2.8m
or 36% (2004: £1.6m). DNA production, although declining
in percentage terms to 18% of 2005 turnover compared
with 30% in 2004, did increase in real terms to £1.4m
(2004: £1.1m). Cell Line production maintained at £0.4m
(2004: £0.4m).

Gross margins – The increase in turnover had a positive
impact on gross margins, as capacity filled throughout the
year at Keele and Oxford, due to a significant element of
the cost of goods being primarily fixed facility and labour
costs. This, combined with Cobra only recruiting staff when
required, and where possible, passing the cost of
consumables directly to the customer resulted in gross
margins increasing to 56% for the year (2004: 45%), peaking
at 59% in the second half of the year.
Operating expenses – Operating expenses increased overall
by 18% to £4.7m in 2005 (2004: £3.9m). This increase can be
attributed to the following factors; firstly the Group’s focus
on North America and the increased effort directed towards
protein and virus production increased sales and marketing
expenditure, and secondly an increase in facility overhead
expenditure and the depreciation charge as the Group
expanded further into the new £5.5m Oxford Facility.
Loss before and after tax – The Group recorded its first
profitable trading period for 18 months in the second half
of the year to reduce the loss before tax of £0.6m in the first
half to a £0.4m loss for the full year (2004: £2.3m loss). With
an estimated R&D tax credit of £54k for the year, the loss
after tax for the financial year was £0.3m (2004: £2.4m loss).

Financial Review
Cash Flow
Operating cash flow – The Group generated £0.6m cash
from operations in 2005 (2004: £2.0m outflow), £0.8m of
which was generated in the second half of the financial year.
Capital expenditure – The Group spent £0.8m on capital
investment (2004: £3.2m), £0.2m of which was for the
purchase of additional land adjacent to the Oxford Facility,
for further expansion, and the remainder being the
purchase of either replacement or contract specific plant and
laboratory equipment at Keele and Oxford. 
Financing – Cobra received net financing of £0.07m in the
year (2004: £0.66m), the majority of which was raised
through the Group’s continuing policy to fund the purchase
of capital investment through either sale and leaseback or
mortgage finance. 
Cash at bank (including short term deposits) – The improved
trading position, in particular in the second half of the year
and the continued funding of essential capital expenditure
throughout the year, ensured that the Group was cash
generative in the second half of the year and that the cash
outflow for the full year was limited to £0.12m (2004:
£4.10m), which resulted in a closing cash at bank (including
short term deposits) at 30 September 2005 of £3.04m (30
September 2004: £3.16m).
Research and Development 
Cobra continues to recognise that it has achieved its
competitive advantage in the complex market of
biopharmaceutical manufacturing, through investment in
research and development, and despite the Group’s focus
during 2005 being primarily on improving its trading
position, gross research and development expenditure
before government grant funding, fell by only 10% to
£0.32m (2004: £0.36m).  
Taxation
At 30 September 2005, the Group had trading tax losses
carried forward of £14.2m ensuring that the Group should
not be obliged to pay UK corporation tax for the
foreseeable future on any trading profits. 
The Group is entitled to claim research and development tax
relief, available under Schedule 20 of the Finance Act 2000,
in respect of financial year 2005, the result of which is a
credit of £54k to the profit and loss account. 
Treasury Policies and Financial Risk
Surplus funds are intended to support the Group’s short-
term working capital requirements. These funds are invested
through the use of short-term deposits and the policy is to
maximise returns as well as provide the flexibility required to
fund on-going operations. It is not the Group’s policy to
enter into financial derivatives for speculative or trading
purposes.
Interest Rate, Liquidity and Foreign Currency Risk
Interest rate risk – During the year the Group switched its
mortgage facility to the National Westminster Bank Plc,
increasing the balance outstanding to £1.3 million,
repayable over a 13-year period commencing May 2007. The
Group utilises the availability of an ‘off-set’ arrangement
with the bank, which effectively means the Group currently
pays a fixed rate of 1.5% over the National Westminster
Bank Plc’s base rate on the outstanding mortgage balance. 
Liquidity risk – Surplus funds are invested on a short-term
basis at money market rates and therefore such funds are
available at very short notice.
Currency risk – The Group generated overseas turnover
during the year, primarily from North America. The position
regarding currency risk is regularly reviewed and hedging
activities are initiated where appropriate, in addition the
currency exposure has been partially offset by overseas
expenditure.

Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held
on 6 April 2006 at 11:00am at the offices of Buchanan
Communications Limited, 45 Moorfields, London, EC2Y 9AE.
The notice of the Annual General Meeting, together with
notes on the resolutions, is on pages 37 and 38.
In addition to the ordinary business there are three items of
special business for consideration at the forthcoming Annual
General Meeting. These are: 
1. An ordinary resolution to renew the directors’ authority
for the purpose of Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985
(“the Act”) to exercise all powers of the Company to
allot, or agree to allot, authorised but unissued (and
unreserved share capital of the Company). The authority
will relate to 7,492,720 ordinary shares of 10p each,
representing 38% of the current issued ordinary share
capital of the Company, and will expire at the conclusion
of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or
if sooner, 2 July 2007. The directors have no present
intention of exercising the authority, which will be
conferred by this resolution, other than through the
grant of options pursuant to the Company’s share option
scheme or the new Cobra Biomanufacturing Plc Long
Term Incentive Plan which is referred to in Paragraph 3
below.
2. A special resolution to renew until the end of the next
Annual General Meeting or, if sooner, 2 July 2007 the
directors’ power to allot equity securities (within the
meaning of Section 94 of the Act) for cash other than
pro rata to existing shareholders. This power will relate
to allotments in respect of rights issues (where
difficulties arise in offering shares to certain overseas
shareholders and in relation to fractional entitlements)
and to allotments (other than in respect of rights issues)
of equity securities having an aggregate nominal value
not exceeding £97,500 (being 5% of the issued equity
share capital of the Company). The directors consider
that it is in the best interests of the shareholders that
the Board should have this limited power in order to
retain flexibility.
3. An ordinary resolution to approve the adoption by the
Company of the Cobra Biomanufacturing plc 2006 Long
Term Incentive Plan the principal terms of which are
summarised in Appendix 1 of the circular to shareholders
dated 31 January 2006 and to approve the establishment
by the Company of the Cobra Biomanufacturing plc 2006
Employee Benefit Trust the principal terms of which are
summarised in Appendix 2 of the circular to shareholders
dated 31 January 2006 and to authorise the directors to
do all such acts or things as may be necessary or
desirable to implement the same.
In the opinion of the directors the passing of these
resolutions is in the best interests of the shareholders.

Report of the Directors
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
in Respect of the Accounts
Company Law requires the directors to prepare accounts for
each financial year, which give a true and fair view of the
state of affairs of the Company and of the Group and of the
profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing
those accounts, the directors are required to:
1. Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
2. Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent;
3. State whether applicable accounting standards have
been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the accounts.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records, which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the financial position of the Group and to enable them to
ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies Act
1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets
of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Going Concern
The directors have reviewed the budget, cash flow and other
relevant information and have a reasonable expectation that
the Group has adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this
reason, the directors continue to adopt the going concern
basis for the preparation of the accounts.
Auditors
Ernst & Young LLP were re-appointed auditors at the Annual
General Meeting held on 7 April 2005. They have expressed
their willingness to continue in office and a resolution to
reappoint them as auditors and to authorise the directors to
determine their remuneration will be proposed at the next
Annual General Meeting.

Corporate Governance Statement
The Combined Code
The directors are committed to high standards of corporate
governance. The Board is accountable to its shareholders for
good corporate governance and is adopting the necessary
structures and procedures, where possible and having regard
to the size of the Group, to comply with the Combined
Code.
Although Cobra is listed on the Alternative Investment
Market and therefore does not need to comply with the
Combined Code, the Board has reviewed the corporate
governance of the Company and has implemented changes
it has felt appropriate, given the Company’s size. The Board
will continue to review the corporate governance of the
Company during the next financial year. 
This statement describes the approach of the Company and
the application of the principles identified in the current
code, which are being applied.
Application of the Principles
of the Combined Code
The Board
The Board of Directors comprises three executive directors,
including the Chairman, and three independent non-
executive directors. The executive directors have a clear
division of duties and meet to direct and control strategy
and the operating performance of the Group. This includes
the approval and monitoring of budgets, reviewing trade
performance and determining risk management policies. The
Group also has a schedule of matters reserved for the
decision of the Board. There is an agreed procedure for
directors in the furtherance of their duties to take
independent professional advice if necessary, at the
Company’s expense.

in with the publication of the Company’s financial
statements. The Committee will also meet on an ad-hoc basis
where necessary. The external auditors attend the meetings
at the invitation of the Committee and report as
appropriate. 
The Committee operates within specific terms of reference,
which include reviewing the Group’s accounting policies,

Corporate Governance Statement
Risk Management and Internal Control
The Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining
the Group’s system of internal control, which is designed to
meet the particular needs of the Group and the risks to
which it is exposed. Such a system is designed to manage
these risks, to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss and to maintain
proper accounting records to ensure the integrity of
financial information used within the business and for
external publication.
The Group’s established internal control procedures include
the following:
1. A schedule of matters reserved for the Board. The Board
of Directors has overall responsibility for the effective
running of the Group and it has a formal schedule of
matters, which are specifically reserved for decisions by
the Board. 
2. The Board meet to manage the affairs of the Group. The
Group’s financial and operating performance is closely
monitored at each Board meeting with formal Board
reports from the Chief Executive and the Finance
Director covering their areas of the business.
3. The Group’s senior management team, including
executive and non-executive directors meet twice a year
for a strategic review. The purpose of which is to
formulate a long-term strategy for the Group and
develop a strategic framework for the achievement of
the Group’s financial targets.
4. The Group’s Executive Committee meets monthly to
review the performance of the Group. The Executive
Committee is comprised of the operational senior
management, who each provide a monthly report. Each
of the senior managers operates within a clearly defined
Group structure, and each member is given the
appropriate operational authority.
5. The Group prepares an annual budget, developed
through a comprehensive operational budgeting process
prior to the commencement of the financial year. A
revised forecast is prepared at the half year. The budget
and the revised forecast are reviewed and approved by
the Board and the Executive Committee.
6. The Board and the Executive Committee then monitor
the actual monthly financial performance of the Group
against the budget and the half-year revised forecast,
with any significant variances highlighted and explained. 
The Board also recognises the need for an effective risk
management process, and has therefore reinvigorated
during the financial year the development of an integrated
risk management process for the Group. The process has
identified and prioritised the major strategic risks facing the
Group, and reviewed the current controls in place for each
risk and recommended a strategy for improvement. Stage
two will be to then embed a risk review process into the
established internal control procedures of the Group during
the next financial year. The financial review also provides
some further information on the risks the Group faces.
Relations with Shareholders
The Board recognises the importance of continual
communications with shareholders and will maintain a
programme of regular dialogue with its investors, including
presentations following the Company’s announcements of
its preliminary full year figures and of the half year results.
There is also an opportunity, at the Company’s Annual
General Meeting for individual shareholders to raise general
business matters with the full Board and notice of the
Company’s Annual General Meeting is circulated to all
shareholders at least 20 working days before such meeting.
The Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination
Committees will be available at the Annual General Meeting
to answer questions. 
The Annual Report is to be published on the Company’s
website, www.cobrabio.com which also includes previous
financial reports, press releases, presentations and other
announcements made during the year.
60011 Cobra Report & Accs 2005  27/1/06  5:19 pm  Page 15 Cobra Biomanufacturing Plc 16
Report on Directors’ Remuneration
This report describes the role and composition of the
Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”), the Group’s
remuneration policy and the arrangements currently in place
in respect of both executive and non-executive directors.
Reward Philosophy
To ensure corporate success and enhance shareholder value,
the Group needs people of high calibre able to meet the
challenges it faces.
The Group’s overall remuneration policy aims are to:
1. Attract, develop, motivate and keep talented people at
director and senior executive level.
2. Pay competitive total compensation packages to
directors and senior executives, with a significant
component linked to the attainment of performance
targets. When pay levels are set, account is taken of the
work a director does, what is paid in other companies
for that work and how well the Group’s businesses are
performing; and
3. Encourage its directors to hold shares in the Company,
which the Committee believes is an effective way of
bringing together their interests with those of external
shareholders.
The Company promotes greater ownership of its shares and
offers directors the opportunity to participate in the
Company’s share options scheme. 
Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration
Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial period
of twelve months and then on a rolling contract subject to
three months’ notice either by themselves or the Company
at a salary determined by the executive directors. All
directors are subject to re-election at an Annual General
Meeting at least every three years. The Board set the
remuneration of the non-executive directors with reference
to third party consultants. The non-executive directors
receive a basic salary and do not participate in the bonus
arrangements, healthcare arrangements, company share
option schemes or the pension scheme. The Company repays
the reasonable expenses they incur in carrying out their
duties as directors. Non-executive directors’ remuneration
for the year ended 30 September 2005 is set out in the
following table:
Total Total
2005 2004
£ £
Non-executive director
David Bloxham 22,500 21,750
Michael Gatenby 22,500 18,519
Nigel Slater 22,500 21,750
Total 67,500 62,019
Executive Directors’ Remuneration
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board on
the Group’s framework of executive remuneration and its
cost. It decides the specific remuneration benefits,
employment conditions, pension rights, compensation
payments and severance terms for the executive directors
and the remuneration framework for the other senior
executives. 
The Committee investigates and takes into account the
remuneration paid to the directors of other companies of a
similar size and comparable industry sector in the UK, to
ensure that the levels of remuneration paid by the Group
are appropriate. The primary source of this information was
provided through subscription and access to the annual New
Bridge Street Consultants’ “Biotechnology Industry
Remuneration Survey”. The Committee met formally once in
the year to 30 September 2005 in addition to regular
discussion and the Board accepted the Committee’s
recommendations without amendment.
The members of the Committee are David Bloxham, Michael
Gatenby and Nigel Slater as Chairman. The members of the
Committee have no personal financial interest in the
Company other than as shareholders and the fees paid to
them as non-executive directors. They are not involved in
the day-to-day running of the Group’s businesses. 
Although not members of the Committee, the Chairman and
Chief Executive may be invited to attend meetings and the
Committee consults them on proposals relating to the
remuneration of executive directors and appropriate senior
executives. They do not attend when the Committee
discusses matters relating to their own remuneration.
Reward Policy
The Committee’s policy for executive directors’ remuneration
is to:
1. Pay a basic salary, which competes with other companies
of similar size and complexity in the biotechnology
sector. 
2. Give executives the opportunity to increase their
earnings by meeting and outperforming short term and
long term objectives that are key to the growth of the
Group. In this way, the Committee links executives’
rewards directly to the Group’s performance and
shareholders’ interests;
3. Evolve compensation schemes that encourage executives
to hold shares in the Company (such as a long term
incentive plan); and 
4. Overall, reward executives fairly and responsibly for their
contribution to the Group’s short and long term
performance.

Report on Directors’ Remuneration
Elements of Remuneration
In deciding the executive directors’ total remuneration
package and individual elements of it, the Committee refers
to the reward policy and assesses where the Company
should be positioned relative to other companies. It has
obtained independent advice on appropriate comparisons
and treats them cautiously. The main elements of executive
directors’ remuneration are as follows:
Basic Salary
The Committee reviews basic salaries each year taking
account of the various factors, elements and policies set out
earlier, including Group performance. Any changes are made
with effect from 1 January. The basic salaries of the
executive directors are set out in the table overleaf.
Annual Bonus
The annual bonus further motivates the executive directors
and other senior executives to achieve the Group’s key
operational and strategic objectives during the financial
year. The Committee reviews regularly the basis of the bonus
and the targets to be achieved.
The directors’ bonus for the financial year 2005 was
determined by both quantitative and qualitative
considerations and was directly linked to the financial year.
The quantitative objectives were based on Group turnover,
PBIT shareholder value and cash management and the
qualitative objectives were based on personal and team
achievements. 
The Chief Executive was entitled to receive up to a
maximum of 50%, the Finance Director 40% and the
Chairman 30% of their basic salaries under this scheme. In
addition the Committee may award an additional
discretionary bonus where merited.
Taking these factors into account the Committee
recommended the payment of bonuses as shown in the
table below in recognition of the substantial improvement
in the Group’s turnover and cash flow. In addition the
Committee recognised the significant personal achievement
in realising the strategy for diversification of the Group’s
product portfolio and geographic focus.
Other Benefits
Benefits for the Chief Executive, David Thatcher and the
Finance Director, Peter Coleman comprise the provision of a
motor car, private healthcare, death and disability in service
cover. The Chairman, Peter Fothergill receives a provision for
private healthcare and death and disability in service cover.
Pension Arrangements
The Chief Executive, David Thatcher and the Finance
Director, Peter Coleman, are members of the Group’s
defined contribution personal pension scheme, which is
open to all employees. The Group makes a contribution of
10% of salary for David Thatcher and 7% for Peter Coleman
and both are required to make a minimum contribution of
3% of their basic salary. The scheme also provides a lump
sum death in service benefit. The Chairman, Peter Fothergill,
receives from the Group a contribution of 15% of his basic
salary to his defined contribution personal pension plan.
Service Contracts
The Executive Directors have a notice period of one year.
There are no special provisions for compensation in the
event of loss of office. The Remuneration Committee
considers the circumstances of individual cases of early
termination and determines compensation payments
accordingly.
Elements of Remuneration
The basic salary, bonus, pension and benefits awarded to the executive directors during the year were as follows:

Report on Directors’ Remuneration
Introduction of the New Cobra Biomanufacturing Plc 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan
The Committee has recently reviewed the total remuneration of directors and senior executives and recommended the
introduction of a new long term incentive plan to be known as the Cobra Biomanufacturing plc 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan
(“the Plan”) and the establishment of a new employee benefit trust to be known as the Cobra Biomanufacturing plc 2006
Employee Benefit Trust (“the EBT”). The Plan and EBT are considered to be necessary to enhance the link between the
remuneration of directors and senior executives and the Company’s long term performance. A resolution to adopt the Plan and
EBT will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of the Company and further details of the resolution are
contained in the notice of the Annual General Meeting set
out on pages 37 and 38 of this report.
The graph shows the Company’s TSR (“Total Shareholder
Return”) compared to the FTSE Small Cap Pharmaceutical
& Biotechnology Sector for the period from 13 June 2002
to 30 November 2005. TSR is defined as share price growth
plus reinvested dividends. Given its size and market sector,
the Company believes that they are the most appropriate
basis for comparison as a relevant equity index of which it
is a member.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the members
of Cobra Biomanufacturing Plc
We have audited the Group's financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2005, which comprise Group Profit and Loss
Account, Group Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses, Group Balance Sheet, Company Balance Sheet, Group
Statement of Cash Flows and the related notes 1 to 23. These financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the
accounting policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state
to them in an auditors' report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or
for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, including the financial statements, which are required to be
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom law and accounting standards as set out in the Statement of Directors'
Responsibilities in relation to the financial statements.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United
Kingdom Auditing Standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, if the Report of the Directors is not
consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors' remuneration
and transactions with the Group is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. This other information comprises the Financial Highlights, Chairman's Statement, Chief Executive’s Review, Financial
Review, Report of the Directors, Corporate Governance Statement and Report on Directors’ Remuneration. We consider the
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An
audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It
also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the
financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group's circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group as at
30 September 2005 and of the loss of the Group for the year then ended and have been properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985.

Notes to the Financial Statements 
for the Year Ended 30 September 2005
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the
United Kingdom.
Basis of consolidation and presentation of financial statements
The Group accounts comprise the accounts of Cobra Biomanufacturing Plc and its subsidiary undertaking Cobra Biologics
Limited up to 30 September 2005. No profit and loss account is presented for Cobra Biomanufacturing Plc as permitted by
Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Turnover and revenue recognition
Turnover, which excludes value added tax, represents amounts receivable in respect of the sale of goods and services during the
year. Turnover on fixed contracts is invoiced in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the customer and is
recognised based upon the stage of completion when the outcome of the contract can be foreseen with reasonable certainty
and after allowing for costs of completion. 
Tangible assets and depreciation
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost less residual value of each asset
evenly over its expected useful life as follows:
Freehold land & buildings between 15 and 25 years
Plant and laboratory equipment between 6.67 and 10 years
Short leasehold building improvements 6.67 years
Office equipment 4 years
Motor vehicles 3 years
The cost of tangible fixed assets includes directly attributable finance costs, calculated on a day to day basis, on expenditure
incurred during construction and modification. The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment when
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Assets under construction include the costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into working condition for its intended
use.
Government Grants
Government grants in respect of capital expenditure are credited to a deferred income account and are released to profit over
the expected useful lives of the relevant assets by equal instalments.
Grants of a revenue nature are credited to income so as to match them with the expenditure to which they relate. 
Stocks
Stocks are valued in the balance sheet at the lower of cost incurred in bringing each product to its present location and
condition, and net realisable value. Cost is calculated on a first in first out basis. 
Raw materials purchase cost on a first in first out basis.
Work in progress cost of direct materials and labour plus attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred on completion and
disposal.
Research and development
Research and development expenditure is written off in the period in which it is incurred, and includes inter alia all internal
and external costs incurred in patenting, external studies and consultancy.
60011 Cobra Report & Accs 2005  27/1/06  5:19 pm  Page 24 Cobra Biomanufacturing Plc 25
Notes to the Financial Statements 
for the Year Ended 30 September 2005
Leasing and hire purchase commitments
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts, which are those where substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership of the asset have passed to the Group, are capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over their useful
lives.
The interest element of the rental obligations is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease and
represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date
where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to
receive more, tax. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not
that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing
differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance
sheet date.
All differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Pension costs
The Group operates a defined contribution scheme, covering all eligible employees. Contributions are charged to the profit and
loss account on an accruals basis.
Derivatives and other financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate movements. The
Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The Group also uses interest rate swaps
to adjust interest rate exposures.
Forward foreign currency contracts
The criteria for forward foreign currency contracts are:
  The instrument must be related to a firm foreign currency commitment;
  It must involve the same currency as the hedged item; and
  It must reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the Group’s operation.

The deferred tax asset has not been provided for as it is uncertain whether sufficient profit will arise in the foreseeable future
to enable the asset to reverse.
7 LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO MEMBERS OF THE PARENT COMPANY
The loss dealt with in the accounts of the parent company for the period ended 30 September 2005 was £6,136 (2004:
£8,315,589 loss).
8 LOSS PER ORDINARY SHARE
The calculation of basic loss per ordinary share is based on losses of £340,871 (2004: £2,397,850 loss) and on 19,504,264 ordinary
shares (2004: 19,500,000) being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
The loss for the period and the weighted average number of ordinary shares for calculating the diluted loss per share for the
year ended 30 September 2005 are identical to those used for the basic loss per share. This is because the outstanding share
options and warrants would have the effect of reducing the loss per ordinary share and would therefore not be dilutive under
the terms of Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) No 14.

Notes to the Financial Statements 
for the Year Ended 30 September 2005
The long-term loan is a new mortgage facility, which in May 2005 replaced the existing £1.1m 11 year mortgage facility with
HSBC Bank Plc, secured against freehold land and buildings. The loan is repayable in monthly instalments, over a thirteen-year
period commencing May 2007. The Group utilises the availability of an ‘off-set’ arrangement with the bank, which effectively
means the Group currently pays a fixed rate of 1.5% over the National Westminster Bank Plc’s base rate on the outstanding
mortgage balance.

21 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
An explanation of the Group’s objectives, policies and strategies for the role of derivatives and other financial instruments can
be found on page 7. It is not the Group’s policy to enter into financial derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. The
financial instruments employed by the Group other than short-term debtors and creditors are used to fund its operations and
comprise cash, short-term deposits, long-term loans and finance leases. 
The Group’s policy during the year ended 30 September 2005 was to place the majority of its cash on short-term deposit with its
bankers, to finance the purchase of freehold land and buildings through mortgage finance and to finance the purchase of
other fixed assets through sale and leaseback, where possible, for cash flow purposes.
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is limited to finance leases which are typically fixed rate, and its mortgage facility and
cash deposits which are typically floating rate. As permitted by Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) No.13 the disclosures below
with the exception of currency exposure, exclude short-term debtors and creditors.

cannot be chemically synthesised and comprise either
recombinant DNA, Protein or Virus.
Cell line – live cells as medicinal products.
Cellular products/manufacture – medicines (manufacture of
medicines) where the active ingredients are live cells.
Cobra – Cobra Biomanufacturing Plc and its wholly owned
subsidiary Cobra Biologics Limited (“The Group”).
DNA – Deoxyribonucleic Acid, a molecule that encodes
genetic information.
cGMP – Good Manufacturing Practice, a code of practice
that ensures medicinal products are produced consistently
and to the appropriate quality standards. In the UK,
manufacturers of medicinal products require accreditation
with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency (“MHRA”). 
Mammalian protein products – proteins, produced and
purified from a mammalian cell culture process.
Microbial – consisting of, or utilising micro-organisms.
Microbial protein products – proteins, produced and purified
from bacteria that have been grown in a microbial
fermentation process.
ORT® – Operator Repressor Titration, a host vector system
that avoids the use of antibiotics and antibiotic resistant
genes during biological manufacture.
ORT-VAC – derived using ORT® technology, strains of
attenuated bacteria bearing high copy number plasmids for
use as live vaccines.
Plasmid DNA – vaccines/medicines where the active
ingredient is made of DNA produced in bacteria and which
encodes a therapeutic gene. Plasmid DNA being replicating
circular DNA encoding genes.
Protein products/manufacture – medicines (the manufacture
of medicines) where the active ingredient is protein.
Qualified Person or QP – The quality assurance professional
for medicines defined by British Law, based upon European
Union directives. For clinical trial materials the QP ensures
that every batch released to the clinic complies with its
specification and has been made according to current cGMP.
Medicines produced outside the EU can be imported and, if
assessed as suitable by the QP, be used for an approved EU
clinical trial.
Virus products/manufacture – medicines (the manufacture of
medicines) where the active ingredient is a recombinant
virus engineered to deliver DNA encoding a therapeutic
gene.

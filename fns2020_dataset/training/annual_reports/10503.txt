Chairman’s Statement 
Results
Against a tough economic backdrop in 2009 the new 
management team stabilised the business – reducing cost, 
improving our basic business processes and establishing an 
investment programme in product and brand that would 
provide a solid platform to return the business to growth.
We saw the benefits of these actions in 2010 in both revenue 
and profitability. Revenue improved throughout the course of 
the year and ended the year 9% ahead as a whole having been 
5% ahead at the end of the first half of the year. Adjusted 
EBITDA increased by 14% in the year having been broadly flat at 
the end of the first half as a result of our front loaded 
investment programme.
Profitability improved markedly in the second half of the year 
increasing by 32% over the same period in 2009 as the Group 
began to see the benefits of its investment programme.
These results reflect the continuing strength and diversity  
of our business model as our Insurance, Money and Home 
Services verticals all grew helping to offset the declines 
experienced in our Travel vertical, which continued to suffer  
in line with the rest of the travel market and consequently 
continued to be managed for margin.
Dividend
The Company paid an interim dividend of 1.3p per ordinary 
share on 17 September 2010, consistent with the interim 
dividends paid in 2008 and 2009.
During the year, the business continued to generate cash, and we 
ended the year with cash balances of £36.6m. With the business 
growing, the Board is recommending a final dividend of 2.53p per 
ordinary share, a 15% increase on the final dividend paid in 2008 
and 2009 (excluding the impact of special dividends). If approved 
by shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting,  
this will bring the total dividend for the year to 3.83p per ordinary 
share and will be paid on 13 May 2011 to all shareholders on the 
register at 8 April 2011. 
Strategic progress
The 2010 results are a reflection of the implementation of the 
Group’s strategy outlined in early 2010. Having taken decisive 
action in 2009 in response to the global financial crisis and 
realigned the cost base, the focus in 2010 has been on growing 
the business. 
We continued to invest during 2010 in opportunities for 
profitable growth through the launch of enhanced market 
leading motor insurance, home insurance, savings and credit 
card channels, together with the acquisition of Financial 
Services Net Limited which provides a platform for the Group  
to broaden its brand offering to a wider range of customer 
segments in the Money and Insurance verticals. 
Our strategy will continue to underpin the Group throughout 
2011 as we launch further enhanced market leading channels 
to ensure we deliver the best customer experience through our 
websites and as we ensure our customers have the tools they 
need to compare products based on the features that are 
important to them.
Outlook
The new year has begun well and, whilst we remain alert to  
the continuing uncertainty in the wider economic environment, 
we are confident that the worst is behind us and that we will 
continue to grow in 2011. Our strong market positions and our 
diversified business model will remain key strengths as 
economic conditions improve.
Governance and the Board
Since the Group listed on the London Stock Exchange in  
2007, our Board and executive governance structures have 
continually developed and improved. We believe that good 
governance reduces risk and adds value to the business. Management Corporate Responsibility Corporate Governance General Financial Statements

Business Overview Business Review
Following the changes to the Board in early 2009 with the 
appointment of Peter Plumb as Chief Executive Officer together 
with the appointments of Graham Donoghue and David Osborne 
as Executive Directors, in April 2010 the Board appointed Bruce 
Carnegie-Brown as an additional Non-Executive Director. 
Bruce has brought a wealth of experience in the financial 
services sector to the business and has provided greater 
balance to the Board.
With the implementation of the UK Corporate Governance  
Code, all of our Directors will retire at this year’s Annual 
General Meeting, and being eligible, will offer themselves  
for re-election.
Employees
2010 saw valuable additions to our team as we continued to 
position the business for future growth. The quality of our 
people continues to be a core strength and I am delighted  
that we have further enhanced our capabilities in so many  
parts of the business. 
Our results this year are down to the performance of  
Peter Plumb, his management team and all the employees  
who continue to build the business. I would like to thank  
them all for their skill and hard work during the year. 
Annual General Meeting

Annual Report 2010
Review of the year
In 2010 we made good progress against our strategic plan.  
We benefited from the tough cost cutting measures we took in 
the first half of 2009 and the investments made in both IT and 
marketing during the second half of 2009. As a result, the 
Group’s revenue increased in 2010 by 9% from £136.9m  
to £148.9m and adjusted EBITDA increased by 14% from  
£36.0m to £41.0m.
Excluding travel, we delivered robust revenue growth of 13% 
despite the challenging economic conditions during the year. 
Our motor insurance channel had a particularly strong year 
despite the competitive market place delivering revenue growth 
of 18%. 
Our customers experienced motor insurance policy inflation of 
more than 25% as motor insurers acted to recover increased 
costs of personal injury claims and reduced investment 
returns. This trend appears to be continuing into 2011. 
Our credit cards channel was the second strongest growth driver 
in 2010. As the year progressed a growing range of credit cards 
were made available to customers. 2011 starts with more credit 
card products available than in January 2010. Our home 
insurance and savings channels also had a good year with  
strong second half revenue growth after their relaunch.
Our travel business was not immune from the challenging 
economic conditions. Throughout 2010, as the travel market 
continued to decline, we managed the business for margin with 
the consequence that revenue declined by 14% compared to 
2009. During the year, we reviewed the travel market, worked 
with our customers to understand their online travel needs,  
and rebuilt our package holidays channel ready for its relaunch 
in January 2011.
Our marketing team continued to drive efficiency through our 
2010 campaigns, reducing our overall media investment from 
45% of Group revenue in 2009 to 43% of Group revenue in 2010 
whilst still delivering 9% revenue growth.

Annual Report 2010
Business Overview Business Review
This was achieved through flat online media spend but 
increased offline investment focused on building our brand 
awareness through TV and radio advertising. Our ‘haggle hero’ 
campaign, featuring Omid Djalili resonated with the British 
public as he challenged us all to ‘save super amounts of money’ 
at moneysupermarket.com. 
As a sector, price comparison remained fiercely competitive, 
especially in the motor insurance market. However, we stuck  
to our strategy of only targeting visitors who we were confident 
would use our services and be profitable to both ourselves and 
our providers. 
Review of the Group’s strategic progress during 2010
In last year’s report, we outlined the Group’s strategy which  
is also outlined in my report. Although simple, it requires 
complete focus on building a long term brand and relationships 
with our customers and providers. The four elements of the 
Group’s strategy are to:
Build the best shop • 
Stock our shop with the best products • 
Use data to make life easier for our customers • 
Build an every day brand • 
This strategy has ensured that the Group has remained 
completely focused as one team on building a successful long 
term business. During 2010 we have made significant progress 
against our strategy as outlined below. 
Building the best shop
In the second half of 2009 and the first half of 2010 we increased 
our IT investment programme rebuilding our core channels. 
New credit cards, savings, home insurance, motor insurance 
and energy channels were launched during the year. 
Our approach has been to engage both providers and 
customers in the design process, ensuring product features  
and price can be fully explored by customers, and product 
benefits can be promoted by providers. Ultimately, customer 
feedback after launch is what counts, and on these rebuilt 
channels it has been extremely encouraging, with motor 
insurance, home insurance and credit cards all being voted 
market leading. 
Stocking our shop with the best products
Our business is based on the ‘success fee’ marketing model,  
in which the majority of our providers only pay a fee for 
customers who purchase their product. We constantly strive  
to offer the most cost effective route to market for our providers 
which requires a great understanding of their business models 
and needs.
Having invested in building a stronger, more experienced sales 
team, I am pleased to be able to report that our relationships 
with our key providers are strong. This helped to ensure that we 
received significant allocations of their marketing spend and 
were able to secure exclusive market leading deals for our 
customers across our business. The result was that during 
2010 we increased the number of paying providers on the 
Group’s websites.
Using data to make life easier for our customers
We only want our customers to have to enter their details once 
so that it becomes ever easier for them to make the most of 
their money and to find the best and most relevant products.
We spent 2010 increasing both our data analysis and customer 
relationship management (CRM) capabilities. The result of this 
work is that we now look after data for more than 10 million 
individuals and talk on a regular basis to many of them through 
our weekly MoreMoney communication and personalised 
marketing campaigns.  12 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC
Annual Report 2010
As an indication of the progress we have made, our revenue 
from our CRM campaigns increased by 74% in 2010 compared 
to 2009. We will continue to build out our CRM capability in 2011 
across our business. 
Building an every day brand
Our 2010 offline advertising campaign ‘a great deal easier’ 
featuring Omid Djalili as our ‘haggle hero’ proved to be very 
successful. Our increased offline investment communicated 
our breadth and depth of products on both TV and radio. 
Online, we continued to optimise our marketing spend. We 
exited or scaled back a number of portal partnership deals, 
which although delivering visitor numbers, were uneconomic 
due to the lower propensity such visitors had to actually use  
our services and purchase products. 
Our investment in paid search also continued to be optimised 
through our bid management systems resulting in a flat spend, 
whilst we experimented with Facebook advertising, particularly 
for financial products.
During 2010 we acquired Financial Services Net Limited (FSN). 
FSN owns and operates a number of highly relevant financial 
services websites which provide a platform for the Group to 
broaden its brand offering to a wider range of customer 
segments in the Money and Insurance verticals.
2011 strategy
I see no need for a change of strategy in 2011. Our focus on 
building the best shop and stocking it with the best products 
has served us well over the past 18 months, we have a strong 
energised team and a growing brand.
Our continued investment programme means that we enter 
2011 with rebuilt package holidays and stocks and shares ISA 
channels. We have also completed the roll out of our innovative 
‘smart channels search’ tool to all credit card categories, 
allowing customers to check their likelihood of acceptance 
before applying for a card – a great service to customers and  
providers alike.

Business Overview Business Review
2011 started with some entertaining new adverts with  
John Prescott promoting our motor insurance business, and 
Jedward relaunching travelsupermarket.com after two years 
off air. This year we are proud to be the new sponsors of ITV’s 
Britain’s Got Talent which gives us a unique and exciting 
opportunity to broaden our brand reach across the UK in a way 
that standard advertising can not. This is a key component of 
our brand strategy for this year.
We will continue to build stronger and deeper relationships with 
our providers ensuring we deliver a valuable and cost effective 
service to them. 
Summary
2010 was a good year for the Group, both in terms of financial 
performance and strategic development. 
Our strong market positions, the clear strategic focus of the 
Group, the cash generative nature of our business and our 
diversified business model all provide a solid platform for the 
Group to grow. We are in a strong position to take advantage of 
any opportunities as they arise.

Financial and Business Review
The Group has presented below an extract of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the years ended  
31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009 along with a reconciliation to adjusted EBITDA. Revenue in 2010 was £148.9m  
(2009: £136.9m) which generated a net profit after tax of £7.7m (2009: £1.9m). The Directors believe that the presentation  
of an adjusted EBITDA measure will allow users of the financial information to gain a better understanding of the underlying 
performance of the business.

1. Basis of Preparation
The results show the trading results for the years ended 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009. The following adjustments 
have been made to arrive at adjusted EBITDA:
The acquisition of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited by the Company gave rise to £207.2m of intangible assets. • 
These are to be written off over a period of 3-10 years with a charge of £24.0m and £25.2m expensed in 2010 and 2009 
respectively. Management Corporate Responsibility Corporate Governance General Financial Statements
15 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC
Annual Report 2010
Business Overview Business Review
Certain share option charges relating to Directors, senior • 
management and other employees of the Group arising from 
the time the Group listed or when it was privately owned 
have been added back to calculate adjusted EBITDA. A 
charge for awards made under the Group’s Long Term 
Incentive Plan is included within the adjusted results for 
2009 and 2010.
On 14 October 2010 the Group acquired Financial Services • 
Net Limited. The Group incurred costs of £0.7m in relation  
to the acquisition including settling both its own and the 
sellers’ professional fees associated with the acquisition. 
The acquisition also gave rise to £6.1m of intangible assets 
which are to be written off over a period of 3-10 years, and 
which gave rise to an amortisation charge of £0.2m in the 
current period.
Reference is made in the Overview section below to adjusted 
distribution and administration expenses, and adjusted staff 
costs. These measures represent the costs charged to the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, less the intangible 
amortisation, pre-listing share option charges and costs 
incurred in relation to the acquisition of Financial Services  
Net Limited. The basis for calculating adjusted earnings per 
share is described on page 21.
Overview
Revenue for the year was £148.9m (2009: £136.9m) generating 
adjusted EBITDA of £41.0m (2009: £36.0m) with trading 
improving throughout the course of the year.
During 2010 the Group has continued to focus on developing 
and enhancing its existing product portfolio, while continuing to 
develop its brand, building on the momentum of the second half 
of 2009.
This investment has delivered significant improvements to our 
website during the year, including new credit cards and savings 
channels in the Money vertical, new motor and home insurance 
channels in the Insurance vertical, a new package holidays 
channel in the Travel vertical, the launch of a new mobile 
application for vouchers and a new energy channel in the Home 
Services vertical. 
The Group continued to develop its brand proposition, launching 
a new television advertising campaign featuring comedian  
Omid Djalili in the first quarter of 2010. This has helped the 
Group to grow its gross margins as the proportion of direct to 
site revenue has increased, as detailed below. The Group 
invested an additional £3.3m in its media campaign in 2010. 
Offline advertising spend increased to approximately one third 
of total spend, from around 25% historically. Moving forward, 
offline marketing is likely to represent a greater part of the total 
marketing mix.
Financial Performance
Revenue increased by 9% to £148.9m (2009: £136.9m) and 
adjusted EBITDA increased by 14% to £41.0m (2009: £36.0m). 
The Group saw solid revenue growth in its Insurance, Money 
and Home Services verticals, whilst Travel revenue declined in 
what remains a challenging economic environment for 
consumers. Revenue improved throughout the course of the 
year, with fourth quarter UK internet revenue 15% ahead of the 
same period last year. EBITDA in the second half of the year 
was 32% ahead of the same period last year.
Group gross margin, at 71.3%, improved by more than two 
percentage points compared to last year. The Group improved 
its proportion of direct to site revenue in the year from 62%  
of revenue to 67% of total revenue. 
The adjusted administrative and distribution cost base 
increased by 11% to £69.9m from £62.7m in the year. Adjusted 
administrative costs increased by 9% over the prior year to 
£48.4m. Adjusted staff costs (including contract resource) 
increased marginally from £26.7m to £27.1m. Headcount 
decreased from 442 to 420. Distribution expenses increased by 
£3.2m over the prior year (including an increase of £3.3m in 
media related costs) as the Group increased the proportion of 
its marketing budget allocated to offline media. 16 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC
Annual Report 2010
The Group invested approximately £2.4m in third party resource  
to improve its core technology and product in 2010, making  
a number of significant releases to its product set as referred  
to above.
Other costs increased by £4.0m over last year as expenditure 
on, inter alia, television advertising and professional fees 
increased, together with the increase in the VAT rate to 17.5% 
which was effective from the beginning of the year. The Group 
incurred a loss of £0.6m in Germany in 2010 (2009: loss of 
£1.8m). Following a review of its German business, the Group 
took the decision in early 2010 to wind down its operations and 
the costs incurred in 2010 largely reflect closure costs. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 27.5% from 26.3% against 
the same period last year. 
The Group operates its internet business across four vertical 
markets. These are discussed below:

to a third party website, or in some cases having completed  
an application form hosted on the Group’s websites. 
Revenue per visitor (‘RPV’)
The Group measures the total revenue (including click  
and other internet revenue) divided by the number of visitors 
defined above. 
Revenue per transaction (‘RPT’)

Money
The Money vertical offers customers the ability to search for, 
and compare, products for, amongst other things, credit cards, 
current accounts, mortgages, loans, debt solutions, savings 
accounts and business finance. It also includes elements  
of the Group’s lead business (PAA) and advisory business  
(MCAT) together with advertising revenue that derives from 
financial products. 
The KPIs for the Money vertical are shown below: 
  31 December 31 December  
  2010 2009 Change
Visitors (000)  31,761 35,178 -10%
Transactions (000)  13,585 11,650 17%

Revenue (£000) – total  44,006 38,132 15%
RPV  £1.39 £1.08 
RPT  £2.89 £2.82 
Total revenue in the Money vertical increased by 15% from 
£38.1m to £44.0m and click based revenue by 19% from  
£32.8m to £39.2m. Visitors to the Money vertical were 10% 
lower than last year. This in part reflects deliberate actions 
taken by the Group to step away from a number of unprofitable 
portal partner relationships together with lower levels of 
consumer confidence, particularly impacting visitors to the 
Group’s credit related channels. 
Despite fewer visitors, the transaction count in the Money 
vertical increased by 17%, helped in part by the product 
developments referred to above. In particular the 
improvements made to the credit cards and savings channels in 
the first half of the year helped drive improved revenue in these 
channels as consumer conversion increased on both the 
Group’s and providers’ websites.
Conditions in the credit markets improved in 2010. Trading 
during 2009 was characterised by limited provider budgets for 
the acquisition of credit customers and by very tight credit 
underwriting criteria. Although underwriting criteria continued 
to remain challenging for consumers, providers set either much 
higher or uncapped acquisition budgets, particularly in relation 
to credit cards customers where revenue grew significantly in 
2010 over 2009. In addition, the Group continued to improve its 
contracted coverage of the money market, with particular focus 
on the most competitive providers in its key channels. Trading 
in credit products, defined as total revenue from secured and 
unsecured loans, credit cards, debt solutions and mortgages 
excluding impression based advertising revenue, was 
approximately 18% ahead of the same period last year. 
Revenue from other banking products, particularly savings  
and current accounts was also ahead of the same period  
last year with strong trading in the second half of the year. 
Other revenue, which includes revenue from the sale of leads 
through PAA, commission based sales through MCAT for 
mortgages and loans, and advertising revenue, declined by 
approximately £0.5m, or 10%, over the year. Trading was 
broadly flat in most categories but in a number of minor areas 
the Group scaled back lead based activities towards click based 
revenues or more generally reduced its volumes in certain 
areas where the business was transacted at lower margins. 18 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC

Insurance
The Insurance vertical offers customers the ability to search 
for, and compare, insurance products for, amongst other things, 
breakdown, dental, home, life, medical, mortgage payment 
protection, motor, payment protection, pet and travel insurance. 
It also includes elements of the Group’s lead business (PAA) 
and advisory business (MCAT) together with advertising 
revenue that derives from insurance products. 
The KPIs for the Insurance vertical are shown below:

Revenue (£000) – total  84,520 75,669 12%
RPV  £3.32 £3.13 
RPT  £5.61 £5.20 
Revenue in the Insurance vertical increased by 12% from 
£75.7m to £84.5m. Click based revenue increased by 15%  
from £68.6m to £79.0m. Visitors increased by 6% to 25.5m, 
helped in part by the increased media spend and new media 
campaign referred to previously.
Revenue grew across most of the vertical’s major channels, 
with solid growth delivered in motor, home and life insurance 
whilst travel insurance revenue remained flat despite a 
turbulent travel market. Motor insurance is the largest channel 
within the Insurance vertical, and was the fastest growing of the 
Group’s major channels.
As in the Money vertical, both the motor and home insurance 
channels benefited from investment made in site design and 
usability, which has helped to improve conversion and the 
average RPV in the Insurance vertical.
Other revenue, which includes revenue from the sale of leads 
through PAA, commission based sales through MCAT for 
insurance products, and advertising revenue, declined 
approximately £1.6m or 22% over the year. This was largely due 
to changes made to the website as part of the redesign referred 
to above which reduced the volume of real estate made 
available for banner advertising delivering an improved 
consumer experience.

Travel
The Travel vertical offers customers the ability to search for, 
and compare, amongst other things, airport parking, car hire, 
flights, hotels and package holidays. 
The KPIs for the Travel vertical are shown below:

Revenue (£000) – total  13,926 16,305 -14%
RPV  £0.37 £0.38 
RPT  £0.57 £0.51 
Revenue in the Travel vertical declined by 14% from £16.3m to 
£13.9m and click based revenue declined by 15% from £14.8m 
to £12.5m. Visitor levels declined by 12% compared to the same 
period last year, whilst RPV remained broadly flat. 
Revenue in the Travel vertical was impacted as customers 
continued to reduce discretionary expenditure in response to 
economic uncertainty. Package holidays revenue did, however, 
grow fractionally over the same period last year. 
Accordingly, the Group continued to manage the Travel vertical 
for margin, particularly in the first half of the year. Trading 
improved in the second half relative to the same period last 
year and the Group has begun to refresh its travel offering 
commencing with the launch of a new package holidays channel 
early in the first quarter of 2011, supported by a new media 
campaign.
Other revenue, representing impression based advertising, fell 
by 8% due to reduced numbers of visitors compared to the 
same period last year, together with weaker demand from 
providers for advertising real estate. 20 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC

Home Services
The Home Services vertical offers customers the ability to 
search for, and compare, products for broadband, mobile 
telephones, vouchers, shopping and utilities. 
The KPIs for the Home Services vertical are shown below:

Revenue (£000) – total  6,206 5,539 12%
RPV  £0.26 £0.30 
RPT  £0.80 £1.03 
Revenue in the Home Services vertical increased by 12% from 
£5.5m to £6.2m in the year. Visitors increased by 32% largely 
from visitors to the shopping and vouchers channels. Revenue 
from utilities, which represents the largest channel in the 
vertical, increased particularly in the second half of the year  
as utility prices began to increase.
The increase in visitors to the shopping and vouchers channels, 
which are lower revenue generating channels, reduced the 
vertical’s RPV against the prior period.
Acquisition of Financial Services Net Limited
On 14 October 2010 the Group completed the acquisition  
of Financial Services Net Limited (‘FSN’) for an initial 
consideration of £4.4m, rising to a total consideration of up  
to £8.8m payable over 3 years depending on the achievement  
of certain financial targets and the conclusion of outstanding 
tax matters. Related costs of approximately £0.7m have been 
expensed in the year.
 
FSN owns and operates a number of website domains which 
will provide a platform for the Group to broaden its brand 
offering to a wider range of customer segments in the Money 
and Insurance verticals.
All consideration payments have been or will be settled in cash 
out of existing resources.
Cash Balance and Dividend
As at 31 December 2010 the Group had a cash balance of 
£36.6m. The Group continued to strengthen its cash position 
throughout the year after payment of dividends. 
Having reviewed the cash required by the business, the  
Board is recommending a final dividend, subject to shareholder 
approval, in respect of the year ended 31 December 2010  
of 2.53p per ordinary share. 
Together with the interim dividend of 1.3p per ordinary share 
paid on 17 September 2010, this gives a total dividend for  
the year of 3.83p per ordinary share, reflecting the Board’s 
confidence in the ability of the business to generate cash on  
an ongoing basis. 
The Board is committed to adopting a progressive dividend policy, 
with ongoing monitoring of the appropriate capital structure.
The ex-dividend date for the final dividend is 6 April 2011, with  
a record date of 8 April 2011 and a payment date of 13 May 2011. 
Shareholders have the opportunity to elect to reinvest their 
cash dividend and purchase existing shares in the Company 
through a Dividend Reinvestment Plan.

(2009: 40%). This is higher than the prevailing rate of 28% due to 
the tax effect of share based payments, a prior year adjustment 
arising on deferred tax, and other permanent differences 
mainly arising from professional fees and non-qualifying 
depreciation. In addition, the current year has been impacted by 
losses from its German operation of £0.6m for which a deferred 
tax asset has not been recognised. In future, the Group expects 
the underlying effective rate of tax to be close to the standard 
UK corporation tax rate.
Earnings per ordinary share 
Basic statutory earnings per ordinary share for the year to  
31 December 2010 was 1.5p (2009: 0.4p). Adjusted basic 
earnings per ordinary share increased from 4.6p to 5.2p per 
share. The adjusted earnings per ordinary share is based on 
profit before tax after adding back intangible amortisation, 
share-based payment charges arising from pre-listing share 
options and costs incurred in relation to the acquisition of 
Financial Services Net Limited. A tax rate of 28% (2009: 28%) 
has been applied to calculate adjusted profit after tax. 
Key contractual arrangements
Moneysupermarket.com Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, 
is party to contracts and other arrangements which the 
Directors judge are essential to the Group’s business.
As with any internet business the Group is dependent upon  
its ability to attract customers to its website either directly or 
through paid search or portal partners, and revenue generated 
from commercial arrangements with its providers.
The Group uses television advertising to attract customers  
to its website directly. The Group incurred costs of £18.9m 
(2009: £15.6m) relating to television and other offline advertising 
in 2010. The Group has contracts with a number of media 
agencies to acquire advertising inventory from commercial 
television companies. The Group typically has a commitment  
of between 6 and 10 weeks expenditure at any one time. 
Television and other offline advertising costs represent  
87% (2009: 85%) of distribution costs. 
The Group uses search engines to acquire traffic via paid 
search. The Group spent £29.6m (2009: £30.8m) on paid search  
in 2010. Although there are a number of search engines that 
operate in the UK, Google is the dominant search engine and 
accounts for the majority of the Group’s spend in this area.  
The Group has no forward commitment to search engines and 
manages its spend on a real time basis.
The Group has a number of contracts with portal partners 
which are not considered to be material with the exception  
of one portal partner which accounted for 7% (2009: 5%) of 
Group internet revenue in 2010.
The Group has a number of contracts with providers which are 
based either on a cost per click basis or a cost per action basis  
or a hybrid of the two. It also has a number of commercial 
arrangements based on the number of page impressions served 
in the case of banner advertising. The Group does not consider  
it has any material contracts with providers in any one channel. 
The Group does however frequently deal with providers  
across a range of different channels managed under different 
contracts, often to different parts of the same organisation,  
and occasionally through third party media agencies. At this 
consolidated channel level, the largest individual provider 
represented approximately 5% (2009: 4%) of Group internet 
revenue in 2010.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Risk area Potential impact Mitigation
Significant worsening 
in credit markets
Financial institutions may reduce the quantum 
of lending and tighten their acceptance criteria 
for customers seeking to obtain credit. This 
may reduce Group revenue. Providers may 
increase their focus on customer retention 
rather than acquisition. This may reduce 
commissions available to price comparison 
websites.
The Group continues to focus on building strong 
relationships with providers to ensure the Group is 
able to provide solutions to the needs of providers and 
to maximise the opportunities for providers to acquire 
customers in a cost effective manner. 
Reduction of providers Providers may consolidate, withdraw their 
products from price comparison websites or 
reduce their customer acquisition activity via 
price comparison websites. This may reduce 
competition for business, customer choice, 
Group revenue and the customer proposition  
of price comparison websites.
The Group continues to focus on building strong 
relationships with providers to ensure the Group is 
able to provide solutions to the needs of providers and 
to maximise the opportunities for providers to acquire 
customers in a cost effective manner. 
Revenue assurance Significant reduction of or a failure to recognise 
revenue from contracted providers where the 
Group is remunerated on a cost per action 
basis.
The Group will continue to perform independent 
reviews using third parties to gain assurance that the 
Group is being correctly remunerated for the sales it 
introduces to contracted providers.
Investment in new 
areas
Significant investments in new products  
and services or new geographies fails to  
make a return.
Investments in new areas typically leverage existing 
expertise and experience built up over many 
years. Capital requirements are relatively low and 
investment is managed in stages such that it is not 
finally committed until there is good visibility of a 
return.
Financial services 
and other markets 
regulation 
The business model in financial services or 
other lines of business may be compromised 
by changes to existing regulation or the 
introduction of new regulation.
The Group has a team of regulatory specialists who 
work with the business to ensure that it remains 
compliant with existing regulation and informed of 
impending regulation. The Group has embraced 
regulation to date and shares the vision of the 
regulators generally to make the market more 
transparent to the end customer.
The tables below summarise the material financial and operational risks to the Group  
and how the Group seeks to mitigate them in the day-to-day running of the business.

Annual Report 2010
Business Overview Business Review
Risk area Potential impact Mitigation
Competitive 
environment
Loss of market share and erosion of margins 
from increased competition.
The Group continues to focus on building market 
leading products to improve its proposition to 
customers. This includes investment in customer 
retention tools and technology including CRM 
initiatives which deliver additional features and 
functionality to customers.
Brand perception and 
reputation
Reduction in customer loyalty with existing 
customers and an inability to attract new 
customers if the business fails to maintain its 
position as a leading price comparison website 
or if its reputation is negatively impacted by  
any event, such as the loss or misuse of 
customer personal data.
Continued investment in television advertising 
reinforced through press activity will maintain the 
Group in customers’ minds. Rigorous checking of the 
website through audit and review will maintain the 
accuracy of the information displayed. Rigorous use 
of internal controls and testing of the Group’s systems 
will ensure the integrity and robustness of the 
Group’s systems. Additional investment in initiatives 
increases transparency to the customer helping to 
protect brand values. 
Business continuity, 
capacity and 
functionality of  
IT and systems
Failure to provide adequate service levels to 
customers or maintain revenue generating 
services.
The Group maintains two separate data centres with 
n + 1 redundancy in relation to its core infrastructure 
to ensure that service is maintained in the event of 
a disaster at the primary data centre. Developed 
software is rigorously tested and the Group operates 
a robust release process which mitigates the 
likelihood of software being released into a live 
environment without being fully tested.
Loss of key 
management
Loss of key management resulting in a lack of 
necessary expertise or continuity to execute 
strategy.
Existing key management and new hires are tied in 
through attractive equity incentive packages and 
rewarding career structures. In addition, succession 
plans have been developed for key members of the 
management team which are regularly reviewed.
Reliance on search 
engine natural listings
Reduction in gross margin through reduction 
in revenue derived from search engine 
optimisation activities.
The Group will continue to invest in sustainable 
search engine optimisation activities which adhere  
to search engine guidelines. 
Economic environment Reduction in visitors and revenue from a 
recession as customers seek to reduce levels 
of discretionary expenditure.
The Group continues to focus on building a wide range 
of market leading products to meet customers needs. 
Customers seeking to reduce levels of discretionary 
expenditure will also be looking to obtain ‘best’ 
value from compulsory products and services. The 
diversification of the Group both in the number of 
verticals that it operates in and the range of products 
and services it provides in each vertical should lessen 
the impact of a recession upon the Group although it 
cannot entirely mitigate against it.

Annual Report 2010
The Group operates with an underlying awareness of its wider 
responsibilities to society.
Communities and charities
The Group’s .Community initiative was launched in 2008 and has 
continued to develop throughout 2009 and 2010. The initiative is 
focused on providing support to charities located within a few 
miles of the Group’s offices in Ewloe and so support is targeted 
primarily in Flintshire and Cheshire.
A volunteer group of employees meet each month to review 
requests for donations from charities and to allocate funds 
according to agreed donation guidelines. Employees are also 
active in researching and seeking out local good causes that  
the Group can help support. The initiative has been effective  
at harnessing the energy and enthusiasm of the Group’s 
employees to benefit the communities in which it operates.
In 2010 the Group made £2,000 per month available for the  
.Community initiative. This funding has been channelled via  
the Charities Aid Foundation, enabling the Group to make gross 
donations to registered charities.
Over the course of the year the Group has supported  
23 charities including:
Clwyd Crimebeat
Welsh Scout Council
Money Advice Trust
Wrexham Group RDA
Claire House
Save The Family
Miles of Smiles
Samantha Dickson Brain Tumour Trust
Pride of Flintshire Children’s Awards
Hannah Jones for Brain Tumour Trust
North Wales Super Kids – Denbigh Home Start
The North Wales Chrysalis Trust
In addition to the .Community initiative, the Group and its 
employees continue to select and support a charity on an annual 
basis. 
The 2010 Charity of the Year was Hope House Childrens’ Hospice. 
The charity runs two centres, in Shropshire and Conwy, serving 
the North West of England and North Wales. The Hospice 
provides free care to terminally ill children and their families. 
Over the course of the year the Group’s employees raised £5,729 
for Hope House with the Group donating £5,729, bringing the total 
donated to Hope House during the year to £11,458.
Employees have selected Wales Air Ambulance as its 2011 Charity 
of the Year. The charity provides emergency air cover for 
individuals who face life threatening illness or injury via the 
operation of three helicopters.
Environment
The Group strives to reduce energy and raw material usage  
to support environmental and financial performance.
The Group has chosen not to set environmental key performance 
indicators due to its relative size and the limited impact it has on 
the environment. 
Employees
The Group actively encourages employee involvement and 
consultation and places considerable emphasis on keeping its 
employees informed of the Group’s activities via formal half yearly 
business performance updates, regular update briefings, regular 
team meetings, the Group’s intranet site which enables easy 
access to the latest Group information as well as Group policies, 
and the circulation to employees of relevant information including 
corporate announcements. This also helps to achieve a common 
awareness amongst employees of the financial and economic 
factors affecting the performance of the Group. 
The Group has an established employee forum through which 
nominated representatives ensure that employees’ views are 
taken into account regarding issues that are likely to affect them. 
A robust employee engagement survey process is also in place to 
ensure that employees are given a voice in the organisation and 
that the Group can take action based on employee feedback.
The Group is committed to an equal opportunities policy.  
The Group aims to ensure that no employee is discriminated 
against, directly or indirectly, on the grounds of colour, race, 
ethnic and national origins, sexual orientation or gender, marital 
status, disability, religion or belief, being part time or on the 
grounds of age.
The Group recognises the importance of health and safety  
and the positive benefits to the Group. Therefore the Group’s 
commitment to health and safety makes good business  
sense. The Group has a health and safety policy which is 
communicated to all employees through a health and safety 
handbook, which is regularly reviewed and updated.
Supporting students
In order to build links between the Group and local schools  
and colleges, work experience and placements are offered  
to a number of students. In doing so, the Group strives to  
make work placements positive, challenging and relevant to 
participants’ current studies and their future job prospects.
Customers
The Group is committed to providing a high quality price 
comparison service to its customers, enabling them to compare  
a wide range of products in the money, insurance, travel and 
home services markets, and to find the product most suited  
to their needs.
To maintain high levels of customer satisfaction, the Group  
is constantly assessing the views of its customers and 
undertaking customer testing of its websites and any new 
developments it makes. The Group provides customers with 
information from a wide variety of sources such as editorial 
content, customer and expert reviews, forums and community 
features to enrich their experience and to help them find the 
product most suited to their needs.

Research and development
Innovation is important to the future success of the Group and

Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a

In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, all of the Directors will 
retire at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and, being 
eligible, will offer themselves for election or re-election.

Directors’ interests
Details of the Directors’ and their connected persons’ interests 
in the ordinary shares of the Company are set out in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 37 to 42. No Director 
has any other interest in any shares or loan stock of any

The details of transactions with Directors of the Company  
and related party transactions in the financial year ended  
31 December 2010 are set out in note 21 to the Group Financial 
Statements on pages 65 and 66. During the year, no Director

Directors’ and officers’ insurance and indemnities
During the financial year ended 31 December 2010 and up to the 
date of this report, the Company has maintained liability insurance 
for its Directors and officers. 
The Company has granted indemnities to each of its Directors 
and the Company Secretary to the extent permitted by law and 
its Articles of Association. Qualifying third party indemnity 
provisions and qualifying pension scheme indemnity provisions 
were in force throughout 2010 and remain in force as at the date 
of this report in relation to certain losses and liabilities which 
the Directors or Company Secretary may incur in the course of 
acting as Directors, Company Secretary or employees of the 
Company or of any associated company.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect  
of the Annual Report and the Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual  
Report and the Group and Company Financial Statements  
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
Company Financial Statements for each financial year. Under 
that law they are required to prepare the Group Financial 
Statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU  
and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Company 
Financial Statements in accordance with UK Accounting 
Standards and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give  
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing 
each of the Group and Company Financial Statements, the 
Directors are required to:
Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them • 
consistently.
Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and • 
prudent.
For the Group Financial Statements, state whether they • 
have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU.
For the Company Financial Statements, state whether • 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the Company Financial Statements.
Prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern • 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any  
time the financial position of the Company and enable them  
to ensure that its Financial Statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Report  
that complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities pursuant  
to Disclosure and Transparency Rules 4.1.12
Each of the Directors whose names and functions are set out on 
pages 24 and 25 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
The Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with the • 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole.
The business review includes a fair review of the • 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the undertakings included  
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties  
that they face.
Internal control
The Corporate Governance Report and Audit Committee Report 
on pages 31 to 35 includes the Board’s assessment of the 
Group’s system of internal controls and consideration of the 
guidance issued by the Turnbull Committee of the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of England and Wales.
Employees
The Group places considerable value on the involvement  
of its employees and uses a number of ways to engage with 
employees on matters that impact them and the performance 
of the Group. These include formal half yearly business 
performance updates by members of the executive 
management team for all employees, regular update briefings 
for all employees, regular team meetings, the Group’s intranet 
site which enables easy access to the latest Group information 
as well as Group policies, and the circulation to employees of 
results announcements and other corporate announcements. 
This also helps to achieve a common awareness amongst 
employees of the financial and economic factors affecting  
the performance of the Group.  30 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC
Annual Report 2010
The Group has an established employee forum through which 
nominated representatives ensure that employees’ views are 
taken into account regarding issues that are likely to affect 
them. A robust employee engagement survey process is also  
in place to ensure that employees are given a voice in the 
organisation and that the Group can take action based on 
employee feedback.
All employees are able to participate in the  
Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC Share Incentive Plan which 
gives employees the opportunity to purchase ordinary shares in 
the Company using money deducted from their pre-tax salary 
on a monthly basis. This helps to encourage employee interest 
in the performance of the Group.
Equal opportunities
The Group is committed to providing equality of opportunity  
to all employees without discrimination and applies fair and 
equitable employment policies which seek to promote entry  
into and progression within the Group. Appointments are 
determined solely by application of job criteria, personal ability, 
behaviour and competency.
Disabled persons
Disabled persons have equal opportunities when applying  
for vacancies, with due regard to their skills and abilities. 
Procedures ensure that disabled employees are fairly treated  
in respect of training and career development. For those 
employees becoming disabled during the course of their 
employment, the Group is supportive so as to provide an 
opportunity for them to remain with the Group, wherever 
reasonably practicable. 
In the opinion of the Directors, all employee policies are deemed 
to be effective and in accordance with their intended aims.
Borrowings
The Group did not have any borrowings during the financial year 
ended 31 December 2010 (2009: £nil).
Financial risk management
It is the Group’s objective to manage its financial risk so as to 
minimise the adverse fluctuations in the financial markets on 
the Group’s profitability and cash flow. The specific policies for 
managing each of the Group’s main financial risk areas are set 
out in note 17 to the Group Financial Statements on page 62.
Political and charitable donations
During the financial year ended 31 December 2010, the Group 
did not make any political donations (2009: £nil) and made 
charitable donations of £29,729 (2009: £33,379).
Creditor payment policy
It is Group policy to agree terms and conditions for its business 
transactions with suppliers. Payment is made in accordance 
with these terms provided the supplier meets its obligations. 
The average number of trade creditor days outstanding for the 
Group at 31 December 2010 was 50.8 days (2009: 58.4). The 
Company is a holding company and therefore had no trade 
creditors at 31 December 2010 (2009: nil).
Disclosure of information to auditors
The Directors who held office at the date of this report confirm 
that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and 
each such Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have 
taken as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information, and to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information.
Auditors
KPMG Audit Plc have indicated their willingness to accept 
reappointment as auditors of the Company. A resolution 
proposing their reappointment is contained in the notice of the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting and will be proposed to 
shareholders at that meeting.
Annual General Meeting
The forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company will 
be held at Doubletree by Hilton Chester Hotel, Warrington Road, 
Hoole, Chester, CH2 3PD on Wednesday 4 May 2011 at 11.00am.

of the Company, with details of the business to be transacted at 
the meeting and explanatory notes, is set out in a separate 
circular which has been sent to all shareholders at the same 
time as this report.

Directors’ Report continued Business Overview Business Review Management Corporate Responsibility General
31 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC
Annual Report 2010
Financial Statements Corporate Governance
The Board of Directors (‘Board’) of Moneysupermarket.com 
Group PLC (‘Company’) is committed to high standards of 
corporate governance and supports the principles laid down in 
the revised Combined Code on Corporate Governance 
published in June 2008 by the Financial Reporting Council 
(‘Combined Code’). This Corporate Governance Report 
describes how the principles of the Combined Code are applied 
by the Company and reports on the Company’s compliance with 
the Combined Code’s provisions. 
Compliance
The Board considers that the Company has complied with the 
provisions of the Combined Code throughout the year ended  
31 December 2010 and to the date of this report except as set 
out below. 
Board of Directors
The Board currently has nine members, comprising the 
Non-Executive Chairman, Gerald Corbett, three Independent 
Non-Executive Directors, Michael Wemms, Rob Rowley and 
Bruce Carnegie-Brown, and five Executive Directors, Simon 
Nixon, Paul Doughty, Peter Plumb, Graham Donoghue and 
David Osborne. Michael Wemms has been designated as the 
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. 
The Board normally meets on at least eight occasions in each 
financial year including a two day strategy conference. To 
enable the Non-Executive Directors to more freely discuss the 
performance of the Group’s management, the Chairman meets 
with the Non-Executive Directors at least once each year 
without the Executive Directors present.
The Board considers that all the Directors are able to devote 
sufficient time to their duties as Directors. Biographies of the 
Board are set out on pages 24 and 25 including details of the 
significant commitments of the Chairman. The Board is 
satisfied that these appointments do not conflict with the 
Chairman’s ability to carry out his duties and responsibilities 
effectively for the Group. 
Independence/Non-Executive Directors
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors bring wide  
and varied commercial experience to Board and Committee 
deliberations. The practice of the Company is to appoint 
Non-Executive Directors for specified terms of three years, 
subject to a maximum of up to 12 months’ notice within that 
period and also subject to re-election and to Companies Act 
provisions relating to the removal of a Director. Each of the 
Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, currently 
holds a letter of appointment reflecting this.
The Board considers that Gerald Corbett was independent  
on appointment as Chairman and considers Michael Wemms, 
Rob Rowley and Bruce Carnegie-Brown to be independent, 
being independent in character and judgement and free from 
relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect,  
or could appear to affect, their judgement. 
Conflicts of interest
The Company’s Articles of Association were amended at the 
2008 Annual General Meeting, in line with the Companies Act 
2006, to allow the Board to authorise potential conflicts of 
interest that may arise and to impose limits or conditions, 
as appropriate, when giving any authorisation. Any decision  
of the Board to authorise a conflict of interest is only effective  
if it is agreed without the conflicted Directors voting or without 
their votes being counted and in making such a decision, the 
Directors must act in a way they consider in good faith will  
be most likely to promote the success of the Company. 
The Company has established a procedure for the appropriate 
authorisation to be sought prior to appointment of any new 
Director or prior to a new conflict arising and for the regular 
review of actual or potential conflicts of interest. During the 
year, this procedure was adhered to and operated effectively.
Relationship Agreement
The majority shareholder of the Company is Simon Nixon.  
The Company and Simon Nixon entered into a relationship 
agreement on 11 July 2007 to regulate the ongoing relationship 
between them (‘Relationship Agreement’). The principal 
purpose of the Relationship Agreement is to ensure that  
the Company is capable of carrying on its business 
independently of Simon Nixon, and that transactions and 
relationships with Simon Nixon are at arm’s length and on 
normal commercial terms.
The Company and Simon Nixon have agreed in the Relationship 
Agreement that Simon Nixon is entitled to appoint (such number 
including himself as a Director) one Non-Executive Director for 
as long as he holds the beneficial interest in at least 15% of the 
ordinary shares of the Company, two Non-Executive Directors 
for as long as he holds the beneficial interest in at least 30% of 
the ordinary shares of the Company and three Non-Executive 
Directors for as long as he holds the beneficial interest in at 
least 50% of the ordinary shares of the Company. The 
Relationship Agreement will terminate if Simon Nixon holds 
less than 15% of the ordinary shares of the Company.
The Relationship Agreement also includes a protocol to be 
observed in relation to any Non-Executive Director appointed  
by Simon Nixon to deal with potential conflicts of interest and 
the provision of confidential information.
As at the date of this report, Simon Nixon had not appointed  
any Non-Executive Directors pursuant to his rights in the 
Relationship Agreement.
Division of responsibilities
The positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are  
not combined, ensuring a clear division of responsibility at the  
head of the Company. The division of roles and responsibilities 
between the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is clearly 
established, set out in writing and has been approved by  
the Board. 
The Chairman is responsible for leadership of the Board, 
setting its agenda and monitoring its effectiveness. He ensures 
effective communication with shareholders and that the Board 
is aware of the views of major shareholders. He facilitates  
both the contribution of the Non-Executive Directors and 
constructive relations between the Executive and  
Non-Executive Directors. 
Corporate Governance Report 32 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC
Annual Report 2010
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the day to day running of the Group, carrying out agreed strategy and implementing 
specific Board decisions.
Role of the Board
The Board is collectively responsible for the Group’s performance and meets regularly to review the operation and performance  
of the Group. The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for decision making and matters delegated to Committees 
of the Board which are available on the Group’s website at www.moneysupermarket.com. These include the Group’s strategy; 
business plan and annual budget; acquisitions and disposals; and other major investments and capital projects.
There is an established procedure for the preparation and approval each year by the Board of business plans and the annual 
budget. The Board receives reports on performance against the business plan and budget and reviews any significant variances 
each time it meets. This information enables business performance to be monitored, evaluated, discussed and challenged where 
necessary and enables informed, sound decisions to be made. At least one of the Board’s regular meetings each year is devoted  
to reviewing and approving the Group’s strategic direction.
Board Committees
The Board has three principal Committees (Audit, Nomination and Remuneration) to which various matters are delegated. The 
Committees all have formal written terms of reference that have been approved by the Board and are published on the Group’s 
website at www.moneysupermarket.com. They are also available in hard copy form on application to the Company Secretary.
Details of the work of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees are given in the reports of those Committees on

Directors
The Company’s Articles of Association require that new Directors appointed by the Board must retire and submit themselves for 
election by shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting following their appointment. The Company’s Articles of Association 
further require that all Directors must retire and submit themselves for re-election at least every three years. In accordance with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, all of the Directors will retire at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and, being eligible, 
will offer themselves for re-election.

Annual Report 2010
Financial Statements Corporate Governance
The Company provides Directors’ and officers’ insurance cover 
for the benefit of Directors in respect of claims arising in the 
performance of their duties. The Company has also granted 
indemnities to each of its Directors and the Company Secretary 
to the extent permitted by law and its Articles of Association. 
Board evaluation
The Board has established a formal process for the annual 
evaluation of the performance of the Board, its Committees  
and individual Directors. Questionnaires were prepared which 
provided the framework for the evaluation process. Each 
Director completed the questionnaires commenting on the 
performance of the other Directors, the Board and each 
Committee and submitted the completed questionnaires  
for collation. 
Utilising the responses to the questionnaires, the Chairman has 
conducted interviews with each Director and assessed their 
individual performance. The Chairman has carried out an 
evaluation of the performance of the Board as a whole and  
of each Committee and, led by the Senior Independent  
Non-Executive Director, the Non-Executive Directors have  
met and assessed the performance of the Chairman taking  
into account the views of the Executive Directors. 
The conclusions of those evaluations have been presented  
to the Board by the Chairman and the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director. The evaluation process is designed  
to cover Board processes, the structure and capability of the 
Board, strategic alignment, Board dynamics and the skills 
brought to the Board by each Director. 
The Board evaluation process identified strengths and 
development areas and confirmed that the Board and its 
Committees were operating effectively. The principal 
development areas included the need for a greater focus on  
the Group’s competitors and its employees, each of which would 
become regular agenda items at Board and Committee meetings.
Development
The Chairman and Company Secretary are responsible for 
preparing and implementing an induction programme for 
Directors, including business related presentations by senior 
management below Board level, as well as guidance on their 
duties, responsibilities and liabilities as a Director of the Company. 
Every Director has access to appropriate training as required 
following their appointment and is encouraged to develop their 
understanding of the Group.
Information
Board members are given appropriate documentation in a 
timely manner in advance of each Board or Committee meeting. 
This normally includes a detailed report on current trading and 
full papers on matters where the Board or Committee will be 
required to make a decision or give its approval. Specific 
business related presentations are given by senior 
management below Board level when appropriate.
The Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary. The Company Secretary is responsible for 
ensuring that Board procedures are followed and providing advice 
to the Board on corporate governance. Both the appointment  
and removal of the Company Secretary are matters for the Board 
as a whole. 
Directors can, where they judge it necessary to discharge their 
responsibilities as Directors, obtain independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense. No such advice was sought  
by any Director during the year. Directors have the right to 
require that any concerns they may have are recorded in the 
appropriate Board or Committee minutes.
Shareholder relations
The Board is committed to establishing and maintaining  
good communications with shareholders. Senior executives, 
including the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer regularly meet with analysts and institutional 
shareholders to keep them informed of significant 
developments and to develop an understanding of their views 
which are reported back to the Board. Formal presentations 
are given to analysts and shareholders covering the full year 
and half year results. The Company Secretary deals with 
questions from individual shareholders.
The results and results presentations, together with all 
information reported to the market via the regulatory 
information service, press releases and other shareholder 
information, are published on the Group’s website at  
www.moneysupermarket.com to be viewed and accessed  
by all shareholders.
The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, Michael 
Wemms, is available to shareholders if they have concerns 
which contact through the normal channels of Chairman, Chief 
Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer has failed to resolve, 
or for which such contact is inappropriate.
All shareholders will have the opportunity to ask questions  
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. The Chairmen of 
the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees will be 
available to answer questions at that meeting. Shareholders 
may also contact the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer or,  
if more appropriate, the Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director to raise any issue with one or all of the Non-Executive 
Directors of the Company.
The Company will prepare separate resolutions on each 
substantially separate issue at the forthcoming Annual  
General Meeting. The result of the vote on each resolution  
will be published on the Group’s website after the Annual 
General Meeting and will be announced via the regulatory 
information service. 34 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC
Annual Report 2010
Internal control and risk management 
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of  
internal control and risk management and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. The system of internal control is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The key features of the Group’s system of internal control and 
risk management are:
A comprehensive annual business planning and budgeting • 
process, requiring Board approval, against which the 
Group’s actual performance and any significant variances 
are regularly reviewed by the Board.
A schedule of matters reserved for the Board’s approval  • 
to ensure it maintains control over appropriate strategic, 
financial, organisational, compliance and capital 
investment issues.
An organisation structure with clearly defined lines of • 
responsibility and delegation of authority.
Regular reviews by management and the Audit Committee • 
of the key risks facing the Group and the actions being 
taken to mitigate and manage those key risks.
An annual two day strategy conference to discuss and • 
approve the Group’s strategic direction, plans and 
objectives and the risks to achieving them.
In addition, the Audit Committee receives:
Reports from the external auditors in relation to the • 
Financial Statements and the material financial reporting 
judgements contained in them.
Reports from the external auditors in relation to the • 
system of internal control and the reviews by the external 
auditors of that system.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of  
the Group’s system of internal control and risk management  
during the financial year ended 31 December 2010. The Board 
considers that in the context of the control environment 
described above, the Group’s system of internal control  
and risk management is effective and satisfactory.
Share capital
Details of the Company’s share capital are set out in the 
Directors’ Report on pages 27 and 28.
Compliance with the Combined Code
The Directors consider that during the financial year ended  
31 December 2010 and to the date of this report, the Company 
complied with the Combined Code except as follows:
A.3.2 – During the year at least half the Board, excluding  
the Chairman, did not comprise Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. The Directors consider that the Board is of sufficient 
size and diversity that the balance of skills and experience  
is considered to be appropriate for the requirements of the 
Group at the current time. 
B.2.1 – Prior to the appointment of Bruce Carnegie-Brown on  
15 April 2010, the Remuneration Committee did not comprise at 
least three Independent Non-Executive Directors.
C.3.1 – Prior to the appointment of Bruce Carnegie-Brown on  
15 April 2010, the Audit Committee did not comprise at least 
three Independent Non-Executive Directors.
D.1.1 – As a result of regular feedback provided to the Board by 
the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer following their dialogue with major shareholders, the 
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director believes he is 
aware of the views of major shareholders. Unless requested by 
major shareholders, the Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director does not attend meetings with them.

financial year ended 31 December 2010.
Composition of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the four Non-Executive 
Directors, Rob Rowley (Chairman of the Audit Committee),  
Gerald Corbett, Michael Wemms and Bruce Carnegie-Brown 
(since 15 April 2010). Rob Rowley, Michael Wemms and Bruce 
Carnegie-Brown are considered by the Board to be independent. 
Gerald Corbett was considered by the Board to be independent on 
appointment. Biographies of the members of the Audit Committee 
are set out on pages 24 and 25. Rob Rowley is a qualified 
accountant and was formerly finance director of Reuters plc and 
chairman of the audit committee at Prudential plc. He is currently 
chairman of the audit committee at Capital Shopping Centres 
Group PLC. The Board is satisfied that Rob Rowley has recent  
and relevant financial experience.
Operation of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee met on three occasions during the year. 
Details of the attendance at Audit Committee meetings are set  
out in the Corporate Governance Report on page 32.
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, together 
with the external auditors, will normally attend meetings at the 
invitation of the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The external 
auditors are regularly invited by the Audit Committee to advise 
them of any matters which they consider should be brought to  
the Audit Committee’s attention without the Executive Directors 
present. The external auditors may also request a meeting with 
the Audit Committee if they consider it necessary.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Audit Committee. 
The members of the Audit Committee can, where they judge it 
necessary to discharge their responsibilities, obtain independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense. 
The Audit Committee’s duties include:
Monitoring the financial reporting process. • 
Monitoring the statutory audit of the Group’s Financial • 
Statements.
Reviewing the Group’s Financial Statements and the material • 
financial reporting judgements contained in them.
Monitoring the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control • 
and risk management systems.
Reviewing and monitoring the independence of the external • 
auditors and the provision of additional services to the Group.
Advising the Board on the appointment and removal of the • 
external auditors and the remuneration and terms of 
engagement of the external auditors.
Reviewing the Group’s whistle blowing procedures. • 
The Audit Committee undertakes its activities in line with an 
annual work plan. The Audit Committee agrees the scope of the 
audit work and discusses the results of the full year audit and half 
year review each year. 
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee are published  
on the Group’s website at www.moneysupermarket.com and  
are available in hard copy form on application to the  
Company Secretary.
During the year, the Audit Committee reviewed the Group’s 
whistle blowing procedures to ensure arrangements are in place 
to enable employees to raise concerns about possible malpractice 
Audit Committee Report
or wrongdoing by the Group or any of its employees on a 
confidential basis. This includes arrangements to proportionately 
and independently investigate such matters and for appropriate 
follow-up action.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
control and risk management and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
The Audit Committee monitors and reviews each year the 
effectiveness of, and the framework for, the Group’s system of 
internal control and risk management. This includes annual 
consideration as to whether there is a need to establish an 
internal audit function.
The Audit Committee undertook a review of the effectiveness of, 
and the framework for, the Group’s system of internal control and 
risk management, including financial, operational and compliance 
controls during the year. In addition to this review, the external 
auditors provided the Audit Committee with comprehensive 
reports of the results of their controls testing as part of the 
external audit. On a half yearly basis, the Audit Committee also 
reviewed the key risks facing the Group and the actions being 
taken by management to mitigate and manage them.
During the year the Audit Committee considered the need to 
establish an internal audit function and concluded that the control 
systems are sufficient for the size and complexity of the Group 
such that an internal audit function is not required at this time. 
This will be reviewed in 2011.
Review of the work of the external auditors
Subject to the annual appointment of the external auditors  
by shareholders, the Audit Committee regularly reviews the 
relationship between the Group and the external auditors.  
This review includes an assessment of their performance, 
cost-effectiveness, objectivity and independence.
The Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring that an 
appropriate relationship is maintained between the Group and the 
external auditors. The Group has implemented a policy of 
controlling the provision of non-audit services by the external 
auditors in order to ensure that their objectivity and independence 
is safeguarded. This control is exercised by ensuring that all 
non-audit services are subject to the prior approval of the Audit 
Committee. During the year, the Audit Committee continued with 
the appointment of other accountancy firms to provide certain  
non-audit services to the Group and anticipates that this will 
continue in 2011.
The Audit Committee, having considered the external auditors’ 
performance during their period in office, recommends their 
reappointment. A full breakdown of the audit and non-audit 
related fees is set out in note 5 to the Group Financial 
Statements on page 55. The Audit Committee discussed the 
level of fees and considered them appropriate given the current 
size of the Group. The Audit Committee is satisfied that the level 
and scope of non-audit services undertaken by the external 
auditors does not impair their independence and objectivity.

audited the content of the report described as ‘Audited 
Information’ to the extent required by law.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the four Non-
Executive Directors, Michael Wemms (Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee), Gerald Corbett, Rob Rowley and 
Bruce Carnegie-Brown (since 15 April 2010). Michael Wemms, 
Rob Rowley and Bruce Carnegie-Brown are considered by the 
Board to be independent. Gerald Corbett was considered by the 
Board to be independent on appointment. Biographies of the

24 and 25.
At the invitation of the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer 
and Human Resources Director may attend meetings of the 
Remuneration Committee, except when their own remuneration 
is under consideration. No Director is involved in determining 
his or her own remuneration. The Company Secretary acts as 
secretary to the Remuneration Committee. The members of the 
Remuneration Committee can, where they judge it necessary to 
discharge their responsibilities, obtain independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense.
The Remuneration Committee’s duties include: 
Determining and agreeing with the Board the framework • 
and policy for the remuneration of the Chairman, Executive 
Directors, Company Secretary and executive management 
team.
Determining the remuneration package of the Chairman, • 
Executive Directors, Company Secretary and executive 
management team, including, where appropriate, bonuses, 
incentive payments and pension arrangements within  
the terms of the agreed framework and policy.
Determining awards under the Company’s long term • 
incentive schemes.
The Remuneration Committee met on five occasions during  
the year. Details of the attendance at Remuneration Committee 
meetings are set out in the Corporate Governance Report on 
page 32. 
The Remuneration Committee’s terms of reference are 
published on the Group’s website at  
www.moneysupermarket.com and are available in hard copy 
form on application to the Company Secretary.
Advisors
During the year, the Remuneration Committee received advice 
from Towers Watson and MM&K Limited, each of whom are 
independent remuneration consultants, in connection with 
remuneration matters including market comparison salary 
benchmarking data and best practice, and the development of 
the Group’s performance related remuneration policy – with 
Towers Watson taking over as advisors during the year. Towers 
Watson is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group 
and is committed to that group’s voluntary code of practice for 
remuneration consultants in the UK. Neither Towers Watson 
nor MM&K Limited has any other connection or relationship 
with the Group. Neither Towers Watson nor MM&K Limited 
provided any other services to the Group during the financial 
year ended 31 December 2010.
Remuneration policy and objectives
The remuneration policy with respect to the Executive Directors 
has been designed to provide market competitive remuneration 
relative to a peer group of UK companies of similar size and 
scope to the Group.
The principal objective of the remuneration policy is to provide 
market competitive levels of remuneration in a form and 
amount necessary to attract, retain and motivate Executive 
Directors of appropriate calibre and experience, and that will 
reward successful execution of the Group’s short term and  
long term strategy. The Remuneration Committee believes  
that this requires:
The provision of mid-market base salaries with appropriate • 
leverage to reward sustained exceptional performance 
provided stretching and demanding performance 
conditions are met.
A reward structure that balances short term and long term • 
performance.
Competitive incentive arrangements that are underpinned • 
by a balance of financial and operational performance 
metrics to provide both a focus on business performance 
and alignment with the interests of shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the remuneration  
of Executive Directors should provide an appropriate balance 
between fixed and variable (performance related) pay elements 
with a significant proportion of potential total remuneration being 
performance related elements. For target performance in 2011  
it is anticipated that approximately 60% of total remuneration  
for Executive Directors will be performance related.
The Remuneration Committee will continue to review the 
remuneration policy to ensure it remains consistent with best 
remuneration practice and is aligned to shareholders’ interests. 
The Remuneration Committee believes the policy described 
above, which applied in 2010, remains appropriate and that it 
will continue in 2011.
Components of remuneration
The main components of the remuneration packages of the 
Executive Directors consist of the following elements.  38 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC
Annual Report 2010
The awards normally vest at the end of the three year 
performance period, subject to the achievement of the 
performance conditions and continued employment.  
Awards lapse to the extent that the performance conditions  
are not achieved. 
The maximum award that can be made to an employee in any 
financial year is the equivalent of 200% of an employee’s annual 
base salary, calculated on the basis of the market price of the 
Company’s shares at the date of grant.
In 2010, awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan were  
made to 38 employees of the Group and were made over  
shares worth between 60% and 200% of those employees’ 
annual base salaries.*
For the awards made in 2010, as detailed below, vesting of 70% 
of the award is subject to an absolute total shareholder return 
(TSR) performance condition and vesting of the remaining 30% 
of the award is subject to a comparative TSR performance 
condition. Both of these performance conditions are assessed 
over a three year performance period as detailed below.
For the absolute TSR element of the award to vest in full, the 
annual compound TSR of the Company must be at least 20% 
over the period 2010 to 2012 (inclusive).
No award will vest in relation to the absolute TSR element for 
performance below threshold, with 50% of the absolute TSR 
element of the award vesting at threshold performance of 
annual compound TSR of 10%, rising to 150% vesting at stretch 
performance of annual compound TSR of 20% on a straight-line 
basis. In order for the absolute TSR element to vest, the 
Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that such vesting is 
justified when taking into account the underlying financial 
performance of the Company. 
For the comparative TSR element of the award to vest in full, 
the Company’s relative TSR must rank in the upper quartile of 
the FTSE 250 (excluding Investment Trusts) over the period 
2010 to 2012 (inclusive).
No award will vest in relation to the comparative TSR element 
for performance below median, with 30% of the comparative 
TSR element of the award vesting at median performance, 
rising to 150% vesting at upper quartile performance on a 
straight-line basis. In order for the comparative TSR element to 
vest, the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that such 
vesting is justified when taking into account the underlying 
financial performance of the Company.
The Remuneration Committee chose the combination of 
absolute TSR and comparative TSR as the performance targets 
for the 2010 award under the Long Term Incentive Plan to 
provide closer alignment of management with shareholder 
interests and to incentivise management to generate long  
term sustainable returns for shareholders. The Remuneration 
Committee believes that the absolute TSR performance target 
also provides closer alignment with underlying financial 
performance than relative TSR growth alone.
The Remuneration Committee will meet once the results for the 
three year plan period are available to determine whether, and 
the extent to which, the performance conditions have been met.
Base salary
Base salary for each Executive Director is reviewed annually by 
the Remuneration Committee, taking account of the Director’s 
performance, experience and responsibilities; the annual salary 
review budget for the Group; business performance; and 
remuneration levels at a peer group of UK companies of similar 
size and scope to the Group. When determining Executive 
Director’s base salaries, the Remuneration Committee also has 
regard to the remuneration and employment terms and 
conditions including levels of pay for Group employees.
Performance related bonus
Targets are approved by the Remuneration Committee at the 
beginning of each year and are aligned to internal targets and 
strategic business objectives. 
For 2010, up to 125% of base salary for Peter Plumb and 100% of 
base salary for each of the other Executive Directors (excluding 
Simon Nixon) were payable for the achievement of target 
performance. For the achievement of exceptional performance 
targets a maximum bonus of 175% of base salary for the Chief 
Executive Officer and 150% of base salary for each of the other 
Executive Directors (excluding Simon Nixon) were payable.
In setting bonus targets, the Remuneration Committee seeks  
to link targets to areas of the business in which the Executive 
Directors have particular influence and responsibility, while 
also seeking to maintain a keen team ethos. The Executive 
Directors’ bonuses are based on a variety of individual and team 
objectives (which for 2010 comprised between 30% to 40% of 
the total bonus) and financial targets (which for 2010 comprised 
between 60% to 70% of the total bonus). The bonus that 
resulted from the delivery of these objectives was reviewed by 
the Remuneration Committee based on its view of the Executive 
Director’s overall performance.
The core targets for the 2010 bonus included the delivery of 
returns to shareholders through an adjusted EBITDA financial 
target and increases to the proportion of direct to site visitors, 
the total number of visitors and employee engagement through 
the individual and team objectives.
For 2010, performance against the adjusted EBITDA financial 
target exceeded target performance and the individual and 
team objectives were partially met. Bonus awards for the 
Executive Directors ranged from 95% to 134% of base salary.
The bonus structure for the Executive Directors for 2011 was 
reviewed and it was felt appropriate to place greater emphasis 
on financial targets (which for 2011 will comprise 80% of the 
total bonus) and to increase the bonus potential for Paul 
Doughty from 100% to 110% of base salary for target 
performance and from 150% to 160% of base salary for the 
maximum potential bonus. The individual and team objectives 
will also be different to reflect the key strategic objectives of the 
Group in 2011.
Long Term Incentive Plan 
Conditional nil cost share awards are made by Appleby Trust 
(Jersey) Limited, as trustee of the Company’s Employee Benefit 
Trust, following recommendations made by the Board. The levels 
of award and the performance conditions are recommended and 
reviewed by the Remuneration Committee annually.

Dividends will accrue on any shares that vest in the form either of additional shares or a cash payment and will be made at the time 
of vesting.
*These figures relate to the maximum available if the performance targets are met in full, representing 150% of the actual awards made.
Share Option Scheme
Prior to the listing of the Company on 31 July 2007 (‘Listing’), the Group operated the Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group 
Limited Share Option Scheme. All options under this scheme were granted prior to Listing and the Group does not intend to grant 
any further options under this scheme. All remaining options under this scheme held by the Executive Directors vested in February 
2010 and were exercised during 2010 (see page 42 for further details). There were no performance conditions applicable to this 
scheme as it was a historic scheme used prior to Listing principally as a means of retaining key employees. 
Pension 
The Company operates a contributory money purchase pension scheme for the benefit of the Executive Directors. In all cases, 
base salary only is pensionable. During the year, the Company provided pension contributions of up to 10% of base salary for the 
benefit of the Executive Directors. 
Car allowance
The Company provides a car allowance of £14,000 per annum for each of the Executive Directors. The amount of the car allowance 
is reviewed annually.
Share Incentive Plan
The Company’s HMRC approved all employee Share Incentive Plan provides all employees with the opportunity to purchase 
ordinary shares in the Company on a monthly basis using money deducted from their pre-tax salary.
Chairman’s Share Award
Under a share award agreement between the Company and Gerald Corbett dated 31 July 2007 (‘Share Award’), Gerald Corbett  
was entitled to subscribe at nominal value for 235,294 ordinary shares in the Company (representing twice the number of shares 
he purchased on Listing with an investment of £200,000), conditional upon completion of three years’ service as Chairman of  
the Company from Listing and the continued retention for that three year period of the 117,647 ordinary shares he purchased  
on Listing. Shareholder approval was obtained prior to the entry by the Company into the Share Award. 
Following the payment of the special dividend of 4.93p per ordinary share on 16 October 2009, the Remuneration Committee approved  
in February 2010 an adjustment to the Share Award in accordance with the rules of the Share Award. As a result of that adjustment, 
Gerald Corbett became entitled to subscribe at nominal value for an additional 13,318 ordinary shares in the Company reflecting the 
reduction in the value of the Share Award arising from the payment of that special dividend.
Gerald Corbett exercised his rights under the Share Award during 2010 and subscribed for 248,612 ordinary shares in the 
Company, representing the original Share Award entitlement to subscribe for 235,294 ordinary shares and the additional  
13,318 ordinary shares approved by the Remuneration Committee. Following such exercise, the Share Award ceased to exist.
Service agreements
The current policy is for Executive Directors’ service agreement notice periods to be normally no longer than 12 months. The 
service agreements of the current Executive Directors and the letters of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors include

Peter Plumb’s service agreement contains a temporary provision which states that, if his employment is terminated by the 
Company as a result of a change in control, wrongful dismissal or redundancy before 1 November 2011, he will be entitled to the 
sum of £225,000 less the market value of any shares received or receivable by him pursuant to his participation in the Group’s Long 
Term Incentive Plan and less any tax payable on such sum, in addition to his 12 month notice period. Thereafter, Peter Plumb’s 
notice period will revert to the normal 12 months which reflects the Company’s general policy on such matters.
Subject to the above, there are no special provisions for Executive Directors or Non-Executive Directors with regard to 
compensation in the event of loss of office. In the event of the employment of an Executive Director being terminated, the 
Remuneration Committee would, having regard to the individual’s circumstances, pay due regard to best practice and take  
account of the individual’s duty to mitigate their loss.
The service agreements and letters of appointment are available for inspection by shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting and during normal business hours at the Company’s registered office address.
Other appointments
Executive Directors may only accept outside appointments on external boards or committees with the prior approval of the Board. 
In addition to his directorship of companies in the Group, Simon Nixon is a director of Simonseeks.com Limited in which Simon 
Nixon is, directly or indirectly, the majority shareholder. No other Executive Director holds any directorship of any other company 
outside the Group.
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements but instead have letters of appointment for a three year term.  
The current policy is for Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment notice periods to be normally no longer than 12 months. 
Each of the Non-Executive Directors currently has a letter of appointment reflecting this.
Following the exercise by Gerald Corbett of his rights under the Chairman’s Share Award as set out on page 39, the remuneration 
of Non-Executive Directors consists solely of fees. The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Remuneration 
Committee and the remuneration of the other Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Executive Directors. The  
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the Group’s bonus, pension, share option or other performance related  
incentive schemes.

In the period 31 December 2010 to the date of this report, there has been no change in the Directors’ interests in shares in the 
Company other than through the monthly purchases in January and February 2011 of ordinary shares under the Company’s Share 
Incentive Plan by Paul Doughty. This has resulted in an increase in the interests held by Paul Doughty of 301 ordinary shares

a meaningful shareholding in the Company.

1 Corporate information
The Consolidated Financial Statements of Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC (‘Company’), a company incorporated in England, 
and its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2010 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the 
Directors on 28 February 2011. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRSs’). The Company has elected  
to prepare its Company Financial Statements in accordance with UK GAAP; these are presented on pages 67 to 70.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements are prepared on the historical cost basis. Comparative figures presented in the Financial Statements 
represent the year ended 31 December 2009. The Financial Statements are prepared on a going concern basis, which the Directors 
deem appropriate, given the Group’s positive cash position and lack of debt.
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The most significant areas of estimation uncertainty, and areas where critical judgements are made in applying accounting policies 
that have a material effect on the Financial Statements, are listed below. The uncertainties encountered, and judgements made, 
are described in more detail in the relevant accounting policies and accompanying notes:
Note 12 goodwill and other intangibles, including their amortisation and impairment • 
Note 13  revenue recognition • 
Note 13 provision for doubtful debts • 
Note 14 accruals • 
Note 18 share-based payments • 
Basis of consolidation
These Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the Financial Statements of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights 
that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are included in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. 
Changes in accounting policies
Accounting for business combinations
From 1 January 2010 the Group has applied IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2008) in accounting for business combinations.  
The change in accounting policy has been applied prospectively. The impact on earnings per share is disclosed in note 3.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which 
control is transferred to the Group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain 
benefits from its activities. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that currently are 
exercisable.
Acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus • 
the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus • 
if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less • 
the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. • 
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are 
generally recognised in profit or loss.

Financial Statements Business Overview Business Review Management Corporate Responsibility Corporate Governance General Financial Statements

Annual Report 2010
2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in 
connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified 
as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the 
contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
Acquisitions between 22 June 2007 and 1 January 2010
For acquisitions between 22 June 2007 and 1 January 2010, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the 
Group’s interest in the recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of  
the acquiree. When the excess was negative, a bargain purchase gain was recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurred in connection 
with business combinations were capitalised as part of the cost of the acquisition.
The Group was established via a series of transactions that occurred concurrently on 22 June 2007. These comprised the 
incorporation of the Company with Simon Nixon as sole shareholder, the acquisition by the Company using a share for share 
exchange of Simon Nixon’s 45% interest in Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited and the acquisition by the Company  
of all other shares in Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited from third parties. The acquisition of Simon Nixon’s shares 
was between two parties, being Simon Nixon and the Company, who were under common control at the time of the transaction. 
The acquisition was of an interest in a company which gave the investor a significant influence in the company and it was concluded 
that this arrangement was a common control transaction and not within the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations. As a result 
the Company accounted for this 45% interest in Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited at original carrying value rather 
than fair value at the date of the acquisition. The acquisition of the remaining shares in Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group 
Limited was accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations applying the accounting guidance for a business 
combination achieved in stages. This resulted in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of 
Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited being recognised in full and the goodwill in respect of the acquisition from  
third parties being recognised.
Foreign currency
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency. 
The functional currency of the foreign operation icero GmbH is the euro. The income and expenses of the foreign operation are 
translated into sterling at an average exchange rate for the period in which the activity occurred. The assets and liabilities of the 
foreign operation are translated into sterling using exchange rates ruling as at the balance sheet date. The exchange difference 
arising upon translation is taken directly to a separate component of equity.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency 
at the exchange rate at that date. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised as a profit or loss.
Revenue
Internet business
The Group generates fees from internet lead generation (click based revenue), commissions from brokerage sales and advertising 
through a variety of contractual arrangements. The Group recognises click based revenues and associated costs in the period that 
the lead is generated. Brokerage commissions are recognised at the point of completion of the transaction with the customer. 
Advertising revenue is recognised in the period when an advertisement is delivered to the end user.
Intermediary business
Commissions are recognised on completed transactions in the period that a transaction completes.
Revenue is recognised net of value added tax.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items  
of property, plant and equipment. 50 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC
Annual Report 2010
2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Depreciation is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each 
part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. Assets under construction are not depreciated until 
brought into use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Buildings 50 years
Plant and equipment (including IT equipment)  3 years
Fixtures and fittings  5 years
Office equipment  5 years
The useful lives and depreciation rates are reassessed at each reporting date.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment  
at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the carrying value may be impaired.
Other intangible assets
The cost of other intangible assets acquired in a business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition. After initial 
recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. All 
the Group’s intangible assets (other than goodwill) have been identified as having finite useful lives. As such, they are amortised on 
a straight-line basis over their useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible 
asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life is 
reviewed at least at each financial year end. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible asset. The estimated 
useful lives are as follows:
Market-related 10 years
Customer relationships  7 years
Customer lists  3 years
Technology  3 years
Market-related intangible assets are defined as those that are primarily used in the marketing or promotion of products and 
services, for example trademarks, trade names and internet domain names.
Customer-related intangible assets consist of customer lists, customer contracts and relationships, and non-contractual 
customer relationships. For accounting purposes, customer relationships and customer lists have been identified separately. 
Relationships with high-profile customers provide the Group with prominence in the marketplace, create volume and traffic on  
the website, and enhance the reputation of the brand. Customer lists allow the Group to undertake targeted marketing activities.
Technology-based intangible assets relate to innovations and technical advances such as computer software, patented and 
unpatented technology, databases and trade secrets.
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.  
If such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable 
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
For the purposes of impairment reviews, the recoverable amount of the Group’s assets is taken to be the higher of their fair value 
less costs to sell and their value in use.
Research and development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining technical knowledge and understanding, is charged  
to the Statement of Comprehensive Income when incurred. Development expenditure is capitalised when it meets the criteria 
outlined in SIC 32. Expenditure that does not meet the criteria is expensed directly to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand are included 
as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the Statement of Cash Flows.

Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income as incurred.
Share-based payment transactions
The Group’s share schemes allow certain Group employees to acquire ordinary shares in the Company. The fair value of share 
awards made is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at award 
date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards. The fair values of the 
share awards are measured using the Monte Carlo method for options subject to a market-based condition and the Black-Scholes 
model for all others, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were made. The amount recognised as 
an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of share awards expected to vest.
Short term employee benefits
Short term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are recognised in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income as the related service is provided.
A provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short term cash bonus or profit sharing plans if the Group has  
a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation 
can be estimated reliably.
Advertising costs
The Group incurs costs from advertising via a number of different media. Costs associated with the production of adverts are 
recognised as an expense in the Statement of Comprehensive Income only once the advert is available to the Group in a format 
ready for use, having been approved for airing or displaying. The cost of airing or displaying the advert is taken as an expense in  
the period in which the advert is aired or displayed.
Finance income
Finance income comprises interest receivable, which is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as it accrues using 
the effective interest method.
Dividends
Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders’ equity in the 
period in which the shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial 
recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than  
in a business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse 
in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the 
carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which  
the asset can be utilised.
In the year ended 31 December 2010 a deferred tax liability was recognised at the expected future tax rate of the value of the 
intangible assets with finite lives which were acquired with Financial Services Net Limited, representing the tax effect of the 
amortisation of these assets in future periods.
A deferred tax liability was recognised in the year ended 31 December 2007 as 30% of the value of the intangible assets with finite 
lives which were generated upon the acquisition of Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited, representing the tax effect  
of the amortisation of these assets in future periods. This liability was revalued at 31 December 2008 to 28% of the value of the 
intangible assets. 52 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC

2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Both these liabilities will decrease in line with the amortisation of the related intangible assets, with the deferred tax credit 
recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in accordance with IAS 12.
Group management of capital
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders  • 
and benefits for other stakeholders; and
to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk. • 
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it 
in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In assessing the level of capital 
all components of equity are taken into account, i.e. share capital, retained earnings and reserves (where applicable), as well as 
unvested share options and awards.
The Group manages its cash balances by depositing them with a number of financial institutions to reduce credit risk. The Group 
had no debt as at 31 December 2010 and is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements; management of capital 
therefore focuses around its ability to generate cash from its operations. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the 
Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets  
to raise funds. The Group believes it is meeting its objectives for managing capital as funds are available for reinvestment where 
necessary as well as being in a position to make returns to shareholders where this is felt appropriate.
There were no changes to the Group’s approach to capital management during the year.
Accounting standards issued but not yet effective
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued during the year ended 31 December 
2010 but are not yet effective, and therefore have not yet been adopted by the Group.
Amendments to IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ – classification of rights issues is mandatory for years commencing  
on or after 1 February 2010. The amendment allows rights, options or warrants to acquire a fixed number of the entity’s own equity 
instruments for a fixed amount of any currency to be classified as equity instruments provided the entity offers the rights, options 
or warrants pro rata to all of its existing owners of the same class of its own non-derivative equity instruments. Adoption of this 
standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
Revised IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosure’ is mandatory for years commencing on or after 1 January 2011. The standard amends 
the definition of a related party and modifies certain related party disclosure requirements for government-related entities.  
The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
The Group continues to monitor the potential impact of other new standards and interpretations which may be endorsed by the 
European Union and require adoption by the Group in future reporting periods.
3 Acquisition of Financial Services Net Limited
On 14 October 2010, the Group acquired all of the shares in Financial Services Net Limited (‘FSN’) for £4.4 million, satisfied  
in cash with a further £400,000 payable pending the outcome of certain matters, and a contingent payment of up to £4 million 
payable up to the third anniversary of handover upon the achievement of specified financial targets by FSN. The company operates 
a range of websites in the financial services sector aimed at putting consumers in touch with brokers or product providers  
who will provide them with the product they are looking for. In the two and a half months to 31 December 2010 the subsidiary 
contributed revenue of £69,000 and a net loss of £159,000 to the consolidated profit for the year. If the acquisition had occurred  
on 1 January 2010, Group revenue would have been an estimated £149.3 million and profit would have been an estimated £7.5m.  
In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of acquisition 
would have been the same if the acquisition occurred on the first day of the accounting period. Business Overview Business Review Management Corporate Responsibility Corporate Governance General Financial Statements

Consideration:
Initial consideration, paid in cash        4,412
Contingent consideration        2,608

The initial consideration includes a payment of £4,330,000 which was made during the year, and a payment of £82,000 which is 
expected to be made after 31 December 2010.
The Group incurred acquisition-related costs of £0.7m relating to legal and advisory fees, including the vendor’s related expenses, 
which have been expensed in administrative expenses. The impact on basic and diluted earnings per share is a decrease of 0.14 
and 0.13 pence respectively.
The contingent consideration includes two elements:
Up to £400,000 which may become due dependent upon the outcome of ongoing discussions around the indirect tax treatment  • 
of certain income streams. Management have estimated that there is a 50% probability of this amount becoming due and have 
recognised £200,000 of contingent consideration, which represents its fair value at the acquisition date.
Up to £4million which may become due upon the achievement of financial performance measures specified in the purchase • 
agreement. Up to one third of this amount will be payable on each of the first three anniversaries of the handover date. 
Management have estimated the amount of this element which will become payable by attributing different probabilities  
to a range of possible outcomes derived from the most recent forecasts of the business’ performance. The Group has  
included £2,408,000 as contingent consideration related to this additional consideration, which represents its fair value at  
the acquisition date. 54 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC

Business segments
In applying IFRS 8 – Operating Segments, the Group has disclosed four reportable segments, being Money, Insurance, Travel and 
Home. Money, Insurance and Home operate under the brand name moneysupermarket.com, and Travel under the brand name 
travelsupermarket.com, however, all four segments are reported separately. This disclosure correlates with the information which 
is presented to the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker, the Company Board, which reviews revenue by segment. The Group’s 
costs, finance income, tax charges and net assets are only reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker at a consolidated level, 
and therefore have not been allocated between segments in the analysis below. Of the Group revenue of £148.9m (2009: £136.9m) 
reported in 2010, £148.8m (2009: £134.9m) was generated in the UK. During the year, the Group took the decision to wind down its 
German operation.

From 1 April 2011 the corporation tax rate payable by the Group is to reduce to 27% with a further 1% reduction each year until tax 
year 2014/15 (when the rate will stabilise at 24%).
Unrecognised tax losses
The Group has tax losses arising from the results of a foreign subsidiary of £584,000 (2009: £1,830,000). A deferred tax asset has 
not been recognised in respect of these losses as it is uncertain as to whether they may be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere 
in the Group and they have arisen in a foreign subsidiary that is not expected to make a profit in the future. 
9 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders  
of the Company, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders 
of the Company, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
Earnings per share
Basic and diluted earnings per share has been calculated on the following basis:
       2010 2009 
       £000 £000

impairment. Business Overview Business Review Management Corporate Responsibility Corporate Governance General Financial Statements

Annual Report 2010
12 Intangible assets continued
During 2007 the Group employed the services of an appropriately qualified and experienced independent third party to value  
the intangible assets acquired from Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited. This valuation was used as the initial 
carrying value for these assets. Following the impairment provision in 2008, the market capitalisation of the Group approximated 
to the total carrying value of the goodwill, intangible and other non-current assets of the Group. At 31 December 2010 the  
market capitalisation exceeded the carrying value of the goodwill, intangible and other non-current assets by more than  
100% (2009: 78%).
On adoption of IFRS 8 the Group was required to allocate goodwill between its cash generating units (CGU) that represent the 
lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, but are not larger than an 
operating segment as defined by IFRS 8. These CGUs are the four operating segments Insurance, Money, Travel and Home 
Services, and the Group has therefore performed impairment testing at this level. The goodwill was allocated on 1 January 2009 
based on estimates of the relative values of the operating segments at that date with £30.7m allocated to Insurance, £15.5m to 
Money, £6.6m to Travel and £2.2m to Home Services. The balances at 31 December 2010 are in line with those at 1 January 2009.
For the current year, the recoverable amount of the assets was taken to be their value in use and was calculated by reference  
to the forecast cash flows.
The present value of the future cash flows has been calculated with the following key assumptions:
Cash flows for year 1 for each CGU represent management’s best estimate of future cash flows as at 31 December 2010, and • 
are based upon the Group’s approved budget for 2011 incorporating where possible an allocation of cost of sales and advertising 
costs. The main assumptions underlying the 2011 budget relate to visitor numbers, source of visitors, revenue per transaction/
visitor and marketing spend which incorporate past experience. The forecast assumes continued improvement during the 
course of 2011 driven by new media campaigns, utilisation of the Group’s data asset and investments made in the core 
technology for the Group’s key channels, as well as the more settled outlook in the wider economy. The Insurance and Money 
segments have been assumed to have similar rates of growth, and the Travel and Home Services segments have been assumed 
to return to close to the revenue levels achieved in 2008.
Cash flows for subsequent years for all segments are consistent with those in year 1 and assume no further growth.  • 
No reliable third party estimates of long term growth rates exist for the price comparison industry given it is a relatively  
new business model.
Cash flows into perpetuity have been incorporated into the calculations. • 
A pre-tax discount rate of 13.5% (2009: 15%) has been used in the forecast for all segments. A lower discount rate has been • 
used compared with the rate used to test the Internet segment last year to reflect the reduction in the uncertainty in the 
economic climate observed through the year, and the return to growth which the Group has reported.
When there are clear indications that the economy has fully emerged from recession a different set of assumptions may be  
more appropriate.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the assets allocated to the Insurance, Money, Travel and Home 
Service segments exceeds their carrying value by in excess of 100%, and as such, no impairment was identified. No reasonably 
possible change to a key assumption would result in an impairment.
As explained in note 4, whilst the Group is able to allocate revenue between the four operating segments, its cost base is reviewed 
by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker at a Group rather than segmental level, and a number of the significant costs which 
the Group incurs cannot be allocated either directly or on a reasonable and consistent basis to the CGUs that are each operating 
segment. Therefore the cash flows estimated above include all of the Group’s forecast revenues, but only approximately 57% of  
the Group’s cost base.
The Group has therefore also performed a further impairment test for the Group as a whole, in a manner consistent with that  
in 2009. In these calculations the Group is treated as one group of CGUs, and the test compared the carrying amount, including 
goodwill and other corporate assets, to the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount has been estimated based on the present value of its future cash flows which has been calculated  
with a set of assumptions consistent with those set out above in relation to the individual operating segment calculations.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the Group’s assets exceeds their carrying value by  
£152m (2009: £49m), and as such, no impairment was identified.
With regard to the Group level impairment testing, an increase of 10% (2009: 3%) in the discount rate, with all other assumptions 
held constant, would give a value in use for the Group’s assets equal to their carrying value. Similarly, a decrease in the annual 
cash flows of £20.0m (2009: £6.0m) with all other assumptions held constant, would also give a value in use for the Group’s assets 
equal to their carrying value. 60 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC

Financial Statements continued
12 Intangible assets continued
At an individual level, management believe that the assumptions relating to each intangible asset remain applicable, and that no 
adjustment is required to their valuation, nor their useful economic lives.
Acquisition of Financial Services Net Limited
The fair value of the intangible assets recognised upon the acquisition of Financial Services Net Limited (‘FSN’) have been 
calculated as set out below:
Market related • 
 Within FSN, the main market related intangible assets are the domain names which FSN owns. These assets have been valued 
using an income-based approach, namely, the royalty savings method, which estimates the royalty which the Group would have 
to pay a third party to use the domain names if it did not own them, typically as a percentage of the revenue earned from the 
domain names during their useful economic life of 10 years. The Group has estimated revenue based on the most recent  
3 year forecasts, and for later periods has assumed inflationary increases of 5%. A royalty rate of 15% has been applied based 
on available industry data. A discount rate of 15.8% has been used to calculate the present value of the future royalty savings.
Customer relationships • 
 This asset represents the value present within the existing relationships which FSN has with product providers and brokers. 
The valuation is based on the cash flows which are expected to result from these relationships during the 7 year useful 
economic life of the asset, adjusted for estimated future attrition of the providers and relationships following the date of 
acquisition. Again, the Group has based the estimate on the most recent 3 year forecasts, and for later periods has assumed  
inflationary increases of 5%, with an assumed attrition rate of the provider relationships of 50% per annum, based on 
management’s expectations. A discount rate of 15.8% has been used to calculate the present value of the future benefit 
resulting from the relationships.
Customer lists • 
 This asset represents the value of the customer data held by FSN at the date of acquisition, and is valued based on the cost  
of recreating such a database in the open market, using in-house estimates of the cost of each data element.
The goodwill balance recognised upon the acquisition of FSN represents the anticipated incremental value which the Group 
expects to generate by applying the existing skills and expertise within the Group’s workforce to the acquired business  
and assets.
Given the proximity of the acquisition of the above assets to the year end date no impairment review has been completed to date, 
and no indication of impairment has been identified.

17 Financial instruments
Interest rate risk
The Group invests its cash in a range of cash deposit accounts with UK banks. Interest earned therefore closely follows 
movements in Bank of England base rates. A movement of 1% in this rate would result in a difference in annual pre-tax profit  
of £366,000 based on Group cash, cash equivalents and financial instruments at 31 December 2010. At the balance sheet date, 
£20,720,000 was invested with Lloyds Banking Group, this being the most invested with any one bank.
Effective interest rates
In respect of interest-earning financial assets, the following table indicates their effective interest rates at the year end date.
    31 December 2010 
I
 31 December 2009
     Effective  Effective 
     interest rate £000 interest rate £000
Cash and cash equivalents     0.72% 36,593 0.69% 53,805
Credit risk
Credit risk with respect to trade receivables is monitored on an ongoing basis by the credit control team and finance management. 
By value, over 90% (2009: 90%) of the Group’s revenue comes from blue chip companies. Most of the remaining provider base is 
subject to payment terms of one week collected by direct debits. At the balance sheet date, the five largest trade receivables, by 
provider, accounted for 18% (2009: 12%) of the total trade receivables balance of £16,320,000 (2009: £14,375,000) and the largest 
individual balance was £985,636 (2009: £585,211).
Fair values
The Group’s financial assets and liabilities are principally short term in nature, and therefore their fair value is not materially 
different from their carrying value. The valuation method for the Group’s financial assets and liabilities can be defined as follows:
Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2:  inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly  
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The contingent consideration liability held at 31 December 2010 is valued using a level 3 valuation method, being its fair value with 
any change in fair value taken to the Statement of Comprehensive Income. All other financial assets and liabilities are valued at 
amortised cost using a level 1 valuation method. There have been no transfers between levels in the year. Business Overview Business Review Management Corporate Responsibility Corporate Governance General Financial Statements

Unapproved share option scheme
Grant 1
On 22 May 2007 the holders of unapproved share options in Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited agreed to have their 
unapproved share options replaced with share options in the Company on similar terms to those that operated under the original 
scheme. Options over 1,460 shares were originally exchanged. Following the share sub-division on 9 July 2007 where each 
ordinary share was converted to 5,000 ordinary shares, the shares under option were subject to a similar sub-division. Following 
this, there were therefore 7,300,000 share options in issue that related to the share options in Moneysupermarket.com Financial 
Group Limited, exchanged for share options in the Company.
These share options were originally granted by Moneysupermarket.com Financial Group Limited on 9 May 2005 and vested on the 
earlier of a trade sale or a flotation provided that in the event of a flotation the options had been held for three years from the date 
of grant. The exercise price is 6p per share.
Grant 2
On 18 and 22 June 2007 the Company granted further unapproved share options that entitled key management personnel and 
senior employees to acquire ordinary shares in the Company. Options were originally granted over 1,243 shares, which following 
the sub-division referred to above, became 6,215,000 shares. Options vest on the earlier of a trade sale or, subject to a flotation, 
equally over a three year period on subsequent anniversaries from the date of grant. The exercise price is 6p per share.
Grant 3
Post the sub-division of shares referred to above, on 10 and 21 July 2007 the Company granted further unapproved share options 
that entitled key management personnel and senior employees to acquire shares in the Company. Options were originally granted 
over 105,000 shares. Options vest on the earlier of a trade sale or, subject to a flotation, equally over a three year period on 
subsequent anniversaries from the date of grant. The exercise price is 6p per share.
All remaining unapproved share options vested and were exercised by the participants during the financial year ended 31 
December 2010. 
Share Incentive Plan scheme (SIP)
Upon listing, the Company granted £3,000 of ordinary shares at the price of £1.70 per ordinary share to each eligible employee free  
of charge. If an employee left within one year of listing, all of these ordinary shares were forfeit; between one and two years of listing, 
50% were forfeit; between two and three years of listing, 20% were forfeit; and after three years of listing, none were forfeit. 948,184 
shares were issued under the Share Incentive Plan scheme in 2007. On 31 July 2010 eligible employees became entitled to receive their 
allocation of free shares. 171,145 shares have been withdrawn from the trust by employees during the period and a further 536,592 
remain held in trust.
Long Term Incentive Plan scheme (LTIP)
On 28 December 2007 and 4 March 2008, the Company made conditional awards over 1,242,201 ordinary shares under the 
Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC Long Term Incentive Plan scheme to senior employees (‘2008 LTIPs’). Under this scheme, 
shares vest at the end of a three year period dependent upon the achievement of a cumulative adjusted EBITDA figure for the three 
financial years from 2008 to 2010. Based on the adjusted EBITDA figures achieved in 2008, 2009 and 2010, none of these awards 
have vested.
On 8 April 2009, conditional awards were made over 8,256,530 ordinary shares under the Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC  
Long Term Incentive Plan scheme to senior employees (‘2009 LTIPs’). Under this scheme, up to 70% of the shares vest at the end  
of a three year period dependent upon the achievement of an adjusted EBITDA figure for each of the three financial years from 
2009 to 2011, and up to 30% of the shares vest at the end of a three year period dependent upon the total shareholder return  
(TSR) of the Company relative to a comparator group of defined companies.
During the year, conditional awards were made over 6,473,309* ordinary shares under the Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC  
Long Term Incentive Plan scheme to senior employees (‘2010 LTIPs’). Under this scheme, up to 70% of the shares vest at the end  
of a three year period dependent upon the absolute total shareholder return of the Company set at the start of the period, and up to 
30% of the shares vest at the end of a three year period dependent upon the total shareholder return of the Company relative to a 
comparator group of defined companies. These awards are therefore subject to market-based performance conditions.
* The figure for the awards made in 2010 are the maximum available if the performance targets are met in full, representing 150% of the actual awards made. 64 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC

Chairman’s share award
Gerald Corbett, the Chairman of the Company, purchased 117,647 ordinary shares on the listing of the Company at the initial  
offer price of £1.70. Subject to him retaining these shares for three years and provided that he completes three years’ service  
as Chairman he was entitled to subscribe at nominal value for a total of 235,294 ordinary shares in the Company. 
Following the payment of the special dividend of 4.93p per ordinary share on 16 October 2009, the Remuneration Committee 
approved, in February 2010, an adjustment to the Chairman’s share award in accordance with the rules of the scheme. As a result 
of that adjustment, Gerald Corbett became entitled to subscribe at nominal value for a total of 248,612 ordinary shares in the 
Company reflecting the reduction in the value of the Chairman’s share award arising from the payment of that special dividend.
In February 2010, the Remuneration Committee approved, in accordance with the rules of the Chairman’s share award, the early 
subscription by Gerald Corbett for the shares comprising the Chairman’s share award. Gerald Corbett subscribed for all of the shares 
comprising the Chairman’s share award in 2010. As at 31 December 2010, all options granted under the Chairman’s share award had 
vested and been exercised.
Simon Nixon Scheme
During 2008, Simon Nixon established an additional incentive scheme under which he personally granted options over 633,504 
ordinary shares in the Company held by him in favour of one former employee of the Group. Options over 487,311 ordinary shares 
vested on 8 October 2008 and were exercised by the former employee on that date. Options over the remaining 146,193 ordinary 
shares were dependent on the satisfaction of Group related performance targets for the year ended 31 December 2008 and lapsed.
During 2009, similar arrangements were entered into by Simon Nixon in favour of Paul Doughty and certain other former 
employees, with options over a total of 3,378,683 ordinary shares held by Simon Nixon being granted personally by him to those 
persons. Options over 2,793,911 ordinary shares vested on 31 July 2009 and 4 August 2009 and were exercised by the participants 
on 4 August 2009. Options over the remaining 584,772 ordinary shares were dependent on the satisfaction of Group related 
performance targets for the year ended 31 December 2008 and lapsed. As at 31 December 2009, all options granted under the

The Group provided office space and services to Abacus Permanent Limited and Virtual Processing Limited, companies in  
which Simon Nixon controlled over 90% of the voting shares, during the prior year. The Group recharged these two companies  
rent and associated services at the same levels as it recharged wholly owned subsidiary companies. These rates were based  
on notional open market rents for similar offices in the locality. In addition the Group provided payroll services for these related 
companies, fully recovering salaries paid. In the normal course of trade with these related companies the Group both charged  
and was charged for mortgage procuration fees. The level of these fees were at arm’s length and mirrored the going rates  
in the open market.

Financial Statements
1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom 
accounting standards.
No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The loss after  
tax for the Company was £1,429,000 (2009: profit of £61,445,000 which included dividends received of £63 million).
The Company has taken the exemption in FRS 1 5(a) and consequently no cash flow statement is presented for the Company.
Investments
Investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Share-based payment transactions
The Group’s share schemes allow certain Group employees to acquire ordinary shares in the Company. The fair value of share 
awards made is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at award 
date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards. The fair value of the 
awards made is measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards 
were made. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of share awards expected to vest. Subsidiaries 
are recharged for the amount recognised as share-based payments relating to awards to their employees. The fair value of the 
recharge is recognised over the vesting period.
Dividends
Dividends receivable are recognised when the Company’s right to receive payment is established. Dividends payable to the 
Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders’ equity in the period in which the 
shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the profit and loss account except  
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted  
at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for 
taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required  
by FRS 19.
2 Share-based payments
The analysis and disclosures in relation to share-based payments are given in the Consolidated Financial Statements in note 18.

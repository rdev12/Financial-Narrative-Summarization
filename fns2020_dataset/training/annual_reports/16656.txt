Foseco acquisition. On 11 October 2007, it was
announced that the boards of Cookson and Foseco plc
(“Foseco”) had reached agreement on the terms of a
recommended offer for Cookson to acquire Foseco
for just over £600 million in cash and assumed debt.
The transaction has recently been cleared by the
competition authorities in the EU and the US and
approved by Foseco’s shareholders. At the date of
this report, 11 March 2008, the transaction required
approval by Cookson’s shareholders at an EGM
scheduled later in the day, which was subsequently
received, and Court approval of the scheme of
arrangement. Completion of the transaction is
currently expected on 4 April 2008. The contents of
this 2007 Annual Report, in particular the Operating
and Financial Review, describe Cookson’s activities
without the addition of Foseco.

OUR BUSINESS Cookson Group plc 6 Annual Report 2007
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
“THE PAST YEAR HAS WITNESSED THE COMMENCEMENT OF A NEW PHASE
IN THE GROUP’S EVOLUTION, ONE OF INVESTMENT FOR GROWTH.”
I am pleased to report another year of excellent progress
for the Group in 2007. This reflects the successful
implementation of a clear strategic plan for our business,
first announced in January 2005 and updated in November
2006, when new and more stretching performance targets
were introduced. The achievement of these targets required
extensive restructuring and rationalisation in mature
markets whilst expanding our presence in emerging
markets and lower cost production areas of the world.
Additionally, our poorest performing and most cyclical
businesses have been divested, generating funds for re-
investment in more profitable activities.
The past year has witnessed the commencement of
a new phase in the Group’s evolution, one of investment
for growth. Growth will be achieved through acquisition
where there is a clear and compelling industrial and
financial rationale with significant benefits for Cookson’s
shareholders and our other stakeholders. Organic growth
will result from investment in new manufacturing facilities
and further capacity expansion to meet demand in high-
growth markets where we enjoy leading positions.
Proposed acquisition of Foseco
On 11 October 2007, after several months of negotiations
and due diligence activity, we announced that the boards of
Cookson and Foseco had agreed terms for a recommended
offer for Cookson to acquire Foseco for just over £600 million
in cash and assumed debt. On the same day, we raised
£151 million through an over-subscribed share placement
and announced new bank facilities totalling £950 million to
fund the acquisition and refinance the enlarged group. We
have recently received approval for the transaction from
the competition authorities in the US and Europe and,
subject to shareholder approval at our Extraordinary
General Meeting on 11 March 2008, expect to complete the
acquisition on 4 April 2008.
Foseco reported revenue of £409 million and a trading
profit of £46 million in 2006. It is a leading supplier of
consumable products worldwide for use in the foundry and
steel-making industries and its activities are highly
complementary to those of our Ceramics division. On
22 February 2008, Foseco announced that it had recorded
another strong performance in 2007 , with full year revenue of
£431 million, an increase of 8% at constant exchange rates. Cookson Group plc 7 Annual Report 2007
The combination of these businesses will provide
opportunities to enhance the growth of both while at the
same time providing customers in foundry and steel
production markets with an excellent range of value-added
products and services. We expect the integration of these
two businesses to generate significant synergies through
the ability to cross-sell each business’ products and
services, the elimination of duplicate overhead costs and
increased purchasing efficiencies. Hence we anticipate
attractive returns and earnings per share enhancement
from this transaction.
This acquisition is expected to meet in full the financial
return parameters we have set for ourselves in our strategic
plan.
Organic growth
During 2007, the Ceramics division completed several new
production facilities in Mexico, Poland and China
representing an investment of almost £20 million. We also
announced plans to invest over £40 million in several
further capacity expansion projects in Ceramics to be
completed in 2008. In particular, we are adding significant
additional capacity to meet demand for our market-leading
Solar Crucible™ product line where the worldwide market is
currently growing at over 25% per year.
The Electronics division also announced plans for a
£9 million investment in a new Chemistry factory in China
where we hope to commence construction shortly for
completion next year.
Lastly, the Precious Metals division, on a smaller scale,
started production from a new low labour cost facility in
Thailand in August 2007 and has just completed a similar
facility in the Dominican Republic.
All these investments are forecast to deliver attractive
economic returns and should enable us to deliver further
profitable growth through 2008, 2009 and beyond.
Profitability
The Group’s results for 2007 also show strong progress with
trading profit from continuing operations (at constant
exchange rates) up 17% and return on sales margins up a
full one percentage point to 10.5%. Headline profit before
tax increased 14% to £149.6 million and headline earnings
per share improved 17% to 54.3 pence.
Dividend
In October, we paid an interim dividend of 4.25 pence in
respect of 2007 (interim 2006: 3.00 pence). We are
recommending a final dividend of 8.75 pence for 2007 to
give a total dividend in respect of 2007 of 13.00 pence
(2006: 10.00 pence).
Financial strength
Over the past few years we have substantially reduced
Group debt through disposal proceeds and cash generation
from operations. At the same time the Group’s pension
deficit has been significantly reduced via accelerated top-up
payments into the UK pension plan, which have more than
offset the effect of adopting longer life expectancy
assumptions in the calculation of the pension liabilities.
Hence, even before we raised the proceeds from the
£151 million share placement in October, the Group had a
strong, investment grade balance sheet.
Financing the forthcoming acquisition of Foseco via a
combination of debt and equity ensures that we should
maintain strong, investment grade balance sheet ratios
going forward.
Board and corporate governance
The Board and Executive Committee have remained
unchanged since my last report. I am confident that we have
an excellent team in place with the right blend of skills and
experience to deliver continuing improvements in
performance and to promote the success of the Company
for the benefit of shareholders as a whole.
The Board is responsible for overseeing the Company’s
strategy and monitoring performance. Through its own
actions and those of the Board committees, the Board
continues to meet its commitment to the highest standards
of corporate governance.
Employees
As in previous years, I would like to offer my sincere thanks
to all of our employees worldwide for their contributions to
the Group’s success. This year I would also like to extend a
warm welcome to the approximately 3,000 new employees
who should be joining us shortly from Foseco.
Outlook
Given the excellent progress achieved in the execution of
our strategy, I am confident that the Group is in robust
shape to face the future. I look forward to continued
progress, particularly with the exciting opportunities
presented by the Foseco acquisition.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
“2007 WAS ANOTHER YEAR OF GOOD PROGRESS FOR THE GROUP.”
2007 Results
2007 was another year of good progress for the Group, driven
by a continued strong improvement in the Ceramics division’s
performance. Group revenue from continuing operations
increased by 6% and trading profit grew 17% at constant
exchange rates. Headline profit before tax increased by 14%
and strong profit growth in lower tax jurisdictions resulted in a
lower tax charge. As a result, headline earnings per share were
up 17% to 54.3 pence.
Net debt at 31 December 2007 was £51 million (2006:
£181 million), the Company having raised £151 million from
the share placing in October. The worldwide pension deficit
reduced from £155 million to £96 million, reflecting cash
contributions of £45 million and favourable discount rate
movements.
Ceramics division
The division’s underlying revenue increased by 11% to
£781 million. Trading profit increased 25% to £109.4 million
and the return on sales margin for the second half of 2007
reached 14.4%, consistent with the new margin target range
of 14% to 16% announced last August.
Global steel production, our main end-market, grew 8%
in 2007 and our underlying revenue growth exceeded steel
production growth in all regions.
Sales of our market-leading steel flow control products,
used in the enclosed continuous casting process, grew 9%
to £372 million. Linings activity worldwide grew 11% to
£310 million, with particularly strong growth in NAFTA.
Worldwide, the linings margin reached 7.7% (pre divisional
and central cost allocations), up from 5.8% in 2006. Fused
silica revenue grew 23% to £52 million driven by a 50% rise
in sales of Solar Crucibles™, reflecting the continuing strong
growth rates in the worldwide production of photovoltaic (or
“solar”) cells.
Production capacities are being expanded in the higher-
growth products and regions. In 2007, two new Solar
Crucible™ plants were completed, one in Poland and one in
China and work has started on building three more (one in
the Czech Republic and two more in China). Also in 2007
new slide-gate (steel flow control) facilities in Mexico and
Poland were completed, linings production in India and
Mexico was expanded, and a local supplier of linings
products in China was acquired which gives us a base from
which to expand linings operations in Asia. Several further
expansion projects were announced for completion in 2008,
including foundry crucible facilities in China and Mexico and
VISO™ (steel flow control) facilities in China and Europe. Cookson Group plc 9 Annual Report 2007
Electronics division
The division’s trading profit was up 3% to £58.0 million on
underlying revenue 2% lower at £559 million, reflecting mix
changes in product sales, as detailed below. The return on
sales margin of 10.4% was slightly down on 2006 due to the
‘pass through’ of higher metals prices to customers
impacting revenue but not profit. If metals prices had
remained at 2006 levels, the 2007 pro-forma return on
sales margin would have been 11.5%.
The Assembly Materials sector continued to benefit from
growing demand for higher-margin products, particularly
SACX™ (the low silver content lead-free solder) and solder
pastes (both lead-free and lead-based) due to the continuing
shift from wave soldering to surface mount technologies.
Conversely demand for electronic solder bar and wire,
particularly traditional lead-based, is declining. As a
consequence of this change in the mix of activities, trading
profit increased 10% on underlying revenue 6% lower than
2006. The Semi-conductor Packaging Materials business,
which represents 5% of Assembly Materials sector revenue,
experienced difficult market conditions and consequently
made a loss of almost £1 million compared with a profit of
£2 million in 2006, on revenue down 14% for the year.
Progress is being made in the turnaround of this business.
The Chemistry sector saw a continuation of the first half
revenue trends with good growth in plating-on-plastics and
corrosion and wear resistant coating products for the
industrial and automotive markets, but weaker growth in
surface finish products for the electronic printed circuit board
market. Underlying revenue grew 3%, but trading profit was
3% lower , reflecting this change in mix of product sales.
In September 2007, a new Assembly Materials factory in
Mexico was opened and two factories in the US were closed.
A solder reclaim operation in the US was started where our
customers’ waste products and scraps are recycled and,
based on the success of this initiative, planning approvals are
being sought to set up an equivalent operation in China in
2008. In Europe, the intention to relocate solder paste
production from the UK to Hungary by the end of 2008 has
been announced, to reflect the migration of our customer
base in Europe to the East. Construction of the new
Chemistry plant in China has been delayed by over one year
due to more complex permitting requirements than originally
foreseen, but these issues are now close to being resolved.
Precious Metals division
For the full year, net sales value was 1% lower than 2006
and trading profit was down 2% (both at constant exchange
rates), which represented a reasonably encouraging second
half performance after the weak first half results and the
continuing weak retail environment in both North America
and Europe.
Results from the European operations benefited from
the restructuring undertaken in the UK in the first half of
the year and the move of some production to a new low
labour cost facility in Thailand which started up in August. A
similar move is being made in the US operations through
the creation of a low labour cost facility in the Dominican
Republic, where we will transfer the equivalent of 200 jobs
from our Attleboro (Massachusetts) facility during 2008.
In September 2007, the assets, designs and customer
lists of a local competitor in the US, Leach & Garner, were
acquired for US$7 million. Over the first half of 2008,
production of the acquired product ranges will be
transferred into our Attleboro and Dominican Republic
facilities. This should increase our net sales value in the US
and help offset the decline in the US market. Not-
withstanding this, in response to the current weak retail
environment in the US, we implemented 60 redundancies at
Attleboro in February 2008.
Foseco acquisition
Following the recent anti-trust clearances by the EU and US
competition authorities and the approval of the transaction
by Foseco’s shareholders, the approval by Cookson’s
shareholders at today’s EGM and Court approval of the
scheme of arrangement are now awaited. This should lead
to the transaction being completed on 4 April 2008. The
synergy expectations from combining Foseco with our
Ceramics operations, which were announced last October,
are reconfirmed. The Board remains convinced of the clear
strategic rationale for this acquisition and that it will deliver
attractive financial returns.
Outlook
The positive end-market trends experienced by Ceramics
over the second half of last year have continued and we are
increasing production capacities in the higher-growth
products and regions. The Ceramics division will be further
enhanced by the acquisition of Foseco which is expected to
complete next month. In Electronics, some slowing of
growth rates is expected for consumer electronics, but we
have been implementing efficiency improvements to offset
this. Precious Metals faces a weak retail environment, but its
performance should be helped by recent and ongoing
significant cost base reductions.
We therefore anticipate a continuing strong performance
in 2008.

OPERATING REVIEW
“THE INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS 
PRINCIPALLY REFLECTED STRONG UNDERLYING GROWTH IN THE CERAMICS 
DIVISION. THE FASTEST GROWING AND MOST PROFITABLE REGION FOR 
THE GROUP CONTINUED TO BE ASIA-PACIFIC.”
GROUP PERFORMANCE
Group revenue from total operations for 2007 was 2% higher than in 2006 at constant exchange rates,
although marginally lower (by 2%) at reported exchange rates. In the Group’s continuing operations, which
exclude the results of the Monofrax business in 2007 and 2006 and the Laminates business in 2006,
revenue was 6% higher at constant exchange rates and 2% higher at reported exchange rates. The increase
in revenue from continuing operations principally reflected strong underlying growth in the Ceramics
division and the impact of higher metal prices being ‘passed through’ to customers in the Precious Metals
and Electronics divisions. This revenue growth was partially offset by the loss of approximately £37 million
of revenue relating to businesses which have been sold or closed in the last two years but which do not
qualify to be treated as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes. Revenue growth from
continuing operations at constant exchange rates was stronger in the second half of the year compared to
the first half (8% and 4% respectively) reflecting the impact of higher metal prices in the second half of the
year and the normal seasonality of the Precious Metals division.
Trading profit from total operations increased by 11% at constant exchange rates compared to the prior
year (7% at reported exchange rates). In continuing operations, the growth rate was higher, being 17% at
constant exchange rates and 13% at reported exchange rates. Trading profit at constant exchange rates
increased by 25% to £109.4 million in the Ceramics division; by 3% to £58.0 million in the Electronics
division; and decreased slightly by 2% to £9.9 million in the Precious Metals division.
The strong growth in trading profit resulted in a significant increase in the Group’s return on sales from
continuing operations (at constant exchange rates) to 10.5% from 9.5%. But for the impact of higher metal
prices increasing reported revenue without any impact on profitability, this increase would have been
around 0.4 percentage points higher.
The fastest growing and most profitable region for the Group continued to be Asia-Pacific, where
revenue from continuing operations (by location of customer and at constant currency) increased by 9%
compared with 2006. Europe and NAFTA (which comprises the US, Canada and Mexico) contributed 34%
and 31% respectively of Group revenue; however, despite revenue growth in both these regions, higher
levels of growth in Asia-Pacific in particular has seen their combined share of Group revenue fall
marginally from 66% in 2006 to 65% in 2007 with Asia-Pacific and Rest of the World representing 35%
of Group revenue in 2007.

OPERATING REVIEW (CONTINUED)
CERAMICS
Divisional overview
Known in its markets as Vesuvius, the Ceramics division is the world leader in the supply of advanced steel
flow control refractory products and systems to the global steel industry and a leading supplier of
specialist ceramics products to the glass, solar and foundry industries. It is also the regional leader in the
US, UK and Australia in the supply and installation of monolithic refractory linings.
The division had another outstanding year with strong underlying revenue growth in the higher margin
speciality products, improved profitability in the linings business, and improved operating efficiencies
resulting in a record level of profitability.
Market overview
The Ceramics division benefited from the good market conditions experienced in 2006 continuing
throughout 2007.
The division’s key end market is global steel production, which accounts for around 70% of the
division’s revenue. In 2007, global steel production rose by 7.5% to over 1.3 billion tonnes. Following the
9% growth in 2006, the rate of growth in 2007 remained strong, being 10% in the first half and 6% in the
second half of the year. China reinforced its position as the world’s leading steel producer with year-on-
year growth of 16% and accounted for 36% of the world’s total production in 2007. Notwithstanding the
strong growth from this region, global production outside of China still showed growth of 3%, with
marginally lower production in the US (down 1%) being more than offset by strong growth in the major
regions of India (up 7%), the CIS (up 3%) and the enlarged European Union (up 2%). Steel prices remained
high during 2007 and the industry’s financial position remains strong. Following the merger of Mittal and
Arcelor in 2006 to form the world’s largest steel producer, consolidation of the steel industry continued in
2007 with a number of acquisitions including Tata Steel’s acquisition of the Anglo-Dutch producer, Corus.
This trend is expected to continue and is expected to be particularly marked in China where the
government has stated its intention to create a small number of industry “champions” out of the currently
very fragmented market place. For example, one of China’s largest steel producers will be created on the
completion of the proposed merger of Anshan Iron and Steel Corporation Group with Benxi Iron & Steel.
The end-markets for most of the division’s products and services which are not related to steel
production, namely foundry, glass and industrial products, are generally linked to GDP growth. Demand for
solar energy – and thus the division’s Solar Crucibles™ used in the manufacture of photovoltaic (“solar”)
cells – was very strong in 2007 as high oil prices and heightened environmental concerns stimulated
demand for renewable sources of energy.
Divisional performance
Good market conditions, combined with the beneficial impact of the investment and restructuring initiatives
implemented in the last two years resulted in a further strong improvement in performance. Revenue on
continuing operations for the year at £781 million was 7% higher than 2006 at constant exchange rates and
3% higher at reported exchange rates. These results exclude the results of Monofrax, the US-based fused
cast refractory business, which was sold in February 2007 and the results of which are included in
discontinued operations. The division’s results do, however, include the results of a number of smaller
businesses which were either sold or closed during the last two years but which did not qualify to be treated
as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes. These include the principally US-based
Ceramics Fibres business (sold March 2006), the UK-based Carbon Blocks business (sold June 2006), the
UK based Magnesia-carbon Bricks business (closed December 2006) and the US-based Alumina Bricks
business (sold February 2007). Excluding the revenue from these businesses, underlying revenue for the
division was up 11% at constant exchange rates, well ahead of the growth in world steel production which
grew 7.5%. This outperformance reflects some market share gains, together with the progressive increase
in the division’s addressable market, as the steel industry in countries such as China, Russia and Ukraine
increasingly converts to enclosed continuous casting technology which requires the division’s steel flow
control products.

OPERATING REVIEW (CONTINUED)
Trading profit from continuing operations grew strongly
by 25% at constant exchange rates (22% higher at reported
exchange rates) to £109.4 million. All regions and product
lines showed good trading profit growth compared to 2006
with a particularly strong performance for linings, which
improved its return on sales (pre divisional and central cost
allocations) from 5.8% in 2006 to 7.7%. Return on sales for
the division from continuing operations was 14.0%, up more
than two percentage points from the 11.8% reported in
2006. Return on net assets increased strongly from 35.0%
in 2006 to 39.6% in 2007.
Europe and NAFTA are the division’s two largest regions by
location of customer, each making up 32% of total divisional
revenue from continuing operations. However , the two fastest
growing regions are Asia-Pacific and Rest of the World, which
include the fast-developing markets of China, India and Brazil,
together comprising 36% of total divisional revenue.
Note: in the analysis below, all of the financial
information is presented on an underlying basis in that it is
from continuing operations, at constant exchange rates
and adjusted for the disposals and closures noted above.
Sector performance
NAFTA (comprising the US, Canada and Mexico)
Underlying revenue in NAFTA grew by 7% to £242 million
with 16% growth in linings (which constitutes just over half
of the region’s revenue) more than offsetting a small decline
in steel flow control. Revenue in foundry was in line with
2006. Steel production in NAFTA was unchanged in 2007
reflecting a 1% reduction in the US being offset by growth in
Mexico and Canada. In the first half of 2007, US steel
production was down 4% reflecting some temporary
production cut-backs initiated in late 2006/early 2007.
These cut-backs were reversed in the second quarter of
2007 such that production in the second half of the year
was 2% ahead of the corresponding period in 2006.
Underlying trading profit increased by nearly one-
quarter compared to 2006 reflecting improved profitability
in linings, achieved through increased management focus
combined with rigorous cost control.
During 2007, the division continued its restructuring
programme with the closure of the Crown Point (Illinois)
facility in June and the announcement in August of the
closure of the Buffalo (New York) facility by the end of 2008.
Production of taphole clay, a product used in the operation of
blast furnaces, has been transferred from Crown Point to an
existing facility at Chicago Heights (Illinois) where a new
production line using updated technology has been
constructed. There is to be a phased run-down of the Buffalo
facility during 2008 with final closure by year-end. This
facility, which manufactures isostatically-pressed foundry
crucibles, has relatively high labour costs and production is to
be relocated to the division’s existing facility in Monterrey,
Mexico which will become a fully integrated facility producing
foundry crucibles using two technologies – isostatic pressing
and traditional spinning – to serve the NAFTA market. The
closure is expected to generate cost savings of approximately
£1 million per annum from the beginning of 2009.
Europe (including CIS)
Good market conditions resulted in underlying revenue in
Europe growing by 10% to £305 million. Steel flow control,
which constitutes nearly 60% of Europe’s revenue grew by
12%, well ahead of the 3% growth in steel production in the
region. This resulted from market share gains and an
increase in the addressable market as the Russian and
Ukrainian steel industry increasingly converts to enclosed
continuous casting technology which requires the division’s
steel flow control products. Steel production growth was
particularly strong in Germany, Spain, Turkey, the UK, Russia
and Ukraine, with more modest growth in Italy and decreases
in France and Belgium. Following steel production growth of
5% in the first half of 2007 there was some slowing of
growth rates, although production still grew by 1% in the
second half. Linings, which constitute one-third of Europe’s
revenue, also grew well with 5% growth in underlying
revenue. Revenue in foundry was marginally lower.
Underlying trading profit grew significantly by 29%
compared to 2006 as a result of strong volume growth in
steel flow control and linings combined with cost reductions
in linings.
The expansion of slide-gate capacity at the facility in
Skawina, Poland based on new slide-gate plate technology was
completed on schedule in July, with production of slide-gates
in Goole, UK ceasing in the third quarter . With the region’s steel
flow control operations currently operating at, or near to, full
capacity, it has been decided to invest £8 million in a new steel
flow control facility in Ostend, Belgium. This new facility, which
should be operational in the fourth quarter of 2008, will
deliver productivity improvements as well as increasing steel
flow control capacity. The expected future growth in Russian
and Ukrainian steel production and the modernisation of their
steel industries, represents a significant opportunity for the
division. These markets are currently served by the division
with products manufactured outside of these two countries
and the possibility of establishing a local manufacturing
presence is currently being evaluated.
Asia-Pacific and the Rest of the World
Underlying revenue in these regions grew in total by 13% to
£182 million reflecting both strong steel production growth
in the three key markets of China (up 16%), India (up 7%)
and Brazil (up 9%) which underpinned strong growth in
steel flow control (up 14%), plus strong revenue growth in
linings, which primarily operates in Australia (up 11%). The
Chinese government continues to encourage the steel
industry to shift to more modern, energy efficient and lower
pollution methods of steel production which should expand
the market for the Ceramics division’s steel flow control
products. In May 2007, the Government’s intention to close
682 old facilities (totalling 42 million tonnes of steel
production) by 2010 was announced, with these facilities to
be replaced by modern enclosed continuous casting plants.
Implementation of this policy has been successful and by the
end of 2007 , 150 facilities had been closed totalling 20 million
tonnes of steel production. This trend should enable the
division to continue its strong progress in China.
The strong revenue growth has resulted in trading profit
increasing strongly by 18% with improved profitability from
both the steel flow control and the linings product lines.
The division is already very well positioned in these fast-
growing and profitable markets. With further strong growth
anticipated as these countries continue to industrialise,
production capacity is being increased in a number of areas
which should help drive increased performance from this
region over the next few years. Cookson Group plc 15 Annual Report 2007
The construction of a new £5 million foundry crucibles
facility in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, near two of the division’s
existing Chinese facilities, is now nearing completion and the
facility is expected to be operational in the second quarter of
2008. This facility will produce long-life, high-performance
alumina graphite crucibles for the fast-growing non-ferrous
foundry market. The Chinese foundry industry is the largest
in the world and has experienced growth of around 10% per
annum over the last few years.
For linings, the division is expanding its capabilities in these
emerging markets and leveraging its expertise gained from its
strong presence in the more established markets in order to
capture the expected strong demand for these products. During
the year, the construction of a new £1 million linings facility in
India was completed. This facility, which produces monolithics,
pre-cast linings and taphole clay for this fast-growing market,
became operational in the fourth quarter of 2007 .
In April 2007 , the acquisition of Bayuquan Refractories Co.
Limited (“BRC”) was completed for a cash consideration of
US$9 million (£4 million). BRC, which manufactures brick-lining
products in China, was previously a supplier to the division. This
acquisition gives certainty of supply of these products and also
provides the division with more freedom to conduct and grow
its linings business in Asia-Pacific. This facility is currently
operating at full capacity and a £1 million expansion project has
been approved for completion in the second quarter of 2008.
Given the expected strong growth in steel production,
plans to expand further steel flow control production
capacity in China and India are currently under evaluation.
The division’s main steel flow control production facilities
in China are located in Suzhou and are 100% owned. To
support these, in October 2007, two new joint venture
agreements were announced with two of China’s largest steel
producers, Wuhan Iron & Steel Corporation (“WISCO”) and
Anshan Iron and Steel Corporation Group (“Angang”). Since
2003, the division has operated a 50/50 joint venture with
WISCO, China’s fifth largest steel producer, producing slide-
gate refractories. This operation had revenue of £6 million in
2007. Based on this success, a further 50/50 joint venture
between the parties has been formed, for the production of
VISO™, the division’s range of isostatically-pressed alumina-
carbon products used to control and protect the flow of molten
metal in the enclosed continuous casting steel-making
process. The new joint venture, to be managed by Cookson, will
involve the construction of a new facility in Wuhan, Hubei
Province. Around half of the production will be dedicated to
supplying VISO™ products to satisfy the anticipated expansion
of WISCO’s own steel-making capacity, with the remainder
available to the Ceramics division to sell to other Chinese steel
producers. The investment in the new facility will be £4 million,
of which the division’s share is £2 million, with the facility
expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2008.
A letter of intent has also been signed with Angang for the
formation of a 50/50 joint venture to supply various refractory
products to Angang. Following the completion of the proposed
merger with Benxi Iron & Steel, Angang will be China’s largest
steel producer and has plans to increase significantly its steel
production over the next five years from the current level of
15 million tonnes per annum to between 40 and 50 million
tonnes. The joint venture, to be managed by Cookson, will
supply Angang with a significant proportion of its total
requirements for magnesia-carbon bricks, magnesia-based
monolithics and VISO™ products from three new facilities.
Initial investment plans are in the process of being finalised.
Fused Silica
The fused silica product line is managed on a global rather
than regional basis. The principal products in the global
fused silica product line are tempering rollers used in the
glass industry and Solar Crucibles™ used in the manufacture
of photovoltaic (“solar”) cells. Underlying revenue has grown
by 23% to £52 million compared to 2006 with good market
conditions in both principal end-markets.
Revenue growth of 6% in tempering rollers and other
speciality products reflects good growth in the glass
industry, driven by strong demand from the construction
industry in China and the Middle East and increased sales of
flat screen television panels. To meet the increased
demand, in the first quarter of 2007 , a £2 million investment
in Kua Tang, the site of the division’s existing glass roller
business in China was completed, which significantly
expanded capacity for producing the rollers used in the
glass industry and transformed this facility into the
Ceramics division’s leading centre for glass roller
production worldwide. This facility is currently running at
close to full capacity and an additional £1 million investment
has been agreed to increase capacity which should be
completed by the second quarter of 2008.
Solar Crucible™ revenue has grown very strongly by
50% reflecting an acceleration in the solar energy industry
as supply shortages of the polycrystalline silicon material
used in the majority of solar panels have eased as a result
of additional capacity now coming on-stream. Worldwide
sales of solar cells in 2007 grew by over 40% compared to
2006 and commentators are forecasting growth to continue
at this level over the next few years.
Trading profit was only marginally ahead of 2006
reflecting the impact of the strong volume growth being
partially offset by ‘one off’ production start-up costs arising
in the new Solar Crucible™ facilities in China and Poland.
Two new Solar Crucible™ facilities were completed in
2007 for a total investment of £10 million, in China (Wei
Ting, Jiangsu Province) and Poland (Skawina), to supply
customers in Asia-Pacific and Europe respectively. Both of
these facilities are expected to be at full capacity in the first
quarter of 2008. In August 2007, it was announced that a
further new facility would be built in Moravia, Czech
Republic for an investment of £6 million and this facility was
completed in March 2008. In addition, in October 2007 a
further £2 million investment at the Wei Ting, China facility
was approved, which will double its capacity, for completion
by the third quarter of 2008.
In response to continued strong growth in the solar
energy industry, an additional facility (“Sunrise”) is to be
constructed in Jiangsu Province, close to the division’s
existing Solar Crucible™ facility in Wei Ting. The total
investment in the new facility will be just over £11 million and
it is expected to be completed by the end of 2008. The main
part of the production from this facility will be supplied,
under a five year agreement, to a new £245 million solar cell
factory being constructed in Jiangsu Province by Glory
Silicon Energy (“GSE”). GSE’s factory will represent one of
the largest facilities of its type in the world, capable of
producing solar cells generating 1,500 megawatts of
electricity per annum.
These new investments will enable the division to
continue to benefit from the strong growth in the solar
energy market and maintain its leading market position as a
key supplier to this industry.
OUR BUSINESS Cookson Group plc 16 Annual Report 2007
OPERATING REVIEW (CONTINUED)
ELECTRONICS
Divisional overview
The Electronics division is a leading supplier of advanced surface treatment and plating chemicals and
assembly materials to the electronics, industrial and automotive markets.
2007 saw generally satisfactory end-market demand. A strong underlying performance from the
Assembly Materials sector compared to 2006 more than offset marginally weaker results from the
Chemistry sector.
Market overview
Around two-thirds of the division’s revenue comes from electronics markets with the remainder deriving
from automotive and other industrial markets.
Electronic equipment production worldwide is reported to have grown by 8% by value in 2007,
marginally lower than the 10% growth in 2006, but well ahead of global GDP growth. This growth was
driven by strong consumer-led demand for PCs (particularly laptops), mobile telephones, games consoles,
navigation systems, high definition flat screen televisions and MP3 players. Global PC sales grew by 13%
by volume in 2007, whilst the total annual production of mobile phones reached 1.2 billion units, growth of
16% over 2006. In the first three quarters of 2007, the worldwide semi-conductor industry grew 9% by
volume (but only 3% by value due to pricing pressures). Printed circuit board (“PCB”) production grew 4%
by volume in 2007 driven by continued strong growth in Asia, particularly China.
Regionally, Asia-Pacific experienced the strongest growth both in terms of production capacity
migrating to this region and also strong local end-market demand. Electronic equipment production, for
example, whilst growing 8% worldwide saw lower growth in both the US and Europe (2% and 4%
respectively) being more than offset by growth of 21% in China.
The market penetration of lead-free products, which had accelerated strongly in 2006 with EU
regulations coming into force in mid-2006 (the Reduction of Hazardous Substances Act) which forbid the
use of lead in the majority of electronic assemblies, remained broadly unchanged in 2007 compared to the
end of 2006. The use of lead-free products is a significant change impacting the whole division, not just
for the Assembly Materials sector, whose solder products have traditionally contained lead. Non-lead
solders melt at higher temperatures and so all other PCB components, including circuit board fabrication
chemistries, must also be able to withstand these temperatures. In the third quarter of 2007 , it is estimated
that more than half of the global market for solder was lead-free.
For the non-electronics markets it was a mixed picture. Whilst 2007 was a year of overall global
economic growth, the most important non-electronics market for the division, the automotive industry,
showed varying trends with the level of vehicle production 6% higher in Europe but 2% lower in the US.
Divisional performance
Revenue for the year from continuing operations (which excludes the results of the Laminates sector sold
in April 2006) at £559 million was 5% higher than last year at constant exchange rates (1% higher at
reported exchange rates). Excluding the impact of higher metal prices (primarily tin and silver in the
Assembly Materials sector), precious metals sales (primarily gold and palladium) in the Chemistry sector,
and the impact of disposals and closures in the Assembly Materials sector (US-based PVC Cements
business in December 2006 and the closure of the European industrial metals business in Naarden,
Netherlands in June 2006), underlying revenue was 2% lower. Trading profit from continuing operations
increased by 3% to £58.0 million at constant exchange rates (1% lower at reported exchange rates) giving
a return on sales for the division of 10.4%. The return on sales is marginally below that reported in 2006
(10.5%) due to the impact of higher metal prices. If metals prices in 2007 had remained at similar levels
to those in 2006, the return on sales in 2007 would have been 0.9 percentage points higher at 11.5%.
Return on net assets for the division reduced marginally from 43.0% in 2006 to 40.0% in 2007, reflecting
higher levels of trade working capital arising from higher metal prices.

OPERATING REVIEW (CONTINUED)
Assembly Materials accounted for 58% of revenue and
51% of trading profit in 2007. Chemistry accounted for the
remaining 42% of revenue and 49% of trading profit.
Asia-Pacific continued to be the division’s fastest
growing region and was responsible for 44% of revenue
from continuing operations by location of customer.
Europe accounted for 29%, NAFTA 23%, and the Rest of
the World 4%.
Sector performance
Assembly Materials
The PCB assembly and semi-conductor packaging segments
of the electronics market account for approximately 65% of
Assembly Materials’ revenue, with the remaining 35% going
into a variety of industrial applications.
Revenue for the year at £326 million was 7% higher
than the prior year at constant exchange rates (2% higher
at reported exchange rates). The higher revenue reflected
the ‘pass through’ to customers of higher metal prices, in
particular for tin and silver. In 2007, the average prices of
tin and silver – the sector’s major raw materials – were
respectively 68% and 15% higher than in 2006, such that
revenue increased by approximately £52 million as a result
of these higher metal prices. Excluding the impact of higher
metal prices and disposals and closures, underlying revenue
was 6% lower than last year (at constant exchange rates)
reflecting changes in the mix of products sold.
The lower underlying revenue reflects flat volumes of lead-
free solder with lower cost SACX™ (0.3% silver) making strong
gains (constituting 31% of lead-free sales by weight in 2007
compared with 24% in the prior year) and substituting for
higher cost 3% silver solder. Volumes of traditional unleaded
solder were significantly lower (by 20%), reflecting a strategy
of focusing resources on higher margin, more value-added
products and exiting more commoditised markets.
The market penetration of lead-free solder, driven by EU
legislation which became effective in July 2006, has remained
broadly constant compared to the end of 2006, against an
expectation of a continuing (albeit slowing) increase in
penetration levels. The significant increase in the price of tin
and silver in 2007 has resulted in lead-free solder being much
more expensive than traditional, leaded solder . For 2007 , 53%
of solder revenue came from lead-free sales (2006: 47%), only
marginally ahead of the 51% achieved in the fourth quarter of
2006. However , higher metal prices have boosted demand for
our less expensive SACX™ products and they made up 21% of
total lead-free solder revenue in 2007 (2006: 15%).
Solder is sold in three principal forms: bar, wire and
paste. Sales of higher-margin solder paste have benefited
from the continuing shift from wave soldering to surface
mount technology and increased by 17% (by weight) in
2007 compared to the prior year. A number of new solder
pastes have recently been launched targeting specific
product applications (such as mobile phones), including
SACX™ in paste form and a new low-silver lead-free paste
product with a 1% silver content. 2007 also benefited from
strong growth in the reclaim business in the US, in which
scrap solder generated by our customers’ production
processes is reclaimed for processing back into solder alloys
for sale to third parties or for reuse within the Assembly
Material business.
The Semi-conductor Packaging Materials business,
which provides epoxy mould compounds, underfills and
solder spheres to the semi-conductor supply industry and
constitutes approximately 5% of the sector’s revenue, faced
continuing difficult market conditions in 2007 and revenue
was down 14% on the prior year. The business successfully
launched a number of new products in 2007 which have
recently been approved by customers and an improved
performance is expected in 2008.
Trading profit for the sector of £29.8 million was 10%
higher than 2006 at constant exchange rates (6% higher
at reported exchange rates), reflecting good growth in
profitability in the Alpha Fry solder business resulting from
the transition to higher-margin products such as solder
paste and SACX™ and growth of the reclaim business in the
US. However, the Semi-conductor Packaging Materials
business reported a loss for the year of just under £1 million
compared to a £2 million trading profit in 2006. Excluding
the Semi-conductor Packaging Materials business, trading
profit in 2007 increased 19% on the prior year (at constant
exchange rates). Return on sales for the sector increased
marginally from 8.8% to 9.1%, notwithstanding the
underperformance of the Semi-conductor Packaging
Materials business and the impact of higher metal prices.
If metals prices in 2007 had remained at similar levels to
those in 2006, the return on sales in 2007 would have been
around two percentage points higher at 10.9%.
Asia-Pacific, the sector’s largest region by location of
customer accounted for 57% of revenue, an increase of
4 percentage points over 2006, which reflects the
continuing migration of consumer electronics production to
this region. Europe accounted for 21% of revenue, NAFTA
17%, and the Rest of the World 5%.

During 2007, the sector’s manufacturing operations in
NAFTA were significantly restructured. This initiative, which
was completed at the end of the third quarter, should
generate annualised savings of £2 million. Production of
high labour-intensive solder wire has been moved from the
Altoona (Pennsylvania) facility to a new site in Monterrey,
Mexico. The Jersey City (New Jersey) facility has been
closed with production moving to Monterrey, Mexico and to
Altoona. The wave solder flux manufacturing facility in
Alpharetta (Georgia) has been closed with production
moving to an existing Chemistry sector facility in Mexico
City, Mexico. In total, headcount in the US has been reduced
by 120, with a corresponding increase in Mexico.
New product development remains a key focus,
reflected by a further expansion of R&D capabilities in
Bangalore, India. This facility, which now employs around
50 personnel, relocated during 2007 to new, larger premises.
Chemistry
End-markets for the Chemistry sector’s plating chemical
products (excluding precious metal sales) are split between
the electronics industry (42%) and other industrial and
automotive applications (58%). If precious metals are
included, then the percentage of revenues going into
electronics end-markets reduces to 34%.
Revenue for the year at £232 million was 2% higher than
2006 at constant exchange rates (1% lower at reported
exchange rates). Excluding the impact of precious metal
sales, underlying revenue growth was 3% (on a constant
currency basis), reflecting good growth in plating-on-plastics
and corrosion and wear-resistant coating products for
industrial and automotive markets. This growth has been
partially offset by marginally lower revenue for surface
coating products serving the printed circuit board
fabrication market within electronics, particularly in China
where the sector’s production network was sub-optimal
throughout 2007 due to the delay in finding a location for
the new Chinese production facility. To mitigate this
situation, the existing facility in Tianjin was upgraded in the
second half of 2007 which should improve delivery capability
in 2008 pending the expected completion of the new facility
in the first half of 2009. Copper damascene sales to the
semi-conductor market were well ahead of 2006.
Trading profit for 2007 at £28.2 million was 3% lower
than 2006 at constant exchange rates (7% lower at
reported exchange rates), reflecting a mix change away
from higher-margin products serving electronics markets.
Return on sales in 2007 decreased from 12.9% to 12.2%.
Europe and NAFTA remain the sector’s largest regions by
customer location with 42% and 30% of total sector revenue.
Asia-Pacific represents 25% of total sector revenue.
The rationalisation of the sector’s European sales,
manufacturing and distribution network, which was initiated
in 2005, was largely completed in 2007 . Production capacity
has been expanded at existing facilities in Germany and the
Netherlands, with these two locations now supplying all of
the sector’s European customers. Facilities in Italy and
Spain have been downsized and relocated. These initiatives
will result in annualised savings of £2 million, most of which
were captured in 2007.
In order to serve customers better in the fast-growing
markets of Eastern Europe, new operations have recently
been established in Slovakia and Romania.
Following the buy-out of the 49% minority interest in the
Chinese operations in October 2006, the construction of a
new £9 million facility was announced to accelerate the
growth of the sector’s operations in China. Delays have been
experienced in finding an appropriate location for the new
facility due to a new, and more stringent, permitting regime.
Following an extensive review, a site has now been identified
near Shanghai which is in the process of being acquired, with
construction expected to commence in mid 2008 for
completion in mid 2009.

OPERATING REVIEW (CONTINUED)
PRECIOUS METALS
Divisional overview
The Precious Metals division is a leading supplier of fabricated precious metals (primarily gold, silver and
platinum) to the jewellery industry in the US, the UK, France and Spain. Products include alloy materials,
semi-finished jewellery components and finished jewellery.
Market overview
2007 saw weaker retail demand for jewellery in the US, whilst demand in Europe was more stable in each
of the key markets of the UK, France and Spain.
Demand for finished jewellery products is influenced to a large extent by both consumer confidence
and consumer preferences. Consumer confidence weakened during the year, particularly in the US, due to
concerns about the high level of consumer debt, higher energy prices and concerns about the housing
market. The shift in customers’ discretionary spend over the last few years away from jewellery products
and more towards consumer electronic products such as mobile phones and MP3 players has continued.
The preference of buyers and wearers of jewellery for white metals and gemstones, a trend
experienced over the last few years, continued in 2007. The price of precious metals – particularly gold –
also has an impact on jewellery demand. As prices increase the weight of gold in the finished product is
typically reduced to meet retailer price points. In addition retailers are reluctant to hold inventory when
prices are volatile. Precious metal prices have been reasonably volatile during 2007, particularly in the
fourth quarter when prices increased significantly. Average precious metal prices (notably for gold, silver
and platinum) in 2007 were higher than for 2006 (gold and silver higher by 15% and 16% respectively).
Precious metal prices reached their yearly high at the end of 2007 with gold at US$830/ounce, nearly one-
third higher than as at the end of 2006.
Divisional performance
The division’s revenue of £280 million was 5% higher than last year at constant exchange rates (1% higher
at reported exchange rates), principally reflecting the higher precious metal prices. Net sales value, being
revenue excluding the precious metal content, of £105 million was 1% lower than 2006 at constant
exchange rates (5% lower at reported exchange rates). Trading profit in 2007 of £9.9 million was broadly
in line with 2006, being 2% lower at constant exchange rates (10% lower at reported exchange rates)
giving a return on net sales value of 9.4% (2006: 9.9%).
The Precious Metals division operates in two distinct geographic regions; the US, which constitutes
55% of the total net sales value for the division, and Europe (which includes the UK, France and Spain).
Return on net assets was broadly unchanged from 2006 at 13.9% (2006: 14.3%).

OPERATING REVIEW (CONTINUED)
Sector Performance
Precious Metals – US
Net sales value of £58 million was broadly unchanged
compared to last year , being 2% lower at constant exchange
rates (10% lower at reported exchange rates). This reflected
weaker retail demand for jewellery throughout the year
being offset by an additional £3 million of net sales value
from the Leach & Garner jewellery business, which was
acquired in September 2007.
Trading profit for 2007 at £7.3 million was 11% lower
than last year at constant exchange rates (19% lower at
reported exchange rates) reflecting the weaker underlying
volumes. Return on net sales value was 12.6% (2006: 14.0%).
The initiative to consolidate all of the US manufacturing
operations into the principal facility in Attleboro
(Massachusetts) has continued with the relocation to
Attleboro of Inverness (the ear-stud business previously
located in New Jersey) in the third quarter of 2007. This
relocation resulted in a net headcount reduction of 30 and
generates annual cost savings of over £1 million.
In September 2007, the business and manufacturing
equipment of Leach & Garner, also based in Attleboro
(Massachusetts), was acquired for a cash consideration of
US$7 million (£3 million). During 2008, Leach & Garner’s
facility will be closed with all production moving on a phased
basis to the division’s existing facility in Attleboro or to the
new facility in the Dominican Republic.
A new manufacturing facility is currently being built
in the Dominican Republic for a capital investment of
£0.7 million. The facility will be completed in the first quarter
of 2008 and the manufacture of a number of product lines
will be transferred from Attleboro to the new facility on a
phased basis during 2008. This will result in a headcount
reduction of approximately 200 in the US. This restructuring
should generate annual cost savings of approximately
£2 million from the beginning of 2009.
Precious Metals – Europe
Net sales value of £47 million was unchanged compared to
2006 both at reported and constant exchange rates, with
each of the UK, France and Spain trading in line with last
year. The UK business, which generates nearly half of
Europe’s net sales value, outperformed the overall jewellery
market with hallmark statistics for 2007 from the Assay
Office showing a 5% decline from 2006 in the number of
gold jewellery items requiring a hallmark.
Trading profit for 2007 was £2.6 million, 37% (£0.7 million)
ahead of 2006 at constant exchange rates (30% higher at
reported exchange rates). All three countries were profitable.
Trading profit in 2007 was in line with last year for France
and Spain but was doubled in the UK as the benefits of the
recent restructuring programme started to be realised.
Return on net sales value was 5.5% (2006: 4.3%).
In January 2007, a fundamental restructuring of the
UK’s manufacturing operations was announced for
implementation on a phased basis during 2007.
Manufacturing activity at the main manufacturing facility in
Birmingham was halved in the second quarter and a facility
in Wrexham closed at the end of August. A new facility in
Thailand became operational in July 2007. These initiatives
resulted in a headcount reduction of approximately 70 in
the UK and will generate an annualised profit improvement
of approximately £2 million.
Group corporate
The Group’s corporate costs, being the costs directly related
to managing the Group holding company, were £7.7 million,
£1.0 million lower than in the previous year. The costs in
2006 reflected a number of non-recurring charges, in
particular costs relating to the successful SEC deregistration.
Discontinued operations
Discontinued operations in 2007 include the results of
Monofrax prior to its disposal in February 2007. For 2006,
discontinued operations comprise Monofrax for the full year
and also include the results of the Laminates business prior
to its disposal in April 2006. Cookson Group plc 23 Annual Report 2007

As described in detail in the Operating Review, the positive
end-market growth experienced in the majority of our
businesses during 2007, together with the benefit of the
investment and restructuring initiatives implemented over the
last few years, drove an improvement in operating margins
from our continuing businesses by one percentage point to
10.5%; delivering trading profit of £169.6 million – an increase
of 17% on that reported for 2006 (at constant currency).
After net finance costs of £21.5 million, reduced from
last year as a result of lower average borrowings and
lower pension interest, headline profit before tax was up
14% over last year to £149.6 million. The Group’s effective
tax rate on continuing operations reduced significantly by
4.4 percentage points to 26.9% as more of the Group’s
taxable profits were earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions.
The continued improvement in the Group’s trading
performance, coupled with the lower interest charge and
lower effective tax rate, resulted in a 17% increase in
headline earnings per share over 2006. This strong
performance contributed to the Board’s decision to
recommend to shareholders a final dividend of 8.75 pence
for 2007. This final dividend, together with the interim
dividend paid in October 2007, makes a total of 13.00 pence
per ordinary share for the year (up 30% over 2006).
Finally, the successful share placing in October in
connection with the proposed acquisition of Foseco, which
raised net proceeds of £151 million, meant that net debt at
the year-end was £51 million, a reduction of £130 million
from last year.

Group Income Statement
Headline profit before tax
Headline profit before tax for total operations was
£149.6 million for 2007, which was £18.4 million higher
than for 2006. The increase in headline profit before tax
arose as follows:

The £6.9 million lower charge for net finance costs
(interest) principally comprised £3.5 million due to lower
pension interest as a result of the lower employee benefits
deficit; and £3.0 million due to a decrease in the average
level of borrowings of £70 million throughout the year.
The £8.1 million decrease in trading profit from
discontinued operations primarily related to the disposal of
the Laminates business in April 2006.
Items excluded from headline profit before tax
A net credit of £1.8 million was incurred in 2007 (2006:
charge of £17.7 million) for the following items excluded
from headline profit before tax:
Rationalisation costs: costs of £5.8 million (2006:
£34.7 million) were incurred in 2007, all relating to
continuing operations. Of the total charge, £1.6 million
related to the non-cash write-down of assets and £4.2 million
to cash-related costs. The principal items included in the
charge for 2007 were as follows:
• £2.1 million in the Ceramics division, principally relating to
the rationalisation of facilities in the US;
• £2.8 million in the Precious Metal division, both for the
rationalisation of the UK manufacturing operations and
also the relocation of Inverness, the ear-stud business, to
Attleboro, US; and
• £0.8 million in the Chemistry sector for the rationalisation
of its sales, manufacturing and distribution network in
Europe.
Profit relating to non-current assets: a profit of £7.0 million
(2006: £13.1 million) was realised in 2007, principally
relating to the disposal of surplus properties in Hong Kong,
the UK and Australia.
Employee benefits curtailment gains: a credit of £1.0 million
(2006: £8.6 million) was realised in the year relating to
amendments to the defined benefit post-retirement
healthcare plan in the UK.
Loss on disposal of continuing operations: a net loss of
£0.4 million (2006: loss of £4.7 million) comprised a small
profit arising on the disposal of a US Alumina Bricks
business in February 2007, net of trailing costs incurred in
respect of prior years’ disposals. The US Alumina Bricks,
business, which did not qualify to be treated as a
discontinued operation for financial reporting purposes,
was formerly part of the Ceramics division. The net charge
included a write-off of goodwill of £0.5 million.
The loss on disposal of continuing operations in 2006
related principally to the disposal of the Ceramic Fibres and
the UK Carbon Blocks businesses, both formerly part of the
Ceramics division, and the PVC Cements business, formerly
part of the Assembly Materials sector.
Group profit before tax and after the items noted above
was £151.4 million for 2007 compared to £113.5 million in
2006, up 33%.
Taxation
The tax charge on ordinary activities was £39.9 million. The
effective tax rate on headline profit before tax from
continuing operations (before share of post-tax profit of
joint ventures) was 26.9% (2006: 31.3%). The decrease in
the effective tax rate in 2007 compared to 2006 arises both
from a higher proportion of the Group’s taxable profits
being earned in relatively low tax rate countries (notably
China and the Czech Republic) and from improved
profitability in previously loss-making countries (notably the
UK and the US). This effective tax rate is expected to reduce
further for 2008, before the impact of Foseco, by about one
percentage point to around 26%, absent any significant
changes in the future geographic split of the Group’s
taxable profits and any material changes, beyond those
already announced, in the statutory tax rates in those
countries where the Group has significant taxable profits.
The cash outflow in respect of tax in 2007 was £26.7 million
(2006: £27.5 million).
A tax charge of £3.5 million (2006: £5.3 million) arose in
relation to all the items excluded from headline profit before
tax noted above.
Net post-tax loss on disposal of discontinued operations
A net post-tax loss of £0.1 million (2006: loss of £3.3 million)
was reported for 2007, comprising a profit before goodwill
write-off arising on the disposal of Monofrax (formerly part
of the Ceramics division) of £8.2 million, a write-off of
goodwill of £4.3 million, a profit of £1.2 million resulting
from additional proceeds received in respect of the disposal
in 2003 of the Group’s former Speedline business, and
additional trailing costs related to prior years’ disposals of
£5.2 million.
The net post-tax loss on disposal of operations of
£3.3 million in 2006 principally related to the disposal of the
Group’s Laminates business, formerly part of the
Electronics division. Cookson Group plc 25 Annual Report 2007
Profit attributable to equity holders
Headline profit attributable to equity holders for 2007 was
£106.8 million (2006: £89.2 million), with the £17.6 million
increase over 2006 arising from the significant increase in
headline profit before tax, the decrease in the effective tax
rate and a decrease of £0.6 million in profit attributable to
minority interests following the buy-out in October 2006 of
the 49% minority interest in the Chemistry sector’s Chinese
operations.
After taking account of all items excluded from
headline profit before tax noted above (net of the related
tax impact) and the net post-tax loss on disposal of
operations, the Group recorded a profit of £107 .9 million for
2007, £41.5 million higher than the £66.4 million profit
recorded in 2006.
Return on investment (“ROI”)
The Group’s post-tax ROI in 2007 was 9.8%, ahead of the
8.4% reported in 2006 and reflecting the growth in the
Group’s profitability. The ROI now exceeds the Group’s post-
tax cost of capital of 8.5%.
Earnings per share (“EPS”)
The weighted average number of shares in issue during
2007 was 196.7 million, 5.2 million higher than for 2006
principally reflecting the placing of 18.6 million new shares
on 11 October 2007.
Headline EPS, based on the headline profit attributable
to equity holders divided by the average number of shares in
issue, amounted to 54.3 pence per share in 2007 , an increase
of 17% on the 46.6 pence recorded in 2006. Based on the
results of continuing operations only, headline EPS was
54.4 pence, an increase over 2006 of 28%. The Directors
believe this basis of calculating EPS is an important measure
of the underlying earnings per share of the Group. Basic EPS,
based on the net profit attributable to parent company
equity holders, was 53.4 pence (2006: 32.8 pence).
Dividends
For 2006, the Company paid a total dividend of 10.00 pence
per share; an interim dividend of 3.00 pence per share paid
in October 2006 and a final dividend of 7.00 pence per
share paid in June 2007. The Board’s confidence in the
future prospects for the Group, supported by the strong
improvement in profitability in 2007, has resulted in the
Board recommending a final dividend of 8.75 pence per
share for 2007, a 25% increase on the 2006 final dividend.
This final dividend, together with the interim dividend of
4.25 pence per share paid in October 2007, would give a
total dividend for 2007 of 13.00 pence per share, an
increase of 30% on 2006.
If approved, the final dividend will be paid on 9 June
2008 to shareholders on the register at the close of
business on 23 May 2008. Shareholders may choose to use
the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (“DRIP”) to reinvest the
final dividend. The closing date for the receipt of new DRIP
mandates is 23 May 2008.
Group Cash Flow
Net cash inflow from operating activities
In 2007, the Group generated £69.4 million of net cash
inflow from operating activities, £1.7 million higher than in
2006. This net increase arose as follows:
2007 2006 Change
£m £m£m
EBITDA 204.3 195.2 9.1
Trade and other working capital (44.8) (29.2) (15.6)
Cash outflow related to assets
and liabilities held for sale (1.5) (7.2) 5.7
Rationalisation costs paid (14.7) (16.1) 1.4
Additional UK pension contributions (28.1) (25.5) (2.6)
Net interest paid (19.1) (22.0) 2.9
Taxation paid (26.7) (27.5) 0.8
Net cash inflow from operating
activities 69.4 67.7 1.7
Of the £44.8 million cash outflow in respect of trade and
other working capital, £31.3 million relates to the increased
level of inventory and trade receivables resulting from the
11% underlying revenue growth of the Ceramics division in
2007 . Also contributing to the outflow was a negative impact
of £12.7 million on the value of inventories and trade
receivables at 31 December 2007 of higher metal prices
(notably for gold, silver and tin) in the Precious Metals and
Electronics divisions. The higher levels of working capital
resulted in a ratio of average trade working capital to sales
from continuing operations for 2007 of 23.0%, 1.2 percentage
points higher than for 2006.
The £5.7 million reduction in outflows related to assets
and liabilities held for sale related principally to Laminates
which was disposed of in April 2006.
Cash outflow for rationalisation of £14.7 million related
to programmes in respect of continuing businesses that
were initiated either in 2007 or prior years. Of the total cash
outflow for rationalisation, £8.1 million related to the
Ceramics division. A cash outflow for rationalisation of
around £5 million is expected in 2008.
Net cash flow from investing activities
Capital expenditure: payments to acquire property, plant
and equipment in 2007 were £59.9 million, 39% higher than
2006 and representing 172% of depreciation (2006: 117%).
Of the total payments, £43.8 million arose in the Ceramics
division in respect of a number of projects in China, India,
Poland, the Czech Republic and Mexico which, once
completed, will increase production capacity and enhance
underlying revenue growth going forward. A cash outflow for
capital expenditure of between £60 million to £65 million is
expected in 2008 (excluding the impact of the proposed
Foseco acquisition). This reflects both the delay, from 2007
to 2008, of the construction of the new £9 million Chinese
facility in the Chemistry sector and the identification of a
number of additional expansion projects in the Ceramics
division, including some £15 million in respect of the
expansion of Solar Crucible™ capacity.
OUR BUSINESS Cookson Group plc 26 Annual Report 2007
FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)
Proceeds from the sale of surplus properties: net proceeds,
principally arising in Hong Kong, the UK and Australia, were
£10.5 million (2006: £16.6 million).
Dividends from joint ventures: dividends of £1.3 million were
received in 2007 (2006: £0.9 million) from the Chemistry
sector’s Japanese joint venture.
Disposals and acquisitions: net cash inflow from disposals
and acquisitions in 2007 was £10.8 million which comprised
the following:
• proceeds from the disposal of businesses, net of disposal
costs, of £24.8 million, principally comprising £18.2 million
for the disposal in February 2007 of Monofrax, £1.7 million
for the disposal in February 2007 of a US Alumina Bricks
business, £1.2 million of deferred consideration relating to
the disposal in June 2006 of the Carbon Blocks operation
in Bawtry, UK and £3.7 million of additional proceeds
relating to the disposal in 2003 of the Speedline business;
and
• acquisition of subsidiaries and joint ventures for
£14.0 million, comprising £10.6 million in respect of the
Precious Metals division’s acquisition of the Leach &
Garner jewellery business (being cash consideration of
£3.1 million for certain assets of the business and
£7.5 million for the working capital impact of the
acquisition), £1.8 million in respect of the Ceramics
division’s investment in the Chinese joint venture with
WISCO, and £1.5 million in respect of deferred
consideration for prior years’ acquisitions.
Proceeds from the disposal of businesses, net of disposal
costs, in 2006 were £59.4 million, principally comprising
£11.1 million for the disposal in March 2006 of the Ceramic
Fibres business, £42.2 million for the disposal in April 2006
of the Laminates business, £1.4 million for the disposal in
June 2006 of the UK Carbon Blocks business, £1.7 million
for the disposal in December 2006 of the PVC Cements
business and £3.7 million of additional proceeds in respect
of the disposal in 2003 of the Speedline business.
Outflow relating to property held for sale: in January 2007,
the Group acquired for £9.0 million the freehold interest in
the site of its former Magnesia-carbon Bricks business
located in Worksop (UK), a business which had been closed
in December 2006. In December 2007, this site was sold for
a net cash consideration of £12.7 million, resulting in a net
cash inflow in 2007 of £3.7 million.
Other investing outflows: net cash outflow from other
investing activity in 2007 was £11.6 million which principally
included the following:
• repayment of £5.3 million of monies owing to the Walloon
regional government in Belgium in respect of the
Ceramics division’s operations in this region;
• trailing costs of £4.9 million in respect of prior years’
disposals; and
• cash payments of £1.7 million in respect of professional
fees relating to the proposed acquisition of Foseco.
Free cash flow
Free cash flow is defined as net cash flow from operating
activities after net outlays for the acquisition and disposal
of property, plant and equipment, dividends received from
joint ventures and paid to minority shareholders, but before
additional funding contributions to Group pension plans.
Free cash outflow for 2007 was £47 .6 million, £16.9 million
lower than 2006, due both to the £15.6 million increase in
cash outflows relating to trade and other working capital for
the reasons described above and the £16.7 million increase in
the payments to acquire property, plant and equipment.
As in prior years, free cash flow in the second half of the
year increased strongly compared with the first half due to
higher profitability and significantly higher cash inflows
from trade working capital.
Net cash flow before financing
Net cash inflow before financing for 2007 was £24.2 million,
£70.0 million lower than 2006. This arose due both to the
reduction in free cash flow for the reasons noted above and
to a £34.6 million reduction in proceeds from the disposal
of businesses.
Cash flow from financing activities
Net cash inflow from financing activities (before repayment
of borrowings) was £104.2 million (2006: outflow of £14.9
million), principally comprising the following:
• proceeds (net of costs) of £150.6 million from the
placing of 18.6 million new shares on 11 October 2007 in
connection with the proposed acquisition of Foseco. The
shares issued in the placing represented approximately
9.6% of Cookson’s issued ordinary share capital prior to
the placing and were issued at a price of 825 pence per
share;
• cash outflow of £20.0 million relating to the settlement
during the year of forward foreign exchange contracts.
These had been taken out broadly to align the currency
profile of the Group’s borrowings with the net assets of
the Group and formed part of the hedge on investments
of the Group’s foreign operations. This cash outflow was
therefore largely offset by an increase in the net assets of
those operations. The cash outflow arose principally as a
result of the strengthening against sterling during the
year of the European currencies (notably the euro, Polish
zloty and the Czech Republic koruna) and the Chinese
renminbi, which more than offset a marginal weakening of
the US dollar during the year;
• payments of £4.8 million in respect of the new £950 million
committed bank facility; and
• dividend payments to equity shareholders of £21.7 million,
comprising a £13.5 million payment of the 2006 final
dividend of 7.00 pence per share in June 2007 and a
£8.2 million payment of the 2007 interim dividend of
4.25 pence per share in October 2007.
Net cash inflow and movement in net debt
Net cash inflow for 2007 (before repayment of borrowings)
was £128.4 million, £49.1 million higher than 2006.
With a £4.3 million positive foreign exchange
adjustment, £2.4 million of debt arising on the Ceramics
division’s acquisition in April 2007 of BRC (a manufacturer
of brick-lining products in China), and £0.4 million of other
non-cash movements, this resulted in a reduction in net
debt of £129.9 million to £50.6 million. Cookson Group plc 27 Annual Report 2007

in May 2007 and US$130 million in November 2007, are
repayable at various dates between 2009 and 2012.
The current committed bank facility of £200 million has
a current maturity date of March 2010.
On 10 October 2007, the Group entered into a new
multi-currency, committed bank facility for approximately
£950 million, raised for the purpose of the proposed
acquisition of Foseco. The facility will be used, in
combination with the net proceeds of £151 million from the
share placing on 11 October 2007, to finance the acquisition
of Foseco, including the refinancing of the existing
committed bank facilities of Cookson and Foseco. Cookson’s
US Private Placement loan notes will not be refinanced on
completion of the Foseco acquisition.
Currency
The US dollar weakened marginally against sterling during the
course of the year such that the exchange rate at 31 December
2007 was some 2% higher than at 1 January 2007. However,
the European currencies, particularly the euro, the Polish zloty
and the Czech Republic koruna, strengthened significantly
against sterling by 8%, 13% and 11% respectively. The Chinese
renminbi also strengthened 5% against sterling during the year .
The average US dollar exchange rate for 2007 was 9%
higher than the average exchange rate for 2006. The Chinese
renminbi also weakened 4% against sterling. The average
values of the European currencies in 2007 were relatively
stable against sterling compared to the prior year, with the
euro unchanged, the Polish zloty 3% stronger and the Czech
Republic koruna 2% stronger .
In 2007, the net translation impact of currency changes
compared to last year was to reduce revenue from continuing
operations by around £60 million and reduce trading profit
from continuing operations by around £5 million.
Pension fund and other post-retirement obligations
The Group operates defined contribution and defined
benefit pension plans, principally in the UK and US.
In addition, the Group has various other defined benefit
post-retirement arrangements, being principally healthcare
plans in the US. The Group’s UK defined benefit pension
plan is closed to new members and its two principal defined
benefit pension plans in the US are closed to new members
and to further benefit accrual for existing members.
As at 31 December 2007, a liability of £96.1 million was
recognised in respect of employee benefits, a decrease of
£59.0 million over the £155.1 million as at 31 December
2006. This decrease results primarily from an increase in
the prescribed discount rates used to calculate the present
value of future liabilities and, in respect of the UK plan, the
additional ‘top-up’ payments made in 2007 in accordance
with an agreement reached with the Trustee in 2006. These
factors have more than offset the assumption of increased
life expectancy of retirees. Of the total liability, £26.0 million
relates to the deficit on the Group’s defined benefit pension
plan in the UK, £34.6 million to the Group’s defined benefit
pension plans in the US, £14.0 million to defined benefit
pension arrangements in the Rest of the World, and
£21.5 million to unfunded post-retirement defined benefit
arrangements, being mainly healthcare benefit arrangements
in the US.
In order to reduce significantly the future underlying
volatility of the funding position of the Group’s UK plan, in
November 2006 the plan Trustee implemented risk
mitigation elements within its investment strategy by which
it entered into a portfolio of inflation and interest rate
swaps, executed an equity hedge and increased its asset
diversification. The effect of these arrangements has been
to significantly narrow the range of likely outcomes for the
underlying economic value of the UK employee benefit
deficit, whether arising from variability in the investment
performance of the plan’s assets due to the impact of future
changes in economic circumstances, or from other aspects
of financial market pricing which are largely outside of the
Group’s control. These risk mitigation enhancements have
not impacted on the expected return assumptions in the
Group’s financial statements.
The schedule of funding contributions agreed with the
Trustee of the Group’s UK plan in 2006 was reconfirmed in
March 2008 and requires ‘top-up’ payments (in addition to the
normal employer contributions) of £26.5 million in 2008. The
level of the scheduled ‘top-up’ payments is expected to be
reviewed in consultation with the Trustee in the second half of
2008, after the proposed acquisition of Foseco is completed.
The total charge to the income statement in 2007 for all
pension plans (including defined contribution plans) and
other post-retirement benefits was £16.0 million, an increase
of £2.0 million over 2006. Of this charge, £13.0 million (2006:
£15.8 million) has been deducted in arriving at trading profit
and £3.0 million (2006: £6.5 million) has been included within
net finance costs. Total pension cash contributions amounted
to £42.8 million in 2007 (2006: £42.2 million).
Summary
Strong trading results, particularly from the Ceramics
division, combined with lower interest costs and a much
reduced effective tax rate, have combined to deliver a
further year of excellent earnings growth.

OUR BUSINESS Cookson Group plc 28 Annual Report 2007
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Corporate Responsibility Statement
Policy
Cookson recognises that its operations impact a wide
community of stakeholders, including investors, employees,
customers, business associates and local communities and
that appropriate attention to the fulfilment of its corporate
responsibilities can enhance overall performance. In
structuring its approach to the various aspects of corporate
social responsibility, the Company takes account of guidelines
and statements issued by stakeholder representatives and
other regulatory bodies from around the world.
Social, environmental and ethical matters are reviewed
by the Board, particularly as regards the impact such
matters may have on the Group’s management of risk and
the internal control systems in place for addressing any
significant associated risks.
Code of Conduct
The Company has a Code of Conduct (“Cookson Code”),
which has been distributed throughout the Group in 12
languages and by which all its businesses are required to
operate. The Cookson Code emphasises the Company’s
commitment to compliance with the highest standards
of legal and ethical behaviour. The Cookson Code is
reproduced in full on the Company’s website,
www.cooksongroup.co.uk.
As stated in the Cookson Code, the primary goal of
Cookson is the protection and advancement of the interests
of investors by providing attractive returns on a long-term
basis. In striving to achieve this goal, management must
conduct its business in a responsible manner, while
engaging in careful risk-taking as an essential ingredient of
business success. The Cookson Code requires that
particular care be given to the preservation and protection
of Group assets by making prudent and effective use of
resources. Long-term customer satisfaction is recognised as
being essential to the attainment of Group goals, which
means listening carefully to customers’ product and service
requirements and maintaining a reputation for integrity in
all business and other dealings.
The Group can only achieve its goals through the efforts
of its employees. Cookson recognises that job satisfaction
requires working environments that motivate employees to
be productive and innovative, and which provide
opportunities for employee training and development to
maximise personal potential and develop careers within the
Group. Cookson believes that wherever in the world they
work employees have the right to be treated in good faith
and on the basis of respect for the dignity of the individual.
The Cookson Code requires all Group companies to
ensure that recruitment, training, promotion, career
development, termination and similar employment-related
issues are based on individual ability, achievement,
experience and conduct without regard to race, colour,
nationality, culture, ethnic origin, religion, sex, sexual
orientation, age, disability or any other reason not related
to job performance or prohibited by applicable law.
The Cookson Code requires all employees, officers and
Directors to have a duty of loyalty to the Group. Individuals
may not use their positions to profit themselves or others at
the expense of the Group. Personal interests that do, may or
might appear to conflict with Group interests or improperly
influence the performance of an individual’s duties must be
avoided at all times.
Cookson seeks to be a good corporate citizen wherever
it conducts business. The Cookson Code requires employees
to observe all national and local laws and never seek to gain
any advantage through the inappropriate use of payments,
business courtesies or other inducements. Bribery is strictly
prohibited. Group businesses must respect and take into
account regional and local concerns, customs and traditions.
Helpline
Cookson has a 24-hour Employee Business Concern
Helpline telephone and email facility. This is operated by a
professional, external provider of employee support,
counselling and business concern services, which provides
Cookson’s employees and business associates worldwide
with an independent and confidential service through which
to register any concerns about any incorrect or irregular
practices they perceive in Cookson’s workplace. With the
express permission of the caller or email correspondent, the
service provider reports any matters raised to a designated
team at Cookson’s Head Office for investigation.
Health, Safety and Environmental
Statement
Policy
Cookson has a Health, Safety and Environment (“HS&E”)
Policy based on the principle of operating in a manner that
preserves health, safety and a sound environment. For
Cookson companies worldwide, the minimum acceptable
standard is to meet their legal HS&E obligations, however,
the aim is to improve continually. Cookson believes that
good HS&E performance is an integral part of effective and
profitable business management. The policy, which is
reviewed regularly, is available in full on the Company’s
website, www.cooksongroup.co.uk.
Management systems
The Board assumes ultimate responsibility for HS&E policy
and for monitoring its implementation, while executives and
line managers are directly responsible for HS&E matters in
the operations under their control. A reporting system is in
place to collect, collate and report on key performance
indicators. Advice and support is available from the
corporate HS&E function, led by the Group Head of HS&E
who reports on these matters to the Board. Cookson Group plc 29 Annual Report 2007
Performance
Since 2004, Cookson has operated a programme aimed at
reducing energy use and the associated emissions of
carbon dioxide (“CO
2
”), the principal greenhouse gas. The
programme trains employees to understand energy use and
conservation principles and introduces energy audits to
assist high-use sites in identifying and implementing
conservation measures. During 2007, Cookson conducted
energy audits and prepared energy-use reduction plans at
19 facilities, typically identifying cost-effective opportunities
to reduce site energy by between 5% and 10%. In early
2007, the Group established a target to reduce normalised
energy use by 9% within 3 years, further demonstrating
Cookson’s commitment to reduced energy use and CO
2
emissions. Many sites that have had energy audits and have
implemented the core recommendations in 2006 or early
2007 are already showing energy reductions approaching
the 9% target, i.e. significantly ahead of plan.
During 2007, several additional Cookson locations
achieved certification to ISO 14001, the international
standard for environmental management systems, bringing
the Group total to 44. Likewise, the number of locations
certified to OHSAS 18001, the standard for health and safety
management systems, increased to 20.
A number of Cookson companies in the US have been
named as potentially responsible parties under the
Superfund law for wastes disposed of at sites owned by
third parties. Although likely Group costs depend on many
factors, the few cases that remain active are expected to be
settled within the amounts already provided.
Like many manufacturers, some Group companies have
potential environmental liabilities because of past operations
at their current or former sites. Where remediation is
required, Cookson environmental managers and external
specialists work with government authorities to ensure that
remediation is conducted effectively and efficiently.
Compliance
A small number of enforcement notices were issued to
Cookson companies in 2007 , including several that assessed
minor penalties. One civil court action for alleged non-
compliance with waste management requirements
associated with managing an inactive site was filed against
a Cookson company in 2006. The company expects to settle
the case in 2008.
REACH
The European regulation for the Registration, Evaluation,
Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) will
have significant implications for Cookson businesses.
REACH requires the registration of some 30,000 chemicals
as it shifts the burden of proving chemical safety to
industry, affecting the availability, cost and conditions of
use of many substances. Cookson’s chemical manufacturing
businesses are taking steps to ensure that the necessary
personnel understand the obligations under REACH and
have the systems in place to meet them.
Workplace
Cookson’s success depends on retaining the commitment of
the people who work within it. The Group strives to ensure
that employees have a safe environment in which to work
and that employment practices are fair and equitable.
Safety
Cookson’s goal is zero work-related injuries and illness.
To achieve this, a worldwide initiative has been implemented
to improve safety performance, with a particular focus on
applying sound risk assessments and ergonomic principles.
The programme includes minimum standards of performance,
targeted assistance to higher risk sites and a variety of
training and awareness activities. From 2002 to 2007, the
rate of recordable injuries and illness improved by 58%, and
the rate of injuries and illness resulting in absence from
work improved by 55%. To ensure continued progress, the
Group set, in early 2007, a target of a further reduction in
injury and illness rates of 30% by the end of 2009. Progress
was mixed in 2007; whilst the recordable injury rate
improved by approximately 7%, the rate of days away
injuries worsened by approximately 11%. Renewed efforts
during the year resulted in steady improvement in the
second half of 2007.
During 2007, Cookson continued to focus on the
elimination of work-related injuries through better
application of ergonomic principles. The last five years have
seen extensive ergonomic training throughout the Group
and the establishment of ergonomic teams at a number of
facilities, leading to a significant improvement in their
performance. Additional information on HS&E matters can
be found on the Group’s website.

OUR GOVERNANCE Cookson Group plc 32 Annual Report 2007
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Details are set out in the narrative below of the Company’s
corporate governance procedures and application of the
principles of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued
by the Financial Reporting Council in June 2006 (“the Code”).
The Company has complied with the provisions of the Code
throughout the year ended 31 December 2007.
The Board
Ultimate responsibility for the management of Cookson rests with
the Board of Directors. The Board focuses primarily upon
strategic and policy issues. It approves the Group’s strategy,
oversees the allocation of resources and monitors the
performance of the Group in pursuit of this.
Membership
The Board currently has seven Directors, comprising the non-
executive Chairman, the Chief Executive, the Group Finance
Director and four non-executive Directors. The Board considers
each of the non-executive Directors, namely Messrs Hewitt,
Oosterveld, Perry and Sussens, to be independent of
management and free from any business or other relationship
which could affect the exercise of their independent judgement.
The Company has reviewed the availability of the non-executive
Directors and considers that each of them is able to, and in
practice does, devote the necessary amount of time to the
Company’s business. The Board nominates one of the non-
executive Directors to act as Senior Independent Director and
provide an alternative contact at Board level, other than the
Chairman, to whom shareholder matters can be addressed. Mr
Sussens held this position during the year . There were no changes
of Board membership during the year. The biographical details of
the individual Directors who served during the year are set out on
page 31.
The Articles of Association of the Company require that
Directors should submit themselves for re-election at least every
three years. Messrs Oosterveld, Perry, Salmon and Sussens will
therefore be retiring and offering themselves for re-election at
this year’s Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) as set out in the
Notice of AGM.
Responsibilities and meetings
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it and
delegates certain matters to committees as outlined below. The
Board met as a full Board on eight scheduled occasions during
2007 . One of these meetings was held at a Cookson facility during
a Board visit to the Group’s operations. Board meetings are also
convened on an ad-hoc basis for non-routine business. In
addition, the Chairman and the non-executive Directors meet
routinely on their own without the executive Directors present
and at least once each year the non-executive Directors meet
without the Chairman present to discuss matters such as the
Chairman’s performance.
Specific matters reserved for the Board include: reviewing
Group and divisional performance; approving significant
transactions including acquisitions, divestments and capital
expenditure; setting and approving the Group’s strategy and
annual budget; approving the Group’s financing and treasury
policies; succession planning and approving Board appointments
and the remuneration of the non-executive Directors. In addition
the Board considers health, safety and environmental matters
and reviews the Group’s risk management processes.
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the
Chief Executive has been agreed by the Board and is set out in
writing. The Chairman leads the Board and meets routinely with
the Chief Executive and Group Secretary to discuss matters
relating to its efficient functioning. The Chairman also serves as
Chairman of Elementis plc and as the Senior Independent Director
and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee of D S Smith plc.
The Board considers that the Chairman is able to and does devote
sufficient time to his duties at Cookson.
The attendance of Directors at Board and principal Committee
meetings during the year, together with the maximum number of
meetings in the period when the individual was a Board member
(as shown in brackets), was as follows:

Papers are provided to the Directors in advance of the relevant
Board or committee meeting to enable them to make further
enquiries about any matters prior to the meeting should they so
wish. The Group Secretary oversees the distribution of these
papers and ensures that there is an appropriate level of
communication between the Board and its committees and
between senior management and non-executive Directors. He
also keeps the Board apprised of relevant developments in
corporate governance.
Performance evaluation
The Board evaluates its own performance and effectiveness and
assesses the performance of its committees and individual
members on an annual basis. In 2007 each Committee Chairman
discussed and evaluated the relevant Committee’s performance
with all members and provided a report back to the Board. In turn,
the Chairman of the Board discussed the Board’s performance
with individual Directors and reported back to the Board. The
Board discussed the results of these reviews and concluded that
overall it was operating effectively and that all Directors
continued to contribute and were committed to their roles at
Cookson. Plans have been implemented to address areas
highlighted for additional focus going forward, such as succession
planning.
The performance of the Chairman was in turn reviewed by the
Senior Independent Director following consultation with other
members of the Board. The Chairman was judged to have
performed satisfactorily.
  Cookson Group plc 33 Annual Report 2007
Induction and training
The Group Secretary ensures that a comprehensive induction
programme is provided to all new Directors, including visits to
manufacturing facilities, meetings with key Group executives and
introductions to the Company’s principal external advisers, as
appropriate. New Directors are also advised of their legal and
other duties and obligations as Directors of a listed company. This
is supplemented by reference materials, which are updated as
required, including information about the Board, the committees,
Directors’ duties, procedures for dealing in the Company’s shares
and other regulatory and governance matters. Directors are
provided with details of seminars and training courses relevant to
their role. They are encouraged to attend these as they consider
appropriate and are supported by the Company in so doing.
Where a general training need is identified, in-house training is
provided to the entire Board. In 2007 presentations were given to
the Board on the Companies Act 2006. During the year Directors
also attended external seminars and other functions relevant to
specific areas of their responsibility.
Relations with shareholders
The Company has an established investor relations programme
managed by the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director. The
Company reports its financial results to shareholders twice a year ,
with the publication of its Annual and Interim Reports. In
conjunction with these announcements presentations are made
to institutional investors and analysts, copies of which are posted
on the Company’s website, www.cooksongroup.co.uk. In addition,
in 2007 the Company provided trading updates at the Company’s
AGM and in advance of the interim and year-end close-periods,
and hosted a Capital Markets Day for analysts at its Ceramics
facility in Skawina, Poland in October.
The Company maintains a regular dialogue with major
institutional investors and regular updates on shareholder issues
and discussions are provided to the Board. Board members also
receive copies of significant analysts’ notes issued on the
Company. All Directors normally attend the Company’s AGM,
providing shareholders with the opportunity to question them
about issues relating to the Group, either during the meeting or
informally afterwards.
Board committees
The principal committees of the Board are the Audit, Remuneration
and Nominations Committees. Each committee has written terms of
reference agreed by the Board. These are available to view on the
Company’s website, www.cooksongroup.co.uk.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee members are the non-executive Directors,
namely Messrs Hewitt, Oosterveld, Perry and Sussens. During the
year the Committee was chaired by Mr Hewitt. The Board believes
Mr Hewitt possesses relevant financial experience, as described
by the Code.
The Group Finance Director, the Group Head of Internal Audit
and the Company’s Auditor, KPMG Audit Plc, are normally invited
to attend meetings and other executives are invited to attend as
and when appropriate. The Committee meets regularly with the
Company’s Auditor without any executives being present.
Audit Committee report
The principal roles of the Audit Committee are:
• assisting the Board in the discharge of its responsibilities in
respect of statutory and other financial reporting and in
respect of its review of the effectiveness of the Group’s
internal controls and risk management systems;
• monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal audit function;
• making recommendations to the Board on the appointment
and dismissal of the Auditor;
• approving the remuneration and terms of engagement of the
Auditor;
• monitoring and reviewing the Auditor’s independence,
objectivity and effectiveness, taking into account professional
and regulatory requirements; and
• helping to strengthen the independent position of the Auditor
by providing a direct channel of communication between it
and the non-executive Directors.
The Committee has established procedures for the receipt,
retention and treatment of complaints received by the Company
including accounting, internal controls, auditing matters and
confidential communications from employees.
The Group Head of Internal Audit reports directly to the
Committee Chairman and the Committee reviews and approves
the internal audit work programme for each year. During the year
under review, the Committee met four times and reviewed,
amongst other matters, the Company’s published financial
results; internal audit reports and management control issues;
the scope of the external audit and its cost effectiveness; and the
extent to which the Auditor’s remuneration for non-audit services
might affect their independence and objectivity in carrying out
the audit.
More specifically, the responsibilities of the Committee were
discharged as follows:
• at its meetings in July 2007 and March 2008, the Committee
reviewed the Company’s Interim Report and Preliminary
Results announcement/Annual Report and Accounts,
respectively. On both occasions, the Committee received
reports from the Auditor identifying any accounting or
judgmental issues thereon requiring its attention;
• at each of the four meetings, the Committee received a report
from the Group Head of Internal Audit covering, amongst
other things, the work undertaken by the Internal Audit
function and management responses to proposals made in
the audit reports issued by the function during the year. In
addition, at the December 2007 meeting, the Committee
reviewed the internal audit plan for 2008, submitted by the
Group Head of Internal Audit;
• at the October 2007 meeting, the Committee reviewed and
agreed the audit plan presented by the Auditor , which detailed
the approach and scope of the work to be undertaken for
2007 and the level of fee to be charged;
• at its meetings in December 2007 and March 2008 the
Committee reviewed both the risk management process
operated by Group management designed to identify the key
risks facing each business and also how those risks were
being managed;
OUR GOVERNANCE Cookson Group plc 34 Annual Report 2007
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT (CONTINUED)
Audit Committee report (continued)
• from time to time, executives were required to make
presentations to the Committee or to the full Board on the
identification, management and control of specific areas of
risk which impact the Company and the Group; and
• as a matter of routine, the Committee was presented with
information on any significant litigation involving the Group.
As noted above, one of the duties of the Committee is to make
recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment of
the Auditor . A number of factors concerning the Auditor are taken
into account by the Committee in assessing whether to
recommend the Auditor for re-appointment, including:
• the quality both of reports provided to the Committee and the
Board, and of advice given;
• the level of understanding demonstrated of the Group’s
businesses; and
• the objectivity of the Auditor’s views on the controls
throughout the Group and its ability to coordinate a global
audit, working to tight deadlines.
The Committee has put in place safeguards to ensure that the
independence of the external audit is not compromised. Such
safeguards include:
• seeking confirmation that the Auditor is independent of the
Company in its own professional judgement; and
• considering all the relationships between the Auditor and the
Group, including those relating to the provision of non-audit
services and whether this impairs, or appears to impair, the
Auditor’s judgement or independence.
The Company has a policy governing the Group-wide conduct of
non-audit work by the Auditor. Under that policy the Auditor is
prohibited from performing services where it:
• may be required to audit its own work;
• would participate in activities that would normally be
undertaken by management;
• is remunerated through a ‘success fee’ structure; or
• acts in an advocacy role for the Group.
Other than the above, the Company does not impose an
automatic prohibition on the Auditor undertaking non-audit work.
The Auditor is permitted to provide non-audit services that are
not, or are not perceived to be, in conflict with auditor
independence, providing it has the skill, competence and integrity
to carry out the work in the best interests of the Group. Details of
the amounts paid to the Auditor during the year for audit and
other services are set out in note 8 on page 67.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee reports the outcome of
the Audit Committee meetings to the Board and the Board receives
the agenda, papers and minutes of Audit Committee meetings.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee members are the non-executive
Directors, namely Messrs Hewitt, Oosterveld, Perry and Sussens
who chairs the Committee. The Committee’s principal roles are to
recommend and monitor the level and structure of remuneration
for senior management and to set the appropriate remuneration
for the Group Chairman, executive Directors and Group Secretary.
Further details of the activities of the Remuneration Committee are
provided in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 42 to 47 .
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee reports the
outcome of the Remuneration Committee meetings to the Board.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee advises the Board on appointments
to, and retirements and resignations from, the Board. The
members of the Committee are the Group Chairman, the Chief
Executive and any three non-executive Directors. The Committee
meets as and when required and is chaired by the Group
Chairman or a non-executive Director . The Group Chairman would
not act as Chairman of the Committee where it was dealing with
the appointment of his successor. Formal meetings are held to
consider standing items of business; there is also a significant
level of ad hoc discussion between members of the Committee,
particularly when a recruitment exercise is taking place.
When considering the appointment of new Directors, the
Committee draws up specifications, taking into consideration the
existing balance of skills, knowledge and experience of the Board
and the ongoing requirements of the Group. It utilises the
services of external recruitment consultants to identify
appropriate candidates, interviews those short-listed and then
makes recommendations for each appointment to the full Board.
Care is taken to ensure that all proposed appointees have
sufficient time available to devote to the role and do not have any
conflicts of interest. 
The Nominations Committee reviews the Company’s
succession plans. The Board as a whole also considers this
subject. Each of Cookson’s divisions submit detailed succession
plans in respect of senior divisional executives to the Board for
review each year. The Board also considers succession planning
for senior corporate executives with the Nominations Committee
focusing in turn, specifically on succession planning for members
of the Board.
The Chairman of the Nominations Committee reports the
outcome of the Nominations Committee meetings to the Board.
Finance and Share Schemes Committees
The Board delegates certain responsibilities on an ad hoc basis to
the Finance and Share Schemes Committees.
The Finance Committee is chaired by the Group Chairman, its
other members being the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director
and Group Treasurer . The Committee meets as and when required
to consider the approval of treasury-related matters.
The Share Schemes Committee’s membership consists of any
two Directors. It meets as and when required to undertake
administrative matters in relation to the Company’s share schemes.
Executive Committee and Central Executive
In addition to the committees of the Board described above, the
Group has an Executive Committee which supports the Chief
Executive in addressing Group-wide issues and initiatives. This
Committee is chaired by the Chief Executive and comprises the
Group Finance Director, the Group Secretary and the Chief
Executives of each of the Group’s three divisions. Specific
authority has been delegated to the Central Executive comprising
the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Group Secretary.
The Central Executive is responsible for reviewing and approving
capital expenditure, acquisitions and disposals at certain levels as
determined by the Board. Responsibility for day-to-day operational
management rests with the divisional Chief Executives. Cookson Group plc 35 Annual Report 2007
Internal control
The Directors are responsible for the establishment and
maintenance of the Group’s system of internal control.
The Company has complied with the provisions of the Code on
internal control which require that the Directors review the
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls, including
financial, operational and compliance controls, and risk
management systems. Whilst no system of internal control can
provide absolute assurance against material misstatement or
loss, the Group’s system is designed to provide the Directors with
reasonable assurance that problems are identified on a timely
basis and are dealt with appropriately. Since the date of the
review, there have been no significant changes in internal
controls or other matters which could significantly affect them.
There is a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and
managing the significant risks faced by Cookson. Group
management operates a risk management process designed to
identify the key risks facing each business and reports to the
Audit Committee on how those risks are being managed. As a
basis for this report, each of the Group’s major business units
produces a ‘risk map’ which identifies their key risks and assesses
the likelihood of those risks occurring, their impact if they do
occur and the actions being taken to manage those risks to a
desired level.
The internal control system is monitored and supported by
the Group’s Internal Audit function, which operates on a global
basis. This function assists management and the Board in the
effective discharge of their responsibility for internal control by
conducting reviews of Cookson businesses and reporting
objectively both on the adequacy and effectiveness of the system
of internal control in place and as to whether those businesses
are in compliance with applicable Group policies and procedures.
The Group Head of Internal Audit is responsible for developing
the function, within the framework of common Group policies and
standards, and for carrying out assignments in accordance with
an annual audit plan approved by the Audit Committee. The Audit
Committee receives reports from the Group Head of Internal
Audit on a regular basis and reports to the Board on the results
of its review.
As part of the Board’s process for reviewing the effectiveness
of the system of internal control, it delegates the following
matters to the Audit Committee to be carried out during the year:
• review of external and internal audit work plans;
• consideration of reports from management, external audit
and internal audit on the system of internal control and any
material control weaknesses; and
• discussions with management on the actions taken on
problem areas identified by Board members, in internal audit
reports or in external audit management letters.
In addition to the above, the Board considers significant financing
and investment decisions concerning the Group, including the
giving of guarantees and indemnities, and monitors policy and
control mechanisms for managing treasury risk. The Board also
reviews the role of insurance and other measures used in
managing risks across the Group, receives regular reports on any
major issues that have arisen during the year and makes an
annual assessment of how the risks have changed over the period
under review.
At the year-end, following the review by the Audit Committee
of internal financial controls and of the processes covering other
controls, the Board evaluates the results of the internal control
and risk management procedures conducted by senior
management. This includes a self-certification exercise by which
senior management certify the effectiveness of the system of
internal controls within the businesses for which they are
responsible, together with their compliance throughout the year
with the Group’s policies and procedures.
Principal risks and uncertainties
Throughout its global operations, Cookson faces various risks,
both internal and external, which could have a material impact on
the Group’s long-term performance. Cookson manages the risks
inherent in its operations in order to mitigate exposure to all
forms of risk, where practical, and to transfer risk to insurers,
where cost effective.
Global economic, political and operational risks
With operations worldwide, the Group’s businesses are subject to
various risks inherent in their international operations, including
economic, political and operational risks.
The diverse nature of Cookson’s products and services, and
customers and markets served, helps to mitigate the impact of
any individual exposure to economic conditions. Political risks
include the imposition of trade barriers, changes of regulatory
requirements and the volatility of prices, taxes and currencies.
The Group is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes,
including those covering taxation and environmental matters.
The Group’s businesses are subject to a variety of operational
risks, the occurrence of which could result in a substantial
interruption to a facility and a potential loss of customers and
revenue, which may materially impact the trading results of
individual facilities, though not necessarily of the Group as a
whole. The Group is exposed to possible natural catastrophe risk
and possible terrorist action. Management monitors such risks,
maintaining what it considers to be adequate insurance cover and
adopting business practices as appropriate to mitigate exposure.
New products, technology and other market risks
The Group supplies materials and services primarily to the steel
and electronics industries on a global basis and to the jewellery
industry primarily in the US and Europe. These markets and
economies are subject to cyclical changes in demand and to
associated pricing pressures. Furthermore, the markets in which
many of the Group’s businesses operate can experience rapid
changes due to the introduction of new technologies. The Group’s
continued success depends upon its ability to continue to develop
and produce new and enhanced products and services on a cost
effective and timely basis in accordance with customer demands.
In addition, the markets for the Group’s products are competitive
in terms of pricing, product and service quality, product
development and introduction time, customer service, financing
terms and other similar factors. Cookson invests significant
amounts in research and development to sustain its competitive
advantage and takes appropriate action to ensure that its cost
base remains competitive.
OUR GOVERNANCE Cookson Group plc 36 Annual Report 2007
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT (CONTINUED)
Principal risks and uncertainties (continued)
Legislation and regulatory risk
Cookson’s operations are affected by various statutes,
regulations and laws in the countries and markets in which it
operates. Cookson cannot predict whether future developments
in laws and regulations concerning its businesses will affect the
demands of regulatory agencies in a manner which could
adversely impact the Group.
Intellectual property risks
The Group relies on a combination of trade secrets, patents,
confidentiality procedures and agreements, and copyright and
trade mark laws to protect its proprietary rights. If the Group fails
to or is unable to protect, maintain and enforce its existing
intellectual property, it may result in the loss of the Group’s
exclusive right to use technologies and processes which are
included or used in its businesses. The Group’s involvement in
intellectual property litigation could result in significant expense,
and/or materially adversely affect the development of sales of the
challenged product or intellectual property. All appropriate
measures are taken to protect the Group’s intellectual property
rights and to minimise the risk of infringement of third-party rights.
Raw materials risk
Tin, solvents, alumina, graphite, silver and gold are among the
principal raw materials that the Group purchases. The Group’s
businesses may be affected by fluctuations in the price and
supply of such raw materials, although purchasing policies and
practices seek to mitigate, where practicable, such risks and the
Group’s geographical and product diversity reduces the
dependence on any single item or supplier. The Group’s ability to
pass on increases or decreases in the cost of raw materials to its
customers is, to a large extent, dependent upon market
conditions, established market practice and terms of trade.
Environmental and health and safety risks
The Group is subject to applicable laws and regulations in all of
the jurisdictions in which it operates, including those relating to
pollution, the protection of the environment, human health and
safety, the disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials
and remediation of any land or water contaminated by such
substances. Violations of legal or other regulatory requirements
could result in restrictions on plant operations, the imposition of
more stringent permitting conditions, damages, fines or other
sanctions. The practices and processes of Cookson’s businesses
are subject to routine inspections by internal qualified personnel
and by external regulatory or other enforcement bodies.
Provision is made for identified remediation obligations related to
contaminated sites based on a reasonable assessment of the
likely costs of rectification.
Product liability risk
A large proportion of the Group’s products are used in the
manufacturing processes of the Group’s industrial customers. If a
product of the Group or of one of the Group’s industrial
customers does not conform to agreed specifications or is
otherwise defective, the Group may be subject to claims by its
customers arising from end-product defects, injury to individuals
or other such claims.
The Group’s current and former businesses have used and/or
continue to use a wide range of hazardous materials, in the
manufacture of industrial and consumer products. Legal claims have
been brought against certain Group companies by third parties
alleging that persons have been harmed by exposure to such
materials, and further claims may be brought in the future. Two of
the Group’s subsidiaries are subject to suits in the US relating to a
small number of products containing asbestos manufactured prior
to the acquisition of those subsidiaries by the Group. These suits also
name many other product manufacturers. To date, there have been
no liability verdicts against any of these subsidiaries.
Provision is made for amounts payable in respect of known or
probable costs. Management believes, taking into account legal
advice received and the Group’s insurance arrangements and
financial provisions, that none of the currently pending or
potential claims will, either individually or in the aggregate, have
a material adverse impact on the Group’s financial position or
trading results. However, the outcome of legal action is uncertain
and there is always the risk that it may prove more costly than
expected and exceed the level of insurance cover and provisions
made, resulting in such a material adverse impact.
Warranties and liabilities relating to divestments
The Group has divested its interests in certain companies and
businesses and has given indemnifications, representations and
warranties with respect to the businesses of the divested
companies at the time of their divestment. Management believes
that sufficient provisions are in place to meet possible claims
resulting from these indemnifications, representations and
warranties, however, significant liabilities arising out of these
transactions may arise in future which have not been provided for .
Post-employment benefit plans
The Group operates defined benefit pension and other post-
retirement plans, principally in the UK and US, the valuation of
which reflected a deficit of £96.1 million as at 31 December 2007.
The funding level of the Group’s pension plans and the Group’s
liabilities in respect of its post-retirement healthcare plans are
subject to adverse change resulting from movements in the
actuarial assumptions underlying the calculation of plan
liabilities, including decreasing discount rates, increasing
longevity of plan members and, in the case of pension plans, a
decline in the market value of plan investments. Significant
adverse changes in these underlying factors could materially
impact the Group’s financial position. The Group’s largest defined
benefit pension plans are in the UK and US, each of which is
closed to new members, with the Group’s largest US plans also
being closed to further benefit accrual for existing members. The
Group’s main pension plan is its UK plan, which had a deficit of
£26.0 million at the end of 2007. Deficit-reduction contributions
of £26.5 million per annum in addition to the normal cash
contributions are being made under the terms of a repayment
schedule agreed with the plan Trustee in 2006. To reduce future
volatility in the UK plan deficit, the UK plan Trustee, with support
from the Company, entered into swap arrangements and an
equity hedge in 2006 to mitigate significantly the impact of
changes in interest rates and inflation on the UK plan’s liabilities
and volatility in the equity performance of the plan’s assets. Cookson Group plc 37 Annual Report 2007
Compliance with covenants in debt agreements
The Group’s ability to meet the financial ratios and tests and
comply with covenants contained in its current or future debt
agreements could be affected by a material adverse change in
the financial position of the Group. In the event of a default under
any of its financing arrangements, the Group’s lenders could
terminate their commitments to lend to the Group or accelerate
the repayment of debt and declare all amounts borrowed due
and payable.
Precious metal consignment arrangements
The Group’s precious metal fabrication operations utilise
significant quantities of precious metals, primarily gold by value.
These metals are held on consignment arrangements, details of
which are given in note 27 on page 79. The utilisation of
consigned precious metals is established practice in the precious
metals industry. Should precious metals consignors decide to
reduce or withdraw the facilities for whatever reason, or require
a return of the consigned metal, or increased metal prices mean
that the consignment arrangements become fully utilised, the
Group’s precious metal fabrication operations may suffer
shortages of raw materials or may require precious metals to be
supplied in a way which could materially increase Group
borrowings and costs.
Currency exchange rates, inflation and interest rate risk
The Group has no control over changes in foreign currency
exchange rates, or inflation and interest rates. In the normal
course of business, transactions are carried out by Group
companies in currencies other than their reporting currency,
leading to transactional foreign exchange risk, although these are
not material for the Group overall. It is Cookson policy that
foreign currency transaction exposures that are material at an
individual operating unit level are hedged using appropriate
instruments such as forward foreign exchange contracts. While
the Group attempts to manage transactional and balance sheet
translation risks associated with currency exchange rate
fluctuations through its hedging and funding policies,
fluctuations in the value of currencies in which it operates may
nevertheless adversely impact the Group’s financial position and
trading results. The Group does not currently hedge translation
exposures arising on unremitted non-UK earnings.
Where appropriate, the Group manages its interest rate
exposures using interest rate swap agreements or other
instruments; however fluctuations in interest rates could
adversely impact the Group’s financial results. Significant interest
rate and currency hedging programmes require the approval of
the Finance Committee of the Board.
Credit risk
Cash deposits and other financial instruments give rise to credit
risk, represented by the loss that would be recognised should a
counterparty fail to perform as contracted. The counterparties to
the Group’s financial instruments are reputable financial
institutions and the credit rating of these counterparties is
monitored on a regular basis in accordance with Board-approved
guidelines. Further information relating to the Group’s financial
risk management can be found in note 4 on pages 62 and 63 and
in note 36 on pages 85 to 88.
Risks related to the proposed acquisition of Foseco plc
(“Foseco”)
On 11 October 2007 it was announced that the Boards of Cookson
and Foseco had reached agreement on the terms of a
recommended offer for Cookson to acquire the entire issued and to
be issued share capital of Foseco plc. The transaction has recently
been cleared by the competition authorities in the European Union
and United States and approved by Foseco’s shareholders. At the
date of this report, 11 March 2008, the transaction requires
approval by Cookson’s shareholders at an EGM scheduled later in
the day and Court approval of the scheme of arrangement under
section 425 of the Companies Act 1985. The acquisition is expected
to be effected on 4 April 2008. Shareholders of Cookson Group plc
were sent, on 19 December 2007, a circular setting out the details
of and background to the proposed acquisition. In the circular to
shareholders, the Directors set out a number of risk factors relating
to the proposed acquisition of Foseco, which are summarised below.
Expected costs and synergies
While Cookson believes that the costs and synergies expected to
arise from the proposed acquisition have been reasonably
estimated, unanticipated events or liabilities may arise which
result in a delay or reduction in the benefits derived from the
acquisition or in costs significantly in excess of those estimated.
Integration of Foseco
There can be no assurance that the Group will successfully
integrate Foseco into its existing operational structure. There are
risks associated with diversion of management’s attention from
other aspects of the business, unanticipated events or liabilities,
and difficulties in relation to retaining key personnel or
assimilating operations. Furthermore, Foseco is party to
agreements with third parties which, without appropriate
consent, contain termination and review rights in favour of the
counterparties to the agreements in the event of a change of
control of Foseco. Whilst Cookson expects the relevant consents
to be granted for a change of control of Foseco, if these third
party consents cannot be obtained on favourable terms, the
combined businesses of Cookson and Foseco may suffer a loss of
potential future revenues or an adverse impact on its outflows.
Financial indebtedness
The acquisition of Foseco will be financed by cash raised from the
£153 million placing of Cookson shares completed on 11 October
2007 and by debt provided by multi-tranche, multi-currency term
and revolving credit facilities of approximately £950 million. The
resulting increase to Cookson’s financial indebtedness and
gearing, combined with covenants contained in its material debt
facility agreements, could: limit flexibility in the management of
the combined Cookson and Foseco businesses; place Cookson at a
competitive disadvantage compared to any competitors that have
less debt; increase Cookson’s vulnerability to and ability to
withstand general adverse economic and industry conditions as
well as to withstand cyclical downturns in demand for its products;
limit Cookson’s ability to obtain future financing on terms
acceptable to the enlarged group; and affect its ability to obtain
raw materials, particularly precious metals, on a consignment
basis. Cookson intends to reduce and/or refinance its indebtedness
on commercially acceptable terms when it falls due. If it is unable
to do this, its future prospects, financial condition and results of
operations may be materially adversely affected.
OUR GOVERNANCE Cookson Group plc 38 Annual Report 2007
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
The Directors submit their Annual Report together with the
audited accounts of the Group and of the Company, Cookson
Group plc, for the year ended 31 December 2007.
The Chief Executive’s Review, the Operating Review, the
Financial Review, the Corporate Governance Report, the
Corporate Responsibility and Health, Safety and Environmental
Statements and Board of Directors section of the Annual Report
are each incorporated by reference into, and form part of, this
Directors’ Report.
The Annual Report contains certain forward-looking
statements with respect to the operations, performance and
financial condition of the Group. By their nature, these statements
involve uncertainty since future events and circumstances can
cause results and developments to differ materially from those
anticipated. The forward-looking statements reflect knowledge
and information available at the date of preparation of this Annual
Report and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these
forward-looking statements. Nothing in this Annual Report should
be construed as a profit forecast.
Principal activities
Cookson Group plc is a leading materials science company which
provides materials, processes and services to customers
worldwide. The Group’s operations are formed into three divisions
– Ceramics, Electronics and Precious Metals. Known in its markets
as Vesuvius, the Ceramics division is the world leader in the supply
of advanced steel flow control refractory products and systems to
the global steel industry and a leading supplier of specialist
ceramic products to the glass, solar and foundry industries. It is
also a regional leader in the US, UK and Australia in the supply and
installation of monolithic refractory linings. The Electronics
division is a leading supplier of advanced surface treatment and
plating chemicals and assembly materials to the electronics,
industrial and automotive markets. It comprises two sectors:
Assembly Materials and Chemistry. The Precious Metals division is
a leading supplier of fabricated precious metals (primarily gold,
silver and platinum) to the jewellery industry in the US, the UK,
France and Spain. Products include alloy materials, semi-finished
jewellery components and finished jewellery.
Business review
As required by the Companies Act 1985, the Company must
provide a fair review of the development and performance of the
Group during 2007 , its financial position at the end of the year and
likely future developments in the Group’s business, together with
information on environmental matters and employees and a
description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the
Group. The information which satisfies these requirements is to be
found in the Chief Executive’s Review on pages 8 and 9; the
Operating Review on pages 10 to 22; the Financial Review on pages
23 to 27; the Corporate Responsibility and Health, Safety and
Environmental Statements on pages 28 to 29; and the Corporate
Governance Report on pages 32 to 37.
Going concern
The financial statements of the Company and the Group,
respectively, have been prepared on a going concern basis as the
Directors consider that the Company and the Group have adequate
resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future.
Dividends
The Board is recommending a final dividend in respect of 2007 of
8.75p (2006: 7.00p) per ordinary share which, if approved, will be
paid on 9 June 2008 to shareholders on the register at 23 May
2008. An interim dividend of 4.25p (2006: 3.00p) per ordinary
share was paid on 15 October 2007 to shareholders on the
register at 28 September 2007, making total dividends of 13.00p
per ordinary share for the year (2006: 10.00p).
Accountability and audit
A responsibility statement of the Directors and a statement by
the Auditor about its reporting responsibilities can be found on
pages 48 and 49, respectively. The Directors fulfil the
responsibilities set out in their statement within the context of an
overall control environment of central strategic direction and
decentralised operating responsibility.
Disclosure of information to the Auditor
As at the date of this report, so far as each Director of the
Company is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which
the Company’s Auditor is unaware and each Director hereby
confirms that he has taken all the steps that he ought to have
taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that the Company’s Auditor is
aware of that information.
Auditor
Resolutions for the re-appointment of KPMG Audit Plc as Auditor
of the Company and to authorise the Directors to determine its
remuneration are to be proposed at the AGM.
Remuneration matters
The Directors’ Remuneration Report appears on pages 42 to 47.
Neither of the executive Directors’ contracts contains any change
of control provisions. 
Remuneration of the Chairman and non-executive Directors
The Board considers the remuneration policy for the non-
executive Directors. Non-executive Directors’ fees have not been
increased during the year and remain at £40,000 per annum.
A supplementary fee is payable to the Chairman of the Audit
Committee of £15,000 per annum. The Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee receives a supplementary fee of
£10,000 per annum and a supplementary fee of £5,000 per
annum is payable to the Senior Independent Director . No changes
were made in 2007 to the supplementary fees payable.
The Group Chairman’s remuneration, which is subject to
periodic review, is determined by the Remuneration Committee.
There was no change to the Group Chairman’s remuneration,
which was reviewed during the year . Neither the Group Chairman,
who is not an executive Director, nor the other non-executive
Directors are members of the Group’s pension plans, nor do they
participate in the Group’s incentive schemes.
Directors
Biographical information for the Directors of the Company who
served during the year is given on page 31. Messrs Oosterveld,
Perry, Salmon and Sussens will retire at the AGM and will offer
themselves for re-election. Further information on the service Cookson Group plc 39 Annual Report 2007
agreements of the executive Directors, including Mr Salmon, is
given on page 45. The non-executive Directors, including Messrs
Oosterveld, Perry and Sussens, do not have such agreements.
Legal matters
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Group
Secretary. There is also an agreed procedure in place for
Directors, in the furtherance of their duties, to take independent
legal advice if necessary, at the Company’s expense.
Directors’ indemnities
The Company’s Directors are indemnified under the Company’s
Articles of Association.
Employment policies
A fundamental concept embodied in the Company’s Code of
Conduct is that Cookson’s goals can only be met through the
efforts of its employees. Cookson recognises that job satisfaction
requires working environments that motivate employees to be
productive and innovative and provide opportunities for
employee training and development to maximise personal
potential and develop careers within the Group.
Cookson is managed on a decentralised basis and within each
division it is the responsibility of the relevant divisional Chief
Executive to adopt employment policies and practices that best
suit the size, style and geographical location of their operations.
This allows the Group’s operations to respond competitively to
changes in the marketplace and to develop and retain a strong
sense of identity whilst benefiting from being a part of a major
international group. Cookson values the involvement of its
employees and keeps them informed on matters affecting them as
employees and factors relevant to the performance of the Group.
It is established policy throughout Cookson that decisions on
recruitment, career development, training, promotion and other
employment-related issues are made solely on grounds of
individual ability, achievement, expertise and conduct. These
principles are operated on a non-discriminatory basis. Cookson
gives full and fair consideration to applications for employment
from disabled persons. Should an employee become disabled
during their employment with Cookson, every effort is made to
enable them to continue their service with the Group.
Pensions
In each country in which the Group operates, the pension
arrangements in place are considered to be consistent with good
employment practice in that particular area. Independent
advisers are used to ensure that the plans are operated in
accordance with local legislation and the rules of each plan.
Group policy prohibits direct investment of pension fund assets in
its own businesses. Outside the UK and the US, the majority of
pension plans in the Group are of a defined contribution nature.
The Group’s UK defined benefit plan and main US defined
benefit plans are closed to new entrants and, during the first
quarter of 2007 , the Group’s two largest US defined benefit pension
plans ceased providing future benefit accrual, with members
instead being provided with a broadly equivalent benefit through a
defined contribution plan. Benefit accrual under the Group’s UK
defined benefit pension plan continues for those employees who
joined prior to the closure of the plan to new entrants. Defined
contribution plans exist for new employees in the UK and the US.
For the Group’s UK defined benefit and defined contribution
plans a Trustee board exists comprising employees, former
employees and an independent trustee. With effect from 1 January
2008, the board comprises six trustee directors, of whom two are
member nominated. The administration of each plan is outsourced.
The Company is mindful of its obligations under the Pensions
Act 2004 and of the need to comply with the guidance issued by
the Pensions Regulator. Regular dialogue is maintained between
the Company and the Trustee board of the UK plans to ensure
that both Company and Trustee are apprised of the same
financial and other information about the Group and the plans
which is pertinent to each being able to contribute to the
effective functioning of the plans. The Company currently has in
place a schedule of contributions, agreed with the Trustee board,
which aims to reduce to zero the deficit existing on the UK
defined benefit plan as at 31 December 2005 within five years
from that date. The adequacy of this schedule of contributions
will be monitored over time, so as to assess the need for it to be
modified in the light of changes in the deficit position.
All US retirement plan assets are held in trust for the exclusive
benefit of plan participants and their beneficiaries. An
independent financial institution acts as the trustee. The trust
assets are protected by law and by Federal Government Regulation
and are subject to annual audit by an independent accountant, the
Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Labor.
Further details of pension arrangements are given in note 37
on pages 89 to 95.
Donations
Donations in the UK for charitable purposes were £0.1m (2006:
£0.1m); and donations throughout the Group were £0.1m (2006:
£0.1m). In accordance with Company policy, no political donations
were made in either 2007 or 2006.
Creditor payment policy
Each operating company in the Group is responsible for agreeing
the terms and conditions under which business transactions with
their suppliers are conducted. It is Group policy that payments to
suppliers are made in accordance with these terms, provided that
the supplier is also complying with all relevant terms and
conditions. In the Company-only accounts of Cookson Group plc
as at 31 December 2007, the number of days’ purchases
outstanding was 9 (2006: 22 days).
Significant agreements
A change of control of the Company following a takeover bid
may cause a number of agreements to which the Company and
its subsidiaries are party, such as funding arrangements, to alter
or terminate. Non-compliance with the change of control clauses
in the Group’s funding arrangements, or failure to reach
agreement with the parties on revised terms, would require the
acquirer to put in place replacement facilities. In addition, the
Group’s share incentive plans would similarly be affected upon a
change of control.
Share capital
As at the date of this report, the Company has an issued share
capital of 212,582,043 ordinary shares of 10 pence each. The total
number of Cookson Group plc shares with voting rights is therefore

DIRECTORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)
Details of movements in the Company’s issued share capital
during the year are given in note 30 on pages 81 and 82.
On 11 October 2007, the Company made a non pre-emptive
placing of 18,583,519 new ordinary shares of 10 pence each. The
placing was carried out to part finance a recommended cash offer
by Cookson for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of
Foseco plc. The placing shares represented approximately 9.6 per
cent. of the Company’s issued share capital. They were credited as
fully paid and rank pari passu in all respects with the existing
issued ordinary shares in the Company, including the right to
receive all dividends and other distributions declared.
The Company operates a number of share-based share
incentive plans (further details about these are given in the
Directors’ Remuneration Report). For the majority of these plans
the Company can satisfy entitlements either by the acquisition of
existing shares or by the issue of new shares. Existing shares are
held in an employee share ownership trust (“ESOP”). The trustees
of the ESOP purchase shares in the open market as required, to
enable the Company to meet liabilities for the provision of
existing shares to satisfy awards that vest. The trustees do not
register votes in respect of these shares.
Since the year end, 19,194 ordinary shares have been issued
as a result of exercises of options granted under the Company’s
share option schemes. Resolutions giving the Directors the
authority to allot further shares and make allotments of shares to
persons other than existing shareholders in certain circumstances
will again be proposed at the AGM.
Additional information for shareholders
Set out below is a summary of certain provisions of the
Company’s current Articles and applicable English law concerning
companies (the Companies Act 1985 and the Companies Act
2006, together the “Companies Acts”). This is a summary only
and the relevant provisions of the Articles or the Companies Acts
should be consulted if further information is required. Certain
amendments will be proposed to the Articles at the Company’s
AGM to be held on 15 May 2008 to be effective immediately, with
further amendments to be effective 1 October 2008, as explained
in the Notice of the AGM. A copy of the Company’s current
Articles, together with a copy marked up to show the proposed
amendments, are available by application to the Group Secretary
at the Registered Office.
Authority for purchase of own shares
Subject to the provisions of company law and any other
applicable regulations, the Company may purchase its own
shares. However, it may not purchase or enter into a contract to
purchase any convertible shares, unless the terms of issue of
such convertible shares include provisions permitting the
Company to purchase its own equity shares or providing for
adjustment to the conversion terms upon such a purchase; or the
purchase, or the contract, has first been approved by an
extraordinary resolution passed at a separate meeting of the
holders of such convertible shares.
At the 2007 AGM, shareholders gave the Company renewed
authority to make market purchases of up to a maximum of 10%
at that time of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital. As at
the date of this report, the Company has made no such purchases
under this authority. The Directors believe it advisable to seek
renewal of this authority at each AGM.
The Company’s Articles specify that, subject to the
authorisation of an appropriate resolution passed by a general
meeting of the Company, Directors can allot relevant securities
under Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985, up to the aggregate
nominal amount specified by the Act. In addition, the Articles
state that the Directors can seek the authority of shareholders in
general meeting to allot equity securities for cash without first
being required to offer such shares to existing ordinary
shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings in
connection with a rights issue and in other circumstances up to
an aggregate nominal amount as specified in Section 89(1) of the
Companies Act 1985.
Transfer of Shares
All transfers of shares which are in certificated form may be
effected by transfer in writing in any usual or common form or in
any other form acceptable to the Directors and may be under
hand only. The instrument of transfer shall be signed by or on
behalf of the transferor and (except in the case of fully-paid
shares) by or on behalf of the transferee. The transferor shall
remain the holder of the shares concerned until the name of the
transferee is entered in the Register in respect thereof. All
instruments of transfer which are registered may be retained by
the Company. Provided that the Directors may dispense with the
execution of the instrument of transfer by the transferee in any
case in which they think fit in their discretion to do so. All
transfers of shares which are in uncertificated form may be
effected by means of the CREST system.
The Directors may decline to recognise any instrument of
transfer relating to shares in certificated form unless it is in
respect of only one class of share and is lodged (duly stamped if
required) at the Transfer Office accompanied by the relevant
share certificate(s) and such other evidence as the Directors may
reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the
transfer (and, if the instrument of transfer is executed by some
other person on his or her behalf, the authority of that person so
to do). 
The Directors may, in the case of shares in certificated form,
in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason,
refuse to register any transfer of shares (not being fully-paid
shares) provided that such discretion may not be exercised in
such a way as to prevent dealings in the shares of that class from
taking place on an open and proper basis. The Directors may also
refuse to register an allotment or transfer of shares (whether
fully-paid or not) in favour of more than four persons jointly. If the
Directors refuse to register an allotment or transfer of shares
they shall within two months after the date on which the letter of
allotment or instrument of transfer was lodged with the Company
send to the allottee or transferee notice of the refusal. 
A shareholder does not generally need to obtain the approval
of the Company or of other shareholders of shares in the Company,
for a transfer to take place.
The Articles contain certain restrictions that give the
Directors the ability to limit the number of US persons who hold
shares in the Company. The application of these restrictions
enabled the Company to suspend its obligations under the US
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Cookson Group plc 41 Annual Report 2007
Voting Rights
Subject to the Articles generally and to any special rights or
restrictions attached to any class of shares, at a shareholders’
meeting every shareholder who is present in person and every
duly appointed proxy shall have one vote on a show of hands, and
on a poll every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy
shall have one vote for every ordinary share of which he or she is
the holder. In the case of joint holders of a share the vote of the
senior holder who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy,
shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint
holders and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the
order in which the names stand in the share register . A shareholder
entitled to attend and vote at a shareholders’ meeting is entitled
to appoint a proxy or proxies to exercise all or any of his rights to
attend and speak and vote in his or her place. A shareholder may
appoint more than one proxy in relation to a general meeting
provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights
attached to a different share or shares by the shareholder.
Proxies need not be shareholders of the Company. For the
purposes of determining which persons are entitled to attend or
vote at a meeting and how many votes such a person may cast,
the Company may specify in the notice of meeting a time, not
more than 48 hours before the time fixed for the meeting, by
which a person must be entered on the share register in order to
have the right to attend or vote at the meeting.
Restrictions on shares
The Board may withhold payment of all or any part of dividends
or other monies payable in respect of the Company’s shares from
a person with a 0.25 percent interest or more in the Company if
such person has been served with a notice after failure to provide
the Company with information concerning interest in those
shares required to be provided under the Companies Acts.
Variation of rights
Subject to statute, the Articles specify that rights attached to any
class of shares may be varied with the written consent of the
holders of not less than three-fourths  in nominal value of the
issued shares of that class, or with the sanction of an
extraordinary resolution passed at a separate general meeting of
the holders of those shares. At every such separate general
meeting the quorum shall be two persons holding or representing
by proxy at least one-third in nominal value of the issued shares
of the class. The rights conferred upon the holders of any shares
shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights
attaching to those shares, be deemed to be varied by the creation
or issue of further shares ranking pari passu with them.
Restrictions on voting
No shareholder shall, unless the Directors otherwise determine,
be entitled in respect of any share held by him or her to vote
either personally or by proxy at a shareholders’ meeting or to
exercise any other right conferred by membership in relation to
shareholders’ meetings if any call or other sum presently payable
by him or her to the Company in respect of that share remains
unpaid. In addition, if any member , or any other person appearing
to be interested in shares held by such member, has been duly
served with a notice to provide the Company with information
under Section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 and has failed to
do so within 14 days, then (unless the Directors otherwise
determine) the member shall not (for so long as the default
continues) be entitled to attend or vote either personally or by
proxy at a shareholders’ meeting or to exercise any other right
conferred by membership in relation to shareholders’ meetings.
Appointment and replacement of Directors 
The Company shall have no less than five and no more than
fifteen Directors. The Company may, by ordinary resolution from
time to time, vary the minimum number and/or maximum number
of Directors. At each AGM all those Directors who were elected or
last re-elected at or before the AGM held in the third calendar
year before the current year shall retire from office by rotation.
A retiring Director shall be eligible for re-election. The Board may
appoint any person to be a Director (so long as the total number
of Directors does not exceed the limit prescribed in the Articles).
Any such Director shall only hold office until the next AGM and
shall then be eligible for election.
Amendment of Articles of Association
The Company may make amendments to the Articles of the
Company by way of special resolution in accordance with the
Companies Acts.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
The Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) is responsible for
recommending and monitoring the level and structure of
remuneration for senior management, being the first layer of
management below Board level, and setting the appropriate
remuneration for the Group Chairman, the executive Directors and
the Group Secretary. A copy of the Committee’s T erms of Reference
is available on the Company’s website, www.cooksongroup.co.uk.
The current members of the Committee are all the non-
executive Directors, namely Messrs Hewitt, Oosterveld, Perry and
Sussens, who also chairs the Committee. All the members of the
Committee are deemed to be independent. The Chairman, Chief
Executive and Group Finance Director are invited to attend
Committee meetings as appropriate.
In formulating its policies and deciding individual
remuneration levels, the Committee was advised during the year
by the Chief Executive, the Group Secretary and by the external
advisers Kepler Associates (“KA”) and New Bridge Street
Consultants LLP (“NBS”), and the law firms McDermott Will &
Emery UK LLP (“MWE”) and Clifford Chance LLP (“CC”). KA, NBS
and MWE were appointed directly by the Committee and CC was
appointed by the Company on its behalf. NBS, MWE and CC also
provide other limited advice to the Group, in their specialist areas
of share award valuation, employment law and share schemes
respectively.
Remuneration policy for executive Directors
The Committee has established employment and remuneration
practices for the Company’s executive Directors aimed at fostering a
high performance culture. In formulating remuneration policy, the
Committee has regard to the international scale and nature of the
Group’s operations and takes into consideration guidelines issued by
its leading shareholders and bodies such as the Institutional
Shareholders’ Committee, the Association of British Insurers (“ ABI”)
and the National Association of Pension Funds. The remuneration
packages of the executive Directors are benchmarked against their
peers and have been designed to ensure that a substantial
proportion of remuneration is linked to performance.
The Committee considers the efficacy of the Group’s
executive remuneration policy each year and commissions more
formal reviews as it considers appropriate. The last such
comprehensive review was undertaken in 2006, when KA were
asked to review the Group’s executive remuneration policy to
ensure that it continued to provide a strong alignment with the
delivery of value to shareholders and reflected market best
practice. The review demonstrated that the overall remuneration
package was competitive in terms of both structure and
quantum. However, the review concluded that certain changes
should be made to the Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”).
Further information on these changes, which were made in 2007 ,
is given below.
Annual salary and benefits in kind
Base salary is set by reference to market rates in the relevant
country for jobs of similar complexity and responsibility. The
Chairman’s fees and the salaries of the Chief Executive and Group
Finance Director are benchmarked against salaries within two
FTSE 250 comparator groups, the first focusing on sector
comparators and the second on companies of similar size. The
salaries of individual executive Directors are normally reviewed
on 1 January each year. With effect from 1 January 2008, Messrs
Butterworth and Salmon were awarded salary increases of 10%
and 5% respectively, following a review of market data.
Benefits in kind receivable by the executive Directors
principally comprise company car allowances, life assurance
benefits and medical and disability insurance. These benefits are
similar to those provided to other Company executives in the UK.
Variable remuneration
The remuneration programme is structured such that variable,
performance-related remuneration potentially represents more
than half of total remuneration.
Annual incentive
In line with the Group’s other senior executives, the executive
Directors are eligible to receive an annual incentive calculated as
a percentage of base salary and based on achievement against
specified financial targets. Each year the Committee establishes
the financial performance criteria for the forthcoming year . These
criteria are set by reference to the Group’s financial budget and
prior year actual financial results.
The Annual Incentive has a Threshold level of performance
below which no award is paid, a Target level at which executive
Directors are entitled to a payment equal to 50% of their base
salary and a Maximum performance level at which a maximum
award worth 100% of base salary is earned.
For the financial year 2007, the executive Directors’ Annual
Incentive was based on Group headline earnings performance,
the calculation of which is shown in note 17 to the consolidated
financial statements. For 2007, the Maximum level of
performance was exceeded and so maximum annual bonuses
were paid to the executive Directors for 2007. These are reported
in the Directors’ remuneration table on page 46.
The Remuneration Committee has determined that for 2008
the executive Directors’ Annual Incentive will again be based on
Group headline earnings.
LTIP and other share incentive plans
The LTIP was introduced in 2004 and is the only long-term
incentive plan under which awards are made to the executive
Directors. It rewards executives for delivering superior Total
Shareholder Return (“TSR”), defined as the increase in the value
of a share, including re-invested dividends, and (from 2007
onwards) headline earnings per share (“EPS”) growth, and as
such is intended to align executive remuneration with
shareholders’ interests.
The LTIP has two elements: firstly, executive Directors are
eligible to receive a conditional annual allocation of shares worth
up to 100% of base salary (“Performance Shares”); secondly,
executive Directors can elect to invest all or part of their Annual
Incentive in ordinary shares of the Company (“Bonus Investment
Shares”) in return for which they receive a conditional allocation
of shares worth up to 2.25 times the pre-tax equivalent of the
Annual Incentive so invested (“Matching Shares”). In addition, for
awards made after 7 March 2007 the Remuneration Committee
has the discretion to award participants the dividends that would
have been paid on the number of shares that vest in respect of
dividend record dates occurring during the period between the
award date and the date of vesting. Cookson Group plc 43 Annual Report 2007
Performance Shares and Matching Shares can vest after three years, with the proportion of shares vesting being based on the
Company’s performance against specified performance conditions. For awards made in 2005 and 2006, vesting is based upon the
Group’s three-year TSR performance (as explained in more detail below) relative to that of the companies of its comparator group, the
FTSE 250 excluding Investment Trusts.
Vesting of the Performance Shares and Matching Shares under the 2005 and 2006 LTIP awards will therefore be as follows:
TSR ranking relative to FTSE 250 Matching Shares Vesting Ratio
excluding Investment Trusts Performance Shares Vesting Percentage (Matching Shares: Bonus Investment Shares)
Below Median 0% 0
Median 25% 0.5:1
Upper Quintile (top 20%) 100% 2.25:1
Between Median and Upper Quintile Pro rata between 25% and 100% Pro rata between 0.5:1 and 2.25:1
In 2007, the Remuneration Committee broadened the performance condition by including headline EPS growth. For awards made in
2007 and for future awards, vesting of 50% of shares awarded will be based on the TSR performance measure described above and
50% on headline EPS (the calculation of which is shown in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements) growth over a three-year
period. The two measures will operate independently.
Vesting of Performance Shares and Matching Shares under the 2007 and 2008 LTIP awards will be based on TSR performance in
accordance with the following schedule:
TSR ranking relative to FTSE 250 Matching Shares Vesting Ratio
excluding Investment Trusts Performance Shares Vesting Percentage (Matching Shares: Bonus Investment Shares)
Below Median 0% 0
Median 12.5% 0.25:1
Upper Quintile (top 20%) 50% 1.125:1
Between Median and Upper Quintile Pro rata between 12.5% and 50% Pro rata between 0.25:1 and 1.125:1
Vesting of Performance Shares and Matching Shares under the 2007 and 2008 LTIP awards will be based on headline EPS growth,
as compared with the compound annual growth in the Retail Prices Index (“RPI”), in accordance with the following schedule:
Matching Shares Vesting Ratio
Annual Compound Headline EPS Growth above RPI Performance Shares Vesting Percentage (Matching Shares: Bonus Investment Shares)
Below 3% 0% 0
3% 12.5% 0.25:1
At or above 10% 50% 1.125:1
Between 3% and 10% Pro rata between 12.5% and 50% Pro rata between 0.25:1 and 1.125:1
Matching Share awards will only vest if the Bonus Investment Shares originally purchased have been retained.
The Committee obtains independent external advice to assess whether the Company has met the TSR performance condition at
the end of the relevant performance period and to confirm that the companies which make up the index and the measurement of the
Company’s performance are both in accordance with the rules of the LTIP. Measurement of the Group’s TSR takes place over a
performance period commencing on the first day of Cookson’s financial year in which the award is granted. Thus, for grants made in
2007, the performance period commenced on 1 January 2007 and will end three years later, i.e. 31 December 2009. TSR is measured
as the percentage increase in a return index (net of tax) between the beginning and end of the performance period. The return index
at the beginning of the performance period is the average of the return index on each weekday in the three-month period prior to the
start of the performance period. The same three-month averaging method is used to ascertain the return index at the end of the
performance period. The companies will then be ranked, in descending order, according to their TSR. If Cookson is ranked at or above
median against the comparator group then some proportion of the awards is eligible to vest.
The Group’s headline EPS will be calculated on a consistent basis and the Committee will have discretion to adjust for exceptional
items as it deems appropriate. Growth in headline EPS will be annualised percentage growth over the performance period (comparing
headline EPS for the base year, the calendar year prior to the award date, with the final year, the calendar year three years after the
base year), expressed as compound annual growth, above the compound annual growth in RPI.
Prior to the vesting of any award, the Committee has also stipulated that, as an additional hurdle, it needs to be satisfied that
vesting has been justified by the underlying financial performance of the Group over the performance period.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT (CONTINUED)
LTIP and other share incentive plans (continued)
Allocations were made under the LTIP to the executive Directors in April 2007, as shown on page 47. Messrs Butterworth and
Salmon purchased Bonus Investment Shares under the Matching Share element of the LTIP in 2007.
In addition to the executive Directors, senior divisional and corporate executives are allocated Performance Shares under the LTIP
and members of the Group’s Executive Committee are also given the opportunity to participate in the Matching Shares element.
In prior years, the Group operated a number of other executive and all-employee share plans under which certain awards and
options are outstanding, although neither of the current executive Directors holds options or awards under the relevant plans. Under
the executive share option schemes the Company granted share options, with an option exercise price fixed by reference to the market
price prevailing at the time of grant, the exercise of which were subject to an EPS performance condition. The last executive share
option grant was made in 2003 and the Company does not intend to make any further grants under the schemes.
Under the Mid-Term Incentive Plan (“MTI Plan”) executives were eligible to receive a bonus (paid partly in cash and partly in
deferred shares) based upon the achievement of target financial performance, measured over a three-year period. The MTI Plan
operated on a rolling three-year basis and the final remaining cycle culminated at the end of 2005. The final tranche of shares under
this plan vested in January 2008.
Both the executive share option schemes and the MTI Plan were replaced by the Company’s LTIP. In addition the Company operated
UK and International Sharesave Plans. These plans were closed to new participants in 2004. Further details of the awards and options
outstanding under these share plans are given in note 38 to the consolidated financial statements.
In 2007 , the Company implemented a new Deferred Bonus Plan in place of the LTIP for certain corporate managers. Under this plan,
executives received an allocation of deferred shares to the value of a percentage of their annual bonus. These shares, which will be
sourced from existing shares, will vest after three years, although an executive’s allocation may lapse if he ceases employment in
certain circumstances before the end of the three-year period. The executive Directors do not participate in this plan. In 2007, 13,869
shares were allocated under the Deferred Bonus Plan.
Under the rules of the LTIP and executive share option schemes, the Company has the discretion to satisfy the majority of awards
either by the transfer of existing shares or by the allotment of newly-issued shares. The decision on how to satisfy awards is taken by
the Board, which considers the most prudent and appropriate sourcing arrangement for the Company.
Option exercises under the UK and International Sharesave plans are satisfied by the allotment of newly-issued shares. Any awards
that vest under the Deferred Bonus Plan will be met from the transfer of existing shares.
As at 31 December 2007, 637,949 shares were held in the Company’s employee share ownership trust (“ESOP”). The Trustees of
the ESOP purchase shares in the open market as required, to meet liabilities for the provision of existing shares to satisfy awards
that vest.
The rules of each of Cookson’s share-based incentive schemes, including the LTIP, and the pre-existing share option and Sharesave
Plans, contain limitations on the total number of options over new shares that can be awarded in accordance with the ABI guidelines.
In the last 10 years less than 2% of the Company’s issued share capital has been allotted to settle obligations arising from the exercise
of executive share incentives.
Details of the awards outstanding under the Company’s share plans as at 31 December 2007 and the associated exercise prices are
given in note 38.2 to the consolidated financial statements.

Shareholding guidelines
The Remuneration Committee encourages executive Directors to build and hold a shareholding in the Company equivalent in value to
at least one times salary. To this end, executive Directors will normally only be able to sell a maximum of up to 50% (measured as the
value after tax) of any Performance Shares or Matching Shares vesting under the LTIP, until this criterion has been met.
Directors’ service contracts
Both of the executive Directors have contractual notice periods from the Company of 12 months. Neither of the executive Directors’
contracts contains any change of control provisions and they both contain a duty to mitigate should the Director find an alternative
paid occupation in any period during which the Company must otherwise pay compensation on early termination. A summary of the
main conditions of the contracts of the Directors is as follows:
Executive Directors
Both of the current executive Directors have UK service contracts which have 12 months unexpired terms and provide for 12 months’
notice being given. Mr Salmon’s contract was dated 14 June 2004 and Mr Butterworth’s 25 May 2005. Each contract provides for
compensation to be paid on early termination by the Company based on one times salary, pension allowance and benefits payable half
in a lump sum and the balance in six separate monthly instalments commencing six months after leaving, mitigated by any salary
earned from any new paid occupation.
Non-executive Directors
In accordance with the Code, each non-executive Director is appointed for an initial fixed term of three years subject to their election
at the Company’s first AGM following their appointment. Thereafter, subject to approval of the Board and their re-election at the
appropriate AGM, they are appointed for a further three-year term.

J L Hewitt 01/06/05 – 2009 Not required
J P Oosterveld 15/06/04 – 2010 Not required
B W Perry 01/01/02 – 2011 Not required
J G Sussens 01/05/04 – 2010 Not required
The Group Chairman, Mr Beeston, was appointed on 1 April 2003 for a fixed period which was due to expire at the conclusion of the
AGM in 2008. During the year his contract was extended and it is now due to expire at the conclusion of the AGM in 2011. He is entitled
to 12 months’ notice from the Company. Any compensation for loss of office would be based upon his annual fee. The remaining non-
executive Directors are not entitled to receive compensation for loss of office at any time.
All Directors are subject to retirement, and election or re-election, in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association.
The Board sets the remuneration of the non-executive Directors after considering the role and responsibilities of each Director and
the practice of other companies. The non-executive Directors do not participate in Board discussions on their own remuneration. The
Chairman’s remuneration is set by the Remuneration Committee.
External appointments
Executive Directors are permitted to hold positions as non-executive directors of other companies provided that these do not lead to
conflicts of interest. The Board sanctions each such request on a case-by-case basis. Fees received are retained by the executive
Director concerned. In 2007, Mr Salmon received fees of £52,000 for his role as non-executive director of United Utilities plc.
No Directors had any material interest in a contract of significance (other than service agreements) with the Company or any
subsidiary company during the year.
Pension arrangements
Messrs Butterworth and Salmon are not entitled to participate in any of the Group’s pension arrangements. In accordance with their
contracts they received pension allowances of 25% of their respective base salaries in 2007 to enable them to make their own pension
provision. Following a review of market practice, the Remuneration Committee increased Mr Salmon’s pension allowance to 30% of
base salary with effect from 1 January 2008. Mr Butterworth’s pension allowance in 2007 amounted to £71,250 (2006: £64,375), whilst
Mr Salmon’s pension allowance in 2007 amounted to £123,000 (2006: £119,375). This information is audited by the Company’s Auditor.

Notes
1. The allocations were calculated based upon the closing mid-market price of Cookson shares on the day before the awards were
made. The 2007 allocations were made to Messrs Butterworth and Salmon on 3 April 2007. Cookson’s mid-market closing price on
this date was 635.50p.
2. The July 2004 and April 2005 market prices shown for shares on the day before the awards have been multiplied by 10 to reflect
the impact of the share consolidation on 26 May 2005 on the Company’s share price. On this date every 10 ordinary 1p shares held
by shareholders were exchanged for 1 new 10p ordinary share.
3. The performance criteria which apply to the vesting of share allocations under the LTIP are summarised on page 43.
4. The performance period for the LTIP awards made in 2004 ended on 31 December 2006. The Company’s TSR performance during
the 3-year performance period was assessed against the comparator group and it was determined that the Company’s performance
was below median. Accordingly the 2004 LTIP awards did not vest on 29 July 2007 and the awards lapsed.
5. The performance period for the LTIP awards made in 2005 ended on 31 December 2007. The Company’s TSR performance during
the 3-year performance period was assessed against the comparator group and it was determined that the Company’s performance
was above the upper quintile. The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the vesting of these awards is justified by the
underlying financial performance of the Group over the performance period. Accordingly the 2005 LTIP awards will vest fully on
the third anniversaries of their award dates.
6. The mid-market closing price of the Company’s shares ranged between 577.5p and 874.5p during 2007. On 31 December 2007 the
mid-market closing price of the Company’s shares was 697p.
7. The information in the above table is audited by the Company’s Auditor.

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT
To the shareholders of Cookson Group plc
The Directors of Cookson Group plc are responsible for preparing
the Annual Report and the financial statements of the parent
company only (“the Company”) and of the Company and its
subsidiaries (“the Group”), in accordance with applicable law and
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that
law the Directors are required to prepare the Group financial
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the EU (“IFRS”) and have elected to
prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with UK
Accounting Standards and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice).
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRSs
to present fairly the financial position and performance of the
Group; the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such
financial statements that references in the relevant part of that
Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are
references to their achieving a fair presentation.
The Company financial statements are required by law to give
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company.
In preparing each of the Group and Company financial
statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs;
• for the Company financial statements, state whether
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed,
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in
the Company financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that
its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group
and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also
responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’
Remuneration Report and report on Corporate Governance that
comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and
integrity of the corporate and financial information included on
the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ
from legislation in other jurisdictions.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS
OF COOKSON GROUP PLC
We have audited the Group and parent company financial
statements (the ‘’financial statements’’) of Cookson Group plc for
the year ended 31 December 2007 which comprise the Group
Income Statement, the Group and parent company Balance
Sheets, the Group Statement of Cash Flows, the Group Statement
of Recognised Income and Expense and the related notes. These
financial statements have been prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in
the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having
been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a
body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report,
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report
and the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable
law and International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted
by the EU (“IFRSs”), and for preparing the parent company
financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report in
accordance with applicable law and UK Accounting Standards
(“UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice”) are set out in
the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 42. Our
responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to
be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group financial
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you
whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’
Report is consistent with the financial statements. The
information given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific
information presented in the Operating and Financial Reviews
that is cross referred from the Business Review section of the
Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or
if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Report reflects
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of
the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We
are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on
internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on
the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance
procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. We consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities
do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of
evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to
be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant
estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the
preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRSs, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at
31 December 2007 and of its profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of
the IAS Regulation;
• the parent company financial statements give a true and fair
view, in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice, of the state of the parent company’s affairs as at
31 December 2007;
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act
1985; and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent
with the financial statements.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Cookson Group plc is a public limited company registered in England and Wales and listed on the London Stock Exchange. Its
registered address is shown on page 118. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the
Operating Review on pages 10 to 22.
The financial statements, which were authorised by the Directors for issue on 11 March 2008, are presented in millions of
pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies
set out in note 3.5.
2. ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as
adopted by the EU (“IFRS”). The financial statements of the Company-only have been prepared in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“UK GAAP”), as disclosed in note 1 to the Company financial statements.
The following standards, amendments to published standards and interpretations are effective for accounting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2007, but do not have a material impact upon the results or net assets of the Group:
2.1 NEW STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS
The following new and amended standards and interpretations are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after
1 January 2007, but do not have a material impact upon the results or net assets of the Group.
• International Accounting Standard 1 (“IAS 1”) (Amendment), Presentation of Financial Statements, Capital Disclosures;
• IFRS 7, Financial Instruments;
• IFRIC 8, Scope of IFRS 2;
• IFRIC 9, Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives; and
• IFRIC 10, Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment.
2.2 STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS THAT ARE NOT YET EFFECTIVE
IFRS 8, Operating Segments, which is effective for years commencing on or after 1 January 2009, has been published, endorsed
by the EU, and is available for early adoption, but has not been applied in these financial statements. The Directors do not
anticipate that the adoption of IFRS 8 will have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements in the period of initial
application.
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
3.1 BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
With the exception of certain items noted below, which are carried at fair value, the consolidated financial statements have been
prepared under the historical cost convention.
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007 have been prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and IFRS, having been prepared in accordance with IFRS for the first time in 2005.
3.2 DISCLOSURE OF EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
IAS 1 provides no definitive guidance as to the format of the income statement, but states key lines which should be disclosed. It
also encourages additional line items and the re-ordering of items presented on the face of the income statement when
appropriate for a proper understanding of the entity’s financial performance. In keeping with the spirit of this aspect of IAS 1, the
Company has adopted a policy of disclosing separately on the face of its Group income statement the effect of any components
of financial performance considered by the Directors to be exceptional, or for which separate disclosure would assist both in a
better understanding of the financial performance achieved and in making projections of future results. Both materiality and the
nature and function of the components of income and expense are considered in deciding upon such presentation. Such items
may include, inter alia, the financial effect of any profits or losses arising on business disposals, major rationalisation or
restructuring activity, curtailment gains or losses relating to employee benefits, profits or losses relating to non-current assets
and other items, including the taxation impact of the aforementioned items, which have a significant impact on the Group’s
results of operations either due to their size or nature. Cookson Group plc 55 Annual Report 2007
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
3.3 BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the
Company (its subsidiaries). Control exists when the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an
entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included
in the Group income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line
with those detailed herein to ensure that the Group financial statements are prepared on a consistent basis. All intra-Group
transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Minority interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s interest therein.
Minority interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the minority’s
share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Losses applicable to the minority in excess of the minority’s interest
in the subsidiary’s equity are allocated against the interests of the Group except to the extent that the minority has a binding
obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
3.4 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the
aggregate of the fair values, at the date of acquisition, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments
issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. The
acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3, Business
Combinations, are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that
are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5, Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which
are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the
business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the recognised identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities. If the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities
exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement. The Group took
advantage of the exemption under IFRS 1, First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, not to restate all
business combinations prior to 1 January 2004 in line with the requirements of IFRS 3.
3.5 FOREIGN CURRENCIES
The individual financial statements of each Group entity are prepared in their functional currency, which is the currency of the
primary economic environment in which that entity operates. For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the
results and financial position of each entity are translated into pounds sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group.
(a) Reporting foreign currency transactions in functional currency
Transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are initially recorded at the rates
of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each subsequent balance sheet date:
(i) Foreign currency monetary items are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences
arising on the settlement or retranslation of monetary items are recognised in the income statement;
(ii) Non-monetary items measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated; and
(iii) Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the income
statement except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses
are recognised directly in equity, in which case any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly
in equity.
(b) Translation from functional currency to presentation currency
When the functional currency of a Group entity is different from the Group’s presentational currency (pounds sterling), its
results and financial position are translated into the presentational currency as follows:
(i) Assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date;
(ii) Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the year , except where the use of such an average
rate does not approximate the exchange rate at the date of the transaction, in which case the transaction rate is used;
and
(iii) All resulting exchange differences are recognised in translation reserves as a separate component of equity and are
recognised in the income statement in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of.

3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
3.5 FOREIGN CURRENCIES (continued)
(c) Net investment in foreign operations
Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a reporting entity’s net investment in a foreign operation
are recognised in the income statement in the separate financial statements of the reporting entity or the foreign operation
as appropriate. In the consolidated Group financial statements such exchange differences are initially recognised in
translation reserves as a separate component of equity and subsequently recognised in the income statement on disposal of
the net investment.
3.6 REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied and services rendered to
customers, after deducting sales allowances and value-added taxes. Revenue is recognised when the risk of loss transfers to the
customer, depending on individual customer terms at the time of despatch, delivery or upon formal customer acceptance.
Provision is made for returns where appropriate.
3.7 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
The Group operates a number of pension plans, both of the defined contribution and defined benefit type.
(a) Defined contribution pension plans
Contributions to the Group’s defined contribution plans are recognised as employee benefits expense when they fall due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that they result in either a cash refund or a reduction in future
payments. Outstanding contributions are recognised as a liability within accruals.
(b) Defined benefit pension plans
The liability recognised in the balance sheet for the Group’s defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined
benefit obligation at the balance sheet date as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, less the fair value of the plan
assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method and by
discounting the estimated future cash flows using interest rates on high quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity
approximating the terms of the related pension liability. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the sum of
unrecognised past service costs plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Pension expense for the Group’s defined benefit plans is recognised as follows:
(i) Within trading profit:
• Current service cost – representing the increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from
employee service in the current year; and
• Past service cost – representing the increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from
employee service in prior periods that arises from changes made to the benefits under the plans in the current year. To
the extent that the changes to benefits vest immediately, past service costs are recognised immediately, otherwise they
are recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
(ii) Within finance costs:
• Interest cost on the liabilities of the plans – calculated by reference to the plan liabilities and discount rate at the
beginning of the year and allowing for changes during the year.
(iii) Within finance income:
• Expected return on the assets of the plans – calculated by reference to the plan assets and long-term expected rate of
return at the beginning of the year and allowing for changes during the year.
(iv) Within the statement of recognised income and expense:
• Actuarial gains and losses arising on the assets and liabilities of the plans.
(v) Gains and losses arising on settlements and curtailments are recognised in the income statement in the same line as the
item that gave rise to the settlement or curtailment is recognised or, if material, separately reported as a component of
profit from operations. Cookson Group plc 57 Annual Report 2007
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
3.7 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (continued)
(c) Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of different share-based payment arrangements for its employees of both the equity-settled
and cash-settled type.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the
grant date takes account of the effect of market-based conditions, such as the Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) upon which
vesting for some of the awards is conditioned, and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a
corresponding increase in equity. The cumulative expense recognised is adjusted for the best estimate of the shares that will
eventually vest and for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. For grants with market-based conditions attaching
to them, fair value is measured using a form of stochastic option pricing model. For consistency, this method has also been
used to value executive share options and stock appreciation rights granted to executives whose options are not subject to
the additional market-based performance conditions. For all other grants, fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes
model.
For cash-settled share-based payments, the fair value of the amount payable to the employee is recognised as an expense
with a corresponding increase in liabilities. The fair value of the amount payable is initially measured at grant date using a
form of stochastic option pricing model and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally
entitled to payment. The liability is remeasured at each balance sheet date and at settlement date. Any changes in the fair
value of the liability are recognised in the income statement.
3.8 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the
Group has sufficient resources to complete development. All other development expenditure is recognised in the income
statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
3.9 BORROWING COSTS
Borrowing costs, comprising interest on bank loans and overdrafts, finance lease obligations, the unwinding of the discount on
provisions and the costs incurred in connection with the arrangement of borrowings, are recognised in the income statement
using the effective interest rate method.
3.10 TAXATION
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the
income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws
that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements
and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability
method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences
can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable
profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests
in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is
realised, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax
is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which
case the associated deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle
its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
3.11 PROPERTY , PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Freehold land is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Other items of property, plant and equipment are carried at
cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Subsequent costs are capitalised only when it is
probable that they will result in future economic benefits flowing to the Group and when they can be measured reliably. All other
repairs and maintenance expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated as it has an infinite life. Depreciation on other items of property, plant and equipment begins
when the asset is available for use and is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost less
residual value of the asset over its estimated useful life as follows:
Asset category Estimated useful life
Freehold property between 10 and 50 years
Leasehold property the term of the lease
Plant and machinery – motor vehicles between 1 and 5 years
– information technology equipment between 1 and 5 years
– other between 5 and 15 years
The depreciation method used, residual values and estimated useful lives are reviewed and changed, if appropriate, at least at
each financial year-end. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as
owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to
its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, as described in note 3.14.
Gains and losses arising on disposals are determined by comparing sales proceeds with carrying amount and are recognised in
the income statement.
3.12 GOODWILL
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary or associate represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s
interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary or associate recognised
at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment
losses. Impairment testing is carried out annually, as described in note 3.14. On disposal of a subsidiary or an associate, the
attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
3.13 INTANGIBLE ASSETS OTHER THAN GOODWILL
Other intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separable, or if they arise from contractual or other
legal rights, and their fair value can be measured reliably. They are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
3.14 IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its
recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the higher of (i) its fair value less costs to sell and (ii) its value
in use, which is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset or cash-generating unit,
discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks
specific to the asset or cash-generating unit.
Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the income statement.
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit
from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units for this purpose are the business segments disclosed in note
6, which represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored. Cash-generating units to which goodwill
has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the cash-
generating unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the resulting
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other
assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. Cookson Group plc 59 Annual Report 2007
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
3.14 IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS (continued)
(b) Other tangible and intangible assets
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss. Where it is not possible to
estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating
unit to which the asset belongs.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased
to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in
prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss for tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill is recognised immediately
in the income statement.
3.15 INTERESTS IN JOINT VENTURES
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and one or more other parties undertake an economic activity
that is subject to joint control. Joint control exists when the strategic financial and operating policy decisions relating to the
activity require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The Group conducts its joint venture arrangements through jointly controlled entities and accounts for them using the equity
method of accounting, except when the investment is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for under IFRS 5.
Where the Group transacts with its jointly controlled entities, unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the
Group’s interest in the joint venture.
3.16 INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (using the first-in, first-out method) and net realisable value.
Cost comprises expenditure incurred in purchasing or manufacturing inventories together with all other costs directly
incurred in bringing the inventory to its present location and condition and, where appropriate, attributable production
overheads based on normal activity levels. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of
completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. The amount of any write-down of inventories to net
realisable value is recognised as an expense in the year in which the write-down occurs.
In addition to the inventory recorded in the balance sheet, the Group holds precious metals under consignment
arrangements, further details of which are given in note 27.
3.17 NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Non-current assets (or a collection of assets and liabilities in a disposal group) are separately classified as held for sale in the balance
sheet when their carrying value will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
Immediately prior to being classified as held for sale the measurement of the assets (and all assets and liabilities in a disposal
group) is brought up to date in accordance with applicable IFRS. Then, on initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets
and disposal groups are recognised at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses on initial
classification as held for sale are included in profit or loss, as are gains and losses on subsequent remeasurement.
Discontinued operations are those operations that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Group, both operationally
and for financial reporting purposes, that have either been disposed of or classified as held for sale and which represent a
separate major line of business or geographical area of operations.
3.18 LEASES
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
(a) Finance leases
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if
lower , at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance
sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease
obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged
to the income statement.
(b) Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the
relevant lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-
line basis over the lease term.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
3.19 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Group balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual
provisions of the instrument.
(a) Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
(b) Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to
manage the effects of its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates on its borrowings. In accordance
with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. The method of recognising the gain or loss on remeasurement
to fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being
hedged (note 4.2).
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date. The fair value
of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance
sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
(c) Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments include investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and
cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, demand deposits and short-term highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant
risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash
management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows. Loans
and borrowings comprise secured and unsecured loans and obligations under finance leases (note 3.18).
Non-derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs.
The Group’s investments in equity and debt securities are classified as available-for-sale financial assets. Subsequent to
initial recognition they are measured at fair value and changes therein are recognised directly in equity. When an investment
is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to profit or loss.
All other non-derivative financial instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less
any impairment losses.
3.20 PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group
will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to
settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects both the current market assessment of the time value of money and the specific risks
associated with the obligation. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised
as an interest expense.
3.21 USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The Company uses a number of non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“non-GAAP”) financial measures in addition to
those reported in accordance with IFRS. Because IFRS measures reflect all items which affect reported performance, the
Directors believe that certain non-GAAP measures, which reflect what they view as the underlying performance of the Group, are
important and should be considered alongside the IFRS measures. The following non-GAAP measures are referred to in this
annual report.
(a) Net sales value
Net sales value is calculated as the total of revenue less the amount included therein related to any precious metal
component. The Directors believe that net sales value provides an important measure of the underlying sales performance
of the Group’s Precious Metals division.
(b) Return on sales and return on net sales value
Return on sales is calculated as trading profit divided by revenue. Return on net sales value is calculated as trading profit
divided by net sales value. The Directors believe that return on sales provides an important measure of the underlying trading
performance of the Group and the Group’s Ceramics and Electronics divisions and that return on net sales value provides an
important measure of the underlying trading performance of the Group’s Precious Metals division. Cookson Group plc 61 Annual Report 2007
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
3.21 USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (continued)
(c) Underlying revenue growth
Underlying revenue growth measures the organic growth in revenue from one year to the next after eliminating the effects
of changes in exchange rates and metals prices and the effects of business acquisitions, disposals and closures. The Directors
believe that underlying revenue growth gives an important measure of the organic revenue generation capacity of the Group.
(d) Trading profit
Trading profit, defined as profit from operations before the costs of rationalisation of operations, profits or losses relating to
non-current assets and curtailment gains or losses relating to employee benefits, is separately disclosed on the face of the
Group income statement. The Directors believe that trading profit is an important measure of the underlying trading
performance of the Group.
(e) Headline profit before tax
Headline profit before tax is calculated as the net total of trading profit, plus the Group’s share of post-tax profit of joint
ventures and total net finance costs associated with ordinary activities. The Directors believe that headline profit before tax
provides an important measure of the underlying financial performance of the Group.
(f) Headline earnings per share
Headline earnings per share is calculated as the net total of trading profit, plus the Group’s share of post-tax profit of joint
ventures and total net finance costs and income tax costs associated with ordinary activities, less profit attributable to
minority interests, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. The Directors believe
that headline earnings per share provides an important measure of the underlying earnings capacity of the Group.
(g) Free cash flow
Free cash flow, defined as net cash flow from operating activities after net outlays for the acquisition and disposal of non-
current assets, dividends from joint ventures and dividends paid to minority shareholders, but before additional funding
contributions to Group pension plans, is disclosed on the face of the Group statement of cash flows. The Directors believe
that free cash flow gives an important measure of the underlying cash generation capacity of the Group.
(h) Average working capital to sales ratio
The average working capital to sales ratio is calculated as the percentage of average working capital balances (being
inventories, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables) for a year to the reported revenue for that year. The
Directors believe that the average working capital to sales ratio provides an important measure of the underlying
effectiveness with which working capital balances are managed throughout the Group.
(i) EBITDA
EBITDA is calculated as the total of trading profit before depreciation charges. The Directors believe that EBITDA provides an
important measure of the underlying financial performance of the Group.
(j) Net interest
Net interest is calculated as interest payable on borrowings less interest receivable, excluding any item therein considered by
the Directors to be exceptional.
(k) Interest cover
Interest cover is the ratio of EBITDA to net interest. The Directors believe that interest cover provides an important measure
of the underlying financial position of the Group.
(l) Net debt
Net debt comprises the net total of current and non-current interest-bearing loans and borrowings and cash and short-term
deposits. The Directors believe that net debt is an important measure as it shows the Group’s aggregate net indebtedness to
banks and other external financial institutions.
(m) Net debt to EBITDA
Net debt to EBITDA is the ratio of net debt at the year-end to EBITDA for that year. The Directors believe that net debt to
EBITDA provides an important measure of the underlying financial position of the Group.

(n) Return on net assets
Return on net assets is calculated as trading profit plus the Group’s share of post-tax profit of joint-ventures divided by
average operating net assets (being property, plant and equipment, trade working capital and other operating receivables and
payables). The Directors believe that return on net assets provides an important measure of the underlying financial
performance of the Group’s divisions.
(o) Return on investment
Return on investment is calculated as trading profit plus the Group’s share of post-tax profit of joint-ventures divided by
invested capital (being shareholders’ funds plus net debt, employee benefits deficit and goodwill previously written-off to, or
amortised against, reserves). The Directors believe that return on investment provides an important measure of the
underlying financial performance of the Group.
4. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
4.1 FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS
(a) Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from transactions and borrowings that are
denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling. It uses various financial instruments to manage these exposures, as
explained below.
(i) Recognised assets and liabilities
Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge against the Group’s exposure to changes in fair value of a
recognised asset or liability that is attributable to a particular risk and which could affect profit or loss. Such forward
exchange contracts are accounted for as fair value hedges in accordance with the policy in note 4.2 (a).
(ii) Forecast transactions
Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge against the Group’s exposure to variability in cash flows that might
arise from the fluctuation of exchange rates in relation to highly probable forecast transactions that are denominated in
currencies other than its own functional currencies and which might affect profit or loss. Such forward exchange
contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the policy in note 4.2 (b).
(iii) Net investment hedges
Forward foreign exchange contracts and debt denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling are both used to
hedge against the Group’s exposure to changes in the value of its investment in the net assets of its foreign operations
that arise from fluctuations in exchange rates. Such financial instruments are accounted for as net investment hedges in
accordance with the policy in note 4.2 (c).
(b) Credit risk
At the balance sheet date, the Group had no significant concentrations of credit risk.
(c) Liquidity risk
The Group Treasury function ensures that there are sufficient levels of committed facilities, cash and cash equivalents to
ensure that the Group is at all times able to meet its financial commitments.
(d) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises primarily from its borrowings. An analysis of the currency and interest rate profiles of
the Group’s borrowings is shown in note 36.
Borrowings at floating rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk and borrowings at fixed rates expose the
Group to fair value interest rate risk. The Group’s policy is to borrow a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. Where appropriate,
the Group manages its interest rate exposures using interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments.
From time to time the Company manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using interest rate swaps, which have the
economic effect of changing the interest rate profile of the Group’s borrowings. Under the interest rate swaps the Company
agrees with the counterparty to exchange at specified intervals the difference between the fixed and floating rate interest
amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional principal amounts.
4.2 HEDGING ACTIVITIES
The Group designates certain financial instruments as either: (a) hedges of the exposure to changes in the fair value of
recognised assets or liabilities that are attributable to a particular risk and could affect profit or loss (fair value hedges); (b)
hedges of the exposure to variability in cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk associated with a highly probable
forecast transaction and could affect profit or loss (cash flow hedges); or (c) hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
At the inception of the transaction the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the financial instruments
that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Cookson Group plc 63 Annual Report 2007
4. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)
4.2 HEDGING ACTIVITIES (continued)
(a) Fair value hedges
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised within trading
profit in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities that are subject
to the hedged risk.
(b) Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a highly probable forecast
transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity within
hedging reserves. The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately within trading profit in the income
statement. When the forecast transaction that was being hedged is realised and affects profit or loss, the cumulative gain or
loss on the derivative financial instrument is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement in the same
period. When the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability,
the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the
non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge
relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains
in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction takes place. If the hedged transaction
is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised immediately within trading
profit in the income statement.
(c) Net investment hedges
The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to
be an effective hedge, is recognised directly in equity within translation reserves and subsequently recognised in the income
statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal of the net investment. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is
recognised immediately within trading profit in the income statement.
4.3 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Company considers its capital to be equal to the sum of its total equity as reported in the Group balance sheet and its net
debt. The Company’s primary objectives when managing its capital are:
• to ensure that the Company and each of its subsidiaries and associated companies are able to operate as going concerns;
• to have available both the necessary financial resources and the appropriate mix of equity and debt to allow the Company to
make investment decisions that will deliver acceptable future returns to shareholders; and
• to maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.
The Company manages its capital using a number of key performance indicators, including return on net assets and return on
investment (see page 11).
There were no changes in the Company’s approach to capital management in the year. Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries
are subject to, and throughout 2007 operated in compliance with, local externally imposed capital requirements.
5. CRITICAL JUDGEMENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
5.1 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
The Group’s financial statements present the results of discontinued operations separately from continuing operations.
Discontinued operations include those businesses that have been sold, or are classified as held for sale, and which represented
a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations. The Directors exercise their judgement to determine which
of the Group’s businesses should have their results presented within discontinued operations.
5.2 DEFERRED TAXATION
The Group has recognised deferred tax assets in respect of unutilised losses and other timing differences arising in certain of the
Group’s businesses, primarily in Europe and Asia. Account has been taken of future forecasts of taxable profit in arriving at the
values at which these assets are recognised. If these forecast profits do not materialise or change, or there are changes in tax
rates or to the period over which the losses or timing difference might be recognised, then the value of the deferred tax asset
will need to be revised in a future period.
The Group has losses and other timing differences for which no value has been recognised for deferred tax purposes in these
financial statements. These can arise in loss-making subsidiaries where the future economic benefit of these timing differences
is not probable. It can also arise where the timing differences are of such a nature that their value is dependent on only certain
types of profit being earned, such as capital profits. If trading or other appropriate profits are earned in future in these
companies, the timing differences may yield benefit to the Group in the form of a reduced tax charge.

5. CRITICAL JUDGEMENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
(continued)
5.3 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
The Group’s financial statements include the costs and obligations associated with the provision of pension and other post-
retirement benefits to current and former employees. It is the Directors’ responsibility to set the assumptions used in determining
the key elements of the costs of meeting such future obligations. These assumptions are set after consultation with the Group’s
actuaries and include those used to determine regular service costs and the financing elements related to the plans’ assets and
liabilities. Whilst the Directors believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, a change in the assumptions used would affect
the Group’s profit and financial position.
5.4 PROPERTY , PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
It is Group policy to depreciate its property, plant and equipment assets, except freehold land, on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives. This applies an appropriate matching of the revenue earned with the capital costs of production and
delivery of goods and services. A key element of this policy is the estimate of the useful life applied to each category of property,
plant and equipment which, in turn, determines the annual depreciation charge. Variations in asset lives could significantly
impact Group profit through an increase or decrease in the depreciation charge.
5.5 GOODWILL
The Directors use their judgement to determine the extent to which goodwill has a value that will benefit the performance of the
Group over future periods. To assist in making this judgement, the Directors undertake an assessment, at least annually, of the
carrying value of the Group’s capitalised goodwill, using discounted cash flow forecasts to derive the “value in use” to the Group
of the capitalised goodwill. In the assessment undertaken in 2007, value in use was derived from discounted 5-year cash flow
projections, using a growth rate of 3% in the years beyond the projection period, and pre-tax discount rates ranging from 11-14%.
The projection period is, in the opinion of the Directors, an appropriate period over which to view the future results of the Group’s
businesses for this purpose. Changes to the assumptions and discount rates used in making these forecasts could significantly
alter the Directors’ assessment of the carrying value of goodwill.
5.6 CURRENT ASSET RESERVES
In the course of normal trading activities, judgement is used to establish the net realisable value of various elements of working
capital, principally inventory and trade receivables. Reserves are established for obsolete or slow-moving inventories, bad or
doubtful debts and product warranties.
Reserve requirements are based on the facts available at the time and are also determined by using profiles, based on past
practice, applied to certain aged inventory and receivables categories. In estimating the collectability of trade receivables,
judgement is required in assessing their likely realisation, including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related
ageing of the past due balances. Specific accounts are assessed in situations where a customer may not be able to meet its
financial obligations due to deterioration in its financial condition, credit ratings or bankruptcy.
5.7 ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES
In certain parts of the business, mainly in the US, the Group has obligations to carry out environmental clean-ups at former and
current production sites. Many of these obligations will not arise for a number of years and the costs are difficult to predict
accurately. The Directors use their judgement and experience to make reserves in the financial statements for an appropriate
amount for the likely cost of such clean-ups. Cookson Group plc 65 Annual Report 2007
6. SEGMENT INFORMATION
6.1 PRIMARY REPORTING FORMAT – BUSINESS SEGMENTS
For management reporting purposes the Group’s continuing operations are organised into three main business segments,
Ceramics, Electronics and Precious Metals. These segments form the basis of the primary reporting format disclosures below.
The principal activities of each of these segments are described in the Operating Review on pages 10 to 22. Segment revenue
represents revenue to external customers. Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment
as well as those items that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Segment assets exclude cash and short-term deposits, deferred tax assets, income tax recoverable, investments in joint
ventures, assets classified as held for sale and corporate assets that cannot be allocated on a reasonable basis to a business
segment. These items are shown collectively in the following tables as “unallocated assets”. Segment liabilities exclude interest-
bearing loans and borrowings, employee benefits obligations, deferred tax liabilities, income tax payable, liabilities directly
associated with assets classified as held for sale and corporate liabilities that cannot be allocated on a reasonable basis to a
business segment. These items are shown collectively in the following tables as “unallocated liabilities”.

9. RATIONALISATION OF OPERATING ACTIVITIES
The charge for rationalisation of operating activities of £5.8m (2006: £34.7m) was the result of the implementation of a number
of initiatives aimed at reducing the Group’s cost base and realigning its manufacturing capacity with its customer markets. The
initiatives implemented included redundancy programmes, the consolidation of facilities, plant closures, the streamlining of
manufacturing processes and the rationalisation of product lines. Of these rationalisation charges, £1.6m (2006: £10.3m) was in
respect of asset write-downs. Total cash spend in respect of rationalisation initiatives was £14.7m (2006: £16.1m), leaving
provisions made but unspent of £5.8m as at 31 December 2007 (31 December 2006: £19.3m). The net taxation credit attributable
to these rationalisation costs was £0.5m (2006: £2.1m).
10. PROFIT RELATING TO NON-CURRENT ASSETS
The net profit relating to non-current assets of £7.0m (2006: £13.1m) mainly comprised profits arising on the sale of surplus
property. The net taxation charge attributable to the sale of non-current assets was £1.2m (2006: £3.7m).

13. LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS
During 2007 and 2006, the Group disposed of a number of businesses from its Ceramics and Electronics divisions, none of which
individually or in aggregate represented a separate major line of business or geographical area of operation. Accordingly, these
disposals are presented within pre-tax results from continuing operations in the Group’s income statement. The aggregate
proceeds, net of selling costs, amounted to £1.5m (2006: £14.5m) and together with additional costs in relation to prior years’
disposals, resulted in a net loss before tax of £0.4m (2006: loss of £4.7m) (note 42).

14. INCOME TAX COSTS (continued)
The Group’s total income tax cost of £43.4m (2006: £43.8m) includes £3.5m (2006: £5.3m) relating to exceptional items,
comprising a £0.5m credit (2006: £2.1m) in relation to rationalisation costs (note 9), a charge of £1.2m (2006: £3.7m) in relation
to non-current assets (note 10) and a charge of £2.8m (2006: £3.1m) in relation to the different treatment of goodwill
amortisation for tax and reporting purposes. Current tax cost for 2007 was reduced by a benefit of £3.5m (2006: £2.2m) arising
from previously unrecognised tax losses and increased by a charge of £0.7m for the impact on deferred tax balances of changes
in tax rates.
The Group operates in a number of countries that have differing tax rates, laws and practices. Changes in any of these areas
could, adversely or positively, impact the Group’s tax charge in the future. Continuing losses, or insufficiency of taxable profit to
absorb all expenses, in any subsidiary could have the effect of increasing tax charges in the future, relative to 2007, as effective
tax relief may not be available for those losses or expenses. Other significant factors affecting the tax charge are described in
note 3.10.
The tax charge relating to items charged or credited directly to equity was £0.3m (2006: £nil).

15. NET POST-TAX LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
The net post-tax loss of £0.1m on disposal of discontinued operations comprised a profit of £3.9m on the sale of Monofrax Inc.
(“Monofrax”), additional profit of £1.2m in respect of the 2003 disposal of the Group’s former Speedline business, net of £5.2m
of additional costs in respect of prior years’ disposals.
On 1 February 2007, the Group sold its Monofrax business, a US-based manufacturer of fused-cast refractory products, which
previously formed part of the Ceramics division, to RHI AG (“RHI”) for US$45.0m (£22.9m). The purchase price was satisfied by
the assumption by RHI of pension, retirement and other liabilities of US$5.6m (£2.9m) with the balance satisfied by cash of
US$39.4m (£20.0m). As at 31 December 2006, the assets and liabilities of the Monofrax business were reclassified in the Group
balance sheet to “held for sale” and measured at fair value less costs to sell, resulting in neither a profit nor a loss in 2006. The
disposal of Monofrax in 2007 resulted in a profit of £3.9m.
As part of the sale of the Group’s former Speedline business in 2003 to KPS, an equity fund, the sale agreement provided for
the Group to receive further consideration from KPS contingent upon Speedline being sold in the future for more than a specified
sum. In December 2006, Speedline was sold by KPS for an amount in excess of the specified sum and accordingly a profit of
£1.2m has been recognised in 2007, in addition to the £2.7m reported in 2006.
In 2006, the £3.3m post-tax loss on disposal of discontinued operations comprised a £5.8m loss resulting from the disposal
of the Group’s former Laminates business, £0.2m of additional costs incurred in relation to the disposal in 2005 of the Group’s
former Specialty Coatings Systems business and a profit of £2.7m arising in relation to additional consideration receivable in
respect of the disposal of the Group’s Speedline business in 2003.
There was no tax charge or credit associated with the net post-tax loss on disposal of discontinued operations in 2007 (2006: £nil). Cookson Group plc 71 Annual Report 2007

ordinary shares are only treated as dilutive when their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease earnings per share, or
increase loss per share, from continuing operations.
In addition to the 0.5m (2006: 1.3m) shares shown in the table above as being dilutive, the Company has outstanding options
in relation to its share option schemes that could dilute EPS in the future, but which are not included in the calculation of diluted

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from
the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units for this purpose are the business segments disclosed in note 6, which
represent the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored. For the cash-generating units shown below, the
carrying amount of goodwill is significant in relation to the Group’s total carrying amount of goodwill:

Impairment testing
For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of the Group’s cash-generating units is determined from value-
in-use calculations.
In assessing goodwill for potential impairment as at 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006, the Directors have made use
of the most recent detailed calculations of the recoverable amount of the Group’s cash-generating units, prepared as at 31
December 2007 and 31 December 2005 respectively. Those calculations resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying values
of the cash-generating units.
In the assessment undertaken in 2007, value in use was derived from discounted 5-year cash flow projections. In preparing
the 5-year projections at 31 December 2007, the anticipated impact of market price trends and expected growth in output within
the industries in which each major Group business unit operates, were taken into account. A growth rate of 3% was used in the
years beyond the projection period, which was in line with the long-term forecast GDP growth rates for the regions in which the
Group operates. Pre-tax discount rates were estimated reflecting market assessments of the time value of money and the risks
specific to each cash-generating unit and were 12.5% for Ceramics, 13.4% for Assembly Materials, 11.3% for Chemistry and 12.9%
for Precious Metals.

The total deferred tax asset not recognised as at 31 December 2007 was £353.1m (2006: £352.4m). This consisted of £52.1m
(2006: £58.3m) relating to capital losses, £146.7m (2006: £141.5m) relating to operating losses, £70.7m (2006: £68.9m) relating
to unrelieved interest, £73.2m (2006: £70.6m) relating to other categories and £13.1m (2006: £13.1m) relating to UK ACT tax
credits. In accordance with the accounting policy in note 3.10, these items have not been recognised in the above analysis on the
basis that their future economic benefit is not probable. In total, there was an increase of £0.7m (2006: decrease of £43.2m) in
net unrecognised deferred tax assets during the year.
As at 31 December 2007, the Group had total operating losses carried forward with a tax value of £149.9m (2006: £147.8m).
This total includes £62.8m (2006: £62.9m) for losses which are available to offset future taxable US income, of which
approximately £6.0m (2006: £6.0m) will expire in 2020 and the remainder will expire between 2022 and 2027. A further £70.0m
(2006: £63.2m) of losses are available to offset future UK taxable income and may be carried forward without time limit. The
remaining losses with a value of £17.1m (2006: £21.7m) include £11.7m (2006: £18.6m) which may be carried forward indefinitely
and £5.4m (2006: £3.1m) which has a maximum life of between 7 and 9 years. The amounts arise in a number of countries and
are not individually significant, reflecting the spread of the Group’s operations.
As at 31 December 2007, the Group had US unrelieved interest with a tax value of £70.7m (2006: £68.9m), which may be
carried forward indefinitely.
As at 31 December 2007, the Group had UK capital losses carried forward with a tax value of £52.1m (2006: £58.3m). These
losses are available to offset future UK capital gains and may be carried forward without time limit.
As at 31 December 2007, the Group had total US tax credits carried forward with a tax value of £7.5m (2006: £6.8m). This
includes £2.0m (2006: £2.0m) of research and experimentation credits which expire between 2018 and 2027 and £5.5m (2006:
£4.8m) of foreign tax credits expiring between 2009 and 2016.
As at 31 December 2007, the Group had UK ACT tax credits carried forward with a tax value of £13.1m (2006: £13.1m), which
may be carried forward indefinitely.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures
for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is £107.3m (2006: £81.0m).

All of the Group’s operating companies have policies and procedures in place to ensure the creditworthiness of the customers
with which they do business. However , where objective evidence exists that a trade receivable balance may be impaired, provision
is made for the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated cash that will be recovered.
Impairment provisions are assessed on an individual customer basis for all significant outstanding balances and collectively for
all remaining balances based upon historical loss experience. Historical experience has shown that the Group’s trade receivable
provisions are maintained at levels that are sufficient to absorb actual bad debt write-offs without being excessive.

Impairment provisions, write-offs and the reversal of unused amounts shown in the table above are charged or credited as
appropriate within administration, selling and distribution costs in the Group income statement.
In determining the level of impairment provisions required, the Group’s operating companies initially review all significant
trade receivable balances on an individual basis for evidence of impairment. Evidence of impairment may include such factors as
the customer being in breach of contract, or entering bankruptcy or financial reorganisation proceedings. Of the total provision
for impairment of trade receivables at 31 December 2007 of £18.1m (2006: £15.9m) shown in the table above, £14.8m (2006:
£15.3m) related to balances that were impaired on an individual basis. The ageing analysis of these individually impaired balances
is shown in the table below.

Due to the large number of customers that the Group transacts its business with, none of which represent a significant proportion
of the total outstanding trade receivables balance, the Group is not exposed to any significant concentration of credit risk. Cookson Group plc 79 Annual Report 2007

The cost of inventories recognised as an expense and included in cost of sales in the income statement during the year was

In addition to the inventory recorded in the balance sheet, the Group held precious metals on consignment terms with a total
value as at 31 December 2007 of £344.1m (2006: £236.6m). As at 31 December 2007, metal held under consignment comprised
696,801 ounces of gold (2006: 564,148 ounces), 4,786,206 ounces of silver (2006: 6,063,106 ounces), 18,981 ounces of platinum
(2006: 17,746 ounces) and 19,974 ounces of palladium (2006: 16,022 ounces).
The Group also held precious metals on behalf of customers for processing, the value of which as at 31 December 2007 was
£83.0m (2006: £84.4m).
The Group’s precious metal fabrication operations utilise significant amounts of precious metals, being primarily gold by
value. These metals are predominantly held on consignment under arrangements the terms of which provide, inter alia, that the
consignor retains title to the metal and has a right of return over the metal without penalty. Consignors are party to either
committed or uncommitted arrangements. Under uncommitted arrangements, the consignor is under no obligation to supply the
precious metal to the Group’s fabrication operations and has the right, with limited or in some cases no notice, to demand
physical return of the consigned metal.
The metal which the Group fabricates for its customers may be purchased by the Group from the consignor and sold
concurrently to the customer, or may be consigned or sold directly from the consignor to the Group’s customers, with the Group
charging customers only for the fabrication process. Both of these methods used to supply metal for fabrication by the Group
eliminate the Group’s exposure to the risk of market fluctuations in metals prices. As the consignors retain title and associated
risks and benefits of ownership under these arrangements, the physical metal so held is not recorded in the Group balance sheet.
Consignment fees are charged by the consignor and totalled £3.8m in 2007 (2006: £4.2m).

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
28. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)
28.1 NET INVESTMENT HEDGES
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to synthetically change the currency profile of its borrowings to more closely
match the currency profile of the net assets of its foreign operations. Such contracts are designated as net investment hedges,
as they mitigate the Group’s exposure to changes in the value of its investment in the net assets of its foreign operations that
arises as a result of the fluctuation in exchange rates.
28.2 CASH FLOW HEDGES
In its operations the Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to provide a hedge against the cash flow risk associated with
certain highly probable forecast transactions. Such contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are used in relation to the
forecast sale of goods and purchase of raw materials in order to provide a hedge against the variability in cash flows that might
otherwise arise as a result of the fluctuation in exchange rates.
28.3 FAIR VALUE HEDGES
In its operations the Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as fair value hedges, to provide a hedge against
the risk of changes in the fair value of recognised assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies that might
otherwise arise as a result of the fluctuation in exchange rates.
29. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE
On 18 December 2006, the Group entered into an agreement with RHI AG to sell Monofrax Inc. (“Monofrax”), a US-based
manufacturer of fused-cast refractory products representing a separate major line of business within the Ceramics division. The
transaction was completed 1 February 2007, and accordingly, the related assets and liabilities of Monofrax were classified as held
for sale as at 31 December 2006. No such disposals were planned at the current balance sheet date.

In October 2007 , the Company issued 18,583,519 new 10p ordinary shares through a share placing at a price of 825p per ordinary
share. The issue raised £150.6m net of issue costs. During the year, the Company issued 621,008 new 10p ordinary shares in
connection with its share option schemes.
The cancellation of the deferred shares became effective on 15 February 2006 upon registration of the order of the High
Court with the Registrar of Companies, at which date the balance of £356.5m on the account became a non-distributable reserve
of the Company reported within other reserves (note 15 to the Company financial statements). This reserve becomes distributable
only at such time when all external creditors of the Company as at 15 February 2006 have either been fully settled, or have

equity within the hedging reserve. When the forecast transaction that was being hedged is realised and affects profit or loss, the
cumulative gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is removed from the hedging reserve and recognised in the income
statement in the same period.
Investment revaluation reserve
Available-for-sale investments are carried in the Group balance sheet at fair value. Changes in fair value from one balance sheet
date to the next are recorded in the investment revaluation reserve, together with any related tax. When the investment is
derecognised the cumulative amount relating to it in the investment revaluation reserve, together with any related tax, is
recognised in the income statement.
Translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences attributable to the equity holders of the parent company that
arise from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations and from the translation of financial instruments that
hedge the Group’s net investment in foreign operations. In addition to foreign exchange differences attributable to the equity
holders of the parent company, the Group statement of recognised income and expense also includes foreign exchange
differences attributable to minority interests (note 34).

The Treasury shares shown in the table above are ordinary shares of 10p each of the Company and are held by Cookson
Investments (Jersey) Limited as Trustee of the Cookson Group ESOP (note 15 to the Company financial statements).
In October 2007, the Company issued 18,583,519 new 10p ordinary shares through a share placing. The issue raised £150.6m
net of issue costs. A cash box structure was utilised to affect the share placing, as a result of which Section 131 of the Companies
Act 1985 applied to the excess of the net proceeds over the nominal value of the shares issued and consequently no share
premium was recognised. The excess net proceeds of £148.8m were recorded as a merger reserve that was subsequently
transferred to retained earnings and which is available for distribution to shareholders.

36.3 MARKET RISK – CURRENCY RELATED
The Group is exposed to currency risk in relation to the value of its financial assets and liabilities that are denominated in
currencies other than sterling (see note 36.2 above), arising from fluctuations in exchange rates. The table below shows the
impact on the value of the Group’s reported net financial liabilities of exchange rates either strengthening or weakening by 10%
against sterling and the impact that this would have on the reported profit or loss and equity. The Group’s reported profit is not
impacted by the effect of the changes in exchange rates on the value of its net financial liabilities, but equity would be £12.2m
higher if sterling strengthened by 10% and £14.9m lower if sterling weakened by 10%.

36.4 MARKET RISK – INTEREST RATE RELATED
(a) Cash flow risk
Changes in market interest rates expose the Group to the risk of fluctuation in the cash flows relating to its financial assets
and liabilities that attract interest at floating rates (see note 36.2 above). Based upon the interest rate profile of the Group’s
financial assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2007, a one percent increase in market interest rates would result in a
reduction of £1.3m (2006: £nil) in both the annual net finance costs charged to the Group income statement and the net
interest paid in the Group statement of cash flows, with no impact on the Group’s equity. Correspondingly, a one percent
decrease in interest rates would result in an increase of £1.3m (2006: £nil) in both the annual net finance costs charged to
the income statement and the net interest paid in the Group statement of cash flows, with no impact on the Group’s equity.
(b) Fair value risk
Changes in market interest rates expose the Group to the risk of fluctuation in the fair value of its financial assets and
liabilities that attract interest at fixed rates. The fair value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are shown in note 36.1
above. Based upon the interest rate profile of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2007 , a one percent
increase in market interest rates would result in a £6.0m (2006: £8.6m) decrease in the fair value of the Group’s net debt
including forward foreign exchange contracts and a one percent decrease in market interest rates would result in a £6.3m
(2006: £9.0m) increase in the fair value of the Group’s net debt including forward foreign exchange contracts. These fair value
changes would have no impact upon the Group’s reported profit or loss or equity.

As at 31 December 2007, the Group had committed borrowing facilities of £383.0m (2006: £478.5m), of which £187.0m (2006:
£200.0m), due to expire in more than two years but not more than five years from the balance sheet date, were undrawn.
The Group’s near-term borrowing requirements have been met by a committed syndicated bank facility of £200.0m (2006:
£200.0m). The facility is for a term of three years, with options to extend for a further two years. On 1 March 2007, the Group
exercised the last of these options to extend the facility’s maturity to 1 March 2010 on the same pricing and terms. The facility is
unsecured, with all security and guarantees under the previous facility being fully released. Borrowings under the facility are for
general corporate purposes. Cookson Group plc 89 Annual Report 2007
37. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
37.1 GROUP POST-RETIREMENT PLANS
The Group operates a number of pension plans around the world, both of the defined contribution and defined benefit type, and
accounts for them in accordance with IAS 19.
(a) Defined contribution pension plans
The Group’s principal defined contribution plans are in the UK and the US and the assets of the plans are held separately from
the Group in trustee-administered funds. The total expense for these plans in the income statement amounted to £7.7m
(2006: £7.0m) and represents the contributions payable for the year by the Group to the plans.
(b) Defined benefit pension plans
The Group’s principal defined benefit pension plans are in the UK and the US. The assets of these plans are held separately
from the Group in trustee-administered funds. The trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plans’ beneficiaries.
The Group also has defined benefit pension plans in other territories, but these are not material in relation to the Group as
a whole.
The Group has one main defined benefit pension plan in the UK (“the UK Plan”), which was closed to new entrants from
2004. A full actuarial valuation of the UK Plan is carried out every three years by an independent actuary for the UK Plan
Trustee and the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2006. At that date, the market value of plan assets was
£278.3m and this represented a ‘funding level’ of 78% of the accrued plan benefits at the time (using the projected unit
method of valuation) of £356.6m. Calculated on a ‘buy-out’ basis (using an estimation of the cost of buying out the UK Plan
benefits with an insurance company), the liabilities at that date were £475.7m, representing a funding level of 59%. Following
the full valuation of the UK Plan as at 31 December 2003, the Group’s ordinary contributions were set at 11% of pensionable
salaries. From 1 January 2008, based on the latest full valuation, the Group’s ordinary contributions have been set at 16.9%
of pensionable salaries. In addition to these ordinary contributions, in 2006 the Company agreed with the UK Plan Trustee a
repayment schedule which provided for additional funding payments of £26.5m per annum from 2007 to 2010, with the aim
of eliminating the UK Plan deficit by 2011. This repayment schedule has been reconfirmed by the Company and the UK Plan
Trustee in March 2008. The Company monitors the UK Plan funding level on a regular basis and will continue to review
annually with the UK Plan Trustee the continued appropriateness of the repayment schedule currently in place. The next full
triennial valuation is due as at 31 December 2009.
The US has a number of defined benefit plans, providing retirement benefits based on final salary or a fixed benefit. In
addition, the Group’s US Retirement Security Plan has characteristics similar to defined contribution plans but with a
minimum performance level guaranteed by the Group on the members’ accounts. The ‘cash balance rate’ assumption in the
table in note 37.2 (b) refers to the assumed minimum guaranteed return on members’ accounts. From early in 2007, the
Retirement Security Plan and the largest of the Group’s other US defined benefit plans were closed to new members and also
to future benefit accrual for existing members. Existing plan members are, in each case, being provided with future pension
benefit through a defined contribution arrangement. Actuarial valuations of the US defined benefit pension plans are carried
out every year and the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2006. At that date the market value of the plan
assets was £58.9m, representing a funding level of 60% of accrued plan benefits at that date (using the projected unit
method of valuation) of £98.7m. Funding levels for the Group’s US defined benefit pension plans are normally based upon
annual valuations carried out by independent qualified actuaries and are governed by US government regulations.
(c) Other post-retirement defined benefit plans
The Group’s principal defined employee benefit plans other than pensions are healthcare benefit plans in the US and UK.
As is common for these types of plan, the costs of providing these benefits are not funded externally by the Group.
37.2 POST-RETIREMENT LIABILITY – VALUATION AND RISK MITIGATION
The assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Group’s defined benefit pension and other post-retirement
benefit plans, as detailed below, are set by the Directors after consultation with independent professionally qualified actuaries.
The discount rate used to determine the liabilities of the UK Plan for IAS 19 accounting purposes is required to be a corporate
bond yield. As described in note 37 .2(c) below, the UK Plan operates a hedging strategy, using a combination of swaps and money
market instruments, to mitigate the impact of interest rate and inflation rate movements on the value of its projected liabilities
for meeting future pension payments (the UK Plan’s “economic liabilities”), the value of which is related more to interest rate and
inflation rate swap yields than to corporate bond yields. When the relationship between the relevant swap yields and corporate
bond yields is stable, the UK Plan’s hedging strategy should deliver a broadly stable funding ratio (the ratio of plan assets to plan
liabilities) not just in relation to the UK Plan’s economic liabilities, but also under an IAS 19 basis of valuation. However, should
corporate bond yields increase significantly above swap yields, as was the case during the second half of 2007, then the IAS 19
value of the UK Plan’s liabilities will be reduced to a greater extent than will the value of the actual underlying economic liabilities.
As at 31 December 2007, this divergence in yields had the effect of reducing the Group’s UK Plan IAS 19 deficit by some £39m
compared with the deficit based on the UK Plan’s economic liabilities. The Company continues to fund the UK Plan with reference
to its economic funding position.

37.2 POST-RETIREMENT LIABILITY – VALUATION AND RISK MITIGATION (continued)
(a) Mortality assumptions
The mortality assumptions used in the actuarial valuations of the Group’s UK and US defined benefit pension liabilities have
been strengthened since 31 December 2006 to assume that pension plan members have a longer life expectancy. The
assumptions used are summarised in the table below and have been selected to reflect the characteristics and experience of
the membership of those plans.
For the UK Plan, the assumptions used have been derived by adjusting the standard mortality tables which reflect recent
research into mortality experience in the UK. The assumptions are based on PA 92 tables projected forward with adjustments
to reflect (i) the medium cohort improvement factors; (ii) a minimum level, or ‘underpin’, to the amount by which life
expectancy is expected to improve at each age in the future, which has the effect of increasing the life expectancy at age 65
by some 0.5 years for someone currently aged 65 and by up to 2 years for someone currently aged 45; and (iii) the latest
available trend information which indicates that life expectancy relating, in particular, to blue collar workers may not be
improving as quickly as indicated by the standard tables. As regards the latter adjustment, based on an analysis of the mix
of blue and white collar workers in the UK Plan and on the results of a recent investigation carried out on the mortality
experience in the UK Plan, the UK assumptions have been adjusted (using a scaling factor of 112%) to reflect a lower level of
life expectancy amongst the blue collar membership. The assumptions used in the 2006 valuation were based on the PA 92
tables combined with the medium cohort improvement factors and a scaling factor of 112% (i.e., adjustments (i) and (iii) above).
For the Group’s US plans, the assumptions used have been based on the standard RP2000CH mortality tables, projected
64 years for non-pensioners (2006: 40 years) and 33 years for pensioners (2006: 25 years) using projection scale AA. The
change in the US assumptions broadly mirrors the same level of improvement as made to the UK assumptions in 2007.

The UK discount rate is based on the annualised yield on the iBoxx over 15 year AA-rated sterling corporate bond index. The
US discount rate is based on the equivalent iBoxx index for US domestic corporations. The assumptions for price inflation are
set by reference to the difference between yields on longer-term conventional government bonds and index-linked bonds. The
overall expected rate of return on plan assets reflects market expectations at the valuation date of long-term asset returns
and the mix of assets in the plans. Cookson Group plc 91 Annual Report 2007

(c) UK pension plan risk mitigation strategy
In 2006, the Company and the UK Plan Trustee undertook an initiative to consider how best to manage the UK Plan’s
exposure to major investment risks. The following were deemed to be the major investment risks which could affect the value
of the UK Plan’s assets compared to the value of its economic liabilities:
• Interest rate risk – the risk of government bond interest rates falling, leading to an increase in the value of plan liabilities.
• Inflation risk – the risk of inflation rising faster than expected, leading to an increase in the value of plan liabilities.
• Equity market risk – the risk of significant equity market falls, leading to a fall in the value of plan assets.
In order to mitigate these key risks, the Trustee has entered into the following financial derivative arrangements:
• Interest rate swaps – the UK Plan receives a fixed rate of interest and pays out a variable rate of interest, based on the
London Inter Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR). This is beneficial when long-term interest rates fall,
significantly offsetting the corresponding increase in the value of the UK Plan’s economic liabilities.
• Inflation swaps – the UK Plan pays out a fixed rate of interest of around 3% per annum and receives payments linked
to actual inflation. This is beneficial when inflation increases faster than expected and significantly
offsets the corresponding increase in the value of the UK Plan’s economic liabilities.
• Equity derivatives – using a combination of equity derivatives, the UK Plan has bought protection against the first 20% fall
in equity market prices over the four year period from 1 December 2006. To pay for this protection, the
UK Plan foregoes any equity market price returns above about 6.5% per annum, but will continue to
receive dividend payments and the benefit of any active management out-performance of its equity
manager’s respective benchmark.
The interest rate and inflation swaps entered into were designed to mitigate interest rate and inflation risk for approximately
80% of the UK Plan’s liabilities. This investment strategy has led to a large reduction in the risk that the value of the UK Plan’s
assets falls materially relative to the value of its economic liabilities.
(d) Sensitivity analysis of key actuarial assumptions used
The following table analyses, for the Group’s UK and US pension plans, the theoretical estimated impact on plan liabilities
resulting from changes to key actuarial assumptions used for IAS 19 valuation purposes, whilst holding all other assumptions
constant.
It should be noted that the investment strategy adopted by the UK Plan, details of which are given above, was designed
to mitigate a significant majority of the interest rate and inflation risk related to the UK Plan’s economic liabilities. The
stabilising impact of this strategy is not reflected in the following table.

With regard to the Group’s post-retirement healthcare benefit plans, a one percent increase in the healthcare cost trend rate
assumptions shown in the table in note 37.2 (b) would increase the accumulated post-employment medical benefit obligation
by £0.1m without changing the post-employment medical benefit costs and a one percent decrease in the healthcare cost
trend rate assumptions would reduce the obligation by £0.1m without changing the post-employment medical benefit costs.

37.3 DEFINED BENEFIT OBLIGATION
The liabilities of the Group’s defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans for IAS 19 accounting purposes are
measured by discounting the best estimate of the future cash flows to be paid out by the plans using the projected unit method,
in which the calculation of plan liabilities makes allowance for projected increases in benefit-related earnings.

(a) UK Plan asset allocation
As at 31 December 2007, the UK Plan’s assets were allocated 47% in equities (of which 50% were UK and 50% overseas);
39% in money market instruments combined with interest rate and inflation swaps; 4% in infrastructure investments and
10% in absolute return funds. The UK Plan Trustee’s target allocation currently provides for money market instruments to
move to 40% of the UK Plan’s assets and for 10% of its assets to be held in each of infrastructure investments and absolute
return funds, with 40% to be held in equities. The infrastructure and absolute return assets have been introduced to reduce
further the exposure to equity market risk and to provide an alternative source of return which is not highly correlated with
equity markets.
The swaps held in combination with the money market instruments (typically AAA-rated, very short-term debt) provide an
exposure similar to holding gilts and are in addition to the interest rate swaps, inflation swaps and equity derivatives in place
as part of the risk mitigation strategy described at 37.2(c).
(b) US pension plan assets not recognised above
In addition to the assets reported above, £9.2m (2006: £8.3m) of assets were held as at 31 December 2007 to fund certain
non-qualified US pension plan obligations (note 24). These assets are not included within pension plan assets as they are
available to satisfy creditors in the event of the winding-up of the Group company in which they are held and are reported as
investments in the Group balance sheet.
(c) Defined benefit contributions in 2008
The Group is expected to make aggregate contributions into its defined benefit pension plans of £36.5m in 2008. This
includes a special funding contribution of £26.5m into the UK Plan, although the level of this contribution is expected to be
reviewed with the UK Plan Trustee during the course of 2008. The Group is also expected to make aggregate contributions
in respect of its other post-retirement benefit plans of £1.8m in 2008.

and £1.0m (2006: £8.6m) has been reported as curtailment gains relating to employee benefits.
The curtailment gain relating to employee benefits of £1.0m in the year arose in relation to the UK post-retirement medical
plan, resulting from a reduction in the Group’s costs of providing benefits under the plan. The £8.6m gain in 2006 resulted from
reductions in liabilities arising from the closure of the Group’s two largest US defined benefit pension plans to new members and
the freezing of benefits for existing members, together with reductions in the level of benefits provided through certain of the
Group’s US post-retirement healthcare plans.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
38. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
38.1 SHARE-BASED PAYMENT SCHEMES
The Group operates a number of different share-based payment schemes; the main features of each scheme are outlined below.
(a) Long-term incentive plan (“LTIP”)
At the 2004 AGM of the Company, shareholders approved a new LTIP to replace the Mid-Term Incentive Plan (“MTIP”) and
the executive share option schemes.
The LTIP has two elements. Firstly, executives who are eligible receive a conditional annual allocation of shares worth up
to a prescribed percentage of their base salary (“Performance Shares”). Secondly, executives who are eligible can elect to
invest all or part of their annual incentive in ordinary shares of the Company (“Bonus Investment Shares”) in return for which
they receive a conditional award of ordinary shares worth up to 2.25 times the pre-tax equivalent of the annual incentive so
invested (“Matching Shares”). In addition, for awards made after 7 March 2007, the Remuneration Committee has the
discretion to award participants the dividends that would have been paid on the number of shares that vest in respect of
dividend record dates occurring during the period between the award date and the date of vesting.
Performance Shares and Matching Shares can vest after three years, with the proportion of shares vesting being based
on the Company’s performance against specified performance conditions. For awards made in 2005 and 2006, vesting is
based upon the Group’s three-year Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) performance relative to that of the companies of its
comparator group, the FTSE 250 excluding Investment Trusts. Vesting of the Performance Shares and Matching Shares under
the 2005 and 2006 LTIP awards will therefore be as follows:
TSR ranking relative to FTSE 250 Matching Shares vesting ratio
excluding Investment Trusts Performance Shares vesting percentage (Matching Shares: Bonus Investment Shares)
Below median 0% 0
Median 25% 0.5:1
Upper quintile (top 20%) 100% 2.25:1
Between median and upper quintile Pro rata between 25% and 100% Pro rata between 0.5:1 and 2.25:1
In 2007, the Remuneration Committee broadened the performance condition by including headline EPS growth. For awards
made in 2007 and for future awards, vesting of 50% of shares awarded will be based on the TSR performance measure
described above and 50% on headline EPS (the calculation of which is shown in note 17) growth over a three-year period. The
two measures will operate independently.
Vesting of Performance Shares and Matching Shares under the 2007 and 2008 LTIP awards will be based on TSR
performance in accordance with the following schedule:
TSR ranking relative to FTSE 250 Matching Shares vesting ratio
excluding Investment Trusts Performance Shares vesting percentage (Matching Shares: Bonus Investment Shares)
Below median 0% 0
Median 12.5% 0.25:1
Upper quintile (top 20%) 50% 1.125:1
Between median and upper quintile Pro rata between 12.5% and 50% Pro rata between 0.25:1 and 1.125:1
Vesting of Performance Shares and Matching Shares under the 2007 and 2008 LTIP awards will be based on headline EPS
growth, as compared with the compound annual growth in the UK Retail Prices Index (“RPI”), in accordance with the following
schedule:
Matching Shares vesting ratio
Annual compound headline EPS growth above RPI Performance Shares vesting percentage (Matching Shares: Bonus Investment Shares)
Below 3% 0% 0
3% 12.5% 0.25:1
At or above 10% 50% 1.125:1
Between 3% and 10% Pro rata between 12.5% and 50% Pro rata between 0.25:1 and 1.125:1
An executive’s Matching Shares award will only vest if the Bonus Investment Shares originally purchased have been retained.
The fair value of awards granted under the LTIP is measured using a stochastic pricing model. Cookson Group plc 97 Annual Report 2007
38. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (continued)
38.1 SHARE-BASED PAYMENT SCHEMES (continued)
(b) Mid-term incentive plan (“MTIP”)
Under the MTIP, executives were eligible to receive a bonus, paid partly in cash and partly in ordinary shares of the Company,
the beneficial receipt of which was deferred for two years from the end of the performance period (“restricted shares”),
based upon the achievement of target financial performance measured over a three-year period. Performance targets based
on either the Group’s cumulative profit or cumulative profit and cash flow performance were set by the Remuneration
Committee for each three-year MTIP period. The MTIP operated on a rolling three-year basis and the final remaining cycle
culminated at the end of 2005.
The fair value of awards granted under the MTIP was measured using a Black-Scholes pricing model.
(c) Executive option schemes (“ESOS”)
The last executive share option grant was made in 2003. Under these schemes, share options were granted at the market
price prevailing at the time of grant. Options normally only became exercisable if the growth in headline earnings per share
was at least equal to the increase in the RPI plus 3% per annum (2% per annum for options granted in 1995 and 1996) for a
consecutive three year period.
The fair value of awards granted under the ESOS was measured using a stochastic pricing model.
(d) UK and international Sharesave schemes (“SAYE” schemes)
The last grant under the SAYE schemes was made in 2004. Under the SAYE schemes, employees had the opportunity to
purchase ordinary shares in the Group at a discounted price by using their savings together with an additional tax free bonus
at the end of their saving period. The schemes operated in conjunction with a three or five-year savings contract and options
were granted at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares at the date of grant. Employees who entered into
these contracts had to make monthly savings of between £5 and £250.
The fair value of awards granted under the SAYE schemes was measured using a Black-Scholes pricing model.
(e) Deferred Bonus Plan (“DBP”)
In 2007, the Company implemented a new Deferred Bonus Plan in place of the LTIP for certain corporate managers. Under
this plan, executives received an allocation of deferred shares to the value of a percentage of their annual bonus. These
shares will vest after three years, although an executive’s allocation may lapse if their employment ceases in certain
circumstances before the end of the three-year period. The executive Directors do not participate in this plan.
The fair value of awards granted under the DBP scheme was measured using a Black-Scholes pricing model.
(f) US Stock Purchase Plan (“USSPP”)
The last grant under the USSPP was made in 2004. An eligible employee who applied for an option under the USSPP agreed
to savings being deducted from their net pay. Regular deductions were made over a one-year period (not more than
US$5,000 in any year). Shares were only acquired under the USSPP on exercise of the option using the savings together with
interest on such savings. The price payable for each ordinary share was the price in sterling determined by the Directors,
provided that it was not less than 85% of the middle market quotation of the ordinary shares on the date of grant. An option
grant under the USSPP was exercisable not later than 18 months after the date of grant provided the option holder was still
employed by the Group.
The fair value of awards granted under the USSPP was measured using a Black-Scholes pricing model.
(g) Stock Appreciation Rights (“SAR”)
Due to the disadvantageous tax regime in Belgium, Belgian participants in the ESOS and SAYE schemes received SAR instead
of share options. These SAR were awarded under exactly the same rights and conditions as the share options, except that
individuals received, in cash, the difference between the subscription price and market price of Cookson Group plc shares on
the date of exercise, rather than having the right to purchase shares.

The provision for disposal and closure costs includes the Directors’ current best estimates of the costs to be incurred both in the
fulfilment of obligations undertaken in connection with former Group businesses, resulting from either disposal or closure,
together with those related to the demolition and clean-up of closed sites. The provision comprises amounts payable in respect
of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims, including
claims relating to product liability.
As the settlement of many of the obligations for which provision is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the
timing of the associated outflows is subject to some uncertainty, but the majority of the amounts provided are expected to be
utilised over the next five years and the underlying estimates of costs are regularly updated to reflect changed circumstances
with regard to individual matters.
The provision for rationalisation costs is used to manage the costs of all of the Group’s initiatives to rationalise its operating
activities. The balance of £5.8m as at 31 December 2007 relates to future expenditure on rationalisation initiatives, the majority
of which commenced in 2006 and 2007 and is expected to be spent over the course of the next two years after 2007. Cookson Group plc 101 Annual Report 2007
40. PROVISIONS (continued)
Other provisions comprise amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory
requirements, or from third-party claims. As the settlement of many of the obligations for which provision is made is subject to
legal or other regulatory process, the timing of the associated outflows is subject to some uncertainty, but the majority of the
amounts provided are expected to be utilised over the next five years and the underlying estimates of costs are regularly updated
to reflect changed circumstances with regard to individual matters.
Where insurance cover exists for any of these known or probable costs, a related asset is recognised in the Group balance
sheet when its realisation is virtually certain. At 31 December 2007, £6.4m was recorded in receivables in respect of associated
insurance reimbursements, of which £4.7m is non-current. The amounts reported in the table above as charged to the income
statement represent only that part of the total income statement charge which should be reported as a movement on the
relevant provisions, other components of which, such as asset write-offs, are reported within the relevant balance sheet line item.
41. ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARIES AND JOINT VENTURES, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED
During 2007, the Group acquired interests in subsidiaries and joint ventures for a total consideration of £14.1m. The net assets
acquired, consideration paid and goodwill arising are summarised in the table below. The goodwill on acquisition of £3.7m is
attributable to the operational synergies expected to result from the business combinations.

The businesses acquired in the year contributed revenue of £11.6m and trading profit of £0.9m to the Group’s 2007 results. If the
acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2007, it is estimated that they would have contributed revenue of £41.8m and a trading
loss of £0.5m.
During 2006, a total of £4.1m was paid, in cash, in respect of deferred consideration for subsidiaries acquired in prior years
and the buy-out of a 49% minority shareholding in a Chinese subsidiary of the Electronics division.

Guarantees of borrowings for the Group as at 31 December 2007 amounted to £nil (2006: £nil) and guarantees under property
leases of discontinued operations amounted to £3.2m (2006: £2.6m). Details of guarantees given by the Company, on behalf of
the Group, are given in note 19 to the Company financial statements.
The Group has extensive international operations and several companies within the Group are parties to legal proceedings,
certain of which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the Group company involved. While the
outcome of litigation can never be predicted with certainty, having regard to legal advice received and the Group’s insurance
arrangements, the Directors believe that none of these matters will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a materially
adverse effect on the Group’s financial position or results of operations.
Legal claims have been brought against Group companies by third parties alleging that persons have been harmed by
exposure to hazardous materials. Two of the Group’s subsidiaries are subject to lawsuits in the US relating to a small number of
products containing asbestos manufactured prior to the acquisition of those subsidiaries by the Group. To date, there have been
no liability verdicts against either of these subsidiaries. A number of lawsuits have been withdrawn, dismissed or settled, and the
amount paid, including costs, in relation to this litigation has not had a materially adverse effect on the Group’s financial position
or results of operations.
45. SUBSIDIARIES
Details of the principal subsidiaries and joint ventures of Cookson Group plc and the countries in which they are incorporated are
given in note 7 to the Company financial statements.
46. RELATED PARTIES

in this note. During the year, Group subsidiaries made sales of products and services to Group joint venture companies of £1.2m
(2006: £1.2m) and made purchases of goods and services from Group joint venture companies of £0.2m (2006: £0.6m). As at

The Company-only financial statements were authorised for issue by the Directors on 11 March 2008 and signed on their behalf by:
Robert Beeston Chairman Mike Butterworth Group Finance Director NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. BASIS OF PREPARATION
The Company-only financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and under the historical cost
convention and in accordance with UK GAAP.
The Company’s results are included in the consolidated financial statements of Cookson Group plc, a company registered in
the United Kingdom. The Company is exempt under the terms of FRS 8 from disclosing related party transactions with entities
that are part of the Cookson Group plc group.
A separate profit and loss account dealing with the results of the Company only has not been presented, as permitted by
Section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently when dealing with all items which are material in
relation to the Company-only financial statements.
2.1 CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAXATION
Both current and deferred tax are calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the
balance sheet date.
Current tax payable is based on the taxable result for the year. Deferred taxation is recognised, without discounting, in
respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date, with the exception that
deferred taxation assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable future profits from
which the reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted. Provision is made for the tax that would arise on
remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have
been accrued as receivable.
2.2 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Company operates equity-settled share-based payment arrangements for employees. Equity-settled share-based payments
are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date takes account of the effect of market-
based conditions, such as a Total Shareholder Return target upon which vesting for some of the awards is conditioned, and is
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity. The cumulative expense
recognised is adjusted for the best estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and for the effect of non market-based vesting
conditions. For grants with market-based conditions attaching to them, fair value is measured using a form of stochastic option
pricing model. For all other grants, fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes model.
2.3 PENSION COSTS
The Company participates in a UK-wide Group pension plan providing benefits based on final pensionable salary. The assets of
the plan are held separately from those of the Company in an independently administered fund. The Company is unable to
identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the plan on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as
required by FRS 17, ‘Retirement Benefits’, accounts for the plan as if it were a defined contribution scheme. As a result, the
amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the plan for the year.
The Company also participates in a UK-wide Group defined contribution pension plan. The assets of the plan are held
separately from those of the Company in an independently administered fund. The amount charged to the profit and loss account
represents the contributions payable to the plan for the year. Differences between contributions payable in the year and
contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
2.4 POST-RETIREMENT PLANS OTHER THAN PENSION PLANS
The Company operates a post-retirement healthcare benefits plan. The costs of providing the benefits under this plan are not
funded and the amount recognised in the balance sheet is based upon independent actuarial valuations, using the projected
unit method.
2.5 FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Differences arising from the translation, at closing rates, of loans to overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures, foreign currency
borrowings, trading and other items are taken to the profit and loss account.
2.6 BORROWING COSTS
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges and direct
issue costs are accounted for on an accruals basis in the profit and loss account using the effective interest rate method.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.7 INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDIARIES
Shares in subsidiaries are stated at cost, together with long-term loans that are stated at amortised cost, less any impairment
in value.
2.8 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company uses derivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign currency contracts to manage the Company’s
exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on retranslation of the Company’s subsidiaries’ net assets on consolidation. In
accordance with its treasury policy, the Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are initially recognised at fair value, which is their quoted market price at the balance sheet
date. At each subsequent balance sheet date, forward foreign exchange contracts are measured at their quoted market price at
the balance sheet date with any change in fair value being recognised in the profit and loss account.
2.9 PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the
Company will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure
required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
3. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE

13. SHARE CAPITAL (continued)
In October 2007 , the Company issued 18,583,519 new 10p ordinary shares through a share placing at a price of 825p per ordinary
share. The issue raised £150.6m net of issue costs. During the year, the Company issued 621,008 new 10p ordinary shares in
connection with its share option schemes.
The cancellation of the deferred shares became effective on 15 February 2006 upon registration of the order of the High Court
with the Registrar of Companies, at which date the balance of £356.5m on the account became a non-distributable reserve of the
Company reported within other reserves (note 15). This reserve becomes distributable only at such time when all external creditors
of the Company as at 15 February 2006 have either been fully settled, or have agreed that this reserve may be deemed distributable.
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time, are entitled to one vote per
share at meetings of the Company and rank equally with regard to entitlement to the Company’s residual assets.

The 2006 cancellation of the share premium account became effective on 15 February 2006 upon registration of the order of
the High Court with the Registrar of Companies, at which date the balance of £646.9m on the account became a non-
distributable reserve of the Company reported within other retained earnings (note 15). This reserve becomes distributable only
at such time when all external creditors of the Company as at 15 February 2006 have either been fully settled, or have agreed
that this reserve may be deemed distributable.

In October 2007, the Company issued 18,583,519 new 10p ordinary shares through a share placing. The issue raised £150.6m net
of issue costs. A cash box structure was utilised to effect the share placing, as a result of which Section 131 of the Companies Act
1985 applied to the excess of the net proceeds over the nominal value of the shares issued and consequently no share premium
was recognised. The excess net proceeds of £148.8m were recorded as a merger reserve that was subsequently transferred to
retained earnings and which is available for distribution to shareholders.
During 2006, the Company entered into a High Court sanctioned capital reduction scheme that resulted in the creation of
£1,003.4m of non-distributable reserves. Under the terms of the reduction, the Company is permitted to release from these
reserves as realised profit, an amount equal in value to the amount by which the Company’s share capital and share premium
account are increased, subsequent to the reduction, as a result of an issue of shares. Since the date of the reduction, the
Company’s share capital and share premium have increased by £10.2m as a result of share issues and this amount has been
transferred to distributable reserves. 15. RESERVES (continued)
Treasury shares
As at 1 January 2007, 0.8m ordinary shares of 10p each of the Company were held by Cookson Investments (Jersey) Limited, as
Trustee of the Cookson Group Employee Share Ownership Plan (“ESOP”), with a nominal value of £0.1m, which were purchased
at a gross cost of £8.4m. During the year 0.2m shares were utilised by the ESOP to meet share option obligations and accordingly
£3.1m has been transferred from the treasury shares reserve to retained earnings. As at 31 December 2007, the number of
ordinary shares of 10p each of the Company so held in trust was 0.6m, having a nominal value of £0.1m, which were purchased
at a gross cost of £5.3m. The purchase of these shares was financed by the Company out of borrowings included in the Company
balance sheet as at 31 December 2007. The market value of these shares as at 31 December 2007 was £4.4m (2006: £4.9m). The
Trustee of the ESOP has waived its rights to receive dividends on the shares held. The shares are held, as Treasury Shares, to
meet share option obligations as and when they arise at the discretion of the Company.
Options exercisable over ordinary shares and capable of being satisfied through new allotments of shares or through shares held
by the Company’s ESOP as at 31 December 2007 were as follows:

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
17. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
17.1 PENSION PLANS
The Company participates in a UK-wide Group defined benefit pension scheme. The Company is unable to identify its share of the
underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme and therefore accounts for its membership of the scheme as it would for a defined
contribution scheme. Costs charged in the year in respect of its contributions payable to the scheme were £4.6m (2006: £4.5m).
The pension scheme is a closed scheme and therefore under the projected unit method the current service cost would be
expected to increase as the members of the scheme reach retirement.
The last full actuarial valuation of the UK defined benefit scheme, which was performed by an independent qualified actuary,
was carried out as at 31 December 2006. At that date, the market value of the plan assets was £278.3m, representing 78% of
accrued plan benefits at the time (using the projected unit method of valuation) of £356.6m. Calculated on a ‘buy-out’ basis
(using an estimation of the cost of buying out the UK Plan benefits with an insurance company), the liabilities at that date were
£475.7m, representing a funding level of 59%. The 2006 full valuation has been updated, as appropriate, in order to estimate the
liabilities of the scheme as at 31 December 2007 , at which date the market value of the plan assets was £318.1m (2006: £278.3m),
representing 92% (2006: 78%) of estimated accrued plan benefits of £345.4m (2006: £356.6m).
The Company also participates in a UK-wide defined contribution pension scheme. The pension cost charge represents
contributions payable by the Company to the scheme and amounted to £0.1m (2006: £0.1m). There were no outstanding
contributions payable to the scheme as at 31 December 2007 (31 December 2006: £nil).
17.2 POST-EMPLOYMENT PLANS OTHER THAN PENSION PLANS
The Company operates a post-retirement healthcare benefits plan. The costs of providing these benefits are not funded. The level
of the accrued plan benefits provision is based on independent actuarial valuations, using the projected unit method. The last
full actuarial valuation of the plan, which was performed by an independent qualified actuary, was carried out at 31 December
2007, at which date the accrued plan benefits were £1.3m (2006: £3.8m; 2005: £4.9m; 2004: £4.2m; 2003: £4.5m). During the
year changes were made to the post-retirement healthcare plan which resulted in a reduction of the costs borne by the Company
in order to meet its liabilities under the plan. As a result of these changes a curtailment credit arose of £1.0m, reducing the plan
benefits accrual.

19. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group,
the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats
the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make
a payment under the guarantee. Guarantees provided by the Company as at 31 December 2007 in respect of the liabilities of its
subsidiary companies amounted to £39.7m (31 December 2006: £34.8m) and guarantees under property leases of discontinued
operations amounted to £3.2m (31 December 2006: £2.6m).
In addition, on behalf of its subsidiaries the Company has given guarantees to precious metals consignors amounting to
£344.1m (2006: £235.6m), representing all of the value of precious metals held by its subsidiaries on consignment terms as at
31 December 2007. Further details of these consignment arrangements are given in note 27 to the consolidated financial
statements.
Cookson has extensive international operations and several of its subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of
which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the company involved. While the outcome of litigation
can never be predicted with certainty, having regard to legal advice received and the insurance arrangements of the Company
and its subsidiaries, the Directors believe that none of these matters will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a materially
adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. FIVE YEAR SUMMARY

Ceramics
Enclosed continuous casting
Method of pouring steel directly from its molten form into a slab,
bloom or billets and thereby short-cutting secondary processing
with associated cost savings. During the process, steel is poured
from a ladle into a tundish on top of the continuous caster. As it
flows from the tundish down into the caster’s mould, it solidifies
into a ribbon of red-hot steel. At the bottom of the caster, torches
cut the continuously-flowing steel to form slabs, bloom or billets.
Float glass process
Production method to produce flat glass for building, automotive
and specialty products. Glass is melted in a separate tank and
flat glass is formed when molten glass is poured from the tank on
to a bath of molten tin. The glass then “floats” on the tin.
Following this, the glass sheet is progressively cooled in the
annealing lehr (which is a type of oven used to anneal glass) and
then on fused silica rollers, as produced by Cookson.
Glass tempering process
Flat glass is transformed into toughened or tempered glass by
being heated and then rapidly cooled. This creates a surface
tension in the glass. Tempered glass is six times stronger than
ordinary glass. When toughened glass is broken the tension is
released, which causes the glass to shatter into less-harmful tiny
fragments. For this reason, toughened glass is specified for many
applications where safety is an issue, including automotive and
architectural applications. The glass is carried on fused silica
rollers, as produced by Cookson, during its manufacture.
Monolithics
Refractory mixes in the form of castables, plastics and sprayed
refractories used principally as a protective lining for ladles and
tundishes. Join-free application reduces heat loss, gas
permeability and thermal stress forces.
Refractory products – linings
Products which provide a heat protection in devices such as
steelmaking vessels, furnaces, kilns and ovens, allowing them to
operate at extremely high temperatures without damaging their
outer shell. They also protect the devices against damage caused
by abrasion, pressure, chemical attack and rapid changes in
temperature, as well as facilitating heat retention to allow the unit
to operate more efficiently without major heat loss.
Slide-gate refractories
Flow control refractories are used as valves between steelmaking
vessels to control the flow of molten metal as it runs through the
continuous casting process. These products have to withstand
extremely high temperatures and are consumables, sometimes
used up in a matter of hours. Cookson is the world leader in the
production of flow control products for the steel industry and
supplies major steel mills worldwide.
Solar Crucible™
A Solar Crucible™ is a large fused silica ceramic crucible used for
the melting and crystallisation of photovoltaic silicon. Silicon ingots
manufactured in these crucibles are then cut into blocks; blocks are
sliced into wafers; and then wafers are used to make solar cells.
VISO™
Brand name for isostatically-pressed alumina-carbon products
manufactured by the Ceramics division to control and protect the
flow of molten metal from re-oxidation in the enclosed
continuous casting steelmaking process. Includes ladle shrouds,
stoppers, subentry nozzles and tube changers. VISO™ is a steel
flow control refractory.
Electronics
SACX™
Brand name for proprietary low-silver content, lead-free solder.
Damascene copper
Chemicals used to create nanoscale copper connections within
semi-conductor wafers.
Epoxy moulding compounds
A solid polymer that is heated to a liquid and injected over or
under a PCB component for protection.
Printed circuit board (“PCB”)
A type of circuit board which has conducting tracks superimposed
or ‘printed’ on one or both sides. May refer to a board either
before or after the assembly process.
PCB assembly
PCB assembly involves attaching components such as semi-
conductors and capacitors on to a fabricated board, together with
the required physical and electrical connections. This has to be
done with precise accuracy if the finished PCB is to function
effectively.
Semi-conductor wafer
A semi-conductor wafer is a thin slice of semi-conducting
material, upon which microcircuits are constructed by doping,
chemical etching, and deposition of various materials.
Solder
An alloy of tin and other metals with a comparatively low melting
point, used to join less fusible metals.
Underfill
An adhesive that mechanically couples an electronic component-
such as a chip-to a PCB to restrain most of the lateral movement
between the component and the board. The interconnect joints
are therefore protected and preserved.
Precious Metals
Findings
Jewellery components such as pins, clasps, posts and clips.

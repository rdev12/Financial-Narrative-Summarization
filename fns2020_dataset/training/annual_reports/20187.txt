OUR OBJECTIVES
5 YEAR HISTORY
Market leadership
We aim to develop our position as the leading direct marketer of promotional 
products in the markets in which we operate.
Organic revenue growth
Our primary financial objective is to maximise organic revenue growth whilst 
maintaining a broadly stable operating margin percentage. 4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 04
Chairman’s Statement
2015 was another excellent year for 4imprint. Revenues were $497.2m, an increase of 20% 
over the prior period. The effect of a 53rd week in the financial period contributed to the 
revenue increase, but only to a small degree. Underlying profit before tax, at $33.5m, also 
rose by 20%.
Orders from new customers increased 18%. Customer retention remains strong, with more 
than 65% of revenue coming from customers who had ordered previously.
Two major infrastructure projects were completed in 2015. The Oshkosh distribution centre, 
from which the Blue Box™ sample programme and the embroidery operation are 
managed, was more than doubled in size. There was also a substantial expansion in 
customer service capacity at the main office location. Both projects were completed to 
budget, on time and without operational disruption. The capital expenditure commitment, 
at $9m, was significant but the expanded facilities are expected to accommodate the 
Group’s growth over the next five years.
At the year end net cash was $18.4m, which in light of the investment in facilities, 
highlights the cash generative nature of the business model. 
The Board was further strengthened by the appointment in June 2015 of Charles Brady and 
the recent appointment of Paul Moody as Non-Executive Directors.
The business proposition 
remains strong and the 
opportunity substantial.
In respect of the legacy defined benefit 
pension scheme, agreement has been 
reached with the Trustee to convert the 
previous buy-in arrangements to a buy-out, 
which will substantially reduce the size of 
the remaining scheme and result in lower 
deficit reduction contributions going 
forward. A one-off contribution of £10m 
will be paid into the scheme, as a result of 
which the remaining net deficit, relating 
primarily to deferred members, is expected 
to be reduced by around half from its 
current level of just over $23m.
The Board is recommending a final dividend 
of 26.80c, an increase of 22%. Going 
forward, the reduced contributions to the 
pension scheme and the low underlying 
capital requirements of the business will 
provide scope for further increases in returns 
to Shareholders.
The business proposition remains strong and 
the opportunity substantial. Our strategic 
objective continues to be the maximisation 
of organic growth while delivering broadly 
constant operating margins coupled with 
high cash conversion. 2016 has started 
satisfactorily.

4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 07
The 2015 results represent another successful year in the delivery of 
our strategy to maximise organic revenue growth at a broadly 
stable operating margin percentage. 
Group revenue increased by 20% over 2014. Comprising more than 
96% of Group revenue, the North American business continues to 
be the primary growth engine for the Group. Revenue growth in 
North America remained strong despite being affected by economic 
pressures and adverse currency movements in Canada. Our 
percentage growth rates remain significantly higher than those in 
our industry as a whole, which are estimated to be in the low-to-
mid single digits. The UK operation produced an increase in revenue 
in reporting currency of 7%, but in underlying currency the growth 
rate was 16%, showing excellent progress and further gain in 
market share.
Revenue benefited from 2015 being a 53 week accounting period 
for the Group, compared to the usual 52 weeks. This “extra” week 
contributed roughly one percentage point to sales growth over the 
prior period. 
Overall, the Group operating margin percentage for 2015 was 
6.74%, compared to 6.68% in 2014, delivering on our strategy to 
maintain a broadly stable operating margin percentage.
Underlying operating profit in Direct Marketing operations 
increased by 16%, compared to a 20% revenue increase. Several 
factors contributed to this slight margin dilution, the largest being 
the impact on gross profit of adverse US and Canadian dollar 
currency movements. Other factors were the assimilation into the 
cost base of the Oshkosh office and distribution centre expansion 
projects, and the 53 week accounting period which resulted in a 
negative profit effect due to a full week of payroll and overheads 
outweighing the gross margin generated from a quiet week of 
revenue during the holiday season. We do not anticipate that these 
factors, taken together, will result in a permanent diminution in 
operating margin. 
Head office costs reduced by 15% in 2015 compared to prior 
period, reflecting the current structure and activities of the  
central function. 
In total, 945,000 individually customised orders were processed in 
2015, compared to more than 780,000 in the prior period.
More than 220,000 new customers were acquired in the period and 
orders from new customers were up 18% over 2014. Prospect 
marketing remains a key priority and we continue to invest a 
significant part of our marketing budget into testing and developing 
innovative techniques for reaching potential customers.
Orders from existing customers were 21% higher than the prior 
period, demonstrating consistent customer retention patterns. A 
key element in maintaining the productivity and reliability of the 
customer file is our Blue Box™ sample mailing programme. More 
than 1.75 million boxes were sent to customers during 2015 as we 
continue to improve the depth and sophistication of this 
programme.
Following the pattern of recent years, online marketing increased at 
a faster rate than offline marketing. Rapidly evolving online 
techniques and media are a major focus for our marketing teams. 
Offline marketing, however, remains a very effective medium. 
Catalogue circulation was increased by 6% over the prior period.
The overall effectiveness of the marketing effort is expressed in the 
revenue per marketing dollar statistic. This was in line with 
expectations at $5.92 for the period, compared to $6.01 in 2014, as 
we continue our aggressive pursuit of organic revenue growth. 
There were two major infrastructure projects in 2015 at our US base 
in Oshkosh. We made a major expansion at our distribution centre, 
more than doubling the footprint of that facility to accommodate 
volume increases in our sample, Blue Box™ and embroidery 
operations. In addition, around 25,000 sq. ft. of office space was 
added to our main office facility. The total capital cost was $9m and 
both projects were delivered on time, on budget and with no 
operational disruption. 
We continue to expand our product range, including products 
exclusive to 4imprint and an increasing number of items available on 
24 hour turnaround. 
For the eighth year in a row, the North American business was 
named on the prestigious list of the Top 25 Best Medium Sized 
Workplaces in the USA. The UK business maintains its Investors in 
People accreditation. Our workplace culture is fundamental in 
sustaining the remarkable customer service that marks us out from 
our competition.
The infrastructure investments and operational improvements made 
in 2015 leave us in a strong market position. Moreover, we are very 
proud of our well-trained, dedicated and talented team. As a result, 
we are confident in our ability to achieve further organic growth. 4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 08
MARKET OVERVIEW
Where we do business 
We operate in two primary geographical 
markets:
• North America: The US and Canadian 
promotional products markets together 
are estimated to total around $25bn. 
• UK and Ireland: The UK and Irish 
promotional products market size is 
estimated at around £900m, or $1.3bn.
The promotional products market place is 
fragmented. The largest market, the USA, is 
served by around 23,000 distributors, of 
whom more than 20,500 have annual sales 
of less than $2.5m. The profile is similar in 
the Canadian and UK/Irish markets.
4imprint is the largest direct marketer of 
promotional products in each market and 
has consistently increased market share 
through organic growth at a rate 
significantly ahead of the overall growth 
rate in the industry.
What we sell
We sell an extensive range of promotional 
products – merchandise custom printed 
with the logo or name of an organisation 
with the intention of promoting a brand, 
service, product or event.
Our product range comprises tens of 
thousands of individual products, ranging 
from basic giveaways such as pens, bags 
and drinkware to higher value items such as 
embroidered apparel, business gifts and full 
size trade show displays. Merchandising 
specialists work closely with suppliers, 
continually updating the product range and 
developing new products or lines, many of 
which are exclusive to 4imprint.

The top ten current product categories are:
Our customers
Promotional products are purchased by a 
wide range of individuals within all types 
and sizes of businesses and organisations. 
The products have many uses: as an integral 
part of sales and marketing activities; for 
recruitment or recognition initiatives; to 
promote health and safety programmes; 
and for any other method of making a 
connection between the customer’s 
organisation and the recipient of the item.
We define our customer as the individual 
placing the order, rather than the business 
or organisation for which the individual 
works or with which he/she is associated. 
As such, our customers can be found across 
the different areas of geography, industry 
categories, size of business/organisation, 
and charitable, religious or governmental 
institutions.
No single customer comprises a material

Operating result
Group revenue in 2015 was $497.22m, (2014: $415.77m), an 
increase of 20% over the prior period. Underlying operating profit 
before tax was $33.55m, (2014: $27.86m), up 20% over the 2014 
comparative.
2015 was a 53 week accounting period for the Group, compared to 
the usual 52 week period. The effect of this extra week on Group 
revenue was an increase of around $4m, contributing roughly one 
percentage point of the 20 percentage points of revenue growth 
over 2014. The effect of the additional week on underlying 
operating profit was negative due to a full week of payroll and 
overheads outweighing the gross margin arising from a quiet week 
of revenue during the holiday season.
Foreign exchange
The US dollar exchange rates material to the Group’s 2015 results 
were as follows:
2015 2014
Period end Average Period end Average
Sterling 1.48 1.53 1.56 1.65
Canadian dollars 0.72 0.78 0.86 0.91
Share option charges
The Group charged $0.30m, (2014: $0.67m), in respect of IFRS2, 
“Share-based payments”. This charge was made up of elements 
from a UK SAYE scheme, the Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) which 
was approved by Shareholders on 27 April 2011, and the 2015 
Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) which was approved at the 2015 AGM. 
The decreased charge in the period compared to 2014 is due to 
1.4 million PSP share options vesting in April 2014, the vesting of a 
US SAYE scheme, and only a partial period’s charge in respect of 
the Plan. 
Current options outstanding are 120,000 shares under the PSP, and 
36,464 shares under the UK SAYE scheme. 26,128 share options are 
expected to be awarded under the Plan following the announcement 
of these results.
Exceptional items
A total of $0.86m (2014: $2.41m) was charged to exceptional items 
in the period, $0.61m of which represents costs incurred and paid 
by the pension scheme. All of the charge was in respect of pension 
risk reduction exercises. $0.28m of costs were incurred as a result of 
the Flexible Retirement Option (“FRO”) offered to deferred 
pensioners in the second half of 2015. A further $0.58m of costs 
related to the ongoing project to progress the pensioner buy-in, 
completed in September 2014, to buy-out status.
Net finance income
Net finance income for the period was $0.03m (2014: $0.10m), 
reflecting the modest rates available on the investment of cash 
balances in short term deposits.
Taxation
The tax charge for the period was $8.46m (2014: $6.98m), 
producing an effective tax rate of 27% (2014: 30%). The charge 
comprised current tax of $8.03m, representing tax payable in the 
USA and a deferred tax charge of $0.43m. The change in rate 
between periods was driven by several factors, but was principally 
due to the deduction of pension-related items.
The tax charge relating to underlying profit before tax was $8.96m 
(2014: $7.74m), an effective tax rate of 27% (2014: 28%).
The effective tax rates are higher than UK corporate tax rates due to 
the Group’s profits being generated principally in the USA attracting 
that country’s higher rates of corporate tax.
Earnings per share
Underlying basic earnings per share from continuing operations was 
88.04c (2014: 73.48c), an increase of 20%. This increase mirrors 
the 20% increase in underlying profit before tax, after accounting 
for a lower rate of tax offset by a slightly higher weighted average 
number of shares in issue.
Basic earnings per share was 81.26c (2014: 59.73c), an increase of 
36%. This reflects reduced share option charges, defined benefit 
pension charges and exceptional charges in the period, as well as a 
lower overall tax charge, all compared to prior period.
Dividends
Dividends are determined in US dollars and paid in Sterling at the 
exchange rate on the date that the dividend is determined.
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 26.80c (2014: 21.90c) 
which, together with the interim dividend of 12.09c, gives a total 
paid and proposed dividend relating to 2015 of 38.89c, an increase 
of 20% compared to prior period.
In Sterling, the final dividend paid to Shareholders will be 18.82p 
(2014: 14.25p), which, combined with the interim dividend paid of 
7.75p, gives a total dividend for the period of 26.57p, an increase of 
30% compared to prior period. 4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 14

Cash flow
The Group had net cash of $18.38m at 2 January 2016, an increase 
of $0.08m over the 27 December 2014 balance of $18.30m.
Cash flow in the period is summarised as follows:
2015 
$m
2014 
$m
Underlying operating profit 33.52 27.76
Depreciation and amortisation 1.96 1.70
Change in working capital (4.46) 0.21
Capital expenditure (11.02) (2.09)
Operating cash flow 20.00 27.58
Tax and interest (8.70) (6.07)
Defined benefit pension contributions (0.83) (26.54)
Own share transactions – (1.32)
Exceptional items (0.31) (0.89)
National Insurance on share options 
exercised – (1.36)
Exchange (0.48) (0.67)
Free cash flow 9.68 (9.27)
Discontinued operations net cash inflow – 9.50
Dividends to Shareholders (9.60) (7.92)
Net cash inflow/(outflow) in the period 0.08 (7.69)
The 2015 results again demonstrate the cash generative capabilities 
of the Direct Marketing business model. 
The underlying operating profit to operating cash conversion rate 
was 60% (2014: 99%). This reflects an unusually high level of 
capital expenditure in the period associated with the Oshkosh 
expansion projects. Adding back the $9m spent on these projects, 
the cash conversion rate rises to 87%. The $4.46m net outflow of 
working capital in the period is higher than usual, arising as a result 
of some timing effects due to the 53 week accounting period and 
some natural build in supplier volume rebate receivable balances at 
the period end. 
Free cash flow was $9.68m, after the $9m of expansion project 
capital expenditure.
Defined benefit pension scheme
The Group sponsors a legacy defined benefit pension scheme 
which has been closed to new members and future accruals for 
several years. The Scheme has around 1,100 pensioners, of whom 
84% have insured benefits, and around 500 deferred pensioners.
At 2 January 2016, the deficit of the Scheme on an IAS 19 basis was 
$23.11m, compared to $24.02m at 27 December 2014.
The change in deficit is analysed as follows:
$m
IAS 19 deficit at 27 December 2014 (24.02)
Company contributions to the Scheme 0.83
Pension administration costs (0.39)
Pension costs – exceptional (0.61)
Pension finance charge (0.84)
Remeasurement gains due to changes in assumptions 0.77
Exchange gains 1.15
IAS 19 deficit at 2 January 2016 (23.11)
At 2 January 2016 gross Scheme liabilities under IAS 19 were 
$139.25m and assets were $116.14m. However, pensioner liabilities 
of $108.41m were insured via annuities as a result of previous risk 
reduction exercises, resulting in uninsured liabilities of $30.84m and 
non-insurance Scheme assets of $7.73m. 78% of Scheme liabilities 
are insured.
The Group is engaged in further pension scheme risk reduction 
exercises. Having completed significant buy-in (insurance of liabilities 
for pensions in payment) arrangements in prior years, it is intended to 
proceed to buy-out status, whereby the underwritten liabilities and 
equivalent assets are removed entirely from the Group balance sheet 
and converted to individual annuities held with the insurer. This is a 
complex and detailed exercise which takes into account many factors 
including guaranteed minimum pension equalisation. In consideration 
of the buy-out exercise, the Group has agreed to a one-off deficit 
adjustment contribution of £10m, to be paid in the first half of 2016 
and a new schedule of deficit recovery contributions going forward 
will be agreed with the Trustee. 
Deferred pensioner liabilities were addressed during the second half 
of 2015 through a FRO exercise. Take up of the offer was relatively 
modest, resulting in $0.55m of liabilities being transferred out of 
the Scheme, however the FRO mechanism has now been 
embedded in the Scheme for future years as more deferred 
pensioners reach the eligibility age of 55.
It is anticipated that as a result of these risk reduction actions, and 
subject to changes in actuarial assumptions, the net deficit is 
expected to be reduced to around half of its current size. Overview Governance

Balance sheet and Shareholders’ funds
Net assets at 2 January 2016 were $28.45m, compared to $14.07m 
at 27 December 2014. The balance sheet is summarised as follows:

The balance sheet movements in respect of non current assets and 
working capital are discussed in the cash flow section on page 14.
Shareholders’ funds increased by $14.38m, comprised of net profit 
in the period of $22.69m, $0.61m of net pension remeasurement 
gains, $0.50m of share option related movements and $0.41m of 
exchange gains, net of a charge of $0.23m for the effect of 
changes in the UK tax rate and $9.60m equity dividends paid to 
Shareholders.
Treasury policy
The financial requirements of the Group are managed through a 
centralised treasury policy. The Group operates cash pooling 
arrangements for its North American operations. Forward contracts 
are taken out to buy or sell currency relating to specific receivables 
and payables as well as remittances from overseas subsidiaries. The 
Group holds the majority of its cash on deposit with its principal UK 
banker and the working capital requirements of the North 
American business are funded by a facility with its principal US 
banker.
The Group has $13.0m of working capital facilities with its principal 
US bank, JPMorgan Chase. The interest rate is US dollar LIBOR plus 
1.5%, and the facilities expire on 31 August 2017. In addition, an 
overdraft facility of £1m, with an interest rate of bank base rate plus 
2.0%, is available from the Group’s principal UK bank, Lloyds.
Critical accounting policies
Critical accounting policies are those that require significant 
judgements or estimates and potentially result in materially different 
results under different assumptions or conditions. It is considered 
that the only critical accounting policy is in respect of pensions.
Going concern
The Board reviews several factors when considering whether the 
financial statements should be prepared on a going concern basis:
• The Group’s business activities, together with management’s 
current view of circumstances likely to affect its future 
development, performance and financial position, (summarised in 
the Strategic Report on pages 6 to 19).
• The Group’s principal risks and uncertainties, as set out on pages 
17 to 19.
• The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, net cash 
position, borrowing facilities and policies for managing financial 
risk, which are described in the Financial Review on pages 12 to 16.
As a result of this review, the Board has a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources to continue to operate for a 
period of at least twelve months from the date this report was 
approved. Accordingly, the Board continues to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Long term prospects and viability
In accordance with Provision C.2.2 of the 2014 UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Board has assessed the prospects and 
viability of the Group.
Assessment of prospects 
The Group’s market position, strategy and business model, as set 
out on pages 8 to 10 of the Strategic Report, are central to an 
understanding of its prospects. These factors provide a framework 
for the rolling three year plan which is developed as part of the 
annual budget process and reviewed by the Board to assess the 
Group’s prospects. Established and reliable demand forecasting 
models are driven by customer acquisition and retention 
assumptions, which are flexed to account for known initiatives and 
anticipated market developments over the three year forecast 
period. 
The three year timeframe for assessing both prospects and viability 
is considered to be appropriate due to the following factors:
• It is consistent with the Group’s rolling three year strategic 
planning process.
• It reflects reasonable expectations in terms of the reliability and 
accuracy of operational forecasting models.
• It acknowledges that the Group’s business model does not rely 
heavily on fixed capital, long-term contracts or fixed external 
financing arrangements. 
• It recognises that projections looking out further than three years 
become significantly less meaningful in the context of the 
fast-moving nature of the business and its markets. 4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 16

Financial Review

Confirmation of viability
The Board’s assessment of the Group’s prospects, as described 
above, has been made with reference to current market conditions 
and known risk factors. The principal risks and uncertainties facing 
the Group are outlined on pages 17 to 19. In the light of the 
Group’s financial performance over recent years, the Board 
considers that the key factor which would prejudice the delivery of 
the Group’s stated financial objectives is a significant decline in 
demand, leading to lower or negative revenue growth and a lower 
return on marketing spend. Using the current three year rolling 
forecasts as a base case, alternative forecasts have been produced 
to model the effects on the Group’s liquidity and solvency of very 
severe but plausible combinations of the principal risks and 
uncertainties affecting demand levels in the business. 
The basis for the key assumptions used in the viability model was an 
overall effect similar to, but more severe than, actual experience 
during the 2008/9 financial crisis. New customer acquisition and 
existing customer retention metrics were significantly degraded in 
the model, but expenditure in the areas of marketing, payroll and 
technology were held steady. Revenue and profitability are clearly 
affected in this scenario, but the business remains cash generative, 
with the Group able to maintain its external dividend payments at 
current rates. 
The assumptions used in the viability model and the resultant 
sensitised financial forecasts have been reviewed and approved by 
the Board. The conclusion of this review is that the Group has 
significant financial flexibility, starting with a net cash position, but 
remaining cash generative even under severe economic stress and 
able to continue investing in marketing, people and technology, 
which are the key differentiators in its strategy. 
Based on this review of the Group’s prospects and viability, the 
Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will continue to operate and to meet its liabilities, as they fall 
due, for the next three years. Overview Governance

Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Risks
4imprint seeks to take a balanced approach 
to the risks and uncertainties which it faces. 
There is an appetite for risk-taking that 
contributes to both the operational agility 
and innovative culture which 4imprint 
believes is necessary to meet its strategic 
objectives. That appetite is, however, 
tempered by risk identification, evaluation 
and management.
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the 
Group’s risk management process, although 
responsibility for reviewing specific risk 
controls may be delegated to the Audit 
Committee. The Executive Directors and 
operational management teams are 
responsible for the identification and 
evaluation of risks and the subsequent 
implementation of specific risk mitigation 
activities. It is important to note that 
business operations are conducted from 
centralised facilities in each territory, with 
short reporting lines. Consequently, the 
Executive Directors are close to day-to-day 
matters, facilitating early identification of, 
and response to, evolving risks. 
Risk appetite, the risk management process, 
and associated mitigating activities are all 
essential elements of the Group’s strategic 
and operational planning processes. 
4imprint’s business model means that it may 
be affected by a number of risks, not all of 
which are within its control. Outlined on the 
following pages are the current principal 
potential risks and uncertainties to the 
successful delivery of the Group’s strategic 
goals. The list is not exhaustive and other, as 
yet unidentified, factors may have an 
adverse effect. 
Risk Potential impact Mitigating activities
Economic and market risks
Macroeconomic conditions 
The business conducts most of its business 
operations in North America and would be 
affected by a downturn in general economic 
conditions in this region. The promotional 
products market would likely soften in line 
with the general economy.
• Customer acquisition and retention 
metrics could fall.
• The growth and profitability levels called 
for in the Group strategic plan may not be 
achieved.
• Cash generation could be reduced 
broadly corresponding to a reduction in 
profitability.
• Management monitors economic and 
market conditions to ensure that 
appropriate and timely adjustments are 
made to marketing and other budgets.
• The customer proposition in terms of 
promotions, price, value and quality of 
product can be adjusted to resonate with 
the prevailing economic climate.
Competition 
The promotional products markets in which 
the business operates are intensely 
competitive and the rapid development of 
internet commerce, digital marketing and 
technological innovation may allow 
competitors to reach a broader audience. In 
addition, new or disruptive business models 
may be developed by existing competitors 
or new entrants.
• Aggressive competitive activity could 
result in pressure on prices, margin 
erosion and loss of market share. All of 
these factors could impair the growth of 
the business and therefore impact the 
financial results.
• The Group’s strategy based on achieving 
organic growth in fragmented markets 
may need to be re-assessed.
• An open-minded culture and an appetite 
for technology are encouraged, with the 
aim of positioning the business at the 
forefront of innovation in the industry.
• Management proactively monitors 
competitive activity in the marketplace. 
• Price, satisfaction and service level 
guarantees are an integral part of the 
customer proposition. Customer surveys 
and market research are used to gauge 
customer satisfaction and perception. The 
causes of any negative indications are 
investigated and addressed rapidly.
Currency exchange 
There is some exposure to currency 
exchange risk. Although the business trades 
predominantly in US dollars, it also transacts 
business in Canadian dollars, Sterling and 
Euros, leading to some currency risk on 
trading. In addition, head office costs, 
pension scheme commitments and dividend 
payments are payable in Sterling, 
consequently the business may be adversely 
impacted by movements in the Sterling/US 
dollar exchange rate when it repatriates cash 
to the UK.
• The financial results of operations, and 
therefore overall profitability, may be 
negatively affected.
• The financial condition and cash position 
of the Group may differ materially from 
expectations. In particular, the Group’s 
strategic objective of delivering 
progressive dividend increases could be 
disrupted.
• The Group reports its results in US dollars, 
minimising currency impact on reported 
revenue, operating profit and net assets 
since trading operations are concentrated 
largely in North America.
• The business actively hedges anticipated 
cash receipts from its overseas operations 
over a rolling twelve month timeframe, 
giving some certainty of amounts 
receivable in Sterling. 4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 18
Strategic Report
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
continued
Risk Potential impact Mitigating activities
Operational risks 
Business facility disruption
The business model means that operations 
are concentrated in centralised office and 
distribution facilities. The performance of 
the business could be adversely affected if 
activities at one of these facilities were to be 
disrupted, for example, by fire, flood, loss of 
power or telecommunication failure.
• The inability to service customer orders 
over any extended period would result in 
significant revenue loss, deterioration of 
customer acquisition and retention 
metrics and diminished return on 
marketing investment.
• Data is backed up immediately to off-site 
servers.
• Back-up and business continuity 
procedures are in place and regularly 
tested to ensure that customer service 
disruption is minimised. 
Disruption to delivery service or the 
product supply chain 
As a consequence of the Group’s drop-ship 
distribution model, trading operations could 
be interrupted if the activities of a key 
supplier were disrupted and it was not 
possible to source an alternative supplier in 
the short term.
• Inability to fulfil customer orders would 
lead to lost revenue and a negative 
impact on customer acquisition and 
retention metrics.
• A rigorous selection process is in place for 
key suppliers, with evaluation and 
monitoring of quality, production 
capability and capacity, ethical standards 
and financial stability. 
• Relationships are maintained with suitable 
alternative suppliers for each product 
category. 
Disturbance in established marketing 
techniques
The success of the business relies on its 
ability to attract new and retain existing 
customers through a variety of marketing 
techniques. These methods may become 
less effective as follows:
Offline: The flow of print catalogues and 
sample packages would be disrupted by the 
incapacity of the US Postal Service to make 
deliveries, for example due to natural 
disasters or labour activism.
Online: Search engines are an important 
source for channelling customer activity to 
4imprint’s websites. The efficiency of search 
engine marketing would be adversely 
affected if the search engines were to 
modify their algorithms or otherwise make 
substantial changes to their practices or 
pricing.
• If sustained over anything more than a 
short time period, an externally-driven 
decrease in the effectiveness of key 
marketing techniques would cause 
damage to the customer file as acquisition 
and retention metrics fall. This would 
affect order flow and revenue in the short 
term and the productivity of the customer 
file over a longer period, impacting 
growth prospects. 
• Offline: Developments in the US Postal 
Service are closely monitored through 
industry associations and lobbying 
groups. Alternative parcel carriers are 
continuously evaluated. 
• Online: Management stays very close to 
new developments and emerging 
technologies in the online space. Efforts 
are focused on anticipating changes and 
ensuring compliance with both the 
requirements of providers and applicable 
laws.
Reliance on key personnel
Performance depends on the business’s 
ability to continue to attract, motivate and 
retain key staff. These individuals possess 
sales and marketing, merchandising, supply 
chain, IT and financial skills that are key to 
the continued successful operation of the 
business. 
• The loss of key employees or inability to 
attract appropriate talent could adversely 
affect the Group’s ability to meet its 
strategic objectives, with a consequent 
negative impact on future results.
• The business is proactive in aiming to 
deliver a first class working environment. 
In addition, attractive employment terms 
and incentive plans are designed with a 
view to attracting and retaining key 
personnel. Overview Governance

Risk Potential impact Mitigating activities
Technological risks
Failure or interruption of IT systems and 
infrastructure 
The business is highly dependent on the 
efficient functioning of its IT infrastructure. 
An interruption or degradation of services at 
a central office facility would affect critical 
order processing systems and thereby 
compromise the ability of the business to 
deliver on its customer service proposition. 
• In the short term, orders would be lost 
and delivery deadlines missed, decreasing 
the efficiency of marketing investment 
and impacting customer acquisition and 
retention. Depending on the severity of 
the incident, longer term reputational 
damage could result. 
• Revenue and profitability are directly 
related to order flow and would be 
adversely affected as a consequence of a 
major IT failure.
• There is significant ongoing investment in 
both the IT team supporting the business 
and the hardware and software system 
requirements for a stable and secure 
operating platform. 
• Back-up and recovery processes are in 
place to minimise the impact of 
information technology interruption, 
including real-time replication of data at 
an alternative site.
Failure to adapt to new  
technological innovations 
The operating platforms of the business may 
not be able to respond and adapt to rapid 
changes in technology. If the development 
of websites and customer-facing 
applications for alternative devices and 
platforms is slow or ineffective the business 
could lose competitive edge. In addition, the 
development of order processing, supplier-
facing and data analytics technologies could 
fail to deliver the improvements in speed, 
ease and efficiency necessary to attract and 
retain a productive customer base.
• If the business fails to adapt to new 
technologies and therefore falls behind in 
the marketplace it may fail to capture the 
significant number of new customers  
and retain existing customers at the rate 
required to deliver the growth rates 
envisaged in the Group’s strategic plan.
• Management has a keen awareness of 
the need to keep pace with the rapidly 
changing and continuously evolving 
technological landscape.
• An appetite for technological innovation 
is encouraged in the business. Sustained 
investment is made in the development of 
both outward-facing and back office 
systems.
Security of customer data 
Unauthorised access to and 
misappropriation of customer data could 
lead to reputational damage and loss of 
customer confidence.
• A significant security breach could lead to 
litigation and losses, with a costly 
rectification process. In addition, it might 
be damaging to the Group’s reputation 
and brand.
• An event of this nature might result in 
significant expense, impacting the 
Group’s ability to meet its EPS targets.
• The business employs IT staff who are 
appropriately trained to mitigate IT 
security violations.
• Technical and physical controls are in 
place to mitigate unauthorised access to 
customer data and there is an ongoing 
investment process in place to maintain 
and enhance the integrity and efficiency 
of the IT infrastructure and its security.

purpose of which is to ensure, as far as reasonably practicable, 
that when undertaking its business, the Group operates in 
accordance with best practice.
The policy addresses such issues as working hours, discrimination, 
collective bargaining, supplier audits and child labour. The policy 
is regularly reviewed and was reconsidered and approved by the 
Board at its meeting on 9 December 2015.
Environment
The Board recognises its obligations to protect the environment 
and is committed both to achieving required environmental 
standards across all the activities of the Group and to minimising 
its environmental impact. Formal systems in place are subject to 
audits and management is regularly notified of key issues and 
developments. The Group’s business assesses and monitors the 
potential impact of its operations on the environment and steps 
are taken to control energy consumption and waste and to ensure 
that paper used for marketing purposes is sourced from 
sustainable forests.
Disabled persons
The Group is committed to the principle of equal opportunity in 
employment. No applicant or employee receives less favourable 
treatment on the grounds of nationality, age, gender, religion, 
race, ethnicity or disability. The Group recognises its 
responsibilities to disabled persons and endeavours to assist them 
to make their full contribution at work. Where employees become 
disabled, every practical effort is made to allow them to continue 
in their jobs or to provide retraining in suitable alternative work.
Health and safety
During 2015, the Group continued to pursue improvements to the 
management of health and safety in its business. Regular reports 
on health and safety are received and reviewed by the Board. Any 
accidents and incidents are reported to the Board together with 
corrective actions which have been implemented. There were no 
accidents or incidents during the period.
Directors
The names and biographical details of the present Directors, their 
committee memberships, independence status and identification 
of the Senior Independent Director are given on pages 20 and 21. 
Ms G. Davies resigned on 31 March 2015 and Mr. S. J. Gray 
resigned on 30 September 2015.
The interests of the Directors in the shares of the Company are 
shown on page 40.
Neither the Directors, nor their associated companies, nor any 
members of their families, had any interest either during or at the 
end of the period in any contract with the Company or its 
subsidiaries requiring disclosure under Sections 197, 198, 200, 
201 and 203 of the Companies Act 2006.
Diversity
The Group recognises the importance and benefit of ensuring 
diversity throughout the business and strives to create a culture 
which recruits and promotes the development of all employees 
regardless of background or gender. The Group employs over 
eight hundred people, seventy five per cent of whom are female. 
One third of the North American senior management team and 
two thirds of the UK senior team are female.
As at 2 January 2016, the Board had no female members and one 
member of six (16%) is a non-UK national.
Employees
Our strategy statement clearly identifies investment in our 
people as a key driver of competitive advantage and as such 
the contribution of every team member is essential to our success. 
We are committed to a culture which encourages the training, 
development, wellbeing and participation of every team member. Overview Governance

During 2015 the Group has complied with the provisions of The 
UK Corporate Governance Code (2014) (the “Code”), except for 
the following matter:
There was no Group Chief Executive Officer until 31 March 2015. 
Until that date the role was undertaken by the Executive 
Chairman, Mr. J.W. Poulter (Principle A.2.1). Mr. J.W. Poulter 
relinquished his executive responsibilities on 30 September 2015 
when he became Non-Executive Chairman.
The Code is publicly available on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website, www.frc.org.uk.
The Board
The Board is responsible to Shareholders for creating and 
sustaining Shareholder value through the management of the 
Group’s business. It is also responsible for ensuring that 
management maintains a system of control that provides 
assurance of effective and efficient operations, internal financial 
control and compliance with laws and regulations.
The Board is the decision making body for all matters material to 
the Group’s finances, strategy and reputation.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for its 
decision and the schedule was re-considered and approved by the 
Board at its meeting on 9 December 2015. The schedule includes, 
for example, the approval of interim and annual financial 
statements, the acquisition and disposal of businesses, changes to 
the capital structure of the Company, the appointment or removal 
of Directors and the financing of the Group’s businesses. 
Otherwise, the Board delegates day-to-day management of the 
Group to the Executive Directors.
Throughout the period and in accordance with provision C.2.1 of 
the Code, the Board has carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group, including those 
that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity. This is fully described in the risks section on 
pages 17 to 19.
The Board has assessed the future prospects of the Group in 
accordance with provision C.2.2 of the Code. Based on the results 
of this analysis, the Board has a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the three year period of their assessment. 
Details of the assessment performed by the Board, including an 
assessment of those risks most likely to impact the Group’s future 
prospects and viability have been set out on pages 15 and 16.
In any circumstances where a Director has a concern, which 
cannot be resolved, about the running of the Company or a 
proposed action, any such concern is recorded in the minutes of 
Board meetings.
The Companies Act 2006 codifies the duty of the Directors to 
avoid a situation in which they have, or could have, an interest 
that conflicts or may possibly conflict, with the interests of the 
Company. A Director will not be in breach of that duty if the 
relevant matter has been authorised in accordance with the 
Articles of Association, by the other Directors. Each Director has 
confirmed that they are aware of the need to notify the Company 
of any potential conflict of interest. Mr. A.J. Scull has notified the 
Company that he is a Director and Company Secretary of the 
4imprint Pension Trustee Company Limited and, with effect from 
its incorporation on 15 December 2015, a Director and Company 
Secretary of 4imprint 2016 Pension Trustee Company Limited, 
the former of which administers the legacy defined benefit 
pension scheme.
Specific responsibilities have been delegated to Board Committees 
which have access to independent expert advice at the Group’s 
expense. The details of the Board Committees and their activities 
are set out in pages 28 to 40.
The Non-Executive Directors meet from time to time, without the 
Executive Directors being present.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary.
At the period end the Board consisted of the Chairman, the 
Group Chief Executive Officer, the Group Chief Financial Officer, 
the Corporate Services Director and two Independent Non-
Executive Directors. The role of the Non-Executive Directors 
includes assisting in the development of strategy, scrutinising the 
performance of management, monitoring the integrity of financial 
information and systems of risk management as well as 
determining the appointment, removal and remuneration of 
Executive Directors.
Key activities of the Board in the current period included:
• monitoring the expansion of the Group’s distribution facilities in 
North America;
• monitoring the expansion of the Group’s customer service 
operations facilities in North America;
• continued discussions with the Pension Scheme Trustee as part 
of the planned buy-out scheduled to be completed in 2016, 
with agreements in principle now having been reached with 
the Trustee;
• designing and implementing the Group’s Flexible Retirement 
Option (“FRO”);
• designing and implementing the 2015 Incentive Plan following 
approval by Shareholders at the 2015 AGM;
• putting into effect the changes to the structure of the Board 
in the light of the continued focus of the business in 
North America; and
• strengthening the Group Board with the appointment of 
Mr. C.J. Brady as Non-Executive Director on 11 June 2015.
Statement on Corporate Governance 4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 26
Governance
On 18 December 2014, the Board announced that it intended to 
make an additional Non-Executive Director appointment in 2015. 
The decision to appoint that person was made by the Board as a 
whole and, with effect from 11 June 2015, Mr. C.J. Brady was 
appointed as a Non-Executive Director for a period of three years.
Mr. S.J. Gray retired from the Board, with effect from 
30 September 2015.
During 2015 and following the Board evaluation process referred 
to below, the Board considered it would be appropriate to have 
an additional Non-Executive Director and has announced, on 
1 February 2016, that Mr. P.S. Moody has been appointed as a 
Non-Executive Director with effect from that date for a period of 
three years. The current Non-Executive Directors have letters of 
appointment for three years from 28 May 2015 for Mr. J.A. 
Warren, 11 June 2015 for Mr. C.J. Brady and 1 February 2016 for 
Mr. P.S. Moody, which are available for inspection by any person 
at the Company’s registered office during normal business hours 
and also at the AGM.
The Corporate Services Director also acts as the Company 
Secretary. This situation has been re-considered by the Board at 
its meeting on 9 December 2015 and approved by the Board. The 
Corporate Services Director took no part in that decision. The 
appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter 
to be decided by the Board as a whole (excluding the Corporate 
Services Director).
The Board has at least six scheduled meetings per year and 
additional Board meetings are convened as and when required. In 
advance of each meeting, the Board receives minutes of the 
previous meeting, detailed financial information on the 
performance of the business and items for discussion. This 
enables the Directors to make informed decisions on the 
corporate and business issues under consideration. Additionally, 
the Company provides resources as appropriate, to enable 
Directors to update their skills and knowledge. Independent 
professional advice is available to the Directors as required, at the 
Company’s expense.
The Board evaluations and those of its Committees which were 
undertaken in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 were undertaken 
internally through a process conducted by the Non-Executive 
Directors, assisted by the Company Secretary. Given the changes 
to the Board in 2015, no external evaluation was undertaken but 
an evaluation was undertaken internally during 2015, by the 
Company Secretary, at the request of the Chairman. The 
questions asked during the process were based on questions 
outlined in the Code and addressed both the performance of the 
Board and its Committees, as well as the Chairman.
A table setting out the number of Board and Committee 
meetings held during the period and attendance by Directors at 
those meetings is set out below:

The Board has three permanent Committees being the Audit 
Committee, the Nomination Committee and the Remuneration

participants may attend by the invitation of the Committee. Each

responsibilities and powers as described in this report.

The Company has received no notifications of changes in holdings

The Board places a high value on its relations with its investors 
and consults with Shareholders in connection with specific issues 
where it considers it appropriate.
The Group, principally through the Chairman, the Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has regular dialogue and 
meetings with institutional shareholders, fund managers and 
analysts. Subject always to the constraints regarding sensitive 
information, discussions cover a wide range of issues, including 
strategy, performance, management and governance.
The Board considers it important to understand the views of 
Shareholders, in particular, any issues which concern them. The 
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is available to meet 
major Shareholders, if they so wish.
Restrictions on voting
No member shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting in 
respect of any shares held by that member if any call or other sum 
then payable by that member in respect of that share remains 
unpaid. Currently, all issued shares are fully paid.
Private Shareholders can keep up to date through updates provided 
on the 4imprint corporate website, investors.4imprint.com and 
through the provision of the Annual and Interim Reports and 
Accounts. Shareholders are invited at any time to write to the 
Non-Executive Chairman or any other Director to express their 
views and the AGM provides an opportunity for Shareholders to 
address their questions to the Board in person.

Nomination Committee
I am pleased to present my report to Shareholders as Chairman of 
the Nomination Committee following my appointment to the role 
with effect from 30 September 2015.
Responsibilities of the Nomination Committee
The responsibilities of the Nomination Committee include: 
(i) reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Board and 
making recommendations to the Board with regard to any 
adjustments that are necessary; (ii) identifying and nominating 
candidates for the approval of the Board to fill Board vacancies as 
and when they arise; and (iii) putting in place plans for succession 
at Board level.
The Company supports the Code provision that Boards should 
consider the benefits of diversity, including gender, when making 
appointments and is committed to ensuring diversity, not just at 
Board level, but also across the Company’s senior management, 
not least because it believes that business benefits from the 
widest range of perspectives and backgrounds. The Company’s 
aim as regards the composition of the Board is that it should have 
a balance of experience, skills and knowledge to enable each 
Director and the Board as a whole to discharge their duties 
effectively. Whilst the Company agrees that it is appropriate that 
it should seek to have diversity on its Board, it does not consider 
that this can be best achieved by establishing specific quotas and 
targets and appointments will continue to be made based wholly 
on merit.
The Nomination Committee has terms of reference which were 
re-considered and approved by the Board of the Company at its 
Board meeting on 9 December 2015. These terms of reference are 
available for inspection at the Company’s registered office during 
normal business hours.
Appointment and replacement of Directors
Directors may be appointed by the Company by ordinary 
resolution or by the Board. A Director appointed by the Board 
holds office only until the next AGM and is then eligible for 
election by the Shareholders.
At every AGM of the Company, all Directors put themselves 
forward for re-election. The office of Director shall be vacated if: 
(a) he or she resigns or offers to resign and the Board resolves to 
accept such offer; (b) he or she is, or has been, suffering from 
mental ill health; (c) he or she becomes bankrupt or compounds 
with creditors generally; (d) he or she is prohibited by law from 
being a Director; (e) he or she ceases to be a Director by virtue of 
the provisions of the Companies Act; or (f) he or she is removed 
from office pursuant to the Articles of Association.
Composition of the Nomination Committee
I chair the Nomination Committee and I am an Independent 
Non-Executive Director. The other member of the Committee 
during the period was Mr. J.A. Warren, the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director. The Chairman of the Company is usually 
invited to attend formal meetings of the Committee. The 
Company Secretary may be invited to attend meetings of  
the Nomination Committee, in his capacity as Company  
Secretary. Mr. P. S. Moody became a member of the Committee 
in February 2016.
Meetings of the Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee meets as frequently as is required to 
fulfil its duties. When there are no specific decisions or 
recommendations to be made, the Chairman of the Committee 
consults the other member of the Committee as necessary. 
During the period ended 2 January 2016 there were no meetings 
of the Nomination Committee.
On 18 December 2014 the Board announced that it intended 
to make an additional Non-Executive Director appointment 
during 2015.
A search process was undertaken using an independent 
consultant. Candidates were interviewed by the Chairman and the 
Non-Executive Directors and subsequently the Executive Directors.
The decision to appoint myself was made by the Board as a whole 
and with effect from 11 June 2015, I was appointed as a Non-
Executive Director for a period of three years.

Audit Committee
I am pleased to present my report to Shareholders as Chairman of 
the Audit Committee.
Responsibilities of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is responsible for maintaining an 
appropriate relationship with the Group’s external auditors and 
for reviewing the Group’s internal financial controls and the audit 
process. It aids the Board in seeking to ensure that the financial 
and non-financial information supplied to Shareholders presents a 
fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the Group’s 
performance and position.
The Committee reviews the effectiveness, objectivity and 
independence of the external auditors and also considers the 
scope of their work and fees paid for audit and non-audit 
services.
The Audit Committee has terms of reference which were 
re-considered and approved by the Board at its meeting on 
9 December 2015. These terms of reference are available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered office during normal 
business hours. The Board considers that the Audit Committee 
members have an understanding of the following areas:
• the principles of, and developments in, financial reporting 
including the applicable accounting standards and statements 
of recommended practice;
• key aspects of the Group’s operations including corporate 
policies and the Group’s internal control environment;
• matters which may influence the presentation of the accounts;
• the principles of, and developments in, company law, sector-
specific laws and other relevant corporate legislation;
• the role of internal and external auditing and risk 
management; and
• the regulatory framework for the Group’s businesses.
Composition of the Audit Committee
I chair the Audit Committee and I am the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director. I am a chartered accountant and was 
Group Finance Director of United Biscuits (Holdings) PLC and 
WH Smith PLC. The Board is of the view that I have recent and 
relevant financial knowledge and experience derived from current 
roles as Chairman of the Audit Committee at Bloomsburg 
Publishing Plc, Welsh Water and Greencore Group plc. The other 
member of the Committee during the period was Mr. C.J. Brady, 
an Independent Non-Executive Director. The Chairman of the 
Company and the Chief Financial Officer are normally invited to 
attend meetings of the Audit Committee as is, from time to time, 
the Group Financial Controller. The Company Secretary attends 
meetings of the Audit Committee in his capacity as Company 
Secretary. Mr. P. S. Moody became a member of the Committee 
in February 2016.
How the Audit Committee discharges its 
responsibilities
The Committee has unrestricted access to Company documents 
and information, as well as to employees of the Company and the 
external auditors. Members of the Committee may, in pursuit of 
their duties, take independent professional advice on any matter, 
at the Company’s expense. The Audit Committee Chairman 
reports the outcome of Audit Committee meetings to the Board.
The Audit Committee meets at least twice each year and has an 
agenda linked to events in the Group’s financial calendar. The 
Audit Committee met twice during 2015.
In order to fulfil its terms of reference, the Audit Committee 
receives and reviews presentations and reports from the Group’s 
senior management and the external auditors.
During the period, the Audit Committee formally reviewed draft 
Interim and Annual Reports and associated interim and year end 
results’ announcements. These reviews considered:
• the accounting principles, policies and practices adopted in the 
Group’s accounts and proposed changes to them; and
• significant accounting issues and areas of judgement and 
complexity.
The Audit Committee is required to assist the Board to fulfil its 
responsibilities relating to the adequacy and effectiveness of the 
control environment and the Group’s compliance with the 
Corporate Governance Code. To fulfil these duties, the Audit 
Committee reviewed:
• the external auditors’ review of internal controls and audit 
highlights memoranda;
• any reports on the systems of internal controls and risk 
management; and
• any reports on identified frauds perpetrated against the Group.
The Audit Committee is responsible for the development, 
implementation and monitoring of the Group’s policy on external 
audit. The Group’s policy on external audit prohibits certain types 
of non-audit work from being performed by the auditor, 
particularly in cases where auditor objectivity and independence 
would be put at risk.
During 2015, the Group’s auditors provided non-audit services in 
a number of areas, principally in respect of advice on the pension 
buy-out and a flexible retirement option. Before any significant 
non-audit work is commissioned, the nature and extent of such 
work is considered, initially by the Chief Financial Officer and the 
Corporate Services Director, to determine if such work would put 
at risk auditor objectivity and independence. This process includes 
discussion with the audit partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. 
If there is any concern that auditors’ objectivity and independence 
would be put at risk, the matter will be referred to the Audit 
Committee, prior to commissioning. For the areas referred to 
above, after following the process described in this paragraph, it 
was considered that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP was the most 
suitable firm to perform the work given their long-standing 
knowledge of the legacy defined benefit scheme. During 2015, 
tax advice was also taken from Deloitte LLP. Details of fees paid to 
the auditors in respect of audit and non-audit services are shown 
in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
In addition to the above, the Board has specifically reviewed the

Governance
To fulfil its responsibility regarding the independence of the 
external auditors, the Audit Committee reviewed:
• changes and rotation of external audit team members, 
including the audit partner, in the audit plan for the 
current year;
• a report from the external auditors describing their 
arrangements to identify, report and manage any conflicts of 
interest; and
• the nature and extent of non-audit services provided by the 
external auditors.
To assess the effectiveness of the external auditors, the Audit 
Committee reviewed:
• the relevant skills and experience of the audit partner and team 
and their knowledge of the business;
• planning and scope of the audit and identification of areas of 
audit risk;
• execution of the audit plan; and
• formal reports presented to the Audit Committee.
To fulfil its responsibility for oversight of the external audit 
process, the Audit Committee reviewed:
• the terms, areas of responsibility, associated duties and scope 
of the audit as set out in the external auditors’ engagement 
letter for the forthcoming year;
• the external auditors’ overall work plan for the forthcoming 
year;
• the external auditors’ fee proposal;
• the major issues that arose during the course of the audit and 
their resolution;
• key accounting and audit judgements;
• the levels of errors identified during the audit; and
• recommendations made by the external auditors in their 
management letters and the adequacy of management’s 
response.
Main activities of the Committee during the period 
ended 2 January 2016
During the period ended 2 January 2016, the Audit Committee’s 
business has included the following items:
• consideration and approval of half year results;
• consideration and approval of full year results;
• principal judgemental accounting matters affecting the Group 
based on reports from both the Group’s management and the 
external auditors;
• review of external audit plans and reports;
• consideration of fraud and loss prevention measures in the 
Group;
• consideration and approval of risk assessments relating to the 
Group’s business; and
• specific investigations as required.
Financial reporting and significant financial 
judgements
The Committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies 
have been adopted and whether management has made 
appropriate estimates and judgements. The Committee reviews 
accounting papers prepared by management which provides 
details on the main financial reporting judgements.
The Committee also reviews reports by the external auditors on 
the half year and full year results which highlight any issues arising 
from the work undertaken in respect of the half year review and 
year end audit.
Specific areas of audit and accounting risk reviewed by the 
Committee were:
Accounting for defined benefit pension scheme
The defined benefit pension scheme is material to the financial 
position of the Group. The amount shown in the balance sheet is 
sensitive to changes in key actuarial assumptions. The Committee 
reviewed the appropriateness and consistency of these 
assumptions and the auditors confirmed that the assumptions 
used were reasonable and within an acceptable range. Full 
disclosure of the pension scheme is provided in note 18 to the 
financial statements, which includes the key period end 
assumptions on page 68 and the sensitivities on page 69.
Supplier rebates
As in previous years, the business receives rebates from key 
suppliers based on agreed fixed rates relating to the volumes of 
goods purchased in a calendar year. The Committee does not 
consider the Group’s rebates to be highly complex as: they are 
volume related; agreement periods are coterminous with the 
Group’s accounting period; there are written agreements in place 
with suppliers; and historically rebates have been collected. 
However, FRC guidance has highlighted this as an area of focus, 
as the rebates are material to the results for the period.
The Committee has discussed any judgements made in accruing 
supplier rebates and the collectability of these amounts with 
management and the external auditors. The Committee is 
satisfied that the amounts of income accrued are appropriate.
Financial statements
The Committee considered, and was satisfied with, 
management’s presentation of the financial statements and, in 
particular, the presentation of certain items as exceptional items.
The auditors confirmed to the Committee that they were not 
aware of any material misstatements during the course of their 
work. The Committee is satisfied that the judgements made by 
management are reasonable and that appropriate disclosures 
have been included in the financial statements.
After reviewing the presentation from management and following 
discussions with the auditors, the Committee is satisfied that:
• the financial statements appropriately address the critical 
judgements and key estimates both in respect of the amounts 
reported and the related disclosures in the financial statements;
• the processes used for determining the value of the assets and 
liabilities have been appropriately reviewed, challenged and are 
sufficiently robust; and
• the Annual Report and Accounts taken as a whole are fair, 
balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for Shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy and should be 
recommended to the Board as such.

In arriving at the conclusion that the accounts were fair, balanced 
and understandable the Committee considered:
• any feedback provided by Shareholders on the Group’s 2014 
Annual Report and Accounts and trading updates, and 
information received by the Board throughout the period;
• an early draft of the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts to allow 
itself sufficient time to review the disclosures therein;
• the processes underpinning the compilation of the Report and 
the Group’s reporting governance framework; and
• the reviews and findings of the Group’s auditor.
Auditor independence
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or its predecessor firms, has been 
the Company’s auditor since 1992. The Audit Committee 
considers that the relationship with the auditors is working well 
and remains satisfied with their effectiveness.
Accordingly, the Committee has not considered it necessary to 
date to require the firm to retender for the Audit. However, the 
Committee has noted the guidance from the Financial Reporting 
Council and changes in the EU to the regulatory framework and 
will continue to keep the matter under review.
The external auditors are required to rotate the audit partner 
responsible for the Group and subsidiary audits every five years. 
The current audit partner was first appointed in respect of the 
2015 financial period ended 2 January 2016.
There are no contractual obligations restricting the Company’s 
choice of external auditor.
Taking into consideration the external auditors’ knowledge of the 
Group and level of experience, the Audit Committee has 
recommended to the Board that the external auditors are 
re-appointed.
Given the present structure of the Group, the Board does not 
currently consider the establishment of a separate internal audit 
function to be necessary. However, this matter is reviewed by the 
Board at least annually.
The Group has a “Whistleblowing” policy which contains 
arrangements for the Company Secretary to receive, in 
confidence, complaints on accounting, risk issues, internal 
controls, auditing issues and related matters for reporting to the 
Audit Committee as appropriate.
As necessary, the Audit Committee holds private meetings with 
the external auditors to review key issues within their spheres of 
interest and responsibility.
As Chairman of the Committee I will be present at the Annual 
General Meeting to answer questions on this report, matters 
within the scope of the Audit Committee’s responsibilities and 
any significant matters brought to the Audit Committee’s 
attention by the external auditors.
Internal control
The control system of the Group is intended to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to meet the Group’s objectives 
and any such system can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurances against material misstatement or loss. The 
effectiveness of the control system including financial, operating, 
compliance and risk management is reviewed by the Board at 
least annually.
Additionally, through the management process outlined in the 
Statement on Corporate Governance on page 25 the Group 
operates a continuous process of identifying, evaluating and 
managing the significant risks faced by each business and the 
Group as a whole. This process, which has been in place 
throughout 2015 and up to the date of the approval of this 
Annual Report, complies with the FRC guidance and includes the 
following:
• a defined organisational structure with appropriate delegation 
of authority;
• formal authorisation procedures for all investments;
• clear responsibilities on the part of management for the 
maintenance of good financial controls and the production and 
review of detailed, accurate and timely financial management 
information;
• the control of financial risks through clear authorisation levels;
• identification of operational risks and the development of 
mitigation plans by the senior management;
• regular reviews of both forward looking business plans and 
historic performance; and
• regular reports to the Board from the Executive Directors.
The internal controls extend to the financial reporting process and 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The 
basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements is set 
out on page 52.
The internal control process will continue to be monitored and 
reviewed by the Board which will, where necessary, ensure 
improvements are implemented. During the period the Board has 
undertaken a review of the effectiveness of internal controls and 
systems. No material matters were identified.

Chairman of the Audit Committee

Governance
4imprint’s strategy is to develop its position as the leading direct 
marketer of promotional products in the fragmented markets in 
which it operates.
Recent years have seen sustained growth in the Group and in 
both the earnings per share and share price of the Company. The 
Remuneration Committee and the Board aim (i) to ensure that the 
Company has the best possible management to continue that 
growth and the creation of further shareholder value and (ii) to 
reward management accordingly.
The Committee’s view regarding remuneration is that it should: 
(i) be competitive when compared to that in organisations of similar 
size, complexity and type; (ii) be structured so that remuneration is 
linked to the long term growth in earnings per share and in the 
shareholder value of the Company; (iii) be clear, easy to understand 
and motivating; (iv) not promote unacceptable behaviour or 
encourage unacceptable risk taking; and (v) be structured to avoid 
reward for failure.
During 2015, a number of events have occurred which have 
impacted on the current and future remuneration arrangements 
for Executive Directors and Senior Managers. These include:
i. The approval by Shareholders at the 2015 AGM of 
amendments to the 2011 Performance Share Plan, including its 
renaming as the 4imprint Group plc 2015 Incentive Plan;
ii. Mr. J.W. Poulter relinquishing his duties as Executive Chairman 
with effect from 30 September 2015, when he became 
Non-Executive Chairman;
iii. Mr. K. Lyons-Tarr being appointed as Chief Executive Officer of 
the Group with effect from 31 March 2015;
iv. Ms. G. Davies ceased to be an employee and a Director with 
effect from 31 March 2015; and
v. Mr. D. J. E. Seekings being appointed Chief Financial Officer 
and Director of the Group with effect from 31 March 2015.
2015 Incentive Plan
The 2015 Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) is designed to support the 
long term strategy of the Group, in particular its increasing focus 
on the business in North America.
The implementation of the Plan reflects the desire of the 
Remuneration Committee to ensure that following both (i) the 
changes to the directorate of the Group in 2015 and (ii) the 
greater focus of the business in North America, key US based 
beneficiaries are appropriately retained and incentivised.
During 2016, the first awards under the Plan will be made to the 
Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and seven 
senior managers. This will be the first time, since 2014, that 
awards have been in place under a long term incentive 
arrangement.
The Plan is directly linked to the annual bonus of senior 
employees. The Remuneration Committee will assess senior 
employee performance against the criteria set each year to 
determine the level of achievement of performance and therefore 
the annual bonus to be paid in respect of such year. The 
performance targets for the 2015 period are set out below.
Under the provisions of the Plan, 50% of the annual bonus will be 
deferred into shares through the award of nil cost options or 
conditional share awards.
The awards will usually be made during the 42 day period 
following the announcement of the Company’s full year results.
The number of nil cost options or conditional share awards will be 
determined by dividing the amount of the annual bonus being 
deferred by the price of a share on 31 December of the year 
preceding that in which the awards are made, for example, for 
awards made in 2016, the share price used in the determination 
will be that on 31 December 2015.
In respect of the period ended 2 January 2016, the Remuneration 
Committee has approved an annual bonus for those participating 
in the Plan equal to 60% of base salary, with 30% of annual 
bonus being deferred under the terms of the Plan. Given a share 
price of £12.70 on 31 December 2015, this is expected to result 
in the award of a total of 26,128 nil cost options or conditional 
share awards.
Other than in exceptional circumstances, any deferred awards will 
not vest earlier than three years from the date of the grant of the 
nil cost option or award of conditional shares and such vesting 
will be conditional on the beneficiary being in employment for 
that period. If, before that period has expired, a participant leaves 
employment as a good leaver or, in the event of a takeover or 
change of control, the award will vest in full (or, if the Board 
should so decide, on a time pro-rated basis).
The Plan contains “malus” provisions such that, if, prior to the 
date on which an award vests, the annual bonus from which it 
was determined is found to be incorrect, as a result of either a 
material misstatement in the audited accounts of the Group or 
the conduct of a beneficiary amounting to fraud or gross 
misconduct, then the Board may reduce, to nil, the number of 
shares awarded.
2015 performance targets
The performance targets for the period ended 2 January 2016 
were set using a combination of targets for both (i) revenue 
growth and (ii) year on year operating profit growth.
By way of example, assuming a constant return on sales of 7.9%, 
then a 15% increase in year on year operating profit growth 
would result in a bonus percentage of 50% of base salary.
The maximum percentage of salary that can be awarded as bonus 
is 100%.
Board of Directors
Mr. J. W. Poulter relinquished his executive duties with effect from 
30 September 2015, when he became Non-Executive Chairman. 
His 2015 salary has remained at its previous level of £120,000. In 
January 2016 the Remuneration Committee awarded him a bonus 
of 50% of annual salary, payable in cash for 2015, but this will be 
paid only in respect of the period when he was Executive 
Chairman.

Mr. S.J. Gray retired from the Board with effect from 
30 September 2015.
Ms. G. Davies stepped down as a Director with effect from 
31 March 2015.
Mr. C.J. Brady was appointed as a Non-Executive Director with 
effect from 11 June 2015. Mr. Brady is Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee and the Nomination Committee.
Mr. K. Lyons–Tarr was appointed Chief Executive Officer of the 
Group with effect from 31 March 2015. To reflect the additional 
duties and responsibilities of that appointment, his annual salary 
was increased, with effect from that date, from $365,000 to 
$400,000. In January 2016 the Remuneration Committee 
awarded him a bonus of 60% of his revised annual salary for 
2015, half of which will be paid in cash and half of which will be 
used for an award of conditional share options pursuant to the 
Plan. The number of options to be awarded is 6,376.
Mr. D. J. E. Seekings was appointed Chief Financial Officer with 
effect from 31 March 2015. To reflect the additional duties and 
responsibilities of that appointment, his annual salary was 
increased, with effect from that date from $223,210 to $275,000. 
In January 2016 the Remuneration Committee awarded him a 
bonus of 60% of his revised annual salary for 2015, half of which 
will be paid in cash and half of which is to be used for an award 
of conditional share options pursuant to the Plan. The number of 
options to be awarded is 4,383.
Given its focus on the Directors and Senior Managers in North 
America, Mr. A.J. Scull, the remaining UK based Executive 
Director will not participate in the Plan. His 2015 salary has 
remained at its previous level of £185,000. In January 2016 the 
Remuneration Committee awarded him a bonus of 50% of 
annual salary payable in cash for 2015.
The Committee reserves the right to make payments outside its 
approved policy but only in exceptional circumstances. The 
Committee would only use this right where it believes that this is 
in the best interests of the Company and when it would be 
disproportionate to seek specific approval from a general 
meeting. No such payments have been made during the period.
Remuneration is a topic upon which Shareholders have differing 
views, but I hope that the Group’s principles of clarity, relative 
simplicity and balance will help to explain what the Committee 
does and to enable Shareholders to understand the Remuneration 
Policy. In this context, I am pleased to note that at the 2015 
Annual General Meeting the Remuneration Report was approved 
by 94.16% of Shareholders who voted (which excluded 344,643 
votes withheld) and the Remuneration Policy by 82.47% of 
Shareholders who voted (which excluded 1,164,177

Remuneration governance
Remuneration Committee composition
The Remuneration Committee is a committee whose membership 
is comprised solely of Independent Non-Executive Directors, being 
Mr. C.J. Brady (Chairman of the Committee), Mr. J.A. Warren and 
Mr. P. S. Moody (from February 2016). The Committee meets at 
least once a year and may invite other attendees as it sees fit. 
Until his retirement from the Board on 30 September 2015, 
Mr. S.J. Gray was Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
During the period ended 2 January 2016, the Committee took 
advice from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP on the design of the 
proposed share-based long term incentive plan which was 
approved by Shareholders at the 2015 AGM. The Committee 
remains mindful of the remuneration of employees when 
reviewing changes in executive pay.
Remuneration Committee responsibilities
The principal duties of the Remuneration Committee are reflected 
in its terms of reference and include the following:
• to determine and recommend to the Board the overall 
remuneration policy of the Company;
• to determine and recommend to the Board the remuneration of 
the Executive Directors;
• to monitor and review the level and structure of remuneration 
for senior management;
• to determine the targets for any performance related bonus 
and share incentive schemes operated for Executive Directors 
and senior management; and
• to review and approve any material termination payments.
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by 
the Non-Executive Chairman of the Board and the 
Executive Directors.
Remuneration Committee activities in the period 
ended 2 January 2016
The Remuneration Committee met twice during the period ended 
2 January 2016 and the following matters were considered:
Salaries
Approving the salaries of the Executive Directors for 2015 and 
monitoring and reviewing the level and structure of salaries for 
senior management for 2015.
Bonuses
Approving the bonuses for the Executive Directors for 2014 and 
monitoring and reviewing the level and structure of bonuses for 
senior management for 2014.
Approving the structure of the bonus criteria for Executive 
Directors and monitoring and reviewing the level and structure of 
bonuses for senior management for 2015. These were as follows:
The performance targets for the period ended 2 January 2016 
were set using a combination of targets for both (i) sales growth 
and (ii) year on year operating profit growth.
By way of example, assuming a constant return on sales of 7.9%, 
then a 15% increase in year on year operating profit growth 
would result in a bonus percentage of 50% of base salary.
The maximum percentage of salary that can be awarded as bonus 
is 100%.
Other matters
Approving the 2015 Incentive Plan for consideration at the 2015 
AGM.
Approving the terms of redundancy and contract termination for 
Ms. G. Davies.
Future remuneration policy
The Company has a well-established and clear remuneration 
policy which, in the view of the Committee, has made an 
important contribution to the success of the Company over a 
sustained period. The policy includes providing Executive Directors 
with remuneration packages which are: (i) competitive when 
compared to that in organisations of similar size, complexity and 
type; (ii) structured so that remuneration is linked to the long term 
growth in earnings per share and in the shareholder value of the 
company; (iii) clear, easy to understand and motivating; 
(iv) designed not to promote unacceptable behaviour or 
encourage unacceptable risk taking; and (v) structured to avoid 
reward for failure.
At the 2015 AGM Shareholders approved the remuneration 
policy, which can be found on the corporate website at http://
investors.4imprint.com/investors/shareholder-information/
agm-company-documents.
Elements of remuneration
Remuneration for Executive Directors comprises both fixed and 
variable elements. The principal component of the fixed element 
is a salary, which is set at an appropriate level for the size and 
type of the Company to retain the quality of management it 
requires to further the Board’s objectives, but which is 
not excessive.
The variable element of remuneration is designed to incentivise 
and motivate management to meet annual performance targets 
and reward performance. The principal components of the 
variable element are (i) an annual bonus and (ii) a share-based 
long term incentive plan.
The targets for the annual bonus, which is capped at a maximum 
of 100% of annual base salary, except in the case of the 
remaining UK based Executive Director, where the maximum is 
50%, are set by the Remuneration Committee each year and 
evolve with the growth objectives of the Group.

Base remuneration comprises fixed elements of pay being base salary, benefits in kind and pension contributions or pay in lieu of pension 
contributions. The base salaries are those approved at the Remuneration Committee meeting in January 2016; pension contributions or 
pay in lieu of pension contributions are a fixed percentage of base salary and benefits in kind are based on 2015 figures.
On target includes base remuneration plus the bonus payable if budget is met. This results in bonus of 60% of base salary for the Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, half of which is in the form of conditional share awards with a vesting period of three 
years from the award date and a bonus of 50% of base salary, payable in cash, for the Corporate Services Director.
Maximum shows the maximum bonus payable if targets set by the Remuneration Committee are met. In the case of the Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer this is 100% of base salary, again with half in the form of conditional share awards with a 
vesting period of three years from the award date. The Corporate Services Director’s bonus, payable in cash, is capped at 50%.

Current service agreements
Mr. A.J. Scull (the “UK-based Executive Director”) has a rolling service contract which continues until terminated by the expiry of twelve 
months’ written notice from the Company to the Director. The service contract provides for participation in a discretionary bonus 
scheme, the provision of a car (or car allowance) and pay in lieu of pension entitlements. The contractual termination payment in such 
circumstances would comprise up to twelve months’ payments, equivalent to the notice period, in respect of salary, car allowance, pay 
in lieu of pension entitlements and contributions to healthcare and income protection schemes.
Mr. K. Lyons-Tarr and Mr. D. Seekings (the “US-based Executive Directors”) have rolling employment agreements with 4imprint, Inc. 
which continue until terminated by the expiry of twelve months’ written notice from that Company to the Director. The employment 
agreements for the US-based Executive Directors provide for participation in a discretionary bonus scheme and entitlement to benefits 
generally available to employees of 4imprint, Inc. from time to time including, for example, retirement, disability, group accident, life 
and health insurance programmes. The contractual termination payment in such circumstances would comprise up to twelve months’ 
payments, equivalent to the notice period in respect of salary and other non-discretionary components.
Any commitment made to the Executive Directors by the Company under his service contract or otherwise which is consistent with the 
approved remuneration policy in force at the time that commitment was made will be honoured, even where it is not consistent with 
the policy prevailing at the time such commitment is fulfilled.

4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 41
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group and parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union. Under 
company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of 
the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for Shareholders to assess a 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in 
the Board of Directors on pages 20 and 21 confirm that, to the 
best of their knowledge:
• the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of 
the Group; and
• the Strategic Report, Chief Executive’s Review, Financial Review 
and Directors’ Report contained on pages 6 to 24 include a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Group, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.

Report on the Group financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion, 4imprint Group plc’s Group financial statements (the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 2 January 2016 and of its profit and cash flows for the 53 week 
period (the “period”) then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European 
Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts (the “Annual Report”), comprise:
• the Group balance sheet as at 2 January 2016;
• the Group income statement and statement of comprehensive income for the period then ended;
• the Group statement of changes in Shareholders’ equity for the period then ended;
• the Group cash flow statement for the period then ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements. 
These are cross referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union.
Our audit approach
Overview
• Overall Group materiality: $1,622,000 which represents 5% of profit from continuing 
operations before tax and exceptional items.
• We conducted audit work over 4imprint Group plc (the parent Company of the Group), 
4imprint, Inc. and 4imprint Direct Marketing Limited which accounted for 100% of revenue 
and profit from  
continuing operations before tax and exceptional items. 
• Accounting for defined benefit pension scheme liabilities. 
• Accounting for supplier arrangements.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In 
particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates 
that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed 
the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that 
represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are 
identified as “areas of focus” in the table following. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in 
order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures 
should be read in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Accounting for defined benefit pension scheme liabilities
Refer to page 30 of the Statement on Corporate Governance, 
page 55 of the statement of accounting policies and note 18 of 
the consolidated financial statements.
The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme which, 
although now closed to future accrual and entrants, had a deficit 
of $23.1m (2014: $24.0m) as at 2 January 2016. The Group 
engage independent actuarial specialists to calculate the valuation 
of scheme liabilities.
The valuation of pension scheme liabilities is impacted by the actuarial 
assumptions adopted by the Directors which are subjective and require 
estimation and judgement to be applied in their determination. If 
alternative assumptions had been adopted and applied these could 
have materially impacted the valuation of the pension scheme liabilities 
as at 2 January 2016. We focussed our work on the assumptions to 
which the valuation was most sensitive, namely the discount rate, 
inflation rate and mortality assumptions.
We compared the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality 
assumptions to externally derived data, as well as our own 
independently formed assessments, in relation to these key inputs 
in order to assess whether the assumptions used were reasonable. 
We noted that all assumptions applied were in line with our 
independently formed assessments, within an acceptable range.
We also assessed whether the disclosures reflect the risks inherent 
in the accounting for the pension scheme and determined that 
the disclosures were sufficient and reflected the period end 
position of the pension scheme.
Accounting for supplier arrangements
Refer to page 30 of the Statement on Corporate Governance 
and page 53 of the statement of accounting policies.
The Group, primarily through 4imprint, Inc., receives significant 
rebates from its suppliers. These relate to volume based rebates 
on purchases made from key product suppliers throughout the 
financial period.
The rebates received are determined by formal signed agreements 
with suppliers and depend on the level of spend within the 
financial period, with which all agreements are coterminous. 
The percentage of purchases paid as a rebate from certain 
suppliers increases based on predetermined thresholds within 
supplier agreements.
We have focussed on this area because the quantum of income 
recorded under these arrangements is material in relation to the 
result in the period. Furthermore, given the number of different 
rebate contracts the Group has entered into and the range of 
different rebate rates used, including stepped rebates, in the 
calculations there is an inherent risk of error in the calculation of 
these amounts. 
We obtained supplier agreements and inspected them to assess 
whether all rebates received, and receivable, by the Group 
have been accounted for in the correct financial period and 
in accordance with specific terms agreed with suppliers. From 
inspection of these agreements we determined that the terms 
and conditions, including the financial periods over which rebate 
income could be earned, had been appropriately reflected in the 
calculations of rebates receivable.
We confirmed directly with a sample of suppliers the rebate 
income which had been earned in the period, and also 
recalculated supplier rebate income and receivables based upon 
spend with suppliers in the period taking account of agreed 
rebate rates per signed agreements. We did not identify any 
material differences between either confirmed rebate income or 
our expectation and the amounts recognised.
We compared actual receipts from suppliers in the period to amounts 
recorded as receivable at the prior period end in order to assess the 
historical accuracy of the estimation process. We determined that 
the level of current year receipts supported the assumptions around 
collectability of prior period rebates receivable, and therefore the 
estimation process was reasonable in this regard.
We tested purchase transactions around the period end to 
confirm whether purchases upon which rebate income and 
receivables are based had been recorded in the correct accounting 
period and we noted no material exceptions from this testing.
We tested the carrying value of rebate receivable balances at 
the period end by vouching them to subsequent cash receipts 
from suppliers. We determined the proportions of these balances 
collected as at the date of this report and noted no evidence to 
suggest material doubts over collectability.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements 
as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in 
which the Group operates. 4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 44
Financial Statements
Independent Auditors’ report to the members 
of 4imprint Group plc continued
Report on the Group financial statements continued
The Group comprises the following entities:
• 4imprint, Inc. and 4imprint Direct Marketing Limited, trading entities that form the Direct Marketing operating segment and are 
based in the United States and United Kingdom respectively;
• 4imprint Group plc, parent company of the Group; and
• Four non trading entities.
The Group audit team in the UK performed an audit of the complete financial information of 4imprint, Inc. (which included visiting the 
businesses operations in Oshkosh, Wisconsin), 4imprint Direct Marketing Limited and 4imprint Group plc, which we regarded as 
financially significant components of the Group. These components accounted for 100% of the Group’s revenue and profit from 
continuing operations before tax and exceptional items for the period.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both 
individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality $1,622,000 (2014: $1,285,000).
How we determined it 5% of profit from continuing operations before tax and exceptional items.
Rationale for benchmark applied We note that profit from continuing operations before tax and exceptional items is the key 
measure used both by the Board and, we believe, externally by Shareholders in evaluating the 
performance of the Group. It also represents a consistent measure of the performance year on 
year by removing the impact of non-recurring items.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above $80,000 (2014: 
$65,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement, set out on page 15, in relation to going concern. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the 
Directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements. We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. 
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the 
Directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have 
concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

of 4imprint Group plc continued
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility 
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a 
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Company financial statements of 4imprint Group plc for the 53 week period ended 2 January 2016 
and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

Financial Statements
Notes to the financial statements
General information
4imprint Group plc, registered number 177991, is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK and listed on the 
London Stock Exchange. Its registered office is 7/8 Market Place, London W1W 8AG. These financial statements have been prepared in 
US dollars.
Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the periods presented. Accounting standards effective for the first time in the period have had no impact on 
the Group’s financial statements.
The Group presents the consolidated financial statements in US dollars. Numbers are shown in US dollars thousands.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with IFRS (International Financial 
Reporting Standards) as adopted by the EU, IFRS IC interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. The standards used are those published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and endorsed by 
the EU at the time of preparing these financial statements (March 2016).
After making enquiries, the Directors have reasonable expectations that the Group has adequate resources to continue to operate for a 
period of at least twelve months from the date these financial statements were approved. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the period. Subsidiaries 
are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed 
to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to 
direct the activities of the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries, as amended to conform to Group accounting policies, are 
included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is 
measured as the fair value of the consideration paid. Identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business 
combination are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share 
of identifiable net assets is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated income statement from the 
effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. In addition, comparatives are also restated to 
reclassify disposed businesses, or those that meet the criteria of IFRS 5 to be classified as held for sale and as discontinued operations. 
All subsidiaries have the same year end date as the Group.
Use of assumptions and estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, 
the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent 
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The key estimates are in respect of the present value of the pension 
scheme obligations. The assumptions used are disclosed in note 18.
Critical accounting policies
Critical accounting policies are those that require significant judgements or estimates and potentially result in materially different results 
under different assumptions or conditions. Management consider the following to be the only critical accounting policy:
Pensions
As disclosed in note 18, the Group sponsors a defined benefit pension scheme closed to new members and future accruals. Period end 
recognition of the liabilities under this scheme and the return on assets held to fund these liabilities require a number of significant 
actuarial assumptions to be made including inflation rate, discount rate and mortality rates. Small changes in assumptions can have a 
significant impact on the expense recorded in the income statement and on the pension liability in the balance sheet. Sensitivities to 
changes in these assumptions are disclosed in note 18. Financial

Other accounting policies
Revenue
Revenue from sales of promotional goods, delivery receipts and other activities, is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business net of discounts, returns and sales related taxes. 
Revenues are recognised upon the transfer of risks and rewards to customers.
Supplier rebates
Amounts due under rebate agreements are recognised based upon volumes of products purchased during the period to which the 
rebates relate at the relevant rebate rates, per supplier agreements. Amounts are credited to the cost of purchase of goods for resale 
and any accrued income is included in other receivables. Provision is made against such receivables to the extent it is considered that 
the amounts are not recoverable.
Segmental reporting
The reporting requirements of IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of 
the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their 
performance. The chief operating decision maker has been identified by the Directors as the Board and accordingly the segmental 
reporting included in the financial statements aligns with those reported monthly to the Board.
Leases
Where the Group has substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership under a lease, the lease will be classified as a finance lease. 
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Finance leases
Assets acquired through finance leases are capitalised as property, plant and equipment, at the lower of the fair value of the leased 
asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. These assets are depreciated over the lease term or the estimated useful 
life, whichever is shorter. The resulting lease obligations are included in liabilities, net of finance charges. Interest costs on finance leases 
are charged directly to the income statement.
Operating leases
Assets leased under operating leases are not recorded on the balance sheet. Rental payments are charged directly to the income 
statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Share-based payments
All share options are measured at fair value at the date of grant using option-pricing models (primarily Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo) 
allowing for any non-market and service conditions and the impact of any non-vesting conditions (for example requirements for the 
employee to save). The fair value is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the share option schemes on a straight 
line basis. The value of the charge is adjusted each year to reflect the expected number of options that will become exercisable. All 
options cancelled are fully expensed to the income statement upon cancellation.
Exceptional items
Income or costs which are both material and non-recurring, whose significance is sufficient to warrant separate disclosure in the 
financial statements, are referred to as exceptional items. The Directors consider that the separate disclosure of these items assists in 
understanding the Group’s financial performance.
Taxation
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that 
it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity in which case the tax is recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in 
the countries where the Group’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken 
in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where 
appropriate on the basis of amounts estimated to be paid to tax authorities.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Group’s financial statements. However, deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises 
from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction 
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been 
enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is 
realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. 4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 54
Financial Statements
Notes to the financial statements continued
Other accounting policies continued
Taxation continued
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised.
Dividends
Final equity dividends are recognised in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the 
Shareholders. Interim equity dividends are recognised when paid.
Foreign currency
The functional and presentation currency of the Company is Sterling, however the Group’s financial statements are presented in 
US dollars.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company or subsidiary concerned are recorded at the exchange 
rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Translation differences on monetary items are taken 
to the income statement.
On consolidation the balance sheets of Sterling enterprises are translated into US dollars at the exchange rate ruling at the balance 
sheet date and income statements are translated at average rates for the period under review. One off material transactions are 
translated at the spot rate on the transaction date. The resulting exchange differences are taken to the cumulative translation 
differences reserve and are reported in the statement of comprehensive income. 
On disposal of an operation any cumulative exchange differences held in Shareholders’ equity are recycled to the income statement.
Derivative instruments
The Group uses derivative forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge highly probable cash flows.
Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value and are remeasured at fair value at each reporting date. The treatment of the gain or loss 
on remeasurement depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
Hedges of the fair value of recognised assets and liabilities are designated as fair value hedges. Hedges of highly probable forecast 
transactions are designated as cash flow hedges.
Changes in the fair value of fair value hedging instruments are recognised in the income statement. Changes in the fair value of the 
hedged items are also recognised in the income statement.
The effective portion of changes in cash flow hedges are deferred in a hedging reserve, where material, and then charged to the 
income statement when the forecast sale or purchase occurs or if the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur. Any 
ineffective portion of the cash flow hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. No depreciation is provided 
on freehold land and assets in the course of construction. For all other property, plant and equipment, depreciation is calculated to 
write-off their cost less residual value by equal annual instalments over the period of their estimated useful lives, which are reviewed on 
a regular basis. Leasehold assets are depreciated over the shorter of the term of the lease or their estimated useful lives.
Cost comprises the purchase price plus costs directly incurred in bringing the asset into use.
The principal useful lives currently fall within the following ranges:
Freehold and long leasehold buildings 50 years
Short leasehold buildings Life of lease 
Plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings 3–15 years
Computer hardware 3 years
Profits and losses on disposal which have arisen from over or under depreciation are accounted for in arriving at operating profit and 
are separately disclosed when material. Financial

Additional 
Information Overview
4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 55
Intangible assets
Acquired software licences and external expenditure on developing websites and other computer systems is capitalised, held at historic 
cost and amortised from the invoice date on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life (currently three to five years). Internal 
costs and non-development costs are expensed to operating expenses as incurred. 
An expense is recognised in operating expenses for catalogues and other related marketing expenses when the business has access 
to them.
Impairment of assets 
All property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets” 
if there is an indication that the carrying value of the asset may have been impaired. Where an impairment review is required, the 
carrying value of the assets is measured against their value in use based on future estimated cash flows, discounted by the appropriate 
cost of capital, resulting from the use of those assets. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is a separately identifiable 
cash flow (cash generating unit). An impairment loss is recognised for the amount at which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Discontinued operations and assets held for sale
Business components that represent separate major lines of business or geographical areas of operations are recognised as 
discontinued if the operations have been disposed of, or meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale under IFRS 5. Assets and 
disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be principally recovered through a sale transaction rather than 
through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable, expected to be completed within one 
year and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Disposal groups or assets held for sale are 
held at the lower of their carrying amount on the date they are classified as held for sale and fair value less costs to sell.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, net of provisions for slow moving and discontinued items, and net realisable value using the 
first in first out basis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling 
expenses. Items in transit where the Group holds the risks and rewards are included in inventories.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the 
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The amount of the provision is 
recognised in the income statement. Trade receivables are discounted when the time value of money is considered material.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held on call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet. In 
the cash flow statement cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank overdrafts. Cash deposits with an original maturity in excess 
of three months are classified as other financial assets.
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. Trade and other payables are 
discounted when the time value of money is considered material.
Pensions
The Group operates defined contribution plans for the majority of its UK and US employees. The regular contributions are charged to 
the income statement as they are incurred.
The Group sponsors a defined benefit scheme, which is closed to new members and future accruals. The Group accounts for the 
defined benefit scheme under IAS 19 “Employee Benefits”. The deficit of the defined benefit pension scheme is recognised in full on 
the balance sheet and represents the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation at the balance sheet date. A full actuarial valuation is carried out at least every three years and the defined benefit obligation 
is updated on an annual basis, by independent actuaries, using the projected unit credit method.
Pension charges recognised in the income statement consists of administration costs of the Scheme and a finance cost based on the 
interest on net pension scheme liabilities calculated in accordance with IAS 19.
Differences between the actual and expected return on assets, experience gains and losses and changes in actuarial assumptions are 
included directly in the Group’s statement of comprehensive income. 4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 56
Financial Statements
Notes to the financial statements continued
Other accounting policies continued
Borrowings
Borrowings are measured initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred and subsequently carried at amortised costs using the 
effective interest rate method. Arrangement fees are amortised over the life of the borrowing. Borrowings are discounted when the 
time value of money is considered material.
Provision for future lease costs
Provisions for future lease costs and dilapidations are made when there is a legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events 
and it is probable that expenditure will be incurred and a reliable estimate can be made of that cost. If the effect of the time value of 
money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the 
increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.
Own shares held by employee share trusts
Own shares acquired, to meet future obligations under employee share options, are held in independent trusts. These are funded by 
the Company and purchases of shares by the trusts are charged directly to equity. 
Administration expenses of the trusts are charged to the Company’s income statement as incurred.
IFRS standards effective in future financial statements
The IASB and IFRS IC have issued new or amended standards and interpretations which are effective for accounting periods as noted 
below. The impact of IFRS 15 is still being assessed, but the net impact on Group’s results is not expected to be material. Management 
do not believe the impact of adopting the other new or amended standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the 
results or net assets of the Group.

Underlying diluted basic earnings per share from continuing operations 87.50 71.55
The basic weighted average number of shares excluded shares held in the 4imprint Group plc employee share trusts. The effect of this 
is to reduce the average by 37,998 (2014: 146,474).
The basic earnings per share is calculated based on the profit for the financial period divided by the basic weighted average number 
of shares.
For diluted earnings per share, the basic weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all 
potential dilutive ordinary shares. The potential dilutive ordinary shares relate to those share options granted to employees where the 
exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares and are likely to vest at the balance sheet date. 
The Performance Share Plan had met vesting conditions for 120,000 options at the balance sheet date.
The underlying basic earnings per share is calculated before the after tax effect of share option charges, exceptional items and defined 
benefit pension charges and is included because the Directors consider this gives a measure of the underlying performance of the 
continuing business. 4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 62

The Group operates defined contribution plans for the majority of its UK and US employees. The regular contributions are charged to 
the income statement as they are incurred. The charges recognised in the income statement are:

Present value of funded obligations (139,248) (154,918)
Fair value of Scheme assets 116,134 130,903
Net liability recognised in the balance sheet (23,114) (24,015)
The funds of the Scheme are held in trust and administered by a Trustee body to meet pension liabilities for around 1,600 past 
employees of the Group. The level of retirement benefit is principally based on salary earned in the best three consecutive tax years in 
the ten years prior to leaving active service and is linked to changes in inflation both pre and post retirement.
The Scheme is subject to the funding legislation outlined in the Pensions Act 2004 which came into force on 30 December 2005. This, 
together with documents issued by the Pensions Regulator, and Guidance Notes adopted by the Financial Reporting Council, set out 
the framework for funding defined benefit occupational pension plans in the UK.
The trustees of the Scheme are required to act in the best interest of the Scheme’s beneficiaries. The appointment of trustees is 
determined by the Scheme’s trust documentation. It is policy that one third of all trustees should be nominated by the members.
The Scheme typically exposes the Company to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, mortality risk and longevity risk. 
A decrease in corporate bond yields, a rise in inflation or an increase in life expectancy would result in an increase to Scheme liabilities. 
This would detrimentally impact the balance sheet position, require an increase in future cash contributions from the Company and 
may give rise to increased charges in future income statements. This effect would be offset by an increase in the value of the Scheme’s 
insurance annuities covering the bulk of the pensioner liabilities. Additionally, caps on inflationary increases are in place to protect the 
Scheme against extreme inflation. Assets other than the insurance annuities are held in a global absolute return fund. This is a multi-
asset fund designed to provide positive returns in all market conditions. The fund uses derivatives to reduce risk.
A full actuarial valuation was undertaken as at 5 April 2013 in accordance with the Scheme funding requirements of the Pensions Act 
2004. This Scheme actuarial valuation showed a deficit of £30.6m. The Company agreed a schedule of contributions with the Trustee. 
The recovery plan period is 6.3 years and takes into account the material funding improvement between the date of valuation and date 
of the recovery plan (December 2013), as agreed with the Scheme actuary. The improvement was principally due to an increase in UK 
gilt rates during that period. In 2014 accelerated contributions of $22.4m (£13.7m) were paid to the Scheme to facilitate the purchase 
of the buy-in policy. A further £10.0m will be paid to the Scheme if the policy is converted to a buy-out, which the Scheme Trustee is 
targeting to complete in the first half of 2016.
For the purposes of IAS 19 the actuarial valuation as at 5 April 2013, which was carried out by a qualified independent actuary, has 
been updated on an approximate basis to 2 January 2016. There have been no changes in the valuation methodology adopted for this 
period’s disclosures compared to the previous period’s disclosures. 4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 68

It is the policy of the Trustee and the Company to review the investment strategy from time to time and at the time of each funding 
valuation. The Trustee investment objectives and the processes undertaken to measure and manage the risks inherent in the Scheme 
investment strategy are documented in the Scheme’s Statement of Investment Principles.
Of the total obligations 78% are matched by insured annuities, thus the only risk in respect of these obligations is if the insurer fails to 
meet its obligations. The balance of the assets were held in a quoted global absolute returns fund, designed to give positive investment 
returns in all market conditions.
The sensitivities on the key actuarial assumptions at the end of the period were:
Change in assumption Change in defined benefit obligation
Discount rate Decrease of 0.25% Increase by 3.0%
Rate of inflation Increase of 0.25% Increase by 1.0%
Rate of mortality Increase in life expectancy of one year Increase by 3.8%
The sensitivities shown above are approximate. Each sensitivity considers each change in isolation and is calculated using the same 
methodology as used for the calculation of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the period. The inflation sensitivity includes the 
impact of changes to the assumptions for revaluation and pension increases. In practice it is unlikely that the changes would occur in 
isolation. As the value of the insured annuity assets match the value of the insured obligations, the overall impact of sensitivities is 
restricted to their impact on the uninsured portion of the obligations.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 2 January 2016 is 12 years.

21 Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including currency risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk.
Currency risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to various currency movements. Risk arises predominantly from the remittance of 
overseas earnings in US dollars. In addition, Group subsidiaries may make both sales and purchases in a currency other than their 
functional currency and have foreign currency trade receivables and trade payables in relation to these transactions. 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to partly hedge foreign currency cash flows arising from sales and purchases of goods, 
as well as remittances from its overseas subsidiaries. Contracts outstanding at the period end had no material impact on the financial 
statements. The Group does not hedge the currency exposure of profits and assets of its overseas subsidiaries or other financial 
transactions.
At 2 January 2016 the Group had forward currency contracts for the sale of US$6m for Sterling up to September 2016. The fair value of 
the derivatives was not material when measured at 2 January 2016 and consequently no entries have been reflected in the financial 
statements.
The movement in the exchange rates compared to prior period increased profit by $0.35m and increased net assets by $0.22m. Closing 
rate was US$1.48 (2014: US$1.56) and the average rate used to translate profits was US$1.53 (2014: US$1.65).
A strengthening in the Sterling exchange rate by 10% (the approximate range of movement of the exchange rate during the year) 
would reduce profit in the period by $0.49m and net assets at period end by $0.36m.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposure to trade receivable balances due from 
customers.
The risk associated with banks and financial institutions is managed on a Group basis and all banking relationships must be approved 
by the Chief Financial Officer or the Board based on the credit rating of the bank. 
Apart from overseas subsidiaries working capital cash requirements, the Group seeks to hold any cash balances on deposit with its 
principal UK bank. Financial

Financial liabilities at amortised cost
Trade and other payables (excluding non financial liabilities) (37,254) (36,038)
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold in the ordinary course of business. Other receivables are non-
derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. If collection of the amounts is 
expected in one year or less they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.

18,381 18,301
There is no concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables, as the Group has a large number of customers. 
Credit risk arising from customers is delegated to the senior management of each business to a maximum level per customer, above which, it is 
referred to the Chief Financial Officer for approval. External credit agency assessment reports are referred to as part of this process. 
Liquidity risk
Group borrowing requirements are managed centrally and the majority of borrowing arrangements are currently with the Group’s 
principal US bank and terms are agreed which are considered appropriate for the funding requirement of the Group at that time. 
Operating working capital is managed to levels agreed with the Group and cash forecasts are reviewed regularly by management. 
The Group monitors its levels of cash and indebtedness to ensure adequate liquid funds are available to meet the foreseeable 
requirements of the Group. The Group does not actively monitor a gearing ratio, but seeks to maintain an appropriate level of financial 
flexibility. Details of borrowing facilities are given in note 17.
At 2 January 2016 the net cash position (note 15) of the Group was $18,381,000 (2014: $18,301,000).
Capital risk management
The objective for managing debt and equity capital is to safeguard the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, in order to 
provide returns for Shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
In 2015 the Company has provided returns to Shareholders in the form of dividends, details of which are included in note 8. Shares 
were purchased by an employee benefit trust, to cover the SAYE options maturing 1 January 2016. 4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 72

The vesting conditions of the 2013 award under the Performance Share Plan have been met in full.
2015 Incentive Plan
Under the 2015 Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) 50% of the 2015 annual bonus of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and 
seven senior managers will be deferred into shares as nil cost options or conditional shares, based on the share price at 31 December 
2015. The awards will be made in a 42 day period following the announcement of the Group’s 2015 full year results and the options 
will normally not be exercisable until three years from the date of the award, conditional upon the person still being in the employment 
of a Group company. It is expected that 26,128 options or conditional shares, with a total fair value of $492,000, will be awarded in 
respect of the 2015 bonus.
23 Share-based payments
Share options may be granted to senior management and in addition a SAYE scheme exists for all UK and US employees. The exercise price for 
SAYE options is equal to the market rate, plus any discount up to the limit imposed by the local tax authority at the pricing date.
The fair value of the options is determined using the Black-Scholes model for SAYE and Sharesave schemes and the Monte Carlo model 
for the Performance Share Plan and is spread over the vesting period of the options. The significant inputs into the model are an 
expected life of between 2.04 and 3 years for the SAYE and Sharesave options, the volatility measured at the standard deviation of 
expected share price returns is based on statistical analysis of daily share prices over the last five years and the risk-free rate is based on 
zero coupon government bond yields.

performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 
16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other 
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent 
in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a 
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of 4imprint Group plc for the 53 week period ended 2 January 2016.

Notes to the Company’s financial statements
General information
4imprint Group plc, registered number 177991, is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK and listed on the 
London Stock Exchange. Its registered office is 7/8 Market Place, London W1W 8AG. The Company’s financial statements are presented 
in Sterling. Numbers are shown in pounds thousands.
Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are the same as those adopted in the 
consolidated financial statements on pages 52 to 56 except for the investments policy noted below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the periods presented.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, IFRS IC 
interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The standards used are 
those published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and endorsed by the EU at the time of preparing these 
statements (March 2016).
After making enquiries, the Directors have reasonable expectations that the Company has adequate resources to continue to operate 
for a period of not less than twelve months from the date these financial statements were approved. Accordingly they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Use of assumptions and estimates
The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions 
are based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of 
which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other 
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Critical accounting policies
Critical accounting policies are those that require significant judgement or estimates and potentially result in materially different results under 
different assumptions or conditions. Management consider the following to be the only critical accounting policy of the Company.
Pensions
As disclosed in note 18 on pages 67 to 69, the Company sponsors a closed defined benefit scheme. Year end recognition of the 
liabilities under this scheme and the return on assets held to fund these liabilities require a number of significant actuarial assumptions 
to be made including inflation, discount rate and mortality rates. Small changes in assumptions can have a significant impact on the 
expense recorded in the income statement and on the pension liability in the balance sheet.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost. Impairment reviews are carried out if there is some indication that the carrying value of 
the investments may have been impaired. Where, in the opinion of the Directors, an impairment of the investment has arisen, 
provisions are made in accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets”. Financial

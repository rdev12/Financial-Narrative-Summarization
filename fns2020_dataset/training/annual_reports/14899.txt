Annual Report and Accounts 2007 2 This year, as you already may know, we have taken decisive actions 
to reshape our Company for growth and value development. We have 
sharpened our focus and, as you read this year’s annual report,  
I believe you will share our optimism and enthusiasm regarding the  
future performance and success of Stem Cell Sciences.

which will hopefully lead to new advances in CNS research, particularly  
in multiple sclerosis.
A major event for the Company during 2007 was our successful stock 
exchange listing in Australia (ASX: STC). The support received by the 
investment community there has been highly satisfying and appreciated. 
We believe one of our most important tasks is not just to ensure a strong 
current performance, but at the same time to create the conditions for 
long-term success. Last year we took a major stride in that direction, in the 
interest of the Company, our employees and, of course, our shareholders.

of such material. We intend to retain a carried interest in this business  
and will continue to develop new media for the partner.

Stem Cell Sciences plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 9 Stem Cell Sciences is exploring the therapeutic potential of different  
stem cell types, including both adult and embryonic stem cells,  
and recognises and abides by jurisdictional laws and regulations 
governing the derivation and use of stem cells in research and  
clinical applications.
There is much public debate on the use of embryonic versus adult stem 
cells. We believe that it is not yet clear which stem cell type will be of most 
value in certain therapeutic indications and that both must be pursued in 
order to deliver the most effective and safest medical outcomes.
While it is clear that different individuals, institutions and governments 
have differing and justifiable concerns regarding stem cells and stem cell 
technology, Stem Cell Sciences most strongly agrees that all aspects 
of human medicine be regulated and governed by the appropriate 
government authority. We therefore conduct ourselves accordingly.
  SCS believes the use of embryos and tissue should be minimised  •	
by facilitating open access for all qualified researchers to established 
cell lines, and supports this approach by the unencumbered provision 
of its human ES cell lines to national stem cell banks in Australia and 
the United Kingdom.
  SCS believes it is important to facilitate realistic and open debate •	
about the progress and the potential of stem cells in human medicine 
so as to balance hope and reality for patients where SCS holds a 
duty of care.
  SCS actively participates in local educational forums to help our •	
community understand what we do and why we do it.
  SCS believes stem cell based drug screening and development  •	
can dramatically reduce the need for animal testing and is  
pleased to support this opportunity by working closely with  
the pharmaceutical industry.
  SCS is appropriately licensed by all governing bodies in all territories •	
where it undertakes stem cell research.
Corporate Social Responsibility
Stem Cell Sciences is committed 
to working in an ethical manner
to help alleviate human suffering 
due to injury or disease.
Stem Cell Sciences plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 10 Directors’ Report
The directors present their annual report and the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007.
Principal activities and business review
The principal activities of the Group continue to be the development, commercialisation and application of stem cells and stem cell technologies  
in biopharmaceutical research and cell based therapies.
A detailed review of the results for the year and future developments in the business is provided within the Chairman’s Statement and the  
Chief Executive’s Review, which form part of this annual report.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The principal risks and uncertainties affecting the business include the following:
Cash resources: the Group’s projected cash resources are dependent on future sales, licence agreements and partnering arrangements, as well  
as product sales. The Group is involved in the research, development and commercialisation of stem cells and stem cell technology. At this stage  
of its development it has limited revenues arising from licensing arrangements, contract research and product sales and its costs exceed its revenue. 
The Group will continue to absorb cash until its products are commercialised. 
The Group’s current cash resources are forecast by the directors as being sufficient to enable it to continue to trade for the foreseeable future.  
However, the projections include revenues which are not certain and which significantly exceed those received in previous years. The Directors are 
currently in the process of talking with prospective licensing partners and other customers and have a reasonable expectation that these discussions will 
be successful. If the revenue remains consistent with previous years the Directors forecast that the Group’s cash resources will be used by March 2009. 
Foreign currency exchange: the Group monitors short- and medium-term exchange rates. The presentational currency of the Group is British 
pounds. The underlying currencies in which the Group’s revenues and costs are denominated are primarily US dollars and British pounds but also 
Australian dollars and Euros. The fact that the Group has a proportion of its revenues and costs denominated in a number of currencies can create 
and has created gains or losses arising from foreign exchange transactions. Although there is currently no existing policy in relation to hedging against 
currency fluctuations the rates are closely monitored.
The effect of legislation or other regulatory activities: the Group proactively monitors forthcoming and current legislation regularly.
New product, project and technology risk: the Group develops new technologies and introduces new products. All new technologies and 
products involve inherent business risk in terms of abortive expenditure, reputational risk and potentially customer claims and onerous contracts. 
Such risks may materially impact the Group.
Protection of intellectual property: all appropriate measures are taken to protect the Group’s intellectual property rights and to minimise the risk  
of infringement by third parties.
Research and development: the Group continues to invest in research and development to maintain technological advantage of its products and 
technology platform.
Competitive risk: the Group operates in highly competitive and innovative markets. Product and technological innovations by competitors could 
adversely affect the Group. The geographical diversity of operations and academic collaborations reduces the possible effect of action by any single 
competitor. The Group invests directly in research and development in order to sustain competitive advantage.
Please refer to the Financial Review for details of our key performance indicators.
Proposed dividend
The directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend.
Supplier payment policy
It is the Group’s policy to settle debts with its creditors on a timely basis, taking in to consideration the terms and conditions offered by each supplier. 
As at 31 December 2007 the number of days, purchases in creditors averaged 41 (2006: 43 days).

Annual Report and Accounts 2007 11 Corporate governance
Companies that have securities traded on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) are not required to comply with the disclosure requirements of the 
Combined Code. However, the Board is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and, whilst not fully complying, has taken 
steps to comply with the Combined Code in so far as it can given the size of the Company and the nature of its operations.
The Company has adopted and operates a share dealing code for Directors and senior employees on substantially the same terms as the Model 
Code appended to chapter 16 of the Listing Rules of the UKLA. The Board has established an Audit Committee, a Remuneration Committee and 
Nomination Committee. 
The Audit Committee is headed by Harry Karelis and comprises all the Non-executive Directors apart from David A Dodd who has a standing 
invitation to attend any meeting. It meets twice a year and is responsible for monitoring the quality of internal controls, ensuring that the financial 
performance of the Company is properly measured and reported on, meeting with the auditors and reviewing reports from the auditors relating  
to accounting and internal controls. It meets with the external auditors at least once a year.
The Remuneration Committee is headed by Mike Dexter and also includes the other Non-executive directors. It reviews the performance  
of executive directors and sets the scale and structure of their remuneration and the basis of their service agreements with due regard for the 
interests of shareholders. 
The Remuneration Committee also makes recommendations to the directors concerning the allocation of share options to employees. No director  
is permitted to participate in discussions or decisions concerning his own remuneration.
The Nomination committee is headed by Les Webb and also includes the other Non-executive directors and Peter Mountford as executive director. 
The committee meets at least twice a year to consider the size, structure and composition of the Board and retirements and appointments of 
additional and replacement directors and to make appropriate recommendations to the Board.
Political and charitable contributions
The Group made no political contributions or donations to UK charities during the year.
Qualifying third party indemnity
Certain directors benefited from qualifying third party indemnity provisions in place during the year and at the date of this report.
Substantial shareholdings
At the date of this report, the Company had been notified under section 198 of the Companies Act 1985 of the following notifiable holdings of the 
Company’s ordinary shares:
     Shares %
Secure Sciences Pty Ltd    2,728,598 8.14
Forest Nominees Ltd    2,674,239 7.98
JP Morgan Nominees Australia Ltd    1,800,000 5.37
HSBC Global Custody Nominee (UK) Ltd    1,270,000 3.79
Disclosure of information to auditors
The directors who held office at the date of the approval of this directors’ report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; each director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a director to make 
himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Auditors
In accordance with Section 384 of the Companies Act 1985, a resolution for the re-appointment of KPMG Audit Plc as auditors of the Company is  
to be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Directors’ Report
(continued)
Stem Cell Sciences plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 12 Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
in respect of the Directors’ Report and the Financial Statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and parent Company financial statements for each financial year. As required by the AIM  
Rules of the London Stock Exchange they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the  
EU and applicable laws and have elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements on the same basis.
The Group and parent Company financial statements are required by law and IFRSs as adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position of  
the Group and the parent Company and the performance for that period; the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such financial statements 
that references in the relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
In preparing each of the Group and parent Company financial statements, the directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; •	
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; •	
 state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and •	
 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent Company will •	
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
parent Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have a general responsibility  
for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. This report is made solely to the Company’s members,

members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do 
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report,  
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the consolidated financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 13.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent 
with the financial statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific information presented in the Financial Review that  
is cross referred from the Business Review section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements.  
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial 
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit 
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of 
the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. We planned and performed our audit so as to 
obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also 
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements. 
Opinion
In our opinion: 
 the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, of the state of the Group’s affairs as  •	
at 31 December 2007 and of its loss for the year then ended; 
 the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU as applied in accordance with •	
the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, of the state of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2007
 have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and •	
 the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements. •	
Emphasis of matter – going concern and capitalised development expenditure 
In forming our opinion on the financial statements, which is not qualified, we have considered the adequacy of the disclosures made in note 2 to 
the financial statements concerning the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern which is significantly dependent upon the Group concluding 
commercial agreements with a view to generating cash inflows in line with projections. As the preparation of the financial statements on the going 
concern basis, and recoverability of capitalised development expenditure, assumes the successful generation of revenues which is not yet certain, 
this indicates the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  
The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group was unable to continue as a going concern and recover  
its assets.

Stem Cell Sciences plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 21 Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Reporting entity 
Stem Cell Sciences plc (the ‘Company’) is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The consolidated financial statements of the Company  
for the year ended 31 December 2007 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’) and the Group’s interest  
in associates. 
The parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 25 February 2008. 
2. Basis of preparation
Statement of compliance
Both the parent Company financial statements and the Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRSs’). On publishing the parent Company financial statements here 
together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to present its 
individual income statement and related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements. These are the first financial statements of the 
Group and the Company prepared in accordance with adopted IFRSs and IFRS 1 has been applied. An explanation of how the transition to IFRS has 
affected the reported financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Group and the Company is provided in note 24. This note includes 
reconciliations of equity and profit or loss for comparative periods reported under UK GAAP to those reported for those periods under adopted IFRSs. 
The Company has elected not to restate business combinations prior to the date of transition to adopted IFRSs and cumulative translation differences  
for all foreign operations have been set to zero at 1 January 2006. 
Going concern
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis which the directors believe to be appropriate for the following reasons:
The Group is involved in the research, development and commercialisation of stem cells and stem cell technology. At this stage of its development 
it has limited revenues arising from licensing arrangements, contract research and product sales and its costs exceed its revenue. The Group will 
continue to absorb cash until its products are commercialised. 
The Group’s current cash resources are forecast by the Directors as being sufficient to enable it to continue to trade for the foreseeable future.  
However, the projections include revenues which are not certain and which significantly exceed those received in previous years. The Directors are 
currently in the process of talking with prospective licensing partners and other customers and have a reasonable expectation that these discussions will 
be successful. If the revenue remains consistent with previous years the Directors forecast that the Group’s cash resources will be used by March 2009. 
While there can be no certainty that the forecast revenues will be generated, the Directors are of the opinion that, taking into account existing cash 
resources available to the Group, sufficient revenue will be generated to enable the Group to continue to trade for at least twelve months from the 
date of approval of these financial statements. If the revenue generation is later than anticipated the Directors would take appropriate steps to reduce 
the level of cash outflow.
However, as noted there can be no certainty in relation to these matters, which may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern and doubt over the recoverability of capitalised development expenditure. The Group may, therefore, be unable to continue realising 
its assets and discharging its liabilities in the normal course of business, but the financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result 
from the going concern basis of preparation being inappropriate. 
Basis of measurement
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis.
Functional and presentational currency
The financial statements are presented in British pounds rounded to the nearest thousand. 
u se of estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements which comply with the provisions of adopted IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as income and expenses. The estimates and 
associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,  
the results of which form the basis of the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may 
differ from these estimates.
Stem Cell Sciences plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 22 The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period  
in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both 
current and future periods.
In particular, information about significant areas of uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant 
effect on the financial statements is included in note 12 on intangible assets.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently by all Group entities to all periods presented in these consolidated financial 
statements and in preparing an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2006 for the purposes of the transition to adopted IFRSs.
3. Significant accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an 
entity to obtain benefits from its activities. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date 
that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings in the Company are stated at cost less any permanent impairment.
Associates (equity accounted investees)
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. The consolidated 
financial statements include the Group’s share of the total recognised income and expense of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the 
date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in 
an associate, the Group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has 
incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an associate.
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing 
the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no 
evidence of impairment.
Revenue
Revenue represents amounts receivable from product sales, collaborative research agreements and licence fees net of sales related taxes.
Revenue is recognised when there is evidence of an agreement, delivery of the product has occurred and the selling price is determined. No revenue 
is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due, associated costs or the possible return of products.
a) Product sales are recognised as revenue when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer.
b) Fees for collaborative research are deferred and recognised over the period of the agreement.
c) Revenue is recognised immediately in respect of licensed technology once all significant performance obligations have been met.
Segmental reporting
A business segment is a group of assets and operations that provide a product or service and that are subject to risks and returns that are different 
from other business segments. A geographic segment is a group of assets and operations that provide a product or service within a particular 
economic environment and that are subject to risks and returns that are different from segments operating in different economic environments.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at that date. Foreign exchange gains  
and losses on translation are included in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the rate at the date of  
the transaction. 
The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary operations are translated at the closing exchange rates. The income and expenses of foreign operations 
are translated to British pounds at average exchange rates for the period to approximate to the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. 
Stem Cell Sciences plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 23 Notes to the Financial Statements
(continued)
3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslations are recognised directly in a separate component of equity. Since 1 January 2006, the Group’s 
date of transition to IFRSs, such differences have been recognised in the foreign exchange reserve. When a foreign operation is disposed of, in part  
or in full, the relevant amount of the foreign exchange reserve is transferred to profit or loss. The Group has taken advantage of the relief available in 
IFRS 1 to deem the cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations to be zero at the date of transition to adopted IFRSs (1 January 2006).
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment loss. Cost includes expenditure that is directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the asset.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment over the estimated useful lives of each part  
of plant and equipment as follows:
Plant and equipment 25% – 40%
  
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
intangible assets
Research and development
Expenditure on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding is recognised  
in the income statement when incurred.
Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes. An internally generated 
intangible asset arising from the Group’s development expenditure is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met:
an asset is created that can be identified (such as new processes); •	
there is an intention to complete and use the intangible asset; •	
it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; •	
the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably; •	
the product or process is technically and commercially feasible; and •	
sufficient resources are available to complete the development and to either sell or use the asset. •	
Development costs recognised as intangible assets are amortised over their expected useful lives.
Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it  
is incurred. 
Research and development costs include personnel charges in respect of persons working wholly or exclusively on process or product development.
Leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Grants
Grants relating to expenditure on research and development are recognised in the income statement on a basis consistent with the research and 
development expenditure policy. Capital based grants are included within liabilities and credited to the income statement over the estimated useful 
lives of the assets to which they relate. 
Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Share based payment transactions
The share option programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Company. The fair value of options granted after 7 November 
2002 and those not yet vested at 1 January 2006 is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value 
is measured at the date of grant and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to options. The amount 
recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where variations are due only to share prices  
not achieving the threshold for vesting. 
Stem Cell Sciences plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 24 The proceeds received, net of any directly attributable expenses, are credited to share capital and share premium when the options are exercised.
income tax
The tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. 
 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated by using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Income tax credits relate to credits receivable for research and development  
expenditure incurred.
Deferred tax is calculated using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected 
manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date.
   
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be 
utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive 
potential ordinary shares.
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, cash equivalents and various items such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly 
from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Group’s operations. The Group does not enter into derivative 
transactions for speculative purposes. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and at bank.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at their fair value and then stated at amortised cost.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at their fair value and then stated at amortised cost.
impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets, other than financial assets and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment 
losses are recognised in the income statement.
Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of the Group’s receivables carried at amortised cost is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows, 
discounted at the original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition of these financial assets).  
Receivables with a short duration are not discounted.
The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the  
cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Reversals of impairment
An impairment loss in respect of a receivable carried at amortised cost is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be related 
objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
Stem Cell Sciences plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 25 Notes to the Financial Statements
(continued)
3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist and there has been 
a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Adoption of international Financial Reporting Standards
Interpretations of existing standards and new standards that are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Group are listed below.
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2007, and have not 
been applied in preparing these financial statements. Those which may have a significant effect on the financial statements are:
IFRS 8 •	 Operating Segments (endorsed), which becomes mandatory for the Group’s 2009 financial statements, will require the disclosure of 
segment information based on the internal reports regularly reviewed by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker in order to assess each 
segment’s performance and to allocate resources to segments.
4. Segmental information
The Group comprises the following main business segments:
 •	 SC Proven supplies growth formulations and other reagents for cell based research;
 SC Services •	 provides custom engineering and supplies cells for research, drug discovery and development;
 •	 SC Licensing provides access to proprietary stem cell technologies. 
Any revenue, overheads, assets or liabilities that cannot be directly allocated to these segments is reported under ‘Unallocated’.

Unallocated corporate items include those certain assets and liabilities that are not specifically allocated to business segments as these assets and 
liabilities are utilised, managed and reported centrally across all business segments. Consequently it is not possible to provide a meaningful allocation 
of the unallocated corporate assets and liabilities for each business segment as this cannot be done on a reasonable basis.
All segments are continuing operations. There are no other non-cash expenses.

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £12.0 million (2006: £9.6 million) which may be carried forward for utilisation against 
taxable profits in future years. The availability of certain of these losses to be offset against future profits is dependent on future suitable profits being 
generated and the appropriate tax authority clearances being granted. £5.6 million of the losses arise in Australia where there is some uncertainty over 
their future availability due to the requirement to obtain tax authority clearances and £1.9 million of the losses are in relation to excess management 
expenses in the parent Company which may only be utilised against future suitable profits.
The Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset in relation to these tax losses. The asset will be recognised in future periods when its recovery 
(against appropriate taxable profits) is considered to be more likely than not.
10. Loss per share
Basic and diluted loss per share 
The calculation of basic loss per share at 31 December 2007 was based on the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of £3,507,000  
(2006: £2,710,000) and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year ended 31 December 2007 of 30,351,000  
(2006: 22,301,000), calculated as follows:
    2007 2006
    £’000 £’000
  
Issued ordinary shares at 1 January 22,301 22,301
Effect of shares issued in April 2007 8,050 –
Weighted average number of ordinary shares at 31 December 30,351 22,301
The loss attributable to ordinary shares and the number of ordinary shares for the purpose of calculating the diluted earnings per share are identical 
to those used for basic earnings per share. The exercise of share options would have the effect of reducing the loss per share and consequently is 
not taken into account in the calculation for diluted loss per share.
At 31 December 2007 there were 2,736,200 (2006: 1,833,788) options outstanding with an average exercise price of £0.47 (2006: £0.50) which are 
not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because they are antidilutive at those dates.

The amortisation charge is recognised in the research and development line item in the income statement.
The directors consider the costs incurred on each project when determining the point at which they should commence and cease to capitalise 
development costs. Costs are capitalised when either an agreement has been reached with a partner to develop a specific project which will earn  
the Group royalties once a product is in production or when there is an identified market that will result in the Group generating future revenues for  
a product. Costs cease to be capitalised when the products are commercially produced and the Group is generating revenues.
Amortisation periods are considered separately for development costs capitalised on individual projects. Amortisation periods in relation to current 
capitalised development costs range from five to ten years depending on the anticipated life of the products.

17. Share capital and reserves (continued)
Foreign exchange reserve 
The foreign exchange reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of the overseas 
subsidiary since the transition date to adopted IFRS. The Group has elected not to restate business combinations prior to the date of transition  
to adopted IFRS and cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations have been set to zero at 1 January 2006. 
Merger reserve
The merger reserve arose when the Company was admitted to AIM in 2005 and merger accounting, which was permitted under applicable accounting 
standards at that time, was adopted. As this was before the date of transition to IFRS advantage has been taken of the provisions of IFRS 1 which allow 
this business combination not to be restated.
Capital redemption reserve
The capital redemption reserve arose through a capital reconstruction that took place during 2006. On 1 November 2006, a resolution was passed to 
sub-divide each of the issued and unissued ordinary shares of £0.50 each in the capital of the Company to one ordinary share of £0.01 each and one 
deferred Share of £0.49. On 9 November 2006 the Company issued one ordinary share for £0.46 in connection with a capital reorganisation of the 
Company and used part of the proceeds received from that issue to buy back all the deferred shares which were in issue. Following the buy-back  
of the deferred shares by the Company all of the deferred shares were cancelled.
18. Share based payments
Equity settled share option plans 
In previous years the Group has established a number of share option schemes that entitle directors, senior management and other employees to 
purchase shares in the Company. Grants have been made of share options in the period from 2005 to date. During 2007 share options were granted 
to directors, senior management and employees as part of a long-term incentive scheme and further options were granted under existing schemes.  
In accordance with these share option schemes, options are exercisable at the market price of the shares at the date of grant.

restrictions, and behavioural considerations.

19. Financial instruments
The Group’s and the Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents together with trade receivables and trade payables  
which arise directly from their operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Group’s and the Company’s operations. 
During the years ended 31 December 2007 and 2006 neither the Group or the Company used derivative instruments to hedge exposure to foreign 
exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities. The Group and the Company do not hold or issue 
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Exposure to market risks (which include currency and interest rate risk) and credit risks arises in the normal course of the Group’s and the  
Company’s business.
Credit risk
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Credit evaluations are performed on all 
customers requiring credit over a certain amount. 
Stem Cell Sciences plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 36 Counterparties for cash deposits are limited to financial institutions which have a high credit rating. 
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying 
amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet as follows: 
   Group Company
  2007 2006 2007 2006
  £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000
Trade and other receivables  224 258 18 97
Cash and cash equivalents  3,607 2,463 3,350 2,203
   3,831 2,721 3,368 2,300
All trade receivables were current at the year end. There are no impairment allowances made against trade receivables in the Group. In the Company, 
amounts owed by subsidiaries of £5,060,000 have been fully impaired in previous years and are carried at a recoverable amount of £nil. 
Currency risk
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than British pounds. The currencies 
giving rise to this risk are primarily Australian dollars and US dollars.
Foreign exchange risk arises from transactions, assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations. The Group does not use foreign 
exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk.
The majority of the Group’s revenues are denominated in US dollars. The Group’s operating costs are denominated in British pounds, Australian 
dollars and US dollars.
   
In respect of monetary assets and liabilities held in currencies other than British pounds, the Group ensures that the net exposure is kept to an 
acceptable level, by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates where necessary to address short-term imbalances.
The Group has investments in foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to currency translation risk. This currency exposure arises from 
the net assets of the Group’s foreign operations denominated in Australian dollars. There is currently no requirement for borrowings, therefore this 
exposure is not managed through borrowings denominated in Australian dollars. 
Sensitivity analysis
A 5% strengthening of the British pound against the Australian dollar and the US dollar at 31 December 2007 would have an immaterial impact on the 
Group and Company’s loss for the year.

Notes to the reconciliations of equity
a) IAS 38 Intangible Assets has resulted in the Group capitalising development expenditure that meets the criteria set out in the standard.  
The Group’s accounting policy in respect of research and development expenditure is set out in note 3 to these financial statements.
b) The Group has taken advantage of the exemption under IFRS 1 – First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards to  
reset cumulative translation differences at the date of transition to zero.
The transition to IFRS has not resulted in any changes to the Company’s balance sheet at 1 January or 31 December 2006.
A separate cash flow reconciliation has not been provided in the notes as all information relevant to understanding the cash flow statement has  
been included on the face of the statement. Transition to IFRS has resulted in the Company disclosing a cash flow statement for the first time.

Annual Report and Accounts 2007 42 Frequently Asked Questions
What are stem cells?
Stem cells are special cells with a unique growth characteristic.  
They can make identical copies of themselves, as well as grow into more 
specialised cell types. For example, blood stem cells found in the bone 
marrow can generate both red blood cells that can carry oxygen and 
white blood cells that can fight infection. Blood stem cells in the body 
continue the supply of blood cells for the life of a person.
Are there different types of stem cells?
There are many different types of stem cells. Stem cells can be broadly 
divided into different types depending on where they are found.
For example, tissue stem cells are present in many tissues, such as  
skin and liver. Tissue stem cells isolated from adult tissue are technically 
known as somatic stem cells, but can broadly be considered as tissue  
or adult stem cells. In contrast, stem cells isolated from embryos are 
called embryonic stem cells.
Do all adult tissues have stem cells?
Stem cells do not reside in all tissues. Tissues that can repair themselves 
such as skin have abundant tissue specific stem cells. However some 
tissues which are difficult to self-repair, such as heart muscle, have very 
few stem cells.
What is so special about embryonic stem cells?
Past scientific evidence has suggested that some adult stem cells,  
such as nerve and blood stem cells, may also have the ability to grow 
into other cell types. While this would be an exciting prospect if it 
occurred on a regular basis, this interpretation is not supported by  
recent scientific findings. The growth and availability of the starting  
stem cell would still be a limiting factor. 
Where do embryonic stem cells come from?
Embryonic stem cells can be isolated from seven-day-old embryos. 
Embryos at this stage are microscopic in size (smaller than the full-stop 
at the end of this sentence) and consist of a ball of approximately one 
hundred cells. At this stage the embryo has only two types of cells,  
those that make the animal or person, and those which will make the 
tissues which connect the foetus to the mother. 
Human embryonic stem cells have been isolated from IVF embryos  
that have been donated by patients at the end of their treatment  
(so-called ‘spare’ IVF embryos), or created from donated eggs and 
sperm specifically for embryonic stem cell isolation.
What are cord stem cells?
Cord stem cells are a type of blood stem cell that can be isolated  
in significant numbers from the placenta and umbilical cord of a  
newborn baby. 
Cord stem cells have been successfully collected and stored as frozen 
cells, and then some years later used as a source of the baby’s own 
blood stem cells for transplantation.
Stem cells are special 
cells with a unique 
growth characteristic.  
They can make identical 
copies of themselves, as 
well as grow into more 
specialised cell types. 
Stem Cell Sciences plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 43 Frequently Asked Questions
(continued)
What are foetal stem cells?
Foetal stem cells are isolated from foetuses aborted during early 
pregnancy. Many different types of tissue-specific stem cells can be 
isolated from foetal tissue, including some tissue stem cells that cannot 
be found in the adult.
Stem cells very similar to embryonic stem cells, called embryonic germ 
cells, have also been collected from foetal mouse tissue, though the 
ability to establish equivalent human cell lines has not been proven.
Why are stem cells of such importance in medicine?
Many researchers believe that stem cells may revolutionise human 
medicine through their ability to make new cells to replace a patient’s 
diseased or damaged cells.
The most promising use of stem cells may be to treat patients where  
the disease condition results from a loss of cells, and the patient is 
unable to repair or replace the poorly functioning cells on its own. 
Currently incurable diseases such as diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, 
spinal cord injury, heart attack, stroke and traumatic brain injury could 
all be treated by transferring new cells, generated from stem cells,  
to the patient.
A very important benefit of stem cell therapy is that it is expected to 
provide cures. For example, transplanted insulin-producing cells will 
continue to produce insulin for the life of a diabetic.
Are stem cells currently being used to treat patients?
The best example of stem cell based therapy is the transplantation  
of bone marrow stem cells for patients with leukaemia and other blood 
disorders. Another example of stem cell based therapy is the use of  
skin biopsies that are expanded in the laboratory to treat patients  
with severe burns.
For technical reasons, by far the majority, if not all, of cell therapies 
require or will dramatically benefit from growing stem cells in the 
laboratory before use. The full promise of stem cell based therapy  
is yet to be realised, as tissue stem cells cannot yet be grown well  
in the laboratory and the options available with human embryonic  
stem cells will need a great deal of further research and development. 
Which stem cells are most promising and why?
To be useful in patient treatment, stem cells need to be grown in the 
laboratory into specific cell types. 
While stem cells isolated from foetal tissue, umbilical cord blood and 
adult tissue may be used for cell therapy, only embryonic stem cells  
can be grown in significant quantities in the laboratory and retain the 
ability to develop into any cell in the body. Other types of stem cells  
are restricted in the types of cells they can produce, and are difficult  
to grow in the laboratory. 
It is only through extensive research that the most effective means  
of providing cells for treatment will be identified.
What are the limitations of using embryonic  
stem cells?
Several obstacles need to be overcome before embryonic stem  
cell based therapy is a realistic treatment option for patients.
As embryonic stem cells have the potential to grow into any cell type in 
the body, it must be ensured that the purified populations of specialised 
cells for patient therapy no longer contain any non-specialised embryonic 
stem cells. Non-specialised embryonic stem cells carry the risk of tumour 
formation following transplantation, as they may continue to grow when 
implanted into the body.
The possibility of tissue rejection must also be addressed. Like all 
transplantation procedures, cells generated from embryonic stem  
cells will need to be tissue-matched so that the patient will not reject  
the transplanted cells. Transplant recipients would most probably also 
require long-term anti-rejection treatments that contribute undesirable 
side effects. 
One alternative might be to establish banks of embryonic stem cells. 
However, the number of embryonic stem cell lines required in order  
to provide meaningful benefit would be very large.
Another possibility is to use cloning techniques to create an embryo from 
a patient’s own cell and use this embryo to isolate embryonic stem cells. 
Embryonic stem cells isolated this way would share the same genetic 
make-up as the patient, and therefore problems of donor matching and 
rejection would be avoided.
Further research will be required to address these limitations and  
to identify which option will provide the best clinical outcome.
Stem Cell Sciences plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 44 What are some of the ethical issues related to 
embryonic stem cells and human embryo research?
The principal objection to the use of embryonic stem cells is that a 
human embryo must be destroyed. 
Despite the possibility that stem cells isolated from embryos could offer 
enormous potential for improving the quality of life for people suffering 
from incurable diseases, opponents of human embryo research claim  
no benefit can justify the destruction of an embryo. 
While most people would agree that embryos are potential human 
beings, and therefore entitled to be treated with respect, many also 
believe that human embryos are not entitled to the full rights normally 
bestowed upon an actual person. One example of this difference is 
evident in law in Australia and other countries where abortion is legal.
While it is true that all embryos have the potential to develop into a new 
person, reproductive biology is very inefficient and not every embryo  
that is created will develop into an actual person.
To date most human embryonic stem cell lines have been generated 
from donated IVF embryos. In order to treat infertility, more embryos than 
may be required are often created. At the completion of their treatment, 
IVF patients can either donate the ‘surplus’ embryos to another couple, 
donate the embryos to research, or discard the embryos. 
Every year around the world, hundreds of IVF embryos, no longer 
required by the patients, are discarded. Most people view the destruction 
of these ‘surplus’ embryos negatively and many would rather see some 
form of beneficial outcome. The use of embryos for embryonic stem cell 
isolation and the potential treatment of patients with incurable diseases is 
one potential use.
A second objection revolves around the issue of creation of embryos for 
research. Recently, human embryos have been created from donated 
eggs and sperm specifically for the isolation of embryonic stem cells. 
This strategy is widely considered as ethically questionable as it involves 
the generation of a new, genetically individual embryo purely for potential 
benefit to others. It has also been suggested that cloning techniques could 
be used to create embryos for embryonic stem cell isolation. 
This so-called therapeutic cloning approach does not require the 
creation of a new genetically distinct embryo by egg/sperm fusion, 
but rather produces embryonic cells that are copies of the patient. 
This would ensure that the patient will not reject cells following 
transplantation. 
Yet another possibility is that animal eggs, instead of human eggs,  
could be used in therapeutic cloning. This option is now regarded by 
most researchers as being technically unsound and a possible risk to  
the patient. 
Opponents view research as equivalent to destruction or death of the 
embryo, even though cells isolated from such an embryo may have  
life-saving potential for a patient.
The ethical issues surrounding the use of human embryos are of significant 
concern and interest in modern society. These issues need to be thoroughly 
and openly reviewed with wide community participation before defining 
legislation is enacted.
How are different countries regulating human  
embryo research?
Human embryo research is viewed and regulated differently in different 
countries and even differently between states and territories within 
a country. This ranges from progressive, well-regulated legislation in 
the United Kingdom, to approved guidelines in Japan and complete 
prohibition in Germany.
Stem Cell Sciences plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 45 Defining the science
What are Stem Cells?
Stem cells are undifferentiated (unspecialised) cells, which can divide 
to make copies of themselves, or differentiate (change) to become 
specialised cells of the body such as muscle cells, nerve cells or  
blood cells.
There are two basic types of stem cells: Embryonic Stem (ES) cells  
and Tissue-specific (also called adult or somatic) stem cells. 
ES cells, derived from a pre-implantation embryo, can grow and 
differentiate into all specialised cell types found in the body, and due 
to this ability are referred to as ‘pluripotent’. Tissue-specific stem 
cells, sourced from body tissue, have a more restricted potential and 
can usually only differentiate into their own or related cell type and 
are referred to as ‘multipotent’. In the body these cells facilitate the 
replacement or repair of diseased or damaged cells in organs such  
as the gut, skin, brain or pancreas.

Stem Cell Sciences plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 46 Benefits of Stem Cells
Stem cells are an important biological resource for the advancement 
of human medicine, because they can potentially be grown in large 
quantities and yet still produce highly specialised cell types found in the 
body – in essence, an unlimited laboratory grown supply of virtually any 
cell type. Stem cells can provide an important benefit to humans via: 
Gene and drug discovery
 Testing the function of the large number of genes generated from  •	
the Human Genome Project
 Testing millions of potential new drugs in a ‘human environment’ •	
 Reducing the need for animal testing •	
 Studying disease onset and progression (disease modelling) •	
Cell therapy
Replacing diseased or damaged cells in patient tissues •	
Correcting genetic disorders (when combined with gene therapy) •	
The Stem Cell Challenge
The greatest challenge facing the application of stem cells in drug 
discovery and cell therapy is the limited quality and quantity of cells that 
are available for research today. Our objective is to achieve safe, robust, 
reproducible stem cell production in the laboratory on a large scale,  
by utilising knowledge of those molecules and processes that control  
the growth and differentiation of normal stem cells in the body.
Today, human and animal cells are already being applied in drug 
discovery but the cells currently in use are typically either laboratory 
grown cancer-like cells or tissue-specific cells, isolated from human 
or animal donor tissues. The use of cancer-like cells does not form an 
attractive template on which to test novel drugs. Unlike stem cells,  
they are not ‘normal’ cells and are thought to be unrepresentative of the 
context in which the drug will act (unless for cancer). The utilisation of 
donor tissue-specific cells, although representative, is proving restrictive 
due to limitations in supply and variation between cell batches sourced 
from different donors. Only Embryonic Stem (ES) cells and a few types  
of tissue-specific stem cells currently demonstrate robust, stable growth 
in the laboratory.
Stem Cell Sciences, through the development of its cell culture systems 
and technologies, has established a methodology to solve this problem 
and produce safe, robust and reproducible stem cells. This is achieved 
via the development of proprietary stem cell culture growth media 
(liquid stem cell culture growth formulations) for optimal growth and 
differentiation of stem cells. In contrast to current industry standards,  
the Company’s medium are serum-free and promote robust stem cell 
growth in the absence of ‘feeder’ cells (helper cells added to cultures 
to promote stem cell growth via production of poorly defined growth 
factors). The elimination of animal serum and feeder cells, known sources  
of undesirable agents affecting stem cell performance and safety,  
will provide scientists with a significant advantage in the future 
production of stem cells for clinical use.

the conversion of genetic information encoded in a gene into either 
messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA) or ribosomal RNA (rRNA) 
through a process called transcription. Transcription precedes translation 
of RNA into protein.
Genetic engineering 
scientific alteration of the structure of genetic material in a living organism. 
It involves the production and use of recombinant DNA and has been 
employed to create bacteria that synthesise insulin and other human 
proteins, and to change specific genes in cells and animals.
Growth factor 
a substance that affects the growth of a cell or an organism.
Multipotent 
stem cells can produce multiple cell types, for example red and white 
blood cells, but not all cell types.
Nervous system 
the system of cells, tissues and organs that regulate the body’s responses 
to internal and external stimuli. In vertebrates it consists of the brain,  
spinal cord, nerves, ganglia and parts of the receptor and effector organs.
Neural 
of or relating to a nerve or the nervous system.
Neural cells
mature, specialised cells of the nervous system including neurons, 
astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.
Neural stem cell or NS cell 
a stem cell found in adult neural tissue that can replicate itself or give rise 
to mature cells of the brain: neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.
Neurons 
nerve cells, the structural and functional unit of the nervous system.  
A neuron consists of a cell body and its processes, an axon, and one  
or more dendrites. Neurons function by the initiation and conduction  
of impulses and transmit impulses to other neurons or cells by releasing 
neurotransmitters at synapses.
NS Technology 
also referred to as Neural Stem Cell Technology: methods and tools  
to derive and grow self-renewing neural stem cells, obtained to date  
from mouse, rat and human tissue.
Oligodendrocytes 
a cell that provides insulation to nerve cells by forming a myelin sheath 
around axons.
Parkinson’s disease 
a progressive nervous disease occurring most often after the age of 50, 
associated with the destruction of brain cells that produce dopamine  
and characterised by muscular tremor, slowing of movement, partial 
facial paralysis, peculiarity of gait and posture, and weakness.  
Also called paralysis agitans, shaking palsy.
Phase i 
the first safety test of a potential therapeutic in humans, usually conducted 
in healthy volunteers.
Phase ii
early clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety trials conducted on 
a limited number of patients. They include dose-ranging studies to 
establish an appropriate range of doses.
Phase iii 
major efficacy and safety trials in large numbers of patients in  
multiple centres.
Pluripotent 
ability of a single stem cell to develop into all different cell types of  
the body.
Pre-clinical 
prior to testing in humans.

Stem Cell Sciences plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 48 Reprogramming 
resetting the developmental clock of a nucleus; for example, resetting 
the developmental state of an adult differentiated cell nucleus so that it 
can carry out the genetic program of an early embryonic cell nucleus, 
making all the proteins required for embryonic development.
Spinal cord 
the thick, whitish cord of nerve tissue that extends from the medulla 
oblongata down through the spinal column and from which the spinal 
nerves branch off to various parts of the body.
Spinal cord injury 
damage in the spinal cord, called myelopathy, which can result in 
paraplegia or quadriplegia, depending on the level of the damage  
within the spinal cord.
Stem cells 
unspecialised human or animal cells which can replicate themselves 
and/or give rise to mature specialised cells (e.g. blood cells).
Stem Cell Selection 
part of the Group’s Selection Technology, methods and tools for 
obtaining pure populations of stem cells, and protected by the patent 
family as set out under paragraph 4.2 of the Patent Agent’s report in 
Part IV of this document.
Tissue 
an aggregation of morphologically similar cells and associated 
intercellular matter acting together to perform one or more specific 
functions in the body. 
Tissue-specific stem cell
(also known as adult or somatic stem cell) an undifferentiated cell found 
in a differentiated tissue that can renew itself and (with certain limitations) 
differentiate to yield all the specialised cell types of the tissue from which 
it originated.
u ndifferentiated
not having changed to become a specialised cell type.

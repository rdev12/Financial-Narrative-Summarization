WE THINK LONG-TERM
We take a long-term approach to 
regeneration and development and 
during any project lifecycle we are 
flexible enough to move with market 
demands and pursue those opportunities 
that generate the greatest value at any 
one time. We work hard to build and 
maintain long-term relationships with 
local authorities, our shareholders and 
our partners.
WE ARE INNOVATIVE
We continuously explore new ways 
to develop our land bank in order to 
generate sustainable value for all our 
stakeholders. We look beyond standard 
development routes to create innovative 
schemes that strive to meet the needs 
and expectations of local residents, 
businesses and the wider community, 
and create value for our shareholders.
WE DO WHAT WE SAY
We are a straight-talking company. 
Colleagues, customers, suppliers and 
stakeholders can rely on us to deliver 
on the promises and commitments we 
make and to bring about long-term, 
sustainable regeneration.

THE LAND 
BANK
Our long-term view allows us to acquire assets at low 
cost and then maximise their potential by steadily adding 
value to them over time through remediation and planning. 
Then to realise any increase in value, we either dispose or 
release assets for development ourselves or in joint venture. 
WHAT DIFFERENTIATES US?
The diverse and extensive nature of our £1.3bn land bank 
provides us with the flexibility to move with market demands 
and, coupled with our local expertise, means we can pursue 
value-creating opportunities. A considerable proportion of our 
land bank is held at relatively low value, giving us access to a 
wide variety of development opportunities without the need 
for significant financing.
DELIVERY
When we are unable to add any further significant value to 
an asset, we seek market-driven opportunities to dispose of 
it, either through the delivery of pre-let and pre-sold buildings 
or the sale of land. Cash generated on the sale provides 
recycled capital to invest in the business and supports the 
delivery of long-term shareholder value creation through a 
progressive dividend policy.
WHAT DIFFERENTIATES US?
We continue to find good development opportunities that 
generate value for the business. Where industrial and 
commercial occupiers have immediate requirements for 
new premises, we are able to react quickly to meet their 
demands with sites that already benefit from planning. 
Our regeneration projects continue to serve as catalysts 
for change, impacting positively on the local economy and 
attracting a variety of occupiers.
ASSET 
DEVELOPMENT
We increase the value of our land bank over time using our 
expertise in and hands-on approach to remediation and 
regeneration, managing sites, public consultation and the 
planning process. Our skills can be applied effectively to 
small developments or be used to navigate complex and 
long-term projects. 
WHAT DIFFERENTIATES US?
Our ability to progress our land bank successfully through 
the planning process and our expertise in brownfield land 
remediation and other aspects of regeneration make us an 
attractive partner to both landowners and public bodies. 
The skill and experience of our people are fundamental to 
the success of our asset development activities and we 
continue to retain, develop and incentivise them.
RECURRING 
INCOME
Whilst all of our assets are ultimately held with a view to 
generating significant future value, some also produce 
a steady income stream prior to development which 
underpins the running costs of the business. This ensures 
that commitments can be met if development profits fall and 
enables us to extract the maximum value from our land bank 
in the short-term.
WHAT DIFFERENTIATES US?
We employ locally-based asset development capability to 
manage the assets as efficiently as possible. We typically offer 
low affordable rents on relatively short tenancies which ensure 
that voids remain low as we prepare sites for development. 
The diversity of occupiers in our income producing properties 
helps us to avoid overexposure to a single scheme, sector or 
tenant. Strategic Report

OUR BUSINESS MODEL

Resources
EMPLOYEES
Our employees are a valued and vital part of the business 
and we aim to attract, develop and retain the best people, 
whose efforts, expertise and judgement we can leverage 
across our extensive portfolio. We have a highly skilled 
in-house team encompassing all facets of the industry. 
They safeguard our principles of delivering high-quality, 
sustainable developments as a legacy for businesses and 
communities to enjoy for years to come.
FINANCIAL CAPITAL
We are a stable business, operating from a robust financial 
position and underpinned by a recurring income stream from 
our £539m portfolio of income producing assets. This enables 
us to acquire assets to which we can add value. In turn, our 
partners and key stakeholders can trust in our ability to fulfil 
contracts and deliver projects on time and to budget. 
LAND BANK
We actively manage a £1.3bn UK-wide portfolio of 
development opportunities across a land bank of 5,900 
acres. We acquire this land specifically to develop it out to 
create homes and communities in which people can live 
and work. At any point in time we are either actively building, 
remediating or pursuing planning permissions which allow us 
to transform this land into thriving communities or business 
destinations that will encourage growth across the country. 
BUILDINGS
Across our portfolio we retain a bank of assets which 
generate income whilst awaiting development. Once we are 
ready to progress their redevelopment we will reclaim and 
recycle as much of the existing materials as is possible. 
The redeveloped asset is then either retained for income 
or sold. St. Modwen Properties PLC Results Announcement 201 4 07

Relationships
PRIVATE SECTOR AND JOINT VENTURES
We have formed strong relationships with many private 
sector partners. Linked by our skills and culture, these 
partnerships are established through joint ventures, strategic 
land acquisitions and development agreements. All bring 
about successful regeneration and development projects 
that in turn stimulate investment and growth. Our private 
sector partners include VINCI PLC, Persimmon PLC and 
Salhia Real Estate Company K.S.C. 
PUBLIC SECTOR AND REGULATORS
We also work hand in hand with a variety of public sector 
organisations across the Country including many local 
authorities, some of which we have been in partnership 
for over 10 years either through joint venture initiatives or 
Development Agreements. We also work closely with key 
Government regulators such as the Environment Agency 
and Highways Agency to ensure our projects are of the 
highest standard.
SUPPLY CHAIN
We have a careful contractor selection process. Many of 
our contractors work with us on a number of schemes and 
we share a mutual trust to deliver our projects to the 
highest standard, within budget and on time. We maintain 
close involvement with our contractors throughout the 
construction process.
LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND TENANTS
Our network of seven regional offices provides us with local 
knowledge and expertise that keeps us abreast of the needs 
of local communities, ensuring we remain politically and 
economically sensitive to each area.
We engage with communities throughout the entire 
development process and value their input and support. 
Our locally-based asset management teams regularly engage 
with our tenants, many occupying more than one site across 
our portfolio.  Strategic Report

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Bill Shannon
Non-executive Chairman
This is a record year 
for St. Modwen with 
the business 
achieving profit 
before all tax 
of £138. 1m.
I am very proud to be reporting on a record year for  
St. Modwen with the business achieving 17% growth in net 
asset value to 324.9p per share (2013: 278.8p per share) and 
profit before all tax of £138.1m (2013: £82.2m). 
This outstanding set of results has been helped by strong 
valuation gains across our portfolio attributable to our 
planning and asset management initiatives, combined with 
positive movements in the UK residential and commercial 
marketplaces which reflect the overall upturn in the economy. 
Sitting alongside our robust business strategy, at the heart 
of our success and inherent to St. Modwen, is a set of core 
values. They reflect our strengths and our approach to all 
facets of regeneration. In a year of record profits, these 
values have never been more relevant. We have set them out 
below, together with examples from our business activities 
highlighting our individual approach.
We think long-term
Over the last few years we have continued to focus on our 
regional portfolio, placing strong emphasis on asset managing 
our income producing properties and preparing sites for 
delivery for when the market conditions are appropriate. 
This long-term approach has positioned us well, enabling 
us to respond quickly to the increase in demand across the 
regional market as it continues to recover and benefit from the 
meaningful contribution the regions have made to this year’s 
record results. 
Our long-term approach to regeneration is exemplified by the 
£1bn regeneration of Longbridge, Birmingham, one of our 
major projects. Having started on site in 2007, we continued 
to deliver this important scheme throughout the recession, 
creating hundreds of new homes, the new 250,000 sq ft 
Bournville College and a 150,000 sq ft T echnology Park. 
We have since launched the new £100m T own Centre and in 
October 2014 we started on site with the second phase retail 
anchor, a 150,000 sq ft Marks & Spencer store, drawn to our 
Longbridge development because of its vibrancy, connectivity 
and growing population. We look forward to welcoming more 
national high street brands to the T own Centre during 2015.

We are innovative
We are continuously looking at new and inventive ways to 
develop our brownfield land portfolio in order to generate the 
best value for the business, our shareholders and partners and 
local communities.
We have also applied this innovative approach to strengthen 
further our financial base, pursuing and securing alternative 
forms of funding to reduce reliance on bank finance whilst 
decreasing our gearing levels. In the last three years, we have 
issued a retail bond in October 2012 which raised £80m, 
completed a £49m equity placing in March 2013 and, in 
February 2014, successfully launched a £100m convertible 
bond. Also in 2014, we completely restructured our bank 
finance such that all of our corporate and joint venture facilities 
now extend until at least 2018.
We do what we say
No one can deny we are a straight-talking company and it 
is this direct approach that has cemented some important 
partnerships for the business and resulted in the success that 
we are reporting on today. Colleagues, customers, suppliers, 
shareholders and major stakeholders rely on us to deliver on the 
promises and commitments we make to bring about long-term 
sustainable regeneration. 
We acquired the 2,500-acre portfolio of BP sites in 2009 at 
the height of the recession and are now delivering on our 
plans by transforming swathes of former industrial land across 
South Wales into an innovative mix of housing, education and 
energy-related projects. These include a 30-acre Solar Park 
at Baglan Bay which we launched in March 2014, the £450m 
Bay Campus for Swansea University and the 1,060-acre 
residential-led regeneration at Coed Darcy in Neath.
DIVIDEND
In recent years, we have increased our dividends in line with the 
growth in net asset value and to reflect the Company’s results. 
For the year ended 30
th
 November 2014, the Board has decided 
to recommend a 15% increase in the total dividend for the year 
to 4.60p per share (2013: 4.00p per share) giving a final dividend 
for the year of 3.137p per share (2013: 2.67p per share). 
The final dividend will be paid on 2
nd
 April 2015 to shareholders 
on the register at 6
th
 March 2015. 
PEOPLE
The dedication and energy of our staff personifies our values 
and they have made a significant contribution to the delivery 
of this year’s excellent set of results. Therefore, I would like to 
thank everyone at St. Modwen for their ongoing commitment, 
hard work and determination throughout the last 12 months. 
BOARD CHANGES
We continue to refresh the composition of the Board to ensure 
that it is best placed to operate effectively. In the year, John 
Salmon, Audit Committee Chairman announced his intention to 
retire from the Board at the conclusion of the 2015 AGM after 
more than nine years’ service. On behalf of the Board, I would 
like to take this opportunity to thank John for his significant 
commitment and valued contribution to St. Modwen and to 
wish him well for the future. 
John will be succeeded as Audit Committee Chairman by 
Ian Bull, who joined the Board as a non-executive director in 
September 2014. Ian is Chief Financial Officer and a main board 
director at Ladbrokes plc, a position he has held since 2011. 
His strong financial and commercial pedigree will complement 
the existing experience of the Board and I am delighted 
that he will be continuing John’s excellent work as Audit 
Committee Chairman. 
We announced in December 2014 that Michael Dunn, Group 
Finance Director, would be leaving the Company. The search 
for his successor, which will consider both internal and external 
candidates, is already well advanced. Mike has played an 
important part in the Company’s success since his appointment 
in 2010 and on behalf of the Board, I would like to thank him for 
his valuable contribution and wish him well for the future. 
PROSPECTS
We are a national business with a UK-wide portfolio of 
commercial and residential development opportunities. 
We have clear visibility on the progression of plans for our 
major projects and anticipate further growth in commercial 
development activity across the UK, leading us to extend our 
active pipeline of opportunities throughout 2015 and beyond. 
Our residential business continues to go from strength to 
strength both in terms of its size and the reputation of the 
brand, and we anticipate sustained levels of performance in the 
coming year. 
We remain well positioned to benefit from the growth potential 
in the UK economy and the property market as a whole and we 
look forward to further success in 2015 when we will continue 
to add value to our portfolio to ensure good long-term returns 
for our shareholders.

Our values in action 
WE THINK  
LONG- TERM
We have a 25-year track record of delivering long-term 
regeneration projects. 
We are delivering the transformation of the 57 -acre New Covent 
Garden market site through a VINCI St. Modwen 50/50 joint venture 
(VSM) and in partnership with the Covent Garden Market Authority. 
A 10-year project, it has received a resolution to grant planning from 
Wandsworth Council in November 2014 and unconditional status is 
targeted for the first half of 2015. It will see the development of over 
500,000 sq ft of modern market facilities consolidated onto one site for 
the 200-tenant businesses. 
In return for delivering the new market, VSM secures 20 acres of 
remaining freehold land which will be transformed into a new, high 
quality, residential-led, mixed-use regeneration scheme comprising 
3,000 new homes, 135,000 sq ft of office space and 100,000 sq ft 
of retail, leisure, and new community facilities including shops, cafés 
and restaurants. 
This long-term and complex project requires careful foresight in 
terms of the design and the sensitive delivery of each project phase. 
Also, as the biggest physical regeneration site in this part of London, 
we are conscious of how it needs to complement the rest of this 
important, large-scale regeneration area and to ensure we leave a 
positive legacy for generations to enjoy beyond its completion.  Strategic Report

WE ARE 
INNOVATIVE
One of the largest regeneration schemes outside of London, the 
transformation of the 468 acre Longbridge site in Birmingham from 
the largest car plant in the world to a thriving-mixed £1bn community 
exemplifies our innovative approach to regeneration. 
Since 2007 , and throughout the recession, we have invested over 
£300m into this important scheme, created over 3,700 jobs and 
welcomed over 50 new businesses. 
The scheme now comprises around 350 new homes, over 
200,000 sq ft of office and industrial space and the 250,000 sq ft 
Bournville College with a 30,000 sq ft specialist construction centre. 
It also includes the completed first phase of the new Town Centre 
including an 80,000 sq ft Sainsbury’s, Costa Coffee, Greggs, 
Beefeater, Hungry Horse restaurant, 80-bedroom Premier Inn and 
the £2m Austin Park.
Current development work includes the delivery of Phase Two of the 
Town Centre anchored by a 150,000 sq ft Marks & Spencer store, plus 
45,000 sq ft of additional retail units. During 2015 the development of 
an ‘Extra Care’ retirement home comprising 260 assisted living units 
will commence and we anticipate planning approval of a 105,000 sq ft 
headquarter-style office building and 215 new homes – all forming 
future phases of the new Town Centre.

WE DO WHAT 
WE SAY
The 65 acre Bay Campus site was acquired in 2009 as part of a 2,500 
acre portfolio of disused BP sites. This acquisition made us the largest 
private owner of brownfield land in South Wales.
Following an intensive remediation programme, we are now 
transforming this portfolio into a major linked development of which 
the £450m Bay Campus forms a fundamental part. It exemplifies our 
ability to deliver major regeneration schemes to the highest standards, 
on time and within budget.
Since becoming Swansea University’s development partner in 2013, 
we have delivered on our promises and have progressed quickly with 
the development of the Bay Campus, which comprises circa 1m sq ft 
of buildings:
•  465,000 sq ft of academic and R&D space including a new Institute 
of Structural Materials, Engineering Central, Engineering East, Bay 
Library, Great Hall and School of Management; and
•  around 500,000 sq ft of student accommodation for 1, 142 students, 
with ancillary retail space and modern facilities to include a gym, 
sports hall and crèche.
In December 2014 we completed the first of the engineering buildings 
and we are on programme to complete this campus project in time to 
welcome the new student intake in September 2015.
This £450m project will bring about a positive economic impact for 
the Swansea Bay City region of about £3bn, with potential for the 
creation of up to 10,000 jobs across the 10 year lifetime of the project 
and beyond.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Bill Oliver
Chief Executive
The combination of our extensive experience, robust business 
model and consistent strategy has come together this year 
to generate exceptional growth for the business. This has 
resulted in record results with an increase in profit before all 
tax of 68% to £138.1m (2013: £82.2.m) and a 17% increase in 
net asset value per share to 324.9p (2013: 278.8p). 
This successful year has seen many high points, the most 
recent being the receipt of a resolution to grant planning 
permission in November 2014 for the redevelopment of the 
New Covent Garden Market sites at Nine Elms in London. 
We are targeting to achieve unconditional status in the first 
half of 2015; this will be a hugely significant milestone for the 
project and the business as a whole and will have a substantial 
and positive impact on the valuation of our portfolio. 
Our other major projects, the £1bn regeneration of 
Longbridge, Birmingham and the £450m Bay Campus for 
Swansea University, have made excellent progress during 
the period. The first completed building at Bay Campus was 
handed over to the University on time and within budget in 
December 2014, whilst the 150,000 sq ft Marks & Spencer 
store at Longbridge is now under construction and scheduled 
to complete in time for Christmas 2015 trading. In line 
with the growing prominence of Longbridge as a business 
location, we moved our Head Office there in October 2014. 
The development, a flagship project for the Company, 
exemplifies every facet of our regeneration skills and is a 
natural base from which St. Modwen can continue its growth. 
Both Longbridge and the Bay Campus contribute to our active 
pipeline of commercial development activity across the UK 
which now amounts to over 3m sq ft, and we are well positioned 
to capitalise on the continued upturn in the market. This pipeline 
and the increase in our construction activity, not only 
underlines the recovery of the regional property market but also 
demonstrates our ability to think long-term and to manage our 
5,900-acre land bank effectively throughout economic cycles.

Strategic Report 01–43 Financial Statements 44–85 Additional Information 86
Our residential business has performed well in the period 
delivering an overall profit increase of 167% to £24m 
(2013: £9m) with good sales rates being achieved across 
the Country. With the Persimmon joint venture now 
firmly established, we are focusing our attention on our 
housebuilding brand, St. Modwen Homes, which completed 
258 new homes over the period and has nine active sites. 
Meanwhile, the Persimmon joint venture completed 562 new 
homes in the period from eight sites. 
We continue to look at new and innovative ways to use our land 
in order to maximise its value and to ensure that it is developed 
to best complement its surroundings. Against the backdrop of 
a diminishing energy supply across the UK, we are pursuing a 
number of energy-related opportunities, including the delivery 
of gas fired Combined Cycle Gas Turbine power stations on 
two sites. Both are at differing stages of the planning process 
but we anticipate further progress for at least one of these 
opportunities during 2015. 
STRATEGY OVERVIEW
Our strategy remains fundamentally unchanged. We continue 
to add value to our £1.3bn land bank through planning and 
asset management initiatives that are carried out by our regional 
teams of skilled property professionals. At the same time, 
we prepare sites for redevelopment through remediation and 
securing planning permissions and dispose of those assets to 
which we can no longer add value in order to release capital 
for reinvestment. 
This strategy, supported by our long-term approach to 
development and our proven business model, has enabled 
us to create value throughout the cycle and to take immediate 
advantage of the market recovery as reflected by record profits 
in the period. 
We will remain true to this long-term strategy and adopt a 
pragmatic approach as residential and commercial markets 
continue to improve. As the economy gets stronger, we will 
ensure that our business grows by increasing our active pipeline 
of development opportunities, creating a firm base for the 
continuing delivery of shareholder value. 
MARKET OVERVIEW
We are one of the few property companies in the UK to have 
stood firm in having a regional development bias whilst also 
progressing projects in and around London. With the economic 
recovery now gathering momentum, we are already well 
positioned to capitalise on the upturn, particularly in the regions. 
Currently, we have an active pipeline of over 3m sq ft of 
commercial development across the UK, and we continue to 
increase our construction levels across our commercial portfolio 
as companies look to expand or move into new premises. 
We are mindful of the increasing cost of construction materials 
and continue to work closely with our supply chain to sustain 
build quality. We are also undertaking some speculative 
development and have been successful in acquiring new 
opportunities in competitive situations, which we will start to 
build out in 2015. 
As tenant demand improves across the UK, this has had a 
positive impact on rent roll across our commercial portfolio and 
we are witnessing a steadily increasing stream of enquiries. 
There is good take up across our T own Centre regeneration 
projects, notably at Wembley Central where we will soon 
conclude works to the final phase of this £90m mixed-use 
development in London. At our T echnology Retail Park in Rugby 
we are already 100% pre-let on the 70,000 sq ft out-of-town 
retail scheme and, in addition to securing planning permission 
for Marks & Spencer in June 2014, we are now in detailed 
discussions with a number of national retailers seeking to take 
space in Longbridge T own Centre in 2015. 
In terms of the residential market, demand has been sustained 
but there are concerns over interest rate rises, changes to the 
mortgage market and the usual uncertainty in the lead-up to the 
2015 UK General Election. However, there remains a structural 
lack of housing supply across the Country and, as a result, 
demand for our land from national housebuilders continues 
to increase. Similarly, good sales rates have been maintained 
throughout the year both for the Persimmon joint venture 
and St. Modwen Homes sites and we anticipate a sustained 
performance into 2015. 
BUSINESS OUTLOOK
We will continue to build on the success of 2014 over the 
next 12 months and now look to take full advantage of the 
market recovery. We will focus our efforts on delivering our 
commercial sites in the regions, growing our active commercial 
development pipeline of over 3m sq ft, and progressing our 
key projects, including the redevelopment of the New Covent 
Garden Market sites.
We expect the current favourable residential market conditions 
in the regions to be sustained throughout the year, and through 
the planning process we will bring new sites forward for 
sale or development, as well as focusing on delivery within 
St. Modwen Homes and the Persimmon joint venture. 
With a record year now firmly under our belts, we are in a very 
good position to grow the business further in 2015 and deliver 
another year of success for our shareholders.

STRATEGY
Alongside a growing and active pipeline of commercial 
development opportunities, we continue to prime and add long-
term value to our land bank through careful remediation and by 
successfully progressing sites through the planning process. 
In doing so, we ensure that a continual stream of opportunities 
is being progressed at any point in the cycle by our highly-
skilled, regionally-based development teams, each supported 
by our centralised construction management team. 
Our regional office framework has stood us in good stead in 
recent years, keeping us abreast of local requirements and 
enabling us to respond quickly to any emerging development 
opportunities. Similarly, our on the ground expertise enables 
us to select the right moment at which to dispose of those 
assets to which we can no longer add value or to acquire new 
opportunities to add to our portfolio for future development. 
On the back of an improving regional property market, we have 
heightened our focus on commercial land and development 
and we are now embarking on a number of either pre-let or 
speculative schemes in selected areas where our teams have 
identified growing demand. As a result of this and the increase 
in pre-let and design and build opportunities coming through, 
we have grown our active commercial development pipeline to 
over 3m sq ft (74%% pre-let or pre-sold) which represents a 
total committed capital expenditure of £286m. At present, this 
pipeline of development reflects a gross development value of 
£458m.
MARKET COMMENTARY
Confidence is growing in the UK’s commercial property market, 
but availability of product remains an issue. Many occupiers 
recognise that with our ‘oven ready’ land we can react quickly 
to their needs. In addition, we are progressing a number of 
pre-let or speculatively built schemes in localised areas of the 
Midlands, the South West, London and the South East, where 
we have identified potential occupational and investor demand. 
We will seek to increase production levels across the Country as 
the economy continues to improve. 
Within this context, the industrial market is experiencing good 
growth across the UK as businesses seek to expand and 
commit to new premises. Vacancy levels across our retained 
industrial portfolio are reducing and an increasing number of 
enquiries for design and build projects are being converted into 
live schemes. 
Much of what we do in the retail sector is already meeting an 
evolving shopper demand and retailer requirements. We focus 
on remodelling historic shopping centres such as Farnborough, 
Wembley Central and Wythenshawe, or we regenerate former 
industrial sites such as Longbridge which we have transformed 
into a new retail destination. 
All such schemes in our portfolio are designed with the belief 
that a T own Centre should service its community and provide 
an integrated, open and accessible environment with good 
transport links, parking provision and retail complemented by 
employment space, food stores and leisure. As a result, we 
continue to consistently secure a good level of take up from 
new retailers and are experiencing strong footfall across all of 
our secondary retail schemes. 
Our ability to offer affordable rents combined with the appeal 
of our regeneration schemes as places where surrounding 
communities and, consequently, footfall grow, means that we 
are able to maintain high occupancy rates and fill voids swiftly.
PERFORMANCE – COMMERCIAL LAND
At the heart of our business lies our skill in cleaning up 
brownfield sites and preparing them for market by securing 
planning permissions and either developing them for immediate 
sale or retaining them as a long-term income producing asset 
for the business. 
We have secured a number of commercial-led brownfield 
land opportunities over the last 12 months either as direct 
acquisitions or through a competitive tendering process.
Highlights
• Spray Street, Woolwich – in December 2014, together with 
development partners Notting Hill Housing Group, we were 
awarded preferred developer status by the Royal Borough of 
Greenwich to redevelop the Spray Street quarter in Woolwich. 
A former market area, the site will be transformed into a 
753,000 sq ft mixed-use housing-led scheme of 612 homes, 
including retail and an art-house cinema.
• London Road Industrial Estate, Newbury – following our 
selection by West Berkshire Council in April 2014 as 
Development Partner for the regeneration of this 25 acre 
industrial estate, we are working up our plans with the 
Council to create a new mixed-use development comprising 
waterside, residential and commercial phases.
We have continued to be successful in securing planning 
approvals across our commercial land bank which has 
promoted a series of site starts across the UK.  Strategic Report

Major projects 
• New Covent Garden Market, London – in November 
2014, the London Borough of Wandsworth resolved to 
grant planning permission for the regeneration of the New 
Covent Garden Market sites in Nine Elms, London. T o be 
delivered under the VINCI St. Modwen joint venture, this 
transformational project will see the development of over 
500,000 sq ft of modern market facilities, 3,000 homes, 
135,000 sq ft of new office space and over 100,000 sq ft of 
retail, leisure and new community facilities. We are targeting 
to achieve unconditional status in the first half of 2015, with 
preparatory works starting on site shortly afterwards. 
• Longbridge, Birmingham – in the second half of the year, we 
secured planning permission and started construction of 
the 150,000 sq ft Marks & Spencer store which will anchor 
the second phase of the new Longbridge T own Centre. 
During the year, we also completed the 30,000 sq ft specialist 
construction centre for Bournville College and secured 
planning permission and a land sale for a £35m Extra Care 
retirement village which will comprise 260 apartments. 
• Bay Campus, Swansea University – we are actively building 
circa 1m sq ft of student accommodation and academic 
facilities at this £450m new campus development and 
handed over the Institute of Structural Materials building, the 
first to be completed, to the University at the end of 2014. 
Earlier in the year, we signed a Development Agreement with 
Swansea University for an additional 545 student apartments 
for occupation during the first quarter of 2016 and major 
new student facilities as part of this scheme. We have since 
completed the forward sale of 50% of the income from this 
latest phase of student accommodation to M&G Investments 
for the M&G Secured Property Income Fund for £20m.
Across our broader portfolio, we have also made good progress 
in converting planning applications to approval and delivery. 
Commercial planning highlights 
• Branston, Burton upon Trent – planning permission has been 
granted for a regeneration scheme comprising 660 homes, 
over 770,000 sq ft of commercial space and over 140 acres 
of new woodland and open green space.
• DPD (UK) – planning consent has been granted for a 
60,000 sq ft distribution centre for express delivery service 
DPD (UK) at the £210m Skypark scheme, adjacent to Exeter 
Airport. Providing further endorsement of our well located 
portfolio of sites across the UK, DPD (UK) has selected 
Etruria Valley, Stoke-on-Trent and Stonebridge, Liverpool as 
the locations for two further facilities, comprising 60,000 sq ft 
and 69,000 sq ft, respectively, for which planning applications 
have been submitted. 
Development highlights 
• Great Homer Street, Liverpool – works have started on site 
at this £150m regeneration scheme which, in addition to a 
100,000 sq ft Sainsbury’s supermarket, will bring 80,000 sq ft 
of retail, 900 car parking spaces, a petrol filling station and 
new homes. Sainsbury’s will begin development of its store 
in summer 2015, with opening expected to take place in 
summer 2016.
• Wembley Central, London – the final phase of this £90m 
mixed-use T own Centre redevelopment will complete in 
early 2015. It now comprises 120,000 sq ft of new retail and 
leisure space let to a range of national retailers including 
TK Maxx, T esco, Sports Direct, Iceland, Argos and The Gym. 
The scheme also comprises an 86-bedroom Travelodge 
Hotel, 273 apartments, a new public square and an enhanced 
tube and train station. 
• Screwfix, Stoke-on-Trent – construction work has 
commenced on a 310,000 sq ft extension for Screwfix, 
almost doubling the size of its existing distribution facility at 
Trentham Lakes to 630,000 sq ft. Developed in partnership 
with M&G Real Estate, the freeholders, the extension is 
scheduled to complete by summer 2015. 
OUTLOOK
We anticipate that the commercial property market will continue 
to improve throughout 2015, allowing us to further increase 
our active pipeline of delivery across the UK of over 3m sq ft. 
The industrial market will lead the way and we will continue to 
grow our industrial portfolio. We will work closely with retailers 
and evolve our schemes to suit their demands, with rental 
levels and the regional focus of our portfolio providing us with a 
competitive advantage as we continue to secure new leases at 
favourable rents and create new retail environments.  Strategic Report

STRATEGY 
We have continued to focus on our proven strategy of buying 
land at low cost and then maximising its value over time 
through remediation and planning. We will always favour 
development on brownfield land, with value being realised 
through three routes to market: 
• Residential land sales – the development and sale of 
oven ready, predominantly brownfield, sites with viable 
implementable planning permissions in place. 
• St. Modwen Homes – in-house development under our own 
brand, using our extensive housebuilding expertise to capture 
additional development profits. 
• Persimmon joint venture – maximising value through 
development with the backing of one of the UK’s leading 
national housebuilders. 
MARKET COMMENTARY
As the year has progressed, the residential marketplace has 
continued to improve with sustainable house price growth 
across the Country. There remains a significant undersupply 
of housing across the UK and, along with a slowly improving 
economy, job market and expected population growth, this 
imbalance supports a positive house price inflation environment 
which should be at more practicable levels in London and the 
South East.
In response to the undersupply, demand for our residential 
land from national housebuilders is increasing, and 
St. Modwen Homes and the Persimmon joint venture continue 
to achieve sales rates of over 0.6 completions per week, which 
is above the national average. 
The Private Rental Sector market is experiencing significant 
growth which, in many cases, is driven by the lack of affordable 
housing, particularly in London. We continue to explore a 
number of opportunities across our UK portfolio that lend 
themselves to this specific sub-sector.
PERFORMANCE – RESIDENTIAL LAND 
In the period, we have increased our land bank to 28,790 plots 
(2013: 27,023) of which 83% have either planning permission 
or allocations within local plans. We have experienced growing 
demand for our land across the Country as housebuilders 
respond to the lack of housing supply across the UK and to 
date have sold or committed for sale 52 acres of land, for total 
proceeds of £95m.
Planning consents achieved
• New Covent Garden Market – resolution to grant planning

235,000 sq ft of commercial space and new community

• Uttoxeter, Staffordshire – for 700 new homes, employment 
space, a new school, sports and recreational facilities, a local 
retail centre and the provision of open green space. 
• Hilton, South Derbyshire – for 485 new homes, a new primary 
school and employment opportunities as part of a mixed-
use development at this former MoD site which currently 
comprises industrial and open storage space.

Applications submitted 
• Meon Vale, Long Marston, Warwickshire – for an additional 
550 homes and a one form entry primary school at this 
478-acre, former MoD site which is being regenerated into 
a £150m mixed-use leisure-led scheme. Here, 284 homes 
are already under construction through the Persimmon 
joint venture and the £5m Meon Vale Leisure Centre 
opened to the public in August 2014. At the same time we 
opened the central facilities, including a shop, community 
centre, public open space, children’s play area, one mile 
Greenway extension into Stratford-upon-Avon and a 30-pitch 
caravan and camping site. The scheme also benefits from 
800,000 sq ft of retained employment space which is 100% 
occupied. 
• Hendrefoilan, Swansea – for 300 high quality homes 
on this 52-acre former Swansea University student 
accommodation site. 
• Wigan, Greater Manchester – for 325 new homes, extensive 
public open space, and the opening up of the culverted water

PERFORMANCE – RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT 
St. Modwen Homes 
Our housebuilding business, St. Modwen Homes, now 
comprises a team of over 50 professionals looking after 13 
sites at various stages of planning and development across the 
Country which will deliver 1,686 new homes. We continue to 
focus on providing quality over quantity delivering between 300 
to 350 units per year. 
Future opportunities for this part of the business in 2015 
comprise a range of schemes representing a total of 700 
homes across the Country including development at Branston 
Leas, Burton upon Trent, Uttoxeter, Staffordshire and Trentham 
Lakes, Stoke-on-Trent. 
Persimmon joint venture
Our joint venture with Persimmon is now firmly established  
with all eight sites (2,364 plots) under the original agreement  
now either under construction or being marketed for sale.
Residential development sales and profit
Reacting to the uptick in the residential marketplace, sales rates 
for the year have been good. We have achieved 820 house 
sale completions in the year (2013: 365) comprising 258 for 
St. Modwen Homes (2013: 126) and 562 for the Persimmon 
joint venture (2013: 239).
As the market has continued to improve across the UK over 
the last 12 months, residential development and sales have 
mirrored this trend, resulting in an overall profit increase of 
167% to £24m (2013: £9m), providing a firm platform from 
which to sustain this area of the business.
OUTLOOK
We expect a good level of activity in the residential market next 
year, particularly in the regions, as demand from housebuyers 
continues and housebuilders also seek attractive land to 
replenish their stocks. We anticipate profits, delivery and sales 
volumes to be maintained for St. Modwen Homes next year and 
the Persimmon joint venture to continue to perform well.

STRATEGY
Whilst our primary business is regeneration, we seek to 
ensure that a large proportion of our assets generate a stream 
of income prior to development in order that the revenue 
generated from these assets covers the running costs of 
the business. 
These income producing assets now make up 43% of our 
property portfolio and we extract value from them through 
our proven asset management initiatives undertaken by our 
regional teams of experts across the Country. T ypically, we 
offer affordable rents on relatively short tenancies to ensure 
that voids remain at their lowest possible levels as we work 
towards redevelopment. 
We will also seek to retain newly built assets for income and 
then sell them on at a later stage once we feel no further 
value can be added. The capital raised from disposal is then 
reinvested in the business. 
Across our income producing portfolio, we manage a broad 
range of assets on behalf of over 1,700 occupiers, operating 
within a variety of sectors. This diversity helps to mitigate 
against specific sector challenges and possible administrations. 
PERFORMANCE
Reflecting the continued improvement in the economy, at 
the year end our income producing portfolio was valued at 
£539m (2013: £514m). T enant administrations have had little 
or no impact on our portfolio, the most high profile during the 
period being Phones4U which occupied just three stores in 
our T own Centre schemes, all of which have since been re-let. 
Occupancy levels have increased slightly to 89% (2013: 88%) 
and we have secured £5.3m in new lettings (2013: £9.0m). 
This contributes 11% to our annualised gross rent roll which 
has increased from last year to £45.4m (2013: £44.7m).
Income
• Trident Business Park, Warrington – a total of 31,050 sq ft 
industrial and office units have been let in the last 12 months 
and income has increased by 34% to £435,500 across this 
office and industrial park. 
• Eastleigh Works, Southampton – Arlington Fleet Services Ltd, 
the principal occupier of this 47-acre site, has contracted to 
expand its occupation from 380,000 sq ft to 430,000 sq ft 
at the end of 2016 and has extended its lease to the end of 
2019, delivering £1.1m annual rental income. All the floor 
space on the site is now fully let after Alstom Transport 
vacated and left a virtually empty site. 
• Edmonton Green Shopping Centre, Enfield – a total of 
20,500 sq ft of retail units and market stalls were let in 2014, 
including 5,000 sq ft to PoundWorld, 2,500 sq ft to Explore 
Learning and 1,500 sq ft to Turkish Bank IS, generating 
£310,500 annual rental income. In addition, a number of 
significant rent reviews and lease renewals were concluded 
which in aggregate delivered an increase in rent of £52,450 
per annum. The Centre now produces a total rental income of 
£4.7m per annum.
Acquisitions
We have been monitoring the market carefully for the right 
opportunities to add to our existing portfolio of retained assets. 
Our most recent purchase is Billingham Shopping Centre in 
Stockton-on-T ees, which we acquired in November 2014 for 
£14.3m and which provides an immediate gross rent roll of 
£1.9m that we intend to grow on the back of our proven asset 
management expertise.
Disposals
We have taken advantage of a rising market and have disposed 
of a range of assets to which we can no longer add value, 
generating receipts of £44m. These include the sale of The 
Planets Shopping Centre in Woking for £8m and the £7m sale 
of Hednesford T own Centre, construction of the latter having 
been completed in 2012. 
OUTLOOK
Throughout 2015, we will continue to selectively add to 
our portfolio of income producing properties with the right 
opportunities. We foresee occupier confidence growing in 
2015, particularly in the industrial sector, which should lead to 
further positive impact on rental revenue across our income 
producing portfolio.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
INCOME STATEMENT 
Our business is focused on creating long-term significant 
added value and generating strong returns through our own 
capabilities. We take a pragmatic approach to development 
and expand our 5,900 acre land bank in a manner which is 
capital efficient. This means making long-term investments to 
which we can add to and realise value through remediation, 
management of the planning process, asset management 
and development. 
Our income producing assets form the largest part by value 
of our portfolio, representing 43% and with a gross rent roll of 
£45.4m comprising mostly core rental income. These assets 
underpin the business, providing a steady stream of income 
prior to development and a solid base from which the business 
can continue to grow. 
As we use a number of joint venture arrangements, the 
statutory financial statement disclosures do not always 
provide a straightforward way of understanding our business. 
T o enable a better understanding, we have also provided 
information including the Group’s share of joint ventures 
and a full reconciliation is provided in note 2 to the Group 
Financial Statements.

PROFITS
Rental and recurring income
Even taking into account asset sales we are once again 
pleased to report an increase in the Group’s share of net rental 
income to £37.1m (2013: £36.3m). This has been achieved as 
a result of our robust asset management capabilities and an 
increase in new lettings as a result of the improving regional 
property market. 
Net rental income for St. Modwen of £2.0m per annum from 
student accommodation at the Bay Campus, Swansea 
University will be coming on line in 2015.
We have sold a number of income producing assets in the 
period but still anticipate our net rental income growing 
throughout the course of 2015 as we bring new assets onto 
our books.
Occupancy levels have increased slightly to 89% (2013: 88%) 
and our average lease length has remained steady at five years 
(2013: five years). We prefer to maintain voids at a relatively 
high level whilst we prepare our income producing assets for 
development. Consequently, our void levels are consistent with 
our expectations. 
Property profits
The Group’s share of property profits from development have 
increased by 45% to £57.7m (2013: £39.8m). This includes 
notable contributions from the Bay Campus development at 
Swansea University and a marked increase in commercial 
development. Asset sales of both income producing properties 
and residential land which were achieved at well above book 
value have also impacted positively on property profits.
Residential housing sales have also made a strong contribution 
to property profits achieving £24m in the period (2013: £9m) 
which demonstrates the rapid growth of St. Modwen Homes 
and reflects the well-established nature of the Persimmon 
joint venture. 
Overheads
Reflecting the upturn in the economy and its positive impact on 
the property market, we have recruited more staff to service our 
growing pipeline of over 3m sq ft of commercial development 
opportunities. Similarly, the St. Modwen Homes sites are fast 
gaining momentum across the Country and the team has now 
grown to over 50 staff. Our recruitment drive, coupled with 
the bonuses paid for successful business delivery, means that 
administrative expenses for 2014 (including the Group’s share 
of joint ventures and associates) have increased to £23.2m 
(2013: £20.2m). 
Finance costs and income
Finance costs have reduced this year, despite average debt 
levels being similar to 2013, as a result of us undertaking a 
significant refinancing process, including the successful issue 
of a £100m convertible bond and comprehensive refinancing of 
our bank facilities. This has reduced the weighted average cost 
of debt significantly from 5.6% at the start of the year to 4.8% 
at the end of the year, whilst net interest charges have reduced 
to £23.5m (2013: £25.5m).
Trading profit
We have therefore experienced a 55% increase in our overall 
trading profit in the period to £51.7m (2013: £33.3m) which 
is an exceptionally strong result driven by the activities we 
undertake ourselves. 
During 2015, we will continue to focus on generating value 
across our land bank and ensure that our rental and recurring 
income underpins the running costs of the business. Strategic Report

FINANCIAL REVIEW

PROPERTY VALUATION
Basis of property valuation
All our investment properties are independently valued every six 
months by our external valuers. The external valuers base their 
valuations upon an open market transaction between a willing 
buyer and a willing seller at the Balance Sheet date. Therefore, 
no value is taken for any future expectations of value increases 
but discounts are applied to reflect future uncertainties. 
Where appropriate we will also independently assess our work 
in progress for any impairment issues. In accordance with 
accounting standards, valuation movements are put through the 
Income Statement as gains or losses. 
Valuations in all our asset classes have been validated by open 
market transactions during the course of the year.
As detailed in the Audit Committee Report, we have an ongoing 
process of competitively tendering our key advisory roles. 
During the year we ran such an exercise for the external valuers 
and Jones Lang LaSalle LLP were replaced with DTZ Ltd 
(DTZ). Both valuers are global real estate professional services 
businesses whose specialisations include property valuation.
Property portfolio
Our property portfolio is worth £1.3bn (2013: £1.2bn). 
During the period we have continued its active management, 
spending £276m on acquisitions and capital expenditure and 
realising £301m from asset disposals. As the UK economy 
becomes more active we expect to continue activity at 
these levels. 
Movements in the year
Property valuation movements are made up of two main 
elements: those resulting from our own actions that we 
undertake specifically to add value to our assets, and those 
resulting from changes in the overall property market. 
DTZ provides this valuation split for us. 
Consistent with market movements, valuations of our income 
producing portfolio have increased by around 7% on average 
during the year.
Market-driven valuation movements
Market-driven valuation movements of our income producing 
portfolio represent a 5% increase across the year. In addition to 
benefitting from this improvement in value, we have also been 
able to sell assets into a strong market that has helped underpin 
both profits for the year and our cash positions. It is anticipated 
that valuations for this type of asset will continue to improve.
Our residential portfolio has experienced a substantial increase 
in value of £28m (2013: £21m), most notably in the South East 
(although residential land has increased in value across England 
and Wales). T ogether with the improvement in commercial land 
values, this has resulted in an overall market-driven increase in 
the value of our property portfolio of £58m (2013: £14m).
Valuation improvements as a result of St. Modwen actions
One of our core skills is our asset management capability, which 
continues to deliver strong returns as we successfully add value 
to our existing portfolio by managing it through the planning 
process. Based on independent valuations from DTZ, we have 
generated revaluation gains of £32m in the year (2013: £28m).
Considering the increased activity across our portfolio, we 
expect to continue to generate significant value improvements 
in 2015, in addition to the significant uplift expected 
when the redevelopment of New Covent Garden Market 
becomes unconditional.

PROFIT BEFORE ALL TAX
Our profit before all tax is stated before tax on joint venture 
income and after movements in the market value of our 
interest rate derivatives (hedges and swaps), our convertible 
bond and the retail bond. The valuations are based on the 
financial market’s forward prediction curves for interest rates. 
Yield curves flattened considerably towards the end of the year 
causing a charge against our profits. At the end of the financial 
reporting period, and together with other finance charges, this 
gave rise to a charge of £3.8m (2013: £6.9m credit). 
Nevertheless, profit before all tax has increased substantially by 
68% to a record level of £138.1m (2013: £82.2m).
TAXATION AND PROFITS AFTER TAX
Our record profitability increased our tax charge (including joint 
venture tax and deferred tax included in negative goodwill) 
for the year to £16.0m (2013: £8.3m). Despite this, we have 
achieved a very strong result for the year with profits after tax 
increasing by 65% to £122.1m (2013: £73.9m). The resultant 
earnings per share of 52.7p (2013: 33.5p) is up 57% year 
on year.
BALANCE SHEET
Funding levels
T aking advantage of an increasingly active investment market, 
we have completed a significant number of acquisitions and 
disposals during the year. Overall, our Balance Sheet debt 
at £334m (2013: £341m) has fallen and as the value of our 
property portfolio has increased, our gearing and loan to 
value ratios have continued to fall. On Balance Sheet gearing 
has decreased to 45% (2013: 54%) while see-through loan-
to-value, taking into account our share of joint ventures, has 
reduced to 30% (2013: 33%).
As the economic environment improves further, we will remain 
acquisitive and continue to invest in site development in order 
to generate future returns. We therefore expect absolute levels 
of debt to rise during 2015. We also expect the value of our 
property portfolio to rise as we invest. In particular, when the 
New Covent Garden Market project achieves unconditional 
status there will be asset recognition without any accompanying 
debt. Overall we expect our debt ratios to remain broadly in the 
same range. 
New Covent Garden Market
The assets and liabilities of this contract will only be recognised 
on our Balance Sheet once the contract becomes fully 
unconditional. Having received a resolution to grant planning 
permission in November 2014 we are targeting to achieve 
unconditional status in the first half of 2015. 
Once the contract becomes unconditional we will recognise 
the value of the extra 20 acres of land as an asset and the cost 
of developing and building the new market facility as a liability. 
The surplus less likely overage payable to the public sector 
will generate valuation profits for the year and there will be an 
uplift after tax obligations to our net asset value. The contract 
is in joint venture with VINCI PLC and so will appear in the joint 
venture line of our Balance Sheet.
Net assets
At the year end the shareholders’ equity value of net assets 
was £717.9m or 324.9p per share which represents a 17% 
increase over the year (2013: 278.8p per share). In addition to 
this, increased dividends of £9.1m (4.13p per share) were paid 
during 2014 (2013: £8.2m or 3.75p per share).
EPRA net asset value
In line with industry best practice we also report net assets per 
share using the EPRA (European Public Real Estate Association) 
methodology*. Our diluted EPRA net asset value rose 16% to 
344.2p from 297.7p per share. A full reconciliation of our net 
assets is provided in note 2 to the Group Financial Statements.
*  Note: as a development business many of the EPRA metrics are inappropriate as they are 
geared to property investment. The EPRA metrics are nevertheless reported on page 59.

CORPORATE FACILITIES
In the first half of the year we successfully launched an offering 
of £100m of unsecured guaranteed convertible bonds. The five-
year bond was placed at a coupon of 2.875% and a conversion 
premium of 35%, representing a conversion price at a 90% 
premium to the 2013 shareholders’ equity net asset value per 
share. The net proceeds of the offering were used to repay 
existing debt.
Over the course of the last 12 months we have also undertaken 
a comprehensive refinancing of our banking portfolio:
• A new seven-year £50m revolving credit facility with 
Santander has replaced the previous £30m facility that was 
due to expire in January 2016.
• New four-year £99m revolving credit facilities with Barclays on 
improved terms replaces the previous £84m Barclays facility 
that was due to expire in September 2015.
• A new five-year £125m revolving credit facility with the Royal 
Bank of Scotland on improved terms replaces the previous 
£95m facility that was due to expire in November 2015.
• A new five-year £100m revolving credit facility with HSBC on 
improved terms replaces the previous £75m facility that was 
due to expire in January 2016.
Our two remaining joint venture facilities have also 
been refinanced:
• A new five-year £85m revolving credit facility for our KPI joint 
venture on improved terms has replaced the previous £135m 
facility that was due to expire in 2017.
• A new five-year £30m facility for our VSM Uxbridge joint 
venture on improved terms. 
The above actions have extended the weighted average facility 
maturity to 4.6 years (2013: 2.5 years), with all corporate and 
joint venture facilities now extending until at least 2018.
We have sufficient headroom within our corporate facilities 
to enable us to meet future development and funding needs. 
At the date of reporting we have £554m of facilities against 
year-end drawn debt of £334m. 
Hedging and cost of debt
We aim to have predictable costs attached to our borrowing 
and therefore hedge the majority of our interest rate risk. 
As anticipated, at the year end we were 63% hedged against 
our corporate debt which is a significant fall compared to the 
previous year (2013: 86%). As any new financing is put in place 
we will ensure that our hedging positions are appropriate for our 
future development.
Corporate funding covenants
We are operating well within the covenants that apply to 
both our corporate banking facilities and to the retail bond. 
These are:
Bank:
• Net assets must be greater than £250m (actual £737m).
• Gearing must not exceed 175% (actual 45%).
• Interest cover ratio (that excludes non-cash items such 
as revaluation movements) must be greater than 1.25x 
(actual 3.2x).
Retail bond:
• See-through loan-to-value ratio must not exceed 75% 
(actual 30%).
• Interest cover ratio must be greater than 1.5x (actual 4.2x).
The current economic environment still has an element of 
uncertainty. However, we have considered available market 
information, consulted with our advisors and applied our 
own knowledge and experience, and we have concluded 
that covenant levels are adequate for our possible 
negative scenarios.

Pension scheme
Our defined benefit pension scheme continues to be fully 
funded on an IAS19 basis. With the scheme being closed 
to new entrants and closed to future accrual we do not 
currently expect any significant material future increase in 
scheme contributions.
OUTLOOK
Achieving record profits is testament to our skill in generating 
strong returns through our market-leading expertise and 
foresight in regeneration and development. 
During the year, we have taken advantage of an improving 
marketplace and have focused on growing our income across 
the UK through active asset management initiatives and 
disposals of those properties to which we can no longer add 
value. We will continue to do so in 2015 whilst growing our 
pipeline of development opportunities as enquiries continue to 
increase and the market gathers pace. 
We also look forward to making further progress on New 
Covent Garden Market which is not yet accounted for within our 
financial results. All of these factors and our ability to harness 
the growth in the marketplace whilst also maintaining a prudent 
financial structure provide us with an excellent base from which 
to grow the business further.

RISK MANAGEMENT
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board recognises the importance of identifying and actively 
monitoring the full range of financial and non-financial risks 
facing the business. Its policy is to have systems in place which 
optimise the Company’s ability to manage risk in an effective 
and appropriate manner. By regularly reviewing the risk appetite 
of the business, the Board ensures that the risk exposure 
remains appropriate at any point in the cycle.
Importantly the Board perceives risk not only as having a 
potential negative influence on the business but also as an 
opportunity that can be a source of financial outperformance 
as we have the expertise to take and manage risks that others 
cannot. As the UK’s leading regeneration specialist, exposure 
to risk is inherent in our business but is subject to extensive 
mitigating controls.
The Board is ultimately responsible for maintaining sound risk 
management and internal control systems and for determining 
the nature and extent of the principal risks it is willing to take 
to achieve its strategic objectives. Management assesses 
and the Audit Committee reviews the principal risks facing the 
Company, including those that would threaten its solvency or 
liquidity. Their evaluation of these solvency risks is described 
further in the Going Concern section on page 104 of the Annual 
Report 2014 and a description of how these risks are managed 
and mitigated is included in the table of principal risks on pages 
40–43.
The Audit Committee also oversees the effectiveness of sound 
risk management and internal control systems. During the 
year it considered a detailed report from management which 
sets out the Group’s control environment, the manner in which 
key business risks are identified, the adequacy of information 
systems and control procedures and the manner in which any 
required corrective action is to be taken.
The executive directors are responsible for delivering 
the Company’s strategy and managing operational risk. 
They in turn place reliance on the Property Board and their 
teams to monitor and manage operational risk on an ongoing 
basis, as well as identifying emerging risks. Risk registers, which 
exist at both a Group and regional basis, provide a framework 
for all employees to contribute in recognition of their shared 
responsibility for effective management of risk in delivering 
our strategy.
The work of the internal audit function is focused on the 
controls that mitigate the principal risks faced by the Group. 
Key internal controls are reviewed by internal audit as part of the 
annual audit plan and findings are reported to and considered 
by the Audit Committee.
OUR APPROACH TO RISK MANAGEMENT
At St. Modwen, assessment of risk is a cornerstone of our 
strategy and our risk management framework is fundamental 
to its delivery. Our integrated approach combines a top-
down strategic view with a complementary bottom-up 
operational process.
The top-down approach involves a review of the external 
environment in which we operate, to guide an assessment of 
the risks which we are comfortable exposing the business to 
in pursuit of our strategy. The bottom-up process involves the 
identification, management and monitoring of risks in each area 
of our business to ensure that risk management is embedded 
in our everyday operations. Control of this process is provided 
through maintenance of regional risk registers. This approach 
ensures that operational risks are fully considered in determining 
the risk appetite and corresponding strategy of the business.
Key features of St. Modwen’s risk management and 
internal control system:
• an organisational structure with clear segregation of duties, 
control and authority;
• a robust system of financial reporting, budgeting and 
re-forecasting processes;
• monthly operational reviews between the Chief Executive 
and regional directors;
• comprehensive monthly reporting to the Board through 
development progress reviews, management accounts 
and a comparison of committee expenditure against 
available facilities;
• clearly defined procedures for the authorisation of capital 
expenditure, acquisitions and sales of development and 
investment properties, construction activity, and other 
contracts and commitments;
• a treasury policy;
• a formal schedule of matters, including major investment 
and development decisions and strategic matters, that are 
reserved for Board approval;
• a suite of policies and procedures in respect of anti-bribery 
and corruption, fraud prevention and IT security;
• an independently operated whistleblowing facility to 
enable employees to raise concerns on a confidential 
basis, with investigation overseen by the Audit Committee; 
and
• other control measures outlined elsewhere in this Annual 
Report, including legal and regulatory compliance and 
health and safety. St. Modwen Properties PLC Results Announcement 201 4 39
Strategic Report 01–43 Financial Statements 44–85 Additional Information 86
Details of the principal risks which could prevent the 
achievement of our strategic objectives and may have a 
material impact on our business are set out in the table that 
follows. This year we recognise the increasing risks associated 
with upcoming political events, such as the UK General Election 
and cyber-crime.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s 
systems of internal control and risk management during the 
period covered by this Annual Report. It confirms that the 
processes described above, which accord with guidance on 
internal control, have been in place throughout that period 
and up to the date of approval of this report. The Board also 
confirms that it has not identified, nor been advised of, a failing 
or weakness which it has determined to be significant.
St. Modwen’s risk management and internal control systems 
are designed to identify, manage and, where practicable, reduce 
and mitigate the effect of the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives. They are not designed to eliminate such risk and 
can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
In 2014 a workshop facilitated by KPMG was held for senior 
management to consider in detail the effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk management framework and review the Group’s 
risk register. The workshop focused on:
• the risk management culture within St. Modwen;
• the governance framework;
• risk identification and assessment processes;
• internal reporting;
• monitoring and assurance; and
• mitigation and controls. Strategic Report

OUR PRINCIPAL RISKS

EXCELLENT 
RETURNS…
Market/economic changes such 
as higher interest rates, reduced 
demand for land/new properties, 
reduced availability of credit and 
declining investment yields restrict 
business development and cause 
valuation falls. Significant upcoming 
political events which delay and/or 
impact investment decisions and 
reduce returns.
• Regional spread and portfolio diversity mitigates sector or 
location-specific risks.
• Active portfolio management achieves a better than 
market utilisation of assets.
• Hedging policy reduces interest rate risk.
• Investment and financing strategy is determined against a 
backdrop of potential outcomes of political events. 
We choose to operate only in the UK, which is subject to relatively low risk and low returns from a 
stable and mature, albeit cyclical, economy and property market. By involvement with all sectors of 
that economy and property market, we are as diversified as possible, without venturing overseas. 
Our land bank of 5,900 acres provides us with the flexibility to move with market demands and 
pursue those opportunities that generate the greatest value at any one time. The 2015 UK General 
Election has the potential to impact the appeal and performance of investment in the UK in general 
and real estate in particular, both through the related uncertainty and resultant implementation of 
policies and regulation.
Over the course of the last year, the continuing economic problems within the Eurozone mean that 
the overall market position continues to represent a risk.
Changes to local and national 
planning processes adversely 
impacts our strategy by limiting our 
ability to secure viable permissions 
and/or by removing our competitive 
advantage.
• Use of high-quality professional advisors.
• Active involvement in public consultation.
• Constant monitoring of all aspects of the planning process 
by experienced in-house experts.
• Lobbying to/contact with both central 
and local Government.
Our daily exposure to all aspects of the planning process, and internal procedures for sharing best 
practice, ensure we remain abreast of most developments. Furthermore, we continue our efforts to 
influence public policy debate. Although the imminent General Election means that future rules are 
uncertain, our expertise should enable us to prosper relative to our competitors, irrespective of the 
planning environment.
Inadequate due diligence on major 
new schemes, programme 
management, construction 
delivery and/or procurement 
leads to unforeseen exposures, 
quality issues and/or cost overruns 
causing customer dissatisfaction 
and/or financial loss.
• Acquisitions, development and ultimate disposals are 
reviewed and financially appraised in detail, with clearly 
defined authority limits.
• Strong internal construction management team.
• Clearly defined formal tender process that evaluates 
qualitative and quantitative factors in bid assessment.
• Use and close supervision of a preferred supply chain of 
high-quality trusted suppliers and professionals. 
• Contractual liability clearly defined.
Our programme for the year has been completed on time and within budget. Our contractor 
selection and management processes are rigorous; we continue to favour financially stable 
and robust contractors and are mindful of contractors’ cash flows becoming stretched in a 
rising market.
Financial collapse of, or dispute 
with, a key joint venture partner 
leads to financial loss.
• Monthly review of performance to identify if senior 
management intervention is required.
• Flexible but legally secure contracts with partners.
• Fewer but financially strong partners.
Our key partners are Persimmon PLC, VINCI plc and Salhia Real Estate K.S.C. of Kuwait. 
These are financially strong partners with good prospects and considerable financial resources.  
We maintain detailed and ongoing dialogue and have exited from any arrangements with financially 
weaker partners, so the overall risk continues to reduce year-on-year.

Failure to manage long-term 
environmental issues relating to 
brownfield and contaminated sites 
leads to a major environmental

• Use of high-quality external advisors.
• Highly qualified, experienced staff and proven track record

• Risk assessments conducted as part of due diligence

acquisition and cost plans allowing for unforeseen 
remediation costs.
• Full warranties from professional consultants and 
remediation contractors.
• Defined business processes to proactively manage issues.
• Annual independent audit of environmental risk.
• Reputation managed by a core team of skilled PR 
professionals.
We are willing to accept a degree of environmental risk, enabling higher returns to be made.  
The inherent risks are passed on or minimised where possible but cannot be eliminated,  
although the residual risks have been acceptably low in recent years.
Failure to recruit, develop and 
retain staff with the necessary skills

• Succession planning monitored at Board level and below.
• T argeted recruitment with competitive, performance-
driven remuneration packages to secure highly-skilled and 
motivated employees.
• Leadership and management development plans in place.
• Exit interviews undertaken.
• Key information is documented to safeguard knowledge.
Our succession planning was put into action during the year with the promotion of Stephen Prosser 
as Midlands Regional Director and the appointments of Richard Bannister, Steven Knowles, 
Richard Powell and Andy T aylor to the Property Board. Staff turnover remains low and the 
proportion of management with more than three years’ service is now at 84%. As competition to 
attract the best people increases, we continue to adapt our recruitment strategy to source the skills 
that will support the Company’ s long-term business objectives.

OUR PRINCIPAL RISKS
continued
WHILE 
PROTECTING 
OUR ASSETS
Availability of funding reduces, 
causing a lack of liquidity that 
impacts borrowing capacity and 
reduces the saleability of assets. 
Unforeseen significant changes 
to cash flow requirements 
(e.g. operating cost increases, 
pension fund shortfall) which limit 
the ability of the business to meet 
its ongoing commitments.
• Recurring income from rents provides funding for a large 
percentage of overhead and interest costs.
• Strong relationships with key banks; all corporate debt 
refinanced until at least 2018.
• Finance successfully raised through alternative, unsecured 
means (retail bond, equity placing and convertible bond).
• Financial headroom maintained to provide flexibility and 
scenario modelling tools employed to evaluate the 
likelihood of a breach of financing covenant limits.
• Regular and detailed cash flow forecasting enables 
monitoring of performance and management of future 
cash flows.
Our geared financial structure means that there are inevitable risks attached to the availability of 
funding and the management of fluctuations in our cash flows. Our prudent approach to forward 
commitments, speculative development and asset disposals has enabled us to optimise 
operational cash flows and offset the impact of fluctuating market conditions. Over the last year we 
successfully launched a £100m convertible bond and have refinanced the debt portfolio, extending 
the weighted average life to 4.6 years (2013: 2.5 years) and reducing the weighted average cost of 
debt to 4.8% (2013: 5.6%).
Failure to anticipate market 
changes through poor market 
intelligence leads to the selection 
of inappropriate and, ultimately, 
unprofitable schemes.
• Regional offices in touch with their local market.
• Dedicated central resource supporting regional teams.
• Flexible and innovative approach to acquisitions and 
schemes in order to adapt to market changes.
• Acquisitions, development and ultimate disposals are 
reviewed and financially appraised in detail, with clearly 
defined authority limits.
The excellent reputation and financial capacity of the Company has enabled us to continue to win 
schemes and grow the property portfolio in an improving but still challenging market and economy. 
In this environment, with a reduced number of active competitors, we expect to be able to continue 
to source attractive acquisitions.
Failure to identify a pipeline of future 
residential sites or reduced 
availability of mortgage finance 
adversely impacts the performance 
of our residential business.
• T eam of professionals with residential experience 
and expertise.
• Extensive land bank with a continuing stream of 
planning applications.
• Flexible approach to mortgage financing (e.g. shared 
equity schemes).
• Use of joint venture partners with residential expertise 
(e.g. Persimmon).
Whilst the planning environment remains challenging and subject to inevitable delays, our scale and 
expertise enables us to navigate the process with considerable success. Demand for new homes 
remains strong, supported by the NPPF’ s housing supply requirements and the availability of 
mortgage finance (due at least in part to the Government’ s Help to Buy scheme). Furthermore, the 
geographic spread of our business means we are not overly exposed to any one region.
Safety, health and environment 
(SHE) culture leads to a major 
incident (e.g. serious injury to, or 
death of, an employee, client, 
contractor or member of the public) 
or non-compliance with legislation, 
resulting in financial penalties and/or 
reputational damage.
• Use of high-quality external SHE advisors.
• Annual cycle of SHE audits.
• SHE Steering Group chaired by the Group 
Construction Director.
• Regular Board reporting.
• Programme of employee training specific to roles 
and responsibilities.
• Defined business processes to proactively manage issues.
Health and safety continues to be a high priority. The assessment of environmental costs (and the 
subsequent optimising of remediation solutions) is an integral part of our acquisition and post-
acquisition processes. We seek to minimise or pass on any such environmental risks, and believe 
that the residual risk remains acceptably low. In other social and ethical areas, our operations are 
underpinned by a simple but rigorous set of operating commitments.
Inadequate security or business 
continuity and disaster recovery 
planning for operations and IT , 
leading to significant business 
disruption, financial/intellectual 
property loss and/or reputational 
damage in the event of an accident, 
act of terrorism or cyber-crime.
• Asset risk assessments (e.g. security, environmental, 
health and safety).
• Documented disaster recovery and crisis management 
plans in place across the business.
• Dedicated IT team monitors security and performance of 
all information systems.
• Comprehensive insurance arrangements.
Whilst our exposure to the loss of intellectual property is relatively low, we are mindful of the 
increasing threat to corporate security from cyber-crime. As the profile of cyber-security continues 
to grow, our risk management approach has adapted to further increase preventative security and 
enhance the robustness of existing procedures.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The Group’s Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and as adopted by the EU as they apply to the Group for the year 
ended 30
th
 November 2014, applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of certain properties, derivative 
financial instruments and the defined benefit section of the Group’s pension scheme.
The Group’s functional currency is pounds sterling and its principal IFRSs accounting policies are set out below.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The Group’s Financial Statements consolidate the Financial Statements of St. Modwen Properties PLC and the entities it controls. 
Control comprises the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee and is achieved through direct or indirect 
ownership of voting rights or by contractual agreement. A list of the principal entities controlled is given in note (F) to the Company’s 
Financial Statements.
VSM Estates (Holdings) Ltd is 50% owned by St. Modwen Properties PLC. However, under the funding agreement, the 
Group obtains the majority of the benefits of the entity and also retains the majority of the residual risks. This entity is therefore 
consolidated in accordance with SIC 12 ‘Consolidation — Special Purpose Entities’.
All entities are consolidated from the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that 
such control ceases. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expense are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets that are not held by the Group and are presented 
separately within equity in the Group Balance Sheet.
INTERESTS IN JOINT VENTURES
The Group recognises its interests in joint ventures, being those entities over which the Group has joint control, using the equity 
method of accounting. Under the equity method, the interest in the joint venture is carried in the Balance Sheet at cost plus post-
acquisition changes in the Group’s share of its net assets, less distributions received, less any impairment in value of individual 
investments. The Income Statement reflects the Group’s share of the jointly controlled entities’ results after interest and tax.
Financial Statements of joint ventures are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. Where necessary, adjustments are 
made to bring the accounting policies used into line with those of the Group.
The Group Statement of Comprehensive Income reflects the Group’s share of any income and expense recognised by the jointly 
controlled entities outside the Income Statement.
INTERESTS IN ASSOCIATES
The Group’s interests in its associates, being those entities over which it has significant influence and which are neither subsidiaries 
nor joint ventures, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, as described above.
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the 
acquisition of a subsidiary comprises the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued 
by the Group. The consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration arrangement and the fair 
value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in 
a business combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at 
the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets.
The excess of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the 
Group’s share of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If those amounts are less than the fair value of the net 
identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary and the measurement of all amounts has been reviewed, the difference is recognised 
directly in the Income Statement as negative goodwill. 
Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present 
value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity’s incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate that a similar 
borrowing could be obtained from an independent financier under comparable terms and conditions. 
Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Amounts classified as a financial liability are 
subsequently remeasured to fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Income Statement. St. Modwen Properties PLC Results Announcement 201 4 49
Strategic Report 01–43 Financial Statements 44–85 Additional Information 86
PROPERTIES
Investment properties
Investment properties, being freehold and leasehold properties held to earn rental income, for capital appreciation and/or for 
undetermined future use, are carried at fair value following initial recognition at the present value of the consideration payable. 
T o establish fair value, investment properties are independently valued on the basis of market value. Any surplus or deficit arising  
is recognised in the Income Statement for the period.
Once classified as an investment property, a property remains in this category until development with a view to sale commences,  
at which point the asset is transferred to inventories at current valuation.
Where an investment property is being redeveloped for continued use as an investment property, the property remains within 
investment property and any movement in valuation is recognised in the Income Statement.
Investment property disposals are recognised on completion. Profits and losses arising are recognised through the Income 
Statement and the profit or loss on disposal is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount 
of the asset.
Investment properties are not depreciated.
Inventories
Inventories principally comprise properties held for sale, properties under construction and land under option. All inventories are 
carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises land, direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs that have been incurred in bringing the inventories 
to their present location and condition. When inventory includes a transfer from investment properties, cost is recorded as the 
book value at the date of transfer. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be 
incurred to completion and disposal.
Operating property, plant and equipment
Operating property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Such cost includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.
Depreciation is provided on all operating property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated 
residual value of each asset evenly over its expected useful life as follows:
• Leasehold operating properties — over the shorter of the lease term and 25 years; and
• Plant, machinery and equipment — over two to five years.
LEASES
The Group as lessee
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Non-property assets held under finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease with a corresponding liability being 
recognised for the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are 
apportioned between the reduction of the lease liability and finance charges in the Income Statement so as to achieve a constant 
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Non-property assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the 
shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Freehold interests in leasehold investment properties are accounted for as finance leases with the present value of guaranteed 
minimum ground rents included within the carrying value of the property and within long-term liabilities. On payment of a 
guaranteed ground rent, virtually all of the cost is charged to the Income Statement as interest payable, and the balance reduces 
the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Group as lessor
Rental income from operating leases is recognised in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Financial Statements

INCOME TAXES
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from, or paid to, the taxation authorities, 
based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable result for the year. The taxable result differs from the result as reported in the 
Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further 
excludes items that will not be taxable or deductible.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts in the Financial Statements, using the rates of tax expected to apply based on legislation enacted or 
substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date, with the following exceptions:
• in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, where 
the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future; and
• deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when 
the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets 
and liabilities on a net basis.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity. Otherwise, income tax 
is recognised in the Income Statement.
PENSIONS
The Group operates a pension scheme with both defined benefit and defined contribution sections. The defined benefit section is 
closed to new members and, from 1
st
 September 2009, to future accrual.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit section is determined using the projected unit credit method, which 
attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period (to determine current service cost) and to the current and prior periods 
(to determine the present value of defined benefit obligation) and is based on actuarial advice. Past service costs are recognised 
in the Income Statement immediately if the benefits have vested.
The interest element of the defined benefit cost represents the change in present value of scheme obligations resulting from the 
passage of time and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening present value of the benefit obligation, taking into 
account material changes in the obligation during the year. The expected return on plan assets is based on an assessment made 
at the beginning of the year of long-term market returns on scheme assets, adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets 
of contributions received and benefits paid during the year. The difference between the expected return on plan assets and the 
interest cost is recognised in the Income Statement as other finance income or expense.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year in which they occur. 
The defined benefit pension asset or liability in the Balance Sheet comprises the present value of the defined benefit obligation, less 
any past service cost not yet recognised and less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
When a pension asset (net surplus) arises and the directors consider it is controlled by the Company such that future economic 
benefits will be available to the Company, it is carried forward in accordance with the requirements of IFRIC14.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are recognised in the Income Statement in the year in which they become payable.
OWN SHARES
Shares in St. Modwen Properties PLC held by the Group are classified in equity attributable to owners of the Company and are 
recognised at cost.
DIVIDENDS
Dividends declared and approved after the Balance Sheet date are not recognised as liabilities at the Balance Sheet date. St. Modwen Properties PLC Results Announcement 201 4 51
Strategic Report 01–43 Financial Statements 44–85 Additional Information 86
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably 
measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, excluding discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales 
taxes or duty. The following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
Sale of property
Revenue arising from the sale of property is recognised on legal completion of the sale. Where revenue is earned for development of 
property assets not owned, this is recognised when the Group has substantially fulfilled its obligations in respect of the transaction.
Construction contracts
Revenue arising from construction contracts is recognised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy on construction 
contracts (see below).
Rental income
Rental income arising from investment properties is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Interest income
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, 
which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts over the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net 
carrying amount.
Dividend income
Dividend income from joint ventures is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the 
stage of completion of the contract activity at the Balance Sheet date. The extent to which the contract is complete is determined 
by the total costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total anticipated costs of the entire contract. Variations in contract work, 
claims and incentive payments are included only to the extent they have been agreed with the purchaser.
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised only to the extent of 
contract costs incurred where it is probable they will be recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in 
which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately.
GOVERNMENT GRANTS
Government grants relating to property are treated as deferred income and released to profit or loss over the expected useful life  
of the assets concerned.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Group accounts for share-based payments as equity-settled. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant using an appropriate option pricing model. For those share options that had previously been accounted 
for as cash-settled, the fair value at the date of transition became the fair value at the date of grant for the equity-settled share-
based options. The fair value at the date of grant is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Group’s 
estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash 
flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the 
asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues 
to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for any amounts it 
may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group 
continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received. The Group 
derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled, or expire.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value or recoverable amount. Provision is made 
when there is evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full. Balances are written off when the probability of 
recovery is assessed as being remote. Financial Statements

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and short-term deposits with banks.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables on deferred payment terms are initially recorded by discounting the nominal amount payable to net present 
value. The discount to nominal value is amortised over the period of the deferred arrangement and charged to finance costs.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, loans 
and borrowings are measured at amortised cost.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised in finance income or 
finance expense as appropriate.
The effective interest rate method is used to charge interest to the Income Statement.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with interest rate 
fluctuations. Such instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a contract is entered into and are 
subsequently remeasured at fair value. The Group has determined that the derivative financial instruments in use do not qualify 
for hedge accounting and, consequently, any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken to the 
Income Statement.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received less direct issue costs.
Convertible bonds
Convertible bonds are assessed on issue as to whether they should be classified as a financial liability, as equity or as a compound 
financial instrument with both debt and equity components. This assessment is based on the terms of the bond and in accordance 
with IAS32 Financial Instruments: Presentation.
USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
T o be able to prepare Financial Statements according to generally accepted accounting principles, management must make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the asset and liability items and revenue and expense amounts recorded in the Financial 
Statements. These estimates are based on the Group’s systems of internal control, historical experience and the advice of external 
experts (including qualified professional valuers and actuaries) together with various other assumptions that management and the 
Board of Directors believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these considerations form the basis for making 
judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.
The areas requiring the use of estimates and critical judgements that may significantly impact the Group’s earnings and financial 
position are:
Going concern The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. This is discussed in the Strategic Report 
and adoption of the going concern assumption is confirmed in the Directors’ Report.
Valuation of investment properties Management has used the valuation performed by its independent valuers as the fair value of 
its investment properties. The valuation is performed according to RICS rules, using appropriate levels of professional judgement 
for the prevailing market conditions.
Net realisable value of inventories The Group has ongoing procedures for assessing the carrying value of inventories and 
identifying where this is in excess of net realisable value. Management’s assessment of any resulting provision requirement is, 
where applicable, supported by independent information supplied by the external valuers. The estimates and judgements used 
were based on information available at, and pertaining to, 30
th
 November 2014. Any subsequent adverse changes in market 
conditions may result in additional provisions being required.
Estimation of remediation and other costs to complete for both development and investment properties In making an 
assessment of these costs there is inherent uncertainty and the Group has developed systems of internal control to assess and 
review carrying values and the appropriateness of estimates made. Any changes to these estimates may impact the carrying values 
of investment properties and/or inventories. St. Modwen Properties PLC Results Announcement 201 4 53
Strategic Report 01–43 Financial Statements 44–85 Additional Information 86
Taxation As a property group, tax and its treatment is often an integral part of transactions. The outcome of tax treatments are 
recognised by the Group to the extent the outcome is reasonably certain. Where tax treatments have been challenged by HMRC, 
or management believe that there is a risk of such challenge, provision is made for the best estimate of potential exposure based 
on the information available at the Balance Sheet date. Management’s assessment of the level of provision required is, where 
applicable, supported by the Group’s tax advisors. If HMRC were to be successful in challenging tax treatments to a greater extent 
than has been provided at the Balance Sheet date then additional provisions may be required. 
Calculation of the net present value of pension scheme liabilities In calculating this liability it is necessary for actuarial 
assumptions to be made, including discount and mortality rates and the long-term rate of return upon scheme assets. The Group 
engages a qualified actuary to assist with determining the assumptions to be made and evaluating these liabilities.
ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED STANDARDS
Standards and interpretations adopted
The following standards, amendments and interpretations have been adopted in the current year:
• IFRS13 Fair Value Measurement: This standard applies to IFRSs that require or permit fair value measurements or disclosures 
and provides a single IFRS framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurement. 
The adoption of this standard has had no material impact on the measurement of fair value for the Group’s assets and liabilities 
and no retrospective changes were required as a result of adopting this standard. Additional disclosures required by this standard 
are set out in note 16.
• IAS19 (revised 2011) Employee Benefits: No material impact on the Group’s Financial Statements. Revised disclosures as 
required by this standard are set out in note 18.
In addition, minor amendments to existing standards were made under Improvements to IFRSs (issued December 2010) and have 
been adopted during the year.
Impact of standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective
At the date of approval of these Financial Statements, the following standards, amendments and interpretations which have not 
been adopted in these Financial Statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by 
the EU):
IAS1 Disclosure Initiative
IAS19 (revised 2013) Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions
IAS27 (revised 2011) Separate Financial Statements
IAS27 (amended 2012) Investment Entities
IAS28 (revised 2011) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
IAS36 (amended 2013) Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-financial Assets
IAS39 (amended 2013) Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting
IFRIC21 Levies
IFRS9 Financial Instruments
IFRS10 Consolidated Financial Statements
IFRS10 (amended 2012) Investment Entities
IFRS11 Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations
IFRS12 (amended 2012) Investment Entities
IFRS14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts
IFRS15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
In addition, Improvements to IFRSs (issued May 2012, December 2013 and September 2014) are the latest tranches of the 
Improvements to IFRSs project and these have a number of minor amendments to existing IAS and IFRSs which have not yet 
been adopted.
The directors are still assessing the impact that the adoption of these standards, amendments and interpretations will have on the 
Financial Statements of the Group in future periods. Adoption of the majority of these standards, amendments and interpretations 
are expected to have little or no impact on the reported results of the Group, although amended disclosures may be required. 
IFRS15 may have an impact on revenue recognition and related disclosures. It is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate 
of the effect of IFRS 15 until a detailed review of the revenue streams to which is expected to apply has been completed.  Financial Statements

• Residential development, being housebuilding activity through St. Modwen Homes and the Persimmon joint venture 
arrangements; and
• The balance of the Group’s portfolio of properties which the Group manages internally, and reports as a single business segment.

The Group continues to monitor the provision of non-audit services provided by the auditor and fees charged for other services 
in 2014 were less than 100% of audit and audit-related fees. The Group’s policy permits the auditor to provide non-audit services 
where alternative providers do not exist or where it is cost effective or in the Group’s interest for the external auditor to provide such 
services. Of particular note with respect to non-audit services provided by Deloitte in the year are:
(1)  Following a formal tender process, which did not include Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) was engaged in June 
2014 to provide tax compliance services to the Group. As a result the level of tax compliance and advisory services provided by 
Deloitte has reduced in the year. St. Modwen Properties PLC Results Announcement 201 4 61
Strategic Report 01–43 Financial Statements 44–85 Additional Information 86
(2)  Deloitte Real Estate (previously Drivers Jonas) provided property consulting services to the Group in the year. All property 
consulting services provided were in respect of long-term projects at Burnley and Leegate (where 50% of the planning costs 
will be borne by the tenant). In both cases the involvement of Drivers Jonas pre-dated the firm’s acquisition by Deloitte and it 
was not in the Group’s commercial interests to change provider. Advice in respect of Burnley is now substantially complete but 
some follow up work may be required in respect of Leegate. No further work has been, or is currently planned to be, placed with 
Deloitte Real Estate. 
The above amounts include all amounts charged in respect of joint venture undertakings. Further information is included in the 
Audit Committee Report.

d. Share-based payments
The Group has a SAYE share option scheme open to all employees. Employees must ordinarily remain in service for a period of 
three or five years from the date of grant before exercising their options. The option period ends six months following the end of the 
vesting period. The Group also has an Executive Share Option Scheme and Performance Share Plan (PSP), full details of which are 
given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
The following table illustrates the movements in share options during the year. As the PSP includes the grant of options at £nil 
exercise price the weighted average prices below are calculated including and excluding the options granted under this plan with 
nil exercise price.

(1) Based on the earlier of the 90 day average to 30th November 2011 or, for options granted after this date, the closing share price on the date of grant. 
The fair value of the share incentive reserve in respect of share options outstanding at the year end was £4.8m (2013: £2.1m) and 
included £0.8m (2013: £0.7m) in respect of options that had vested at the year end.
In arriving at fair value it has been assumed that, when vested, shares options are exercised in accordance with historical trends. 
Expected volatility was determined by reference to the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over a period consistent with 
the expected life of the options.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise was £3.82 (2013: £3.00). The executive share options outstanding at the 
year end had a range of exercise prices between £1.75 and £3.75 (2013: £1.69 and £3.75) with PSP options exercisable at between 
£nil and £1.52 (2013: £nil and £1.52). Outstanding options had a weighted average maximum remaining contractual life of nine 
years (2013: nine years).

At the Balance Sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses in relation to 2014 and prior years of £1.3m (2013: £3.2m), of which 
£nil (2013: £1.6m) has been recognised as a deferred tax asset. A deferred tax asset of £1.3m (2013: £1.6m) has not been 
recognised in respect of current and prior year tax losses as it is not considered sufficiently certain that there will be appropriate 
taxable profits available in the short-term against which these can be utilised. 
d. Factors that may affect future tax charges
Based on current capital investment plans, the Group expects to continue to be able to claim capital allowances in excess of 
depreciation in future years.
As a property group, tax and its treatment is often an integral part of transactions. The outcome of tax treatments are recognised by 
the Group to the extent the outcome is reasonably certain. Where tax treatments have been challenged by HMRC, or management 
believe that there is a risk of such challenge, provision is made for the best estimate of potential exposure based on the information 
available at the Balance Sheet date. St. Modwen Properties PLC Results Announcement 201 4 65

The directors consider all inventories to be current in nature. The operational cycle is such that a proportion of inventories will not 
be realised within 12 months. It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this will be 
subject to a number of issues including the strength of the property market.
Included within disposals of inventories are net realisable value provisions made during the year of £0.1m (2013: £1.7m).
As at 30

c) Convertible bonds
On 6
th
 March 2014 St. Modwen Properties Securities (Jersey) Ltd (the Issuer) issued £100.0m 2.875% Guaranteed Convertible 
Bonds due 2019 (the Convertible Bonds) at par. The Company has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed the due and 
punctual performance by the Issuer of all its obligations (including payments) in respect of the Convertible Bonds and the 
obligations of the Company, as guarantor, constitute direct, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Company. 
Subject to certain conditions, the Convertible Bonds are convertible into preference shares of the Issuer which are automatically 
transferred to the Company in exchange for ordinary shares in the Company or (at the Company’s election) any combination of 
ordinary shares and cash. The Convertible Bonds can be converted at any time from 16
th
 April 2014 up to the 7
th
 dealing day before 
the maturity date. 
The initial exchange price was £5.29 per ordinary share, a conversion rate of approximately 18,889 ordinary shares for every 
£100,000 nominal value of the Convertible Bonds. Under the terms of the Convertible Bonds, the exchange price is adjusted 
on the happening of certain events, including the payment of dividends by the Company in excess of a yield of 1.00% of the 
average share price in the 90 days preceding the ex-dividend date. No changes to the exchange price have been made up to 
30
th
 November 2014. 
The Convertible Bonds may be redeemed at par at the Company’s option subject to the Company’s ordinary share price having 
traded at 30% above the conversion price for a specified period, or at any time once 85% of the Convertible Bonds have been 
traded or cancelled. If not previously converted, redeemed or purchased and cancelled, the Convertible Bonds will be redeemed 
at par on 6
th
 March 2019.
A total of £100.0m nominal value of the Convertible Bonds were issued and remained outstanding at 30
th
 November 2014. 
The Convertible Bonds are designated as at fair value through profit or loss and so are presented on the Balance Sheet at fair value 
with all gains and losses taken to the Income Statement through the movement in fair value of derivative financial instruments line. 
At 30
th
 November 2014 the fair value of the Convertible Bonds was £99.1m with the change in fair value charged to the Income 
Statement. The Convertible Bonds are listed on the Official List of the Channel Islands Security Exchange. 
Following the issue of the Convertible Bonds the Group was in an over-hedged position with an excess of debt at fixed rate. 
In order to reduce the level of fixed rate borrowings an interest rate derivative was entered into to swap the interest rate in the 
Convertible Bonds from a fixed rate of 2.875% to a floating rate of 6 month LIBOR plus 1.43% through to its third anniversary in 
March 2017.
The change in fair value of all of the above instruments is charged/credited to the Income Statement is disclosed in note 4.

Fair value hierachy of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, are required to be grouped 
into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
• Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets;
• Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are 
observable for the asset, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset that are not based 
on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The following table provides an analysis of the categorisation of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities measured subsequent to 
initial recognition at fair value:

Investment properties were valued at 30
th
 November 2014 by DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Ltd, Chartered Surveyors 
(2013: Jones Lang LaSalle LLP), in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual of the Royal Institution of Chartered 
Surveyors, on the basis of market value. Both DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Ltd and Jones Lang LaSalle LLP are professionally 
qualified independent external valuers and had appropriate recent experience in the relevant location and category of the 
properties being valued.
Income producing properties have been valued using the investment method which involves applying a yield to rental income 
streams. Inputs include equivalent yields, current rent and ERV . The resulting valuations are cross checked against the resulting 
initial yields and, for certain assets, the land value underpin if the assets were to be redeveloped. For the valuation as at 
30
th
 November 2014 equivalent yields ranged from 7.0% to 14.5% (2013: 7.1% to 19.0%).
Residential land is valued using the residual development method. T o derive the value of land the valuers will estimate the gross 
development value of completed residential units on a site from which deductions will be made for build costs (including costs to 
remediate and service land), finance costs and an appropriate profit margin.

Capital risk 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that the entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising 
the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Company consists 
of debt (as disclosed in note 14), cash and cash equivalents and equity, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings 
as disclosed in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
Market risk 
Market risk is the potential adverse change in Group income or the Group net worth arising from movements in interest rates or 
other market prices. Interest rate risk is the Group’s principal market risk and is considered below.
Interest rate risk management: The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows funds at variable interest rates. 
The Group uses a combination of variable rate borrowings and interest rate swaps to manage the risk. Financial Statements

Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss where counterparties are not able to meet their obligations as they fall due.
The credit risk on the Group’s liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with 
acceptable (generally A and above) credit ratings. Bank deposits are only placed with banks in accordance with Group policy that 
specifies minimum credit rating and maximum exposure. Credit risk on derivatives is closely monitored.
Trade and other receivables consist of amounts due from a large number of parties spread across geographical areas. The Group 
does not have any significant concentrations of credit risk as the tenant base is large and diverse with the largest individual tenant 
accounting for £1.6m (2013: £1.6m) of gross rental income.
The carrying amount of financial assets, as detailed above, represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at the 
reporting date.
Included within trade and other receivables is £0.6m (2013: £0.5m) which is provided against as it represents estimated 
irrecoverable amounts. This allowance has been determined by a review of all significant balances that are past due considering 
the reason for non-payment and the creditworthiness of the counterparty. A reconciliation of the changes in this account during the 
year is provided below.

Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient financial resources available to meet its obligations as they fall due. 
The Group manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, matching the maturity profiles of 
financial assets and liabilities and through the use of fixed rate bilateral facilities, overdrafts and cash with a range of maturity dates 
to ensure continuity of funding. 
The maturity profile of the anticipated future cash flows for bank loans and overdrafts is shown in note 14. The maturity profile for

18. PENSIONS
The Group operates a UK based pension scheme, the St. Modwen Pension Scheme, with both defined benefit and defined 
contribution sections. The defined benefit section is closed to new members and, from 1
st
 September 2009, to future accrual. 
The Income Statement includes:
• a charge of £0.2m (2013: £0.2m) for the defined benefit section; and
• a charge of £0.6m (2013: £0.6m) for the defined contribution section.
The St. Modwen Pension Scheme is governed by the trustee company, St. Modwen Pensions Ltd. It is regulated by the UK 
regulatory regime, overseen by the Pensions Regulator.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 5
th
 April 2014, when the market value of the net assets of the scheme 
was £38m, a funding level of 97% based on the trustee’s proposed assumptions for technical provisions. The main actuarial 
assumptions were:
Investment rate of return: pre-retirement 5.6% pa
 post-retirement 3.8% pa
Increase in pensions 2.7% pa
As the scheme is almost fully funded, the current schedule of contributions requires the Group to fund the Scheme to such an 
extent as to cover administrative expenses only. The expected contribution for year ended 30
th
 November 2015 is expected to be 
£0.2m, consistent with the current year (£0.2m).
The actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section, a final salary scheme, was updated to 30
th
 November 2014 on an IAS 
basis by a qualified independent actuary. The valuation was performed using the ‘Projected Unit Credit Method’ under IAS 19. 
The major assumptions used by the actuary were:
2014 2013 2012
Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.1% 2.6% 2.0%
Rate of increase in pensions in payment 
 Pre 6

th
 April 1997 benefits 3.1% 3.4% 2.7%
Discount rate 3.6% 4.5% 4.3%
Inflation assumption 2.1% 2.6% 2.0%
Following the closure of the defined benefit section to future accrual, the assumption regarding the rate of increase in salaries is 
no longer applicable as retirement benefits will be based on salaries at 31
st
 August 2009. Benefits earned up to the point of the 
scheme closure will be protected and will be increased in line with inflation, subject to a maximum of 5% per annum. From 2010 
the basis of the inflation assumption has been amended, in line with market practice, from the Retail Price Index to the Consumer 
Price Index.
The mortality rates adopted are from the Hymans Robertson Scheme Specific VITA T ables with an underpin to future improvements 
of 1% per annum. The cohort effect is assumed to have peaked and improvements remain flat at the oldest ages. The resultant 
assumptions are, for example:
• Average future life expectancy (in years) for a pensioner aged 65 at 30
th
 November 2014: 23.0 (male), 23.8 (female).
• Average future life expectancy (in years) at age 65 for a non-pensioner aged 40 at 30

 November 2014: 23.9 (male), 26.1 (female). St. Modwen Properties PLC Results Announcement 201 4 79

Sensitivity analysis
The impact of changes in actuarial assumptions compared with those adopted for the year ended 30
th
 November 2014 would be:
• A 0.5% decrease in the discount rate would increase the actuarial value of liabilities by £2.2m to £30.8m.
• A one-year increase in life expectancy would increase the actuarial value of liabilities by £0.9m to £29.5m.
Defined benefit scheme – risk factors
The Group is exposed to a number of risks related to its defined benefit scheme, the most significant of which are detailed below.
Asset volatility
Pension scheme liabilities are calculated using discount rates set with reference to bond yields. If the assets within the scheme 
deliver a return which is lower than the discount rate this will create or increase a deficit within the scheme. This risk is reduced by 
holding a significant proportion of the scheme assets in matching assets (bonds or similar). As the scheme matures, it is anticipated 
that this proportion will increase to better match the assets and liabilities of the scheme.
Changes in bond yields
A decrease in bond yields will typically increase liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an appreciation in the value of 
scheme assets held in bonds.
Inflation risk
As the pension obligations are linked to inflation, higher inflation expectations will lead to higher liabilities. The asset portfolio 
includes a significant proportion of inflation linked bonds to reduce this risk.
Member longevity
The pension obligations provide benefits for the life of the members, therefore increases in life expectancy will result in an increase 
in liabilities (and vice-versa).
19. ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARY UNDERTAKING
In 2010, the Group entered into an option to acquire the entire issued share capital of Branston Properties Ltd (Branston), 
of which Simon Clarke is a shareholder, at market value. The price paid for the option was £0.1m with exercise contingent on the 
achievement of certain planning milestones in relation to land held by Branston.
Following achievement of these planning milestones the option was exercised by the Group on 22
nd
 May 2014 and 87.5% of the 
issue share capital of Branston was acquired. A conditional agreement to acquire the remaining 12.5% of the issued share capital, 
which is held by Simon Clarke, was also entered into on 22
nd
 May 2014. T otal consideration payable for the entire issued capital of 
Branston was:
• £0.8m on completion;
• £0.1m payable on shareholder approval;
• £0.1m 12 months after completion; and
• Contingent consideration payable based on the level of future development gains achieved in respect of the land and property 
held by Branston. Based on the provisional fair values detailed below, no contingent consideration has been recognised.
The consideration payable to Mr. Clarke under the conditional agreement equates to 12.5% of the amounts above. As the 
consideration payable to Mr. Clarke is in excess of £100,000, the conditional agreement constitutes a substantial property 
transaction with a director of the Company under sections 190 and 191 of the Companies Act 2006. As a result, the agreement is 
conditional, among other things, on approval of shareholders of St. Modwen Properties PLC; this approval will be sought at the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting to be held on 27
th
 March 2015.
As required by IFRS3 (2008) Business Combinations, this acquisition has resulted in the assets and liabilities of Branston being 
remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date. Fair values are reported as provisional for 12 months to allow the incorporation 
of any subsequent amendments and the negative goodwill arising has been credited to the Income Statement. Financial Statements

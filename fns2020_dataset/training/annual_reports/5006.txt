we offered. In December 2011 we sold 
our Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling division.

SCA Packaging –  
a transformational opportunity
In January 2012 we announced an 
agreement to buy the SCA Packaging 
business. This represents a huge step 
forward for the Group, giving us a 
pan-European footprint. Since January,  
we have put in place detailed integration 
plans. This transaction completes at the 
end of June 2012 and integration will 
begin immediately.

Chairman’s statement
I am delighted to report that 2011/12 has 
been a year of transformation for DS Smith, 
during which the Group has made great  
strides towards its strategic aim of becoming  
the leading supplier of recycled packaging  
for consumer goods. This has been achieved 
through a combination of acquisition and 
disposal, while at the same time keeping a  
keen eye on the underlying business, which  
has continued to perform very well despite the 
current economic difﬁculties throughout Europe. 
DS Smith has gone through a period of great 
change in the last 12 months with more 
changes still to come. Managing this change 
has been a fundamental part of the good 
governance of this Company. Meeting the 
ever-changing demands of the business 
environment, wider social and political 
inﬂuences whilst at the same time ensuring  
that our various stakeholders – shareholders, 
employees, customers and the environment – 
are all given equal consideration, has been  
a challenge that your Board has taken very 
seriously. Ensuring that DS Smith has been  
able to rise to these demands as a cohesive 
Group has been at the heart of all your  
Board’s decisions.
201 1/12 has been a year  
of transformation for DS Smith
Corporate developments and strategy
In December 2010 we set out a clear strategy 
to investors, accompanied by key performance 
indicators and the actions we would seek to 
take. A key one of those was to streamline the 
Group, and I am pleased to report that in July 
2011 we announced the agreement we had 
reached to dispose of our Ofﬁce Products 
Wholesaling division. While a proﬁtable 
business, this had no synergy with the rest  
of the Group and the Board believes that  
the capital realised will deliver a better return 
invested in our core business. Following the 
customary competition authority clearance 
process, that disposal completed in December 
2011. We also sold a small paper mill in 
September 2011, delivering against another 
objective to reduce our exposure to non-
integrated paper manufacturing. 
In January 2012, after six months of exclusive 
negotiation and due diligence, we announced 
our proposal to acquire SCA Packaging 
(excluding its kraftliner assets), the second 
largest corrugated packaging group in Europe. 
The transaction approximately doubles the  
size of the Group and substantially extends  
the DS Smith footprint across Europe.

Business Review
Dividend
The Board considers the dividend to be  
an important component of shareholder  
returns. In December 2010 we set out our 
dividend policy for a progressive dividend 
where dividend cover is expected to average  
between 2.0 and 2.5 times through the cycle. 
Accordingly, the Board recommends  
a ﬁnal dividend for 2011/12 of 4.0 pence 
per share which, together with the interim 
dividend of 1.9 pence per share gives a  
total dividend for the year of 5.9 pence per  
share (2010/11: 4.5 pence per share). This 
represents an increase of 31 per cent over the 
prior year and a cover of 2.2 times in relation 
to adjusted earnings per share, in line with  
our policy.
Board changes
In October 2011 Peter Johnson chose to  
stand down temporarily from his responsibilities 
as Chairman, due to personal circumstances,  
and in January 2012 he decided to resign  
from the Board. Peter joined the Board as a 
non-Executive Director in 1999 and became 
Chairman in 2007. I would like to thank Peter 
for his immeasurable contribution, leading the 
business through a period of transition over that 
time and leaving the business in an excellent 
position to grow and further develop. I am 
delighted to have the honour of chairing  
DS Smith Plc and look forward to continuing  
this work. We are committed to ensuring  
our Board continues to have both relevant 
experience and appropriate diversity and, 
although we believe it difﬁcult to set targets or 
timescales for the percentage of women, or any 
other group, on our Board, we are optimistic 
that the targets for board composition set out  
in the Davies recommendations can be met.
Finally, on behalf of the Board, I would like to 
thank all our colleagues throughout DS Smith  
for the substantial efforts made by everyone  
to deliver these results this year. In a period  
of strategic change, it has been their daily  
focus on delivering great service, quality and 
innovation to our customers, which has enabled 
the delivery of such signiﬁcant progress. I would 
also like to extend a warm welcome to our  
new colleagues from SCA Packaging, who  
will be joining the Group from the end of June. 
Looking to 2012/13, we are ready to start 
integrating our new business, and I have every 
conﬁdence that the success achieved to date 
will continue. 
Gareth Davis, Chairman 
Due to the size of the transaction, and to 
maintain an acceptable level of debt, we 
announced at the same time our intention to 
raise approximately £466 million by way of a 
rights issue. I was delighted by the reaction of 
our shareholders, who provided support and 
leadership, with 98.6 per cent of shareholders 
choosing to take up their right to buy additional 
DS Smith shares in the offer. A huge amount of 
work has followed, to prepare for the point 
when we take ownership, expected to be  
30 June 2012. I am pleased to say that we 
have a clear plan for integrating the businesses, 
starting from day one. 
Trading performance
Throughout this period of strategic change,  
the underlying businesses have proved 
themselves resilient despite substantial economic 
headwinds, delivering a 28 per cent increase 
in operating proﬁt (20 per cent excluding the 
impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange). 
The performance from our European business, 
including the Otor business in France, acquired 
in September 2010, has been particularly 
good, giving conﬁdence in the prospects  
for the SCA Packaging acquisition. Return  
on average capital employed increased  
310 basis points to 14.6 per cent. Earnings 
per share from continuing operations increased 
28 per cent in the period to 12.8 pence 
(2010/11: 10.0 pence).

Overview
2011/12 has been a year of transformation 
for DS Smith, in which we took several 
signiﬁcant steps along the path to our strategic 
goal: to become the leading supplier of 
recycled packaging for consumer goods,  
with improved medium-term ﬁnancial 
performance. We are doing this by growing 
our packaging and recycling businesses, 
reducing our exposure to paper manufacturing 
and disposing of non-core businesses.
We delivered great improvements during  
the ﬁrst full year of ownership of the French 
business, Otor, which we acquired in 
September 2010. In June 2011 we announced 
the closure of one paper mill, and in September 
2011 we announced the sale of a second,  
in aggregate reducing our UK paper capacity 
by an annual run-rate of approximately  
120 thousand tonnes. We disposed of our 
Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling division, Spicers, 
in December 2011, fulﬁlling our strategic aim  
of streamlining the Group and releasing capital  
to be used in developing the core business.  
In January 2012 we announced our intention  
to acquire SCA Packaging (excluding its 
kraftliner assets) for €1.6 billion, which will 
make DS Smith the second largest provider of 
corrugated packaging in Europe, and deliver  
a pan-European footprint. We are funding the 
acquisition, in part, with an issue of equity and 
we were delighted with the strong support of 
our shareholders. This acquisition has received 
all the necessary clearances from the 
competition authorities and we are on track  
to complete it, as planned, at the end of  
June 2012. 
Notwithstanding this period of considerable 
change, I am delighted to report that our 
operations have performed very well. Unless 
otherwise indicated, all references to operating 
proﬁt, return on sales, return on average capital 
employed and earnings per share (EPS), are  
on the basis of continuing operations, before 
exceptional items and amortisation of  
intangible assets.
In 2011/12 the Group’s revenues grew  
by 12 per cent, up 8 per cent excluding  
the impact of acquisitions and currency. This 
increase was driven by volume growth in 
corrugated box sales, of 2 per cent, coupled 
with strict pricing discipline, recovering  
cost increases promptly. Operating proﬁt 
increased 28 per cent to £142.0 million 
(2010/11: £110.9 million), an increase of  
20 per cent excluding the impact of acquisitions 
and currency. EPS increased 28 per cent 
despite the dilutive effect of the equity issue  
that completed in February 2012. This result  
follows the prior year where EPS increased  
58 per cent.
The Group has increased its corrugated  
box volumes and made good progress in  
each of its major markets. This progress was 
achieved by focusing on what our customers 
value – service, quality and innovation. 
Delivering against our Key  
Performance Indicators
We have delivered results within our  
previously stated target range for all our  
Key Performance Indicators in relation  
to our ﬁnancial metrics, customer service, 
employees and environmental performance.

Business Review
The retailer buys products 
from the FMCG manufacturer. 
They will specify the type of 
packaging that they prefer, to 
that manufacturer. The retailer 
then crushes and bales up its 
used corrugated boxes at the 
back of the store. 
DS Smith buys used cardboard 
from many of the largest 
retailers in the UK through 
its recycling businesses.
We design, manufacture and 
deliver corrugated packaging to 
our customers, delivering the high 
standards of service and quality they 
require. Our corrugated packaging 
customers in 2011/12 were over 
70 per cent fast-moving consumer 
goods (FMCG) manufacturers and 
the remainder are other industrial 
customers, such as car makers. 
Our largest customer comprises 
c. 3 per cent of Group revenue.
 Total sales volume in 
2011/12: 1.2 million 
tonnes/2.4 billion square metres
 Customers: product manufacturers, 
e.g. grocery products and home 
care products through to car parts
A business model for sustainable growth
Our business model is designed to deliver, consistently, a return on capital above our cost of capital.
The design and manufacture of corrugated packaging is at the heart 
of our business, supported by our paper and our recycling businesses. 
In the markets that we operate in, we choose to be a net buyer of 
paper from third parties, as there are plenty of external suppliers of 
this commodity. We regard our recycling business as a way to connect 
with retailers to develop the market for corrugated packaging, as well 
as providing us with ownership of paper ﬁ bre. 
4. Retailer 3. Corrugated packaging
2. Paper
Key raw material: paper. 
c. 34 per cent of our paper 
requirement is sourced from our 
own mills and the remainder 
is bought from third parties.
Total sales volume in 2011/12:
2.4bn sq metres
1. Recycling
Recycled paper is made from 
recovered ﬁ bre, principally from 
used corrugated boxes and other 
used paper and card. It is a 
scarce resource that is traded 
internationally. We have a 
substantial business in the UK 
collecting used corrugated and 
other ﬁ bre direct from retailers. 
This gives us security of supply 
to our paper mills. We see our 
recycling operations as more than 
a sourcing operation. They also 
connect us with our customers’ 
customer, the retailer. By 
engaging with major retailers 
about the beneﬁ ts of corrugated 
packaging, we seek to drive 
growth in the market for 
corrugated packaging.
We manufacture corrugated case 
material (CCM), the paper used 
to make corrugated packaging. 
We are a net buyer of CCM, 
manufacturing only the amount 
strategically necessary to ensure 
consistent economic supply. We 
also manufacture a small amount 
of other paper grades.
Customers such as: 
Tesco, Sainsbury, M&S, Morrisons
Recovered ﬁ bre collected in 2011/12:
 1.8m tonnes
 CCM volume 2011/12: 
0.7 million tonnes
 Other paper sales volume 
2011/12: 0.4 million tonnes
 Customers: corrugated box 
manufacturers. 63 per cent of 
our CCM is used by our own box 
operations and the remainder is 
sold. All of our non-CCM grade 
paper is sold externally 
Key raw materials: recovered ﬁ bre. 
In the UK all of our ﬁ bre is sourced 
from our own recycling business. 
In Europe the ﬁ bre is currently 
sourced externally. Approximately 
1.1 tonnes of ﬁ bre are needed 
to make 1.0 tonnes of paper.

1. All KPIs are calculated in respect of the Group’s continuing operations, excluding amortisation and exceptional items
Volume in our corrugated box business grew  
at 2 per cent in line with our target of GDP+1  
per cent for the markets in which we operate. 
Return on sales improved a further 90 basis 
points to 7.2 per cent (2010/11: 6.3 per 
cent), in line with our target of 7 – 9 per cent. 
This has been driven by the tight control of  
costs and a focus on efﬁciency throughout the 
business, and also a focus on prompt input-cost 
recovery through pricing where necessary. 
Return on average capital employed increased 
310 basis points to 14.6 per cent (2010/11: 
11.5 per cent), towards the upper end of the 
target range of 12 – 15 per cent and well 
above our estimated weighted average cost  
of capital of c.10 per cent. This increase was 
driven by improved proﬁtability and strong 
control of the capital base, including working 
capital. Return on average capital employed  
is our primary ﬁnancial measure of success,  
as it underpins the sustainability of both our 
investment strategy and our dividend policy.  
This metric is our highest priority. All senior 
management have a return on capital target 
included within their incentivisation 
arrangements. 73 per cent of capital 
expenditure during the year has been  
on packaging or recycling, our strategic  
priority areas. 
Average working capital, as a proportion  
of revenue, fell to 4.9 per cent in 2011/12 
(2010/11: 6.4 per cent). The working capital 
improvement has been driven by focused 
attention on all three areas of debtors,  
inventory and creditors.
The Group was highly cash generative in  
the year with free cash ﬂow of £94.5 million 
(2010/11: £72.0 million). The ratio of 
operating cash ﬂow, before investment capital 
expenditure, as a proportion of operating proﬁt, 
was 139 per cent, exceeding our target of 
maintaining this ratio above 120 per cent,  
with the outperformance primarily driven by  
the working capital in-ﬂow over the year. 
As at 30 April 2012, the Group had a net  
cash position due to the cash raised through  
an equity issue in February to fund in part the 
acquisition of SCA Packaging. Cash ﬂow in  
the year also beneﬁted from the sale of Spicers, 
where net proceeds amounted to £184.5 million 
in this ﬁnancial year, and are expected to be 
approximately £171 million once all  
balancing cash items (such as tax)  
are fully paid. On completion of the  
SCA Packaging acquisition, our net  
debt/EBITDA ratio is expected to be 
moderately above our medium-term target  
level of 2.0x. However, as previously 
announced, it is expected to reduce to  
the targeted level by the end of the ﬁrst  
full ﬁnancial year after completion. 
Underpinning the delivery of all our ﬁnancial 
targets has been the Group’s decision to  
be a net purchaser of paper, rather than  
a fully integrated producer. By being long  
in packaging and short in paper, we have  
had the ability to adjust corrugated prices 
quickly where we have needed to and to take 
decisions which may have short-term impacts  
on volume, where they have beneﬁted the 
ﬁnancial performance overall. 
On customer service, our key measure  
of on-time, in-full delivery improved from  
96 per cent to 97 per cent in line with our 
target. The reason this metric is important  
is because it underpins our aim to be  
a trusted, responsive business partner.

3 per cent of the revenue of the acquired 
business. In 2011/12 we delivered savings  
of €10.0 million and are on target to deliver 
the full amount as planned. 
Our procurement team had a target of 
delivering a run-rate of £10.0 million cost 
savings by April 2012. I am delighted with the 
performance of this team, with £13.0 million 
delivered in 2011/12 alone, of which around 
half relates to capital expenditure projects.  
The typical saving from procurement projects 
has been approximately 10 per cent and  
this team has become an integrated part of  
the business. The procurement function will  
be central to delivering procurement savings 
following completion of the acquisition of  
SCA Packaging, and their delivery this year 
demonstrates the capability within DS Smith. 
In December 2010 we set out a target to 
reduce average working capital from 8 per cent 
of revenue to 5 per cent, over the three years  
to April 2014. As set out above, we have now 
delivered that, two years ahead of schedule, 
with working capital at an average of 4.9 per 
cent of revenue in 2011/12. 
Culture
Setting out our strategy in 2010, I said that 
culture would be a key element to its successful 
implementation. Since then, this has been an 
area of important focus throughout the Group 
and we have made considerable progress  
this year. We have launched a new set of 
corporate values, which are to be caring, 
challenging, trusted, responsive and tenacious, 
and which are brought together under a 
programme of communication under the  
banner “OWN IT!”. These values apply to  
all of us throughout the organisation, in both  
our dealings with customers and with each 
other. We have undertaken a detailed roll-out 
programme with every member of staff, in 
conjunction with their team and line manager, 
working through how these values apply to 
them and their work and how they contribute 
personally to the success of DS Smith. We will 
be rolling these out to our new colleagues 
following completion of the SCA Packaging 
acquisition to help all our people to understand 
what it means to work for DS Smith. 
It has been a great year for DS Smith, with  
hard work from our employees, all of whom 
have played their part in delivering the  
excellent results we are reporting today. 
Outlook
Since the start of this new ﬁnancial year, the 
good trading performance reported for the  
year 2011/12 has continued, with good 
performance from packaging and, as 
expected, a more challenging market for our 
modest paper business. Completion on the  
SCA Packaging acquisition is expected to  
take place on 30 June 2012. The key drivers  
in this ﬁnancial year will be the integration of 
SCA Packaging and delivery of the associated 
cost and cash synergies we have previously 
identiﬁed, along with the underlying 
performance of the enlarged Group.
With regard to SCA Packaging, as previously 
announced, we continue to expect that in the 
ﬁrst 12 months of ownership the acquired 
business (inclusive of synergies) will deliver a 
return above the Group’s pre-tax cost of capital 
of c. 10 per cent. The economic conditions 
across Europe remain challenging. DS Smith is 
positioned to perform well in this environment, 
due to our resilient customer base, the 
opportunity for substantial cost and cash 
synergies as previously announced, and our 
track record of delivering sustainable returns  
in challenging market conditions. Accordingly,  
the Board views the prospects for the enlarged 
Group in the coming year with conﬁdence  
and expects to make continued progress.

developed in the year to co-ordinate this activity 
throughout the business. We provide customers 
with packaging that use less ﬁbre, with less 
carbon and less cost, through technology. 
Examples are the continued roll out of R-Flute
®
  
in the year, the use of our software solutions 
“PackRight” and the development of the 
mechanisation solutions, which maximise  
the performance of our packaging. 
DS Smith has a commitment to provide every 
employee with a safe and productive working 
environment. I am very pleased that our 
accident frequency rate for the continuing 
business has dropped 22 per cent year-on-year. 
The rate of improvement is principally due to  
the roll out of our safety practices in the plants 
previously part of the Otor business, as well  
as continued work throughout the Group. Our 
ultimate target is a zero accident rate and we 
continue to strive to achieve this. Lastly, on the 
environment, our CO
2 
emissions/revenue 
improved by 16 per cent. 
Delivery against our existing  
cost-savings targets
In addition to planning for the SCA Packaging 
acquisition, we have maintained our focus on 
our previously announced cost savings targets  
in relation to the existing business. 
In respect of the UK efﬁciency target to deliver 
£10 million savings by April 2014, we have 
accelerated our plans with additional 
restructuring and are ahead of our original plan, 
with a run-rate of £7.8 million delivered as we 
exit 2011/12. This is principally due to more 
co-ordinated working between the paper and 
the packaging businesses in the UK, for 
example in the area of logistics where we  
now operate a more integrated ﬂeet. We have 
announced the creation of a shared services 
centre in the UK to improve the efﬁciency  
of our back-ofﬁce support functions, which  
will become operational over the coming  
12 to 18 months. 
Our French business had a target of  
delivering €13.0 million synergies from the Otor 
acquisition by April 2013, a target which had 
originally started at €9.3 million, equivalent to  Business Review
A sustainable business model, creating value through differentiation on 
a pan-European scale
DS Smith Recycling prides itself on the level of 
service offered to customers. We make thousands 
of collections per day, across the UK. Our transport 
ﬂ eet operates out of 15 recycling facilities. Our 
customers rely on us regularly collecting their used 
paper and board, and we then ensure it is recycled, 
with nothing to landﬁ ll. 
Tesco has been a customer of DS Smith Recycling in 
the UK for over 25 years. We were delighted when 
they chose us to manage their recycling and residual 
waste streams in Poland as part of a total waste 
management contract. We now collect from over 
400 sites in Poland, covering all major towns and 
cities. This provides an excellent platform for us to 
grow in this important developing region.
Service
The Impact and Innovation Centres in the UK and 
France have proved to be a successful format for 
demonstrating to customers and retailers the beneﬁ ts 
that packaging, designed by DS Smith, can bring. In 
April 2012 the new Impact and Innovation Centre in 
Poland opened. The 300 m
2
 space was adapted to 
show the supermarket, back of store and warehousing 
areas in order to present the DS Smith expertise and 
understanding of the FMCG packaging. Customers 
are able to inspect wide ranging examples of best 
practice across all categories, get to grips with 
leading edge developments and conduct practical 
experiments with their own packaging in order to 
generate solutions for better sales and proﬁ ts.
Innovation
DS Smith worked closely with valued customer 
Chivas Brothers and leading brand Chivas Regal, to 
create a consumer pack to promote their 4.5L bottle 
of 12 year old Premium Blended Scotch Whisky.
The bottle is housed in a creatively designed cradle 
for dispensing, held securely within the pack. The 
result is an impressive EFIA 2011 award-winning 
corrugated pack that is post printed in 5 colours with 
a varnish. The print includes a stylish metallic silver 
look, produced to complement the gift carton pack.

The acquisition of SCA Packaging – an exceptional opportunity to accelerate our strategy
On 30 June 2012 DS Smith will acquire SCA Packaging
DS Smith announced the proposed acquisition of SCA Packaging 
on 17 January 2012. The acquisition will complete on 30 June 2012.
The transaction accelerates our strategy to become the leading supplier 
of recycled packaging for consumer goods. There are many compelling 
strategic beneﬁ ts to the deal, including:
1.  Geographic ﬁ t. We will be able to access new markets through 
an expanded network for corrugated packaging across Europe;
2.  Delivering more to our customers, who want a pan-European provider;
3.  Offering even more innovation as we combine the DS Smith research 
and development with that of SCA Packaging;
4.  Cost synergies from procurement and operating efﬁ ciencies 
of €75 million (by the end of the third full year of ownership); and
5.  Capex and working capital synergies of at least €40 million 
(by the end of the third full year of ownership).
The acquisition is expected to deliver a return on investment above our 
cost of capital in the ﬁ rst full year of ownership, with further improvement 
in the second and third years. Return on average capital employed is 
our key measure.
How we ﬁ t together
Following the acquisition of SCA Packaging, DS Smith will continue 
to have a similar balance of business as before, with a substantial 
recycling business and a smaller paper business, both supporting 
a strong corrugated packaging business.
Note: this pro-forma combines SCA Packaging volume metrics for the year ended 
31 December 2011 with those for DS Smith for the year ended 30 April 2012.

Annual Report & Accounts 2012

 In the UK, DS Smith operates three 
interconnected businesses, being 
packaging, paper manufacturing 
and used ﬁ bre collection. Prior to the 
acquisition of SCA Packaging our 
operations comprised 28 corrugated 
packaging manufacturing sites, 3 paper 
mills and 15 recycling depots.
 In 2011/12, DS Smith in the UK sold 
1.1 billion m
2
 of corrugated packaging 
and board. The UK market size is 
estimated at 3.3 billion m
2
 (FEFCO 
2011). Excluding output from our mills at 
Hollins (expected to close later in 2012) 
and Higher Kings (sold in September 
2011) we sold approximately 600 
thousand tonnes of corrugated case 
material (CCM) in 2011/12; the UK 
market is estimated at 2.1 million tonnes 
(CEPI, to March 2012). We also made 
an additional 266 thousand tonnes 
of other paper grades, principally 
plasterboard liner. Of the CCM that 
we manufactured in 2011/12, 
approximately 340 thousand tonnes 
was used within our packaging business. 
 In 2011/12, DS Smith Recycling 
collected 1.8 million tonnes of old 
corrugated containers and other used 
paper, the majority of which is utilised 
by our UK paper business. The market 
size for all types of recycled paper 
and board in the UK is 8 million tonnes. 
 In 2011/12, our corrugated box 
revenue was approximately 75 per 
cent from FMCG customers. The largest 
customer in the UK comprised 2 per 
cent of the division’s revenue. 
Packaging
In 2011/12, our corrugated business has 
grown ahead of the market. In the countries in 
which DS Smith currently operates the market in 
France has been ﬂ at, the market in Poland has 
continued to show good growth, while the UK 
market has been difﬁ cult (European Federation 
of Corrugated Board Manufacturers, FEFCO, 
year to 31 March 2012). Blended market 
growth in the markets in which we operate 
was around 1 per cent. Volume growth in our 
corrugated box business of 2 per cent has been 
driven by a focus on our customers, with volume 
gains both with existing and new customers. 
The input cost environment has remained 
volatile, with the market price of recovered 
ﬁ bre rising year-on-year by 11 per cent, for 
example. Our total Group input costs increased 
by £124.9 million and we have addressed 
this through the usual prompt pricing 
recovery discipline.
UK Packaging
The UK Packaging business, which comprises 
our recycling operations, paper manufacturing 
and the design and manufacture of corrugated 
packaging, has delivered a revenue increase 
of 5 per cent, principally driven by pricing 
to recover input costs. The year has been 
characterised by a robust performance from 
the corrugated packaging and recycling 
businesses and ﬁ rm cost control resulting in 
an improvement in operating proﬁ t of 19 per 
cent and an improvement in margin of 80 basis 
points, despite signiﬁ cant headwinds from the 
paper manufacturing business, where market 
conditions have been volatile, particularly in 
the second half of the year. 
In recycling, which includes all recycling 
operations including those outside the UK, 
overall volumes of ﬁ bre collected increased by 
3 per cent to 1.8 million tonnes. We are now 
operating in Poland where we have a sole ﬁ bre 
and waste supply contract with Tesco, collecting 
from 400 locations across that country. While 
the volumes from this are modest in the context 
of the overall business, it gives us an excellent 
platform for growth in the region. Revenue in 
the recycling business increased signiﬁ cantly 
and margins remain good while return on 
average capital is excellent, reﬂ ecting the 
quality of service we provide. 
In the paper business, the volatile pricing 
environment has meant that, while the business 
has performed well operationally, ﬁ nancial 
returns have, as expected, been disappointing. 
Over the year our focus has been on ensuring 
that the paper business is aligned to support 
our corrugated packaging operations with 
integrated operations where possible to reduce 
duplicate costs. One example is in logistics, 
where we have started operating our ﬂ eet in a 
co-ordinated way across paper and packaging 
together. We have also been working on the 
performance qualities of the paper produced 
so that the paper output supports the drive 
within the packaging operations to deliver 
lighter weight recycled boxes. In the year we 
have reduced our UK paper capacity, with 
the sale of Higher Kings Mill in September 
2011, and the announced closure of our 
Hollins Mill, which is expected to close 
in the second half of 2012. 
In the corrugated packaging business, we 
have outperformed a difﬁ cult market, while 
swift decision making and pricing discipline 
has meant that we have succeeded in 
recovering costs. We have continued to see 
success from the development of R-Flute
®
 in 
the UK which has shown volume improvements 
considerably ahead of the market. We continue 
to see growth in our FMCG customers, where 
our focus on delivering high quality, innovative 
product, with high standards of service has 
helped us gain market share, principally by 
expanding our position with existing customers.
The return on average capital employed 
for UK Packaging improved signiﬁ cantly to 
13.9 per cent (2010/11: 10.3 per cent), 
reﬂ ecting both increased proﬁ tability and 
a sustained reduction in working capital.

Continental European Corrugated Packaging
The continental European business has delivered 
an excellent performance, with revenue growth 
of 24 per cent, 10 per cent on a like-for-like 
basis. This like-for-like growth was driven by a 
mix of volume and pricing where our operations 
outperformed the underlying market, due to 
our focus on FMCG in those regions. The 
combination of Otor with the existing DS Smith 
business has enhanced the market position 
of the enlarged business. In Poland we saw 
particularly strong growth driven by our FMCG 
customers in the region with growth from both 
existing and new customers. In Italy we also 
performed well with good volume growth in a 
declining market despite a strategic decision to 
reduce our exposure to lower quality corrugated 
sheet sales. 
In France, volumes have been robust with a 
focus on high quality, innovation-led products 
for FMCG customers driving our increase in 
market share. We have been working with 
our customers, not only to supply corrugated 
boxes, but also supplying bespoke packaging 
machinery for the end of packaging lines. 
This technology, combined with our boxes 
manufactured to a high degree of accuracy, 
can substantially improve the performance 
of the packaging while using lighter weight 
material, delivering greater value to our 
customers. This innovative approach allows 
us to develop a long-term working partnership 
with those customers.
Operating proﬁ t increased 40 per cent to 
£55.6 million (2010/11: £39.8 million), 
17 per cent on a like-for-like basis. Operating 
margin increased 90 basis points to 7.5 per 
cent (2010/11: 6.6 per cent). This increase 
has been achieved through a combination 
of operational gearing, and the beneﬁ t 
of synergies from the Otor acquisition 
coming through as planned, in particular 
on procurement.
Return on average capital employed 
increased 150 basis points to 14.0 per 
cent (2010/11: 12.5 per cent), towards 
the top end of the Group target range of 
12 – 15 per cent, principally driven by 
increased proﬁ t margin.

In the LP&D business, the US business continued 
to perform well with continued success for our 
products for tea urns, smoothie dispensers and

improved signiﬁ cantly due both to a move to a 
higher margin mix of products, as some lower 
margin sales have been replaced by higher 
quality products, and also due to cost 
restructuring in the European part of the LP&D 
business. We have set up a new factory in 
Thailand to shorten our supply chain to serve 
the growing market in that region for fruit juice 
and concentrate exports; this facility is expected 
to become operational shortly.

 Our Plastic Packaging business comprises 
liquid packaging and dispensing (LP&D) 
and returnable transit packaging (RTP).
 LP&D is principally used in the beverage 
sector and is also used in some industrial 
solutions such as oils and in-home 
products such as laundry detergents. 
The global market for LP&D products is 
estimated at c. £500 million. DS Smith 
has a number two position in the global 
market, with a particularly strong 
position in the US. It operates from 
11 manufacturing operations in Europe, 
USA, Australia and New Zealand. 
 RTP is used across the retail, automotive, 
electronics and beverage sectors. RTP 
operates across 10 locations in Europe. 
 We also make modiﬁ ed atmosphere 
packaging for fresh fruit and vegetables. 
Eco-friendly innovation
DS Smith Plastics has developed an 
environmentally-friendly and innovative bag 
solution in collaboration with Ecologic for 
their eco.bottle™ line. The innovative bag 
was designed to ﬁ t the eco.bottle™ outer 
shell, made from 100% recycled ﬁ bre. 
Through R&D and innovation the bag sealing 
was developed to withstand and perform 
under stringent critical-to-quality criteria in the 
distribution chain. The bag can be ﬁ lled by 
any standard commercial bottle ﬁ lling 
equipment — eliminating the need for 
customers to invest in new ﬁ lling equipment. 
This bag uses up to 70 per cent less plastic 
than regular blow-moulded jugs, and its inner 
pouch and spout can be recycled along with 
plastic grocery bags in retailer drop-off bins.
Since commercialising the bag for Ecologic 
in January of 2011, we have supplied 
approximately 1 million 50-ounce bags 
with a detergent-style closing cap or twist 
cap, for the US market, with other sizes 
under development. 
The eco.bottle™ is well suited to a 
wide array of consumer products ranging 
from pourable goods to beverages and 
personal care products, making it attractive 
to ecological-minded customers. It is 
100 per cent recyclable and compostable.

Overview
The Group achieved another strong  
ﬁnancial performance in 2011/12, despite  
an economic environment which continues  
to be challenging and sustained input cost 
pressures. It has been a period of signiﬁcant 
change for the business, with the sale of the 
Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling division and the 
planned acquisition of SCA Packaging, partially 
funded by a rights issue, and the remainder 
funded through reﬁnancing. Throughout, we 
have maintained a rigorous focus on our core 
business and are delivering on the strategic, 
medium term ﬁnancial targets we have  
set ourselves.
Revenue from continuing operations for the year 
increased by 12 per cent and operating proﬁt 
increased by 28 per cent. Adjusted earnings 
per share increased 28 per cent, despite the 
dilutive effect of the equity issue that completed 
in February 2012. Free cash ﬂow increased  
by 31 per cent, principally due to improved 
management of working capital despite the 
impact of price increases and higher volumes. 
These results reﬂect the resilience of our FMCG 
customer base and the success of our pricing 
strategy to recover increased input costs  
faster, along with the full-year impact of the  
Otor acquisition and our ongoing focus on  
controlling costs and reducing working capital.
Trading results
The Group’s trading results for 2011/12 are 
summarised in Table 1 (all results exclude the 
Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling division which 
was sold in December 2011 and is therefore 
reported as a discontinued operation).
The 2011/12 results were driven by a strong 
performance across the Group with volume 
growth and improved return on sales, combined 
with the full year beneﬁt from the acquisition of 
Otor which has been successfully integrated. 
Revenue from continuing operations for 
2011/12 of £1,969.4 million represents  
an increase of 12 per cent. On a like-for-like 
basis, excluding the full-year impact of  
the acquisition of Otor, revenue was up  
8 per cent on 2010/11.
Operating proﬁt from continuing operations  
in 2011/12 increased by 28 per cent to 
£142.0 million, like-for-like operating proﬁt  
is up 20 per cent. UK Packaging was up  
19 per cent at £64.4 million, whilst Continental 
European Packaging increased 40 per cent  
to £55.6 million (17 per cent on a like-for-like 
basis). This performance was supported by 
Plastic Packaging which increased operating 
proﬁt 30 per cent to £22.0 million. Return  
on sales from continuing operations increased  
90 basis points to 7.2 per cent.
Operating proﬁt was up 41 per cent in  
the ﬁrst half, 22 per cent on a like-for-like  
basis. Operating proﬁt was up 15 per cent  
on a reported basis and 18 per cent on  
a like-for-like basis in the second half.
The Group’s pre-tax return on average capital 
employed (which is deﬁned as the operating 
proﬁt divided by the monthly average capital 
employed) increased from 11.5 per cent in 
2010/11 to 14.6 per cent in 2011/12, 
signiﬁcantly above the Group’s estimated 
pre-tax cost of capital of c. 10 per cent.  
The increase in the Group’s return on  
capital employed reﬂected higher returns in  
2011/12 across all continuing operations.
Exceptional items
Acquisition costs in respect of the proposed 
acquisition of SCA Packaging are in line  
with our initial estimate of £50 million. Of  
this, £18.4 million has been recognised as  
an exceptional cost in the 2011/12 income 
statement, £16.9 million has been charged  
to share premium and £7.0 million has been 
capitalised on the balance sheet and will  
be amortised through the income statement.  
The remainder is expected to be incurred  
in 2012/13.
A net exceptional gain after tax of  
£3.3 million has been recognised in the  
year (2010/11: costs of £1.8 million). This 
comprises a £58.0 million post-tax exceptional 
gain in discontinued operations arising from  
the sale of the Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling 
division offset by other continuing operations 
post-tax exceptional costs of £54.7 million  
(2010/11: £2.0 million). These costs primarily 
relate to the impairment of intangible and 
tangible ﬁxed assets (£36.5 million) and 
restructuring costs within the UK Packaging 
division (£30.6 million) (after the beneﬁt  
of a £15.4 million tax credit), as part of  
our strategy to reduce paper production and  
to reduce costs to underpin future returns in  
the Packaging business.
Interest, tax and earnings per share
Net interest expense decreased from  
£20.0 million in 2010/11 to £18.4 million  
in 2011/12, the reduction being principally   www.dssmith.uk.com 
Annual Report & Accounts 2012
18
Financial review continued
due to interest received on the proceeds  
from the rights issue and the proceeds arising 
from the disposal of the Ofﬁce Products 
Wholesaling division. The employment  
beneﬁt net ﬁnance expense, which is  
largely a non-cash item, was £4.8 million 
(2010/11: £7.4 million), reﬂecting a  
lower deﬁcit of the deﬁned beneﬁt schemes 
following the actions taken at the end of last 
year to reduce the liabilities of the UK scheme. 
Proﬁt before tax from continuing operations 
(excluding amortisation, exceptional items and 
share of loss of associate) was £118.8 million 
(2010/11: £83.5 million), an increase  
of 42 per cent. Reported proﬁt before tax  
from continuing operations was £21.7 million 
(2011/10: £77.6 million).
The Group’s effective tax rate from continuing 
operations, excluding exceptional items and 
associate, at 27.6 per cent, was marginally 
lower than the previous year’s rate of 28.2 
per cent, principally due to a reduction in  
the UK corporation tax rate. A tax credit on 
exceptional items of £17.3 million resulted 
from both the tax allowances for SCA 
Packaging acquisition costs of £1.9 million 
and a tax credit of £15.4 million on other 
exceptional items. Reported proﬁt after tax 
from continuing operations was £8.4 million 
(2011/10: £53.1 million).
In November 2011 the Group reinstated  
its investment in Rubezhansk, the Group’s 
associate business in Ukraine, following a 
successful reﬁnancing. As such, the Group  
has recognised its share of the associate’s 
result from this date.
Adjusted earnings per share from  
continuing operations were 12.8 pence  
(2010/11: 10.0 pence), an increase  
of 28 per cent. 
Discontinued operations
The Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling division has 
been classiﬁed as a discontinued operation, 
having been disposed of on 30 December 
2011. Post-tax proﬁt for the period to disposal 
was £9.3 million. Proﬁt on disposal of the 
Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling division of 
£67.1 million has been recognised in the 
period as an exceptional item. After a tax 
charge of £9.1 million, the net gain is  
£58.0 million.
Dividend 
The proposed ﬁnal dividend is 4.0 pence 
(2010/11: 3.1 pence), giving a  
total dividend for the year of 5.9 pence  
(2010/11: 4.5 pence). Dividend cover  
before amortisation and exceptional items was  
2.2 times in 2011/12 (2010/11: 2.9 times). 
Rights issue
Gross rights issue proceeds of £466.2 million 
were received in February 2012, less  
£16.9 million of costs. The purpose of the 
rights issue was to contribute towards the 
ﬁnancing of the proposed SCA Packaging 
acquisition along with new and existing debt 
facilities. The take up for the rights issue was 
highly successful, with acceptances being 
received in respect of approximately 98.6 per 
cent of qualiﬁed shareholdings.

Business Review
Cash ﬂow
The Group generated free cash ﬂow of 
£94.5 million (2010/11: £72.0 million),  
a 31 per cent improvement. 
Despite increases in prices of paper, energy 
and corrugated boxes, tight control of working 
capital resulted in a working capital cash inﬂow 
of £43.7 million (2010/11: £0.2 million). 
Our target was to reduce the monthly average 
working capital to revenue ratio to 5 per cent 
by 30 April 2014; we achieved 4.9 per cent 
in 2011/12, consequently exceeding our 
target two years ahead of schedule. We 
believe there are further improvements that  
can still be made and will continue to maintain 
focus in this area.
Pension cash contributions were £30.4 million 
in 2011/12 (2010/11: £32.3 million), 
principally comprising £14.8 million in 
respect of the agreed contributions to the  
UK Group pension scheme deﬁcit (for the 
future ﬁnancing of the pension scheme) and  
a further £14.8 million relating to the disposal 
of the Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling division  
in respect of those employees who will  
remain in the UK Group pension scheme  
as deferred members.
Cash generated from operations was  
£225.5 million (2010/11: £156.2 million), 
a 44 per cent improvement. 
Capital expenditure of £94.2 million 
(2010/11: £62.3 million) reﬂects our 
commitment to invest in processes and 
technologies to sustain future growth.  
Growth capital expenditure was £33.0 million 
(2010/11: £20.0 million). Tax payments  
were £25.3 million (2010/11: £16.0 million),  
the increased payments largely resulting from 
improved proﬁtability on continuing operations 
across the Group. Net interest paid of  
£19.8 million was £4.0 million higher  
than 2010/11, mainly due to a full year’s 
payment of interest on the private placement 
debt issued to ﬁnance the Otor acquisition  
in August 2010.
Cash dividend cover, deﬁned as free cash 
ﬂow divided by dividends declared for the 
year, was 1.9 times (2010/11: 3.6 times).
Net proceeds from acquisitions/disposals  
of £182.3 million primarily relate to the sale 
of the Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling division.
SCA Packaging acquisition costs of  
£7.0 million were paid during the year.  
The cash outﬂow in respect of other  
exceptional costs was £19.5 million 
(2010/11: £15.1 million).
Overall, the Group had a reduction in  
net debt of £672.7 million, principally due  
to the rights issue proceeds, the proceeds  
from the disposal of the Ofﬁce Products 
Wholesaling division and strong free cash 
ﬂow. This resulted in a net cash position  
at the year end of £321.7 million.
Financial position
Shareholders’ funds of £1,057.5 million  
at 30 April 2012 were up from  
£584.2 million at 30 April 2011,  
principally due to an increase in share  
capital as a result of the rights issue and 
retained proﬁt for the year. Proﬁt attributable  
to shareholders was £75.3 million  
(2010/11: £70.1 million) and dividends  
of £31.5 million (2010/11: £22.6 million) 
were paid during the year. In addition,  
actuarial gains of £16.1 million from the 
Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes were 
credited to reserves. Other items recognised 
directly in reserves include currency translation 
losses of £14.2 million, adverse movements  
on cash ﬂow hedges of £6.6 million,

Financial review continued
a reclassiﬁcation from the foreign exchange 
reserve in relation to the disposal of the Ofﬁce 
Products Wholesaling division of £9.8 million 
and a tax charge relating to these items of 
£14.3 million. 
The Group has committed facilities of  
c. £1.5 billion. The Group is temporarily  
in a net cash position (£321.7 million at  
30 April 2012), principally due to the net 
inﬂow from the disposal of the Ofﬁce Products 
Wholesaling division and the rights issue 
proceeds. These proceeds will be reinvested 
as part of the proposed SCA Packaging 
acquisition and, on completion, net debt to 
EBITDA ratio is expected to be moderately 
above the target level of 2 times. However,  
as previously announced, we expect to 
reduce it to the targeted level by the end  
of the ﬁrst full ﬁnancial year after completion. 
The Group’s banking covenants for the 
syndicated loan specify an EBITDA to    
 net interest payable ratio of not less than  
4.5 times, a maximum ratio of net debt  
to EBITDA of 3.25 times and net assets to  
be in excess of £360 million. The covenant 
calculations exclude from the income 
statement exceptional items and the net  
interest income/charge arising from the 
deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes. The 
calculation of net assets excludes the net  
asset or liability arising from the deﬁned beneﬁt 
pension schemes. As at 30 April 2012, the 
most sensitive covenant is EBITDA to net interest 
payable and this has an EBITDA headroom  
of £122.1 million (a ratio of 11.1 times).
Just as the DS Smith business model is resilient 
and focused on cash generation we have 
made sure the ﬁnancing strategy is equally 
resilient. During the ﬁnancial year 2011/12 
and in the year to date we have therefore put 
in place a diverse mix of bank and US private 
placement funding and we have renegotiated 
our covenants to provide further covenant 
headroom in a downturn scenario. The  
Group reﬁnanced its medium-term borrowings 
in September 2011 with a new ﬁve-year 
revolving credit facility of £610 million. 
Included in Table 3 are acquisition facilities 
totalling €700 million which are dependent 
upon completion of the acquisition of SCA 
Packaging, expected on 30 June 2012. 
Since the year end we have agreed  
pricing with debt investors over the issuance  
of a new private placement with average 
maturity of nine years at a competitive  
4.28 per cent annual ﬁnance charge and  
have ﬁxed interest rates in euro and sterling.  
The new private placement will repay the 
shortest maturing element (€300 million 
three-year bridge ﬁnance) of the SCA 
Packaging acquisition facility and consequently 
the next signiﬁcant maturity is not until 2016. 
We now hedge EBITDA to debt by currency 
and ensure that in each country in which  
we operate, we have a substantial banking 
relationship with a leading bank in that country.
Energy costs
High energy costs continued to be a 
signiﬁcant factor for the Group in 2011/12. 
The Group’s total costs for gas, electricity and 
diesel fuel increased from c. £113 million in 
2010/11 to c. £126 million in 2011/12. 
The Group continued with its strategy of 
hedging energy costs with suppliers and 
ﬁnancial institutions, the purpose of which is  
to reduce the volatility of energy costs and to 
provide the Group with a degree of certainty 
over future energy costs.
Financial capital management
The Group funds its operations from the 
following sources of cash: operating cash 
ﬂow, borrowing, shareholders’ equity and 
disposals of non-core businesses where 
appropriate. The Group’s objective is to 
achieve a capital structure that results in an 
appropriate cost of capital whilst providing 
ﬂexibility in immediate and medium-term 
funding so as to accommodate material 
investments or acquisitions. The Group also 
aims to maintain a strong balance sheet and 
to provide continuity of ﬁnancing by having  
a range of maturities and borrowing from  
a variety of sources.
The Group’s overall treasury objectives are  
to ensure sufﬁcient funds are available for  
the Group to carry out its strategy and to 
manage ﬁnancial risks. The Group’s treasury 
strategy is controlled through the Treasury 
Committee, which meets regularly and 
includes the Group Chief Executive, the 
Group Finance Director, the Group Financial 
Controller, the Group Treasurer and the Group 
Tax Manager. The Group treasury function 
operates in accordance with policies and 
procedures approved by the Board and is 
controlled by the Group Treasurer. The function 
arranges funding for the Group, provides  
a service to operations and implements 
strategies for interest rate, foreign exchange 
and energy exposure management.
The Group’s main borrowing facilities are 
shown in Table 3. At 30 April 2012, the 
Group’s total committed borrowing facilities 
were c. £1.5 billion. The total gross 
borrowings (including derivatives) at  
30 April 2012 were £331.5 million.  
At 30 April 2012, the Group’s borrowing 
facilities had a weighted-average  
maturity of four years and eight months  
(30 April 2011: four years and two months). 
The major treasury risks to which the Group  
is exposed relate to movements in interest and 
foreign exchange rates and volatility of market 
prices for energy. The overall objective of the 
Treasury function is to control these exposures 
whilst striking an appropriate balance 
between mitigating risks and controlling  
costs. Financial instruments, including 
derivatives, may be used in implementing 
hedging strategies but the speculative use  
of ﬁnancial instruments, including derivatives, 
is not permitted. 
The Group manages the risks associated  
with its purchases of energy in the UK through 
its Energy Procurement Group, which operates

Business Review
under the oversight of the Treasury Committee. 
UK purchases of energy represent the majority 
of the Group’s overall energy costs. 
The Treasury Committee regularly reviews  
the Group’s exposure to interest rates and 
considers whether to borrow on ﬁxed or 
ﬂoating terms. Fixed-rate borrowings, taking 
into account the effect of related swaps, 
comprised 63 per cent of total borrowing at 
30 April 2012 (30 April 2011: 58 per cent).
The Group has a net investment in major 
overseas subsidiary companies’ foreign 
currency assets and liabilities, in particular 
those whose functional currency is the euro. 
The Group’s policy is to hedge a large part  
of the resulting exposure to movements in 
foreign currency rates, by means of debt  
in the same currency, to a level determined  
by the Treasury Committee. The overseas  
net assets hedged through euro borrowing 
were 97 per cent at 30 April 2012  
(30 April 2011: 87 per cent), as a  
proportion of the Group’s euro net investment. 
Following completion of the SCA Packaging 
acquisition, the currency proﬁle of the Group’s 
borrowings will be aligned to the currency 
proﬁle of the enlarged Group’s EBITDA.
The Group’s foreign currency debt may be put 
in place either in the currency itself or through 
the use of cross-currency swaps on differently 
denominated borrowing. The Group applies 
hedge accounting under IAS 39, ‘Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’,  
to its hedges of its net investment of foreign 
currency subsidiaries and records exchange 
differences arising on the net investments and 
the related foreign currency borrowing directly 
in equity. In addition, the Group’s operations 
make product sales and purchases of raw 
materials in foreign currencies and cash  
ﬂow hedges are taken out to reduce the  
risk associated from these transactions.
Impairment
When applying IAS 36, ‘Impairment of 
Assets’, the Group compares the carrying 
amounts of goodwill and intangible assets 
with the higher of their net realisable value 
and their value in use to determine whether  
an impairment exists. The value in use is 
calculated by discounting the future cash  
ﬂows expected to be generated by the assets 
or group of assets being tested for impairment. 
During April 2012 a series of tests were 
undertaken to determine whether there  
had been any impairment to the balance 
sheet carrying values of goodwill and other 
intangible assets. The key assumptions behind 
the calculations are a growth rate of 3 per 
cent and an average pre-tax discount rate  
of 10.1 per cent. 
An impairment charge of £36.5 million was 
recorded in exceptional items during the year. 
An impairment of £28.0 million has been 
made in UK Paper, the largest constituent of 
which was for property, plant and equipment 
relating to certain specialised plant and 
machinery which is no longer fully utilised. 
Following the announcement of the closure  
of Hollins Mill, £4.5 million of goodwill  
has been impaired. The remaining charge  
of £4.0 million relates to other impairments  
in the Plastics and UK Packaging divisions.
The net book value of goodwill and  
other intangibles at 30 April 2012  
was £309.7 million (30 April 2011:  
£344.8 million).
Pensions
IAS 19, ‘Employee Beneﬁts’, requires the 
Group to make assumptions including, but not 
limited to, future asset returns, rates of inﬂation, 
discount rates and current and future life 
expectancies. The use of different assumptions 
could have a material effect on the accounting 
values of the relevant assets and liabilities, 
which in turn could result in a change to the 
cost of such liabilities as recognised in the 
income statement over time. The assumptions 
involved are subject to periodic review. 
The Group operates one main deﬁned  
beneﬁt pension scheme in the UK which is 
now closed to future accrual, and also has 
some overseas arrangements and a small  
UK unfunded scheme. The aggregate gross  
assets of the schemes at 30 April 2012  
were £765.1 million and the gross liabilities 
at 30 April 2012 were £869.3 million, 
resulting in the recognition of a gross  
balance sheet deﬁcit of £104.2 million  
(30 April 2011: £147.5 million), a  
net deﬁcit of £77.1 million (30 April  
2011: £111.8 million) after a deferred  
tax asset of £27.1 million (30 April  
2011: £35.7 million). 
A triennial valuation of the main UK scheme 
was carried out at 30 April 2010 at which 
point the Group agreed that cash contributions 
would be £14.8 million per annum, rising  
by 2 per cent per annum for the remaining  
10 years, with a view to closing the deﬁcit 
within a 10 year recovery period. Pension 
cash contributions were £30.4 million  
in 2011/12 (2010/11: £32.3 million), 
principally comprising £14.8 million in 
respect of the agreed contributions to the  
UK Group pension scheme deﬁcit (for the 
future ﬁnancing of the pension scheme) and  
a further £14.8 million relating to the disposal 
of the Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling division  
in respect of those employees who will  
remain in the UK Group pension scheme  
as deferred members.
The reduction in the gross balance sheet 
deﬁcit of £43.3 million is principally 
attributable to cash contributions.
Guidance for the year 2012/13
Taking into account completion of the SCA 
Packaging acquisition on 30 June 2012,  
we expect the average cost of debt for the 
Group in 2012/13 to be c. 4.5 per cent. 
Depreciation and capital expenditure are 
expected to be approximately £160 million. 
The expected tax rate for the Group as a 
whole is expected to be 27.6 per cent. The 
cost of capital for the Group is expected to  
be approximately 9.5 per cent. The pension 
interest ﬁnance charge is expected to be 
approximately £6.0 million in 2012/13, 
rising to approximately £9.0 million in 
2013/14 to reﬂect changes to IAS 19  
that are applicable then.

Business Review
Environment
DS Smith’s business model is built 
on sustainability – by providing 
corrugated packaging that is largely 
made of recycled material, and 
that is fully recyclable. Our plastics 
products, such as bag-in-box,  
also offer signiﬁcant environmental 
beneﬁts over alternative packaging 
materials. Therefore, for DS Smith, 
sustainability is part of our  
business model. 
FTSE Group conﬁrms that DS Smith Plc has 
been independently assessed according to  
the FTSE4Good criteria, and has satisﬁed  
the requirements to become a constituent of  
the FTSE4Good Index Series. Created by  
the global index company FTSE Group, 
FTSE4Good is an equity index series that is 
designed to facilitate investment in companies 
that meet globally recognised corporate 
responsibility standards. Companies in the 
FTSE4Good Index Series have met stringent 
social and environmental criteria, and are 
positioned to capitalise on the beneﬁts  
of responsible business practice.
Our principles and approach to  
corporate responsibility
At DS Smith we are committed to conducting 
our business in a responsible and sustainable 
manner, delighting our customers, creating  
value for our shareholders, and providing  
our employees with a safe and productive  
work place. 
Our core business is the design and 
manufacture of recycled packaging for 
consumer goods. We recognise that our 
businesses have direct environmental impacts 
through running our operations and also  
indirect impacts through our sourcing activities 
and how our customers use and dispose  
of our products. 
Our corporate responsibility (CR) approach 
covers health and safety, the environment,  
our employees, and our communities. 
The Board considers risks to the Group’s short 
and long-term value arising from CR matters as 
part of its regular review of the key risks to the 
Group’s operations. It ensures that the Group 
has in place effective policies and systems for 
managing any signiﬁcant CR risks and it 
receives regular reports on performance.  
The Group Chief Executive is the Director 
responsible for CR matters and he reports to  
the Board on these. It is the responsibility of the 
Divisional Chief Executives to communicate and 
to apply the policies, to ensure compliance and 
to review procedures, taking account of local 
legislation and potential risks. 
The Group has a Workplace Malpractice 
Policy, under which employees may report in 
conﬁdence any perceived wrongdoing within 
the Group on matters relating to safety, the 
environment, unethical business conduct or 
breaches of Group policies, the law or other 
regulations. This policy is reinforced by a 
conﬁdential Employee Concern Helpline  
and e-mail facility. Any concerns reported  
are appropriately investigated. 
How DS Smith plays its part in  
a sustainable economy
Corrugated packaging produced by  
DS Smith has attractive environmental 
characteristics, being both made from  
recycled raw material and recyclable.
We work closely with our customers to reduce 
the carbon footprint of the packaging they 
require – and at the same time, to save costs. 
We look at the cost and carbon impact of the 
whole supply chain, taking into consideration 
the transportation, wastage on the packing  
line, and the materials used in the packaging.  
DS Smith has been developing light-weight 
solutions for some time. For example, we  
have developed a type of corrugated board,  
R-Flute
®
, which signiﬁcantly improves the carbon 
footprint in the supply chain. While it has similar 
strength properties to alternative types of 
corrugated board, it is 20 per cent thinner.  
That means that 20 per cent more boxes can 
be ﬁtted in one lorry from our factory to that  
of our customer, so fewer lorry journeys are 
needed. This is a simple example of saving  
our customers cash and carbon in their  
supply chain. 
DS Smith Recycling is the largest collector and 
recycler of used paper and cardboard in the 
UK. We are different from our main competitors 
in the UK as, unlike them, we do not own 
landﬁll sites. Therefore customers of our 
recycling services know that our commitment  
lies in landﬁll diversion.
Corrugated packaging has good  
environmental characteristics and we see 
substantial opportunities to continue the 
expansion of its use as a substitute for  
other forms of packaging material.
Our bag-in-box technology is used for a wide 
range of products in substitution for rigid plastic 
containers, bottles, or other packaging formats 
for liquids. The cardboard box is readily 
recyclable, while the plastic content in the  
bag and tap is often signiﬁcantly less than the 
amount of material used in the production of an 
alternative plastic bottle. The beneﬁts continue 
through the supply chain as boxes of liquids can 
be packed in a more space-efﬁcient manner 
and the weight of the packaging is less – often 
making it cheaper and less energy intensive  
to transport. These beneﬁts of bag-in-box 
packaging have been independently veriﬁed  
by PIRA (the Paper and Board, Printing and 
Packaging Association) and are promoted to 
customers by our Plastic Packaging business.
Environmental management and regulation 
The environmental performance and activities  
of the divisions are reviewed at the Group 
Environment Committee, which is chaired  
by the Group Chief Executive. 
Each of our sites is required to implement an 
environmental management system (EMS) which 
is appropriate to its activity. DS Smith has 58 
sites accredited under the ISO 14001 standard  www.dssmith.uk.com 
Annual Report & Accounts 2012

Corporate Responsibility review continued
and 26 that have in place a simpliﬁed EMS, 
appropriate to their lower level of potential 
environmental impact. As part of their EMS, 
many Group businesses have procedures  
in place for assessing their suppliers’ 
environmental policies and management 
systems, as appropriate.
The Group had a number of minor 
environmental incidents during the year, 
following which prompt corrective action and 
steps to prevent any recurrence were taken. As 
previously reported, in 2010 the Environment 
Agency brought a case against DS Smith Paper 
Limited in relation to alleged breaches of the 
Higher Kings Mill’s Pollution Prevention and 
Control (PPC) permit that occurred between 
December 2005 and March 2008. The 
charges primarily related to the training of  
staff, record keeping and the operation of  
the mill’s efﬂuent treatment plant. A detailed 
environmental survey has indicated that these 
breaches did not result in any signiﬁcant 
environmental impact. At the court hearing  
in October 2010, DS Smith Paper Limited 
pleaded guilty to a number of the offences, 
generally relating to record keeping, and 
pleaded not guilty to charges of intentionally 
making false entry in a required Environmental 
Agency record. DS Smith Paper Limited was 
found guilty on all charges. DS Smith Paper 
Limited appealed against three of the 19 
charges, being those charges (and related ﬁnes) 
of intentionally making false entries in a required 
Environmental Agency record. The appeal  
was heard at the Court of Appeal in November 
2011 and the initial guilty verdicts in relation  
to these charges were overturned. 
In accordance with our general practice  
relating to any regulatory breaches, at the time 
of the incident a full investigation was promptly 
undertaken of all our UK paper mills to ensure 
that nothing similar arose. As a result we 
implemented a range of actions to strengthen 
our systems including increasing the scope  
and frequency of our internal audits.
The Group’s paper manufacturing  
operations account for the majority of the 
Group’s environmental impact, particularly 
because their manufacturing process uses large 
quantities of energy and water. The UK paper 
mills are regulated through PPC permits under 
which they each have speciﬁc improvement 
programmes and targets. DS Smith Paper’s 
overall compliance with its environmental 
permits rose to 99.7 per cent in 2011/12 
(2010/11: 99.0 per cent) principally due  
to better performance of our efﬂuent treatment 
plants. DS Smith Paper is a key participant  
in the UK paper sector Climate Change Levy 
(CCL) Agreement with the Department of 
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs under 
which the industry has undertaken to achieve 
energy consumption reduction targets. DS Smith 
Paper met the ﬁnal target of the existing scheme 
with future targets yet to be identiﬁed awaiting 
Government revision of the scheme.
The Group’s UK and French paper operations 
are subject to the terms of their respective 
national schemes for implementing the EU 
Emissions Trading Directive. We expect the 
Group’s emissions to be slightly below our 
emissions allocations during EU ETS Phase  
2. The effects of subsequent phases from  
2013 onwards are likely to be more  
onerous, being dependent upon the details of 
the emissions allocations and the market price 
of carbon under future phases of the scheme. 
Environmental performance
In 2010/11 DS Smith set a target of a  
20 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide (CO
2
) 
emissions, water use and of waste to landﬁll, 
relative to the activity level of the business,  
over the following 10 years. 
Our businesses include their environmental 
impact in their budgeting plans in order to  
track their progress against their targets.
During the year, we again employed 
independent consultants, Bureau Veritas,  
to review our environmental data collection  
and reporting process in order to ensure the 
robustness and accuracy of the Group’s 
environmental performance indicators. This 
review concluded that overall there was a  
good level of process control and reporting  
at the sites but identiﬁed some areas for 
improvement which are being considered  
and, as appropriate, implemented.
The Group reduced its carbon dioxide 
emissions by 3 per cent in absolute amounts. 
Relative to revenue, carbon dioxide emissions 
fell 16 per cent reﬂecting the effect of price 
inﬂation on revenue as well as underlying 
improvements. As disclosed, the proportion  
of Scope 1 emissions has increased with a 
commensurate reduction in Scope 2 emissions. 
This reﬂects the change in ownership of the 
power plant at our Kemsley site, where 
ownership has transferred from E.ON to  
DS Smith, and hence a change in reporting  
in accordance with DEFRA guidelines. Water 
usage per £’000s revenue fell reﬂecting a focus 
on roll-out of best industry practice in this area. 
The proportion of waste generated by the 
Group which was sent to landﬁll fell from  
13 per cent to 12 per cent, a relative 
improvement of 8 per cent.
Energy efﬁciency 
Our two largest paper mills, at Kemsley in the 
UK and Kaysersberg in France, have on-site 
CHP plants. These CHP facilities provide energy 
more efﬁciently, with lower CO
2
 emissions and 
at signiﬁcantly lower cost than if it were to  
be sourced from the external grid. In addition, 
Kemsley Mill recycles, in the form of energy 
recovery, a substantial proportion of the reject 
material, such as plastic and polystyrene, which 
enters its process mixed in with the waste paper 
and is separated out during paper manufacture. 
The mill’s own waste-to-energy plant efﬁciently 
recovers the energy to produce steam for use in 
the mill’s operations. Further, we applied in April 
2010 for planning permission for a sustainable 
energy plant at Kemsley to reduce the mill’s 
reliance on fossil fuels. The proposed fuel for  
this plant is hard-to-recycle materials, sourced 
and pre-treated offsite, which might otherwise 
go to landﬁll. The power plant would be built 
by energy company E.ON and by waste 
specialist Wheelabrator, with DS Smith 
providing the site. Planning permission has  
been granted and an operating permit from  
the Environment Agency has been received. The 
project is now subject to securing the necessary 
contracts for a supply of waste. If the contracts 
are agreed, it is expected that the plant will be 
operational by 2017. DS Smith Plc

Business Review
Veriﬁcation Statement from  
Bureau Veritas UK Ltd
For the fourth year we have worked with  
DS Smith Plc to provide an independent  
opinion on the Environmental Performance 
Indicators presented on this page of its 2012 
Annual Report. Having completed a process 
incorporating site visits, document review and 
interrogation of associated management and 
reporting systems, it is our opinion that the 
presented performance indicators provide  
a fair and accurate representation of  
DS Smith Plc’s performance.
DS Smith Plc should be commended on their 
approach to data collection, which continues  
to remain consistent across the divisions with  
a clear understanding of required processes 
demonstrated by those with responsibilities  
in this regard at both divisional and site level.  
It remains clear that DS Smith Plc is constantly 
looking to improve these processes; both via 
internal mechanisms, and as demonstrated in 
the proactive manner in which the company  
has continued to engage Bureau Veritas on  
this project.
Bureau Veritas encourages DS Smith Plc  
to continue to improve its data capture  
and reporting processes at the Group  
and divisional level.

Methodology: The Group aims to collect and report its environmental data in accordance with the guidelines  
speciﬁed by the Global Reporting Initiative and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP), to the extent that this is  
currently practicable. The ﬁgures reported above include data from all of the Group’s wholly-owned or majority-owned 
operations and sites worldwide. The methodology used is consistent for 2010/11 and 2011/12. 
1.  The energy ﬁgures relate to the usage of all fuels used in ﬁxed installations on the Group’s sites plus the diesel  
fuel used for freight transport 
2.  The CO
2
 emissions have been calculated using the energy data, as deﬁned above. The factors used for converting 
gas, coal, fuel oil and diesel usage into CO
2
 emissions are the latest factors for each year as published by the  
UK Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) in the Guidelines to DEFRA’s GHG Conversion 
Factors. The factors used for converting electricity usage are the national ﬁgures for each country in which the Group 
operates, also sourced from DEFRA; these factors therefore reﬂect the mix of fuels used for electricity generation  
in each country. As required by the GHGP, Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO
2
 emissions are reported separately.  
Scope 1 (direct) emissions are those arising from combustion of fuel in installations or vehicles owned by the Group;  
Scope 2 (indirect) emissions are those arising from bought-in energy (i.e. electricity or steam) where the combustion 
has been carried out by another company. Scope 3 emissions from sources external to DS Smith but involved  
in the supply chains for the Group’s products and services are not included 
3.  The waste ﬁgures relate to waste generated by our operations; they do not include waste that is collected from 
external sources for recycling within our paper and plastic packaging operations (numbers of accidents resulting

Corporate Responsibility review continued
Health and Safety
Safety is our highest priority. 
In 2011/12 we have made 
excellent progress, improving  
our safety performance in each 
of our three Key Performance 
Indicators (KPIs). 
The safety of our staff and those affected by our 
operations is our highest priority. In 2011/12 
the Group continued to improve its safety 
performance. Our businesses benchmark their 
safety performance internally and through the 
use of external data. Information on safety 
performance, including statistics related to our 
KPIs, is reported to the Board quarterly. The 
overall goal is to achieve zero accidents and 
our divisions set interim targets against their  
KPIs, which reﬂect the nature of their business 
and their previous performance. 
In September 2010, the Group acquired  
a business in France, Otor, whose historic  
health and safety record signiﬁcantly lagged 
that of DS Smith, as we reported last year. In 
December 2011 we sold our Ofﬁce Products 
Wholesaling division, Spicers. In 2011/12, 
we have worked very hard to improve the 
health and safety performance of the Otor 
business, along with making improvements 
throughout the Group as part of our continuing 
programme. The statistics quoted below 
compare 2011/12 with 2010/11, where 
2010/11 has been adjusted to include a  
full year ownership of Otor. Statistics relating  
to Spicers are excluded from all years, as it  
is no longer part of the Group. 
In September 2011, there was an accident  
at Higher Kings Mill (prior to its disposal) which, 
sadly, resulted in one fatality. The accident 
remains under investigation.
In 2011/12, we achieved a 23 per cent 
reduction in Lost Time Accidents (LTAs); these  
are accidents that resulted in one shift or more 
of working time being lost. There was a 22 per 
cent reduction in the accident frequency rate 
(AFR), which measures LTAs in proportion to the 
number of hours worked. There was a 10 per 
cent improvement in the accident severity rate, 
which measures the hours lost as a result of 
accidents as a percentage of the total hours 
worked. The improvements in the Group’s  
safety record reﬂect the leadership shown  
by the Group’s managers and the ongoing 
commitment of our employees to working  
safely. As a Group we remain resolute in our 
determination to realise a zero accident culture 
and to continue to build on the progress we 
have made to date. 
The Group’s progress towards a zero  
accident culture is evidenced by 47 of the 
Group’s 107 sites having no LTAs in 2011/12.  
In the Group’s engagement survey, 84 per cent 
of respondents agreed that health and safety  
was taken seriously at their workplace. 84 per 
cent of respondents also felt empowered to 
raise concerns about unsafe practices. The 
Group’s safety communications programme, 
operating under the slogan ‘Think Safe, Be 
Safe’, aims to raise awareness of key issues,  
to challenge unsafe attitudes and behaviour  
and to promote a collective responsibility for 
maintaining a safe working environment. This 
year we have particularly focused on near-miss 
reporting, supported by training at site level. 
The Group has a well established safety audit 
programme conducted by internal specialists 
and external consultants. These audits are used 
to ensure sites’ consistent adherence to safety 
standards and to investigate possible areas of 
concern. The resulting action plans set a clear 
pathway for improvement. Integrating safety  
into the Group’s operational improvement forum 
has enabled further progress in spreading best 
practice across the Group, focusing on issues 
such as re-engineering processes to improve 
safety and factoring safety issues into 
procurement decisions. 
All accidents and situations that might have 
resulted in an accident are investigated to 
ensure we learn from these incidents and  
take steps to prevent a recurrence. In addition  
to focusing on speciﬁc risks, through techniques  
of risk assessment and root cause analysis, the 
Group also undertakes extensive safety training 
programmes at all levels of the organisation.

Business Review
Employees 
DS Smith employees are skilled, 
dedicated and hardworking. We 
are engaging with our employees 
to deliver the Group strategy  
and realise their true potential.
Engagement in our DS Smith story
In 2010 DS Smith ran a Group-wide  
employee survey to understand better the views 
and opinions of all employees on a range of  
topics including the business, their role, their 
manager, and their working environment. This 
information was used to formulate action plans 
for 2011/12 at a local, divisional and Group 
level. The action plans and progress made 
towards their completion has been widely 
communicated and will be measured formally  
in the next survey later in 2012. Some of  
the actions at a Group level that have been 
undertaken as a result of this process are 
outlined in more detail below under the  
DS Smith story – OWN IT! 
The DS Smith story – OWN IT! 
Delivery of the strategic narrative has been 
accompanied by illustrative stories that recognise 
and celebrate the success of individuals and 
teams achieved to date. These success stories 
help to build pride and belief in the Company 
and identify examples of best practice, as well 
as connecting the high level goals and narrative 
to real-life experiences with which individuals 
can relate.
Whilst the DS Smith story aims to engage  
and excite employees in what we want to 
achieve as a business, the wider OWN IT! 
programme also acts to realise the potential of 
our people by enabling them to own their part 
of the story. Each and every team in DS Smith 
will be engaging in interactive meetings focused 
on a local goal that links to one of the strategic 
goals. These meetings seek small yet signiﬁcant 
steps that can be taken to work more efﬁciently, 
collaborate more effectively, use or develop 
latent potential or learn from our past success  
to improve the business. Each small step is 
suggested and owned by a member of the  
team and the accountability for the projects 
undertaken shared between the team members, 
including the recognition of a project’s successful 
completion. Once established, this process  
will promote the continuous identiﬁcation and 
implementation of improvements which are 
directly linked to the Group’s strategic goals and 
supported by behavioural and attitudinal change 
in line with the values of the business. We look 
forward to sharing some of these completed 
projects in our 2012/13 Report.
To help share stories and experiences of best 
practice across the Group globally, DS Smith 
has a new internal network portal, which allows 
employees to read about the success of other 
teams, form project groups to discuss ideas, and 
connect virtual teams or those with similar clients 
or interests. In 2012/13 this will be developed 
as a route to improved collaboration, better 
dissemination of best practice and network 
thinking to harness the ‘wisdom of the crowd’. 
As part of this development, the tool will start 
thought leadership around key strategic 
questions to form interest communities who  
will meet in summits to discuss the leading  
ideas in those ﬁelds based on internal  
and external learning from practical and 
theoretical perspectives.
The programme has united employees who 
work in a range of countries and with a range 
of different product or service offerings around  
a single purpose and common strategic goals. 
There is also a clear declaration of how  
DS Smith employees act through the common 
values that form a crucial section of the narrative: 
DS Smith employees are caring, challenging, 
trusted, responsive and tenacious. These values 
clearly draw on the strengths that are already 
present within DS Smith but also represent the 
common standards required of each employee 
in order to realise our vision.
Community 
involvement
DS Smith has established a 
charitable foundation to support 
the work of charities aligned  
with our activities and values.
We seek to develop and maintain good 
relations in the local communities in which we 
operate. We aim to make positive contributions 
to our communities and build a reputation as a 
good neighbour and employer. Our businesses 
work closely with local schools and colleges 
providing training, mentoring, work experience 
placements and other opportunities for pupils  
to learn about industry and business. The  
Group is involved in a wide range of other 
local community activities including sponsorship  
of community projects or sports teams and 
provision of adult skills training. For example, 
staff from our ofﬁce in Caerphilly are involved  
in the Keep Wales Tidy initiative. 
The DS Smith Charitable Foundation has  
been established this year to provide support  
to charities in two areas aligned with the 
activities and values of the business, being  
(1) environmental/conservation issues and  
(2) opportunities into work. Application forms  
can be found on our corporate website.  
The DS Smith Charitable Foundation also 
actively encourages ideas from employees 
regarding potential partnership charities.  
The DS Smith Charitable Foundation intends  
to identify and start working with its ﬁrst 
partnership charities later in 2012.

The DS Smith story in action
The DS Smith story is not a stand-alone 
programme and the principles are embedded 
in all aspects of the business, including 
people management practices and 
initiatives, from recruitment to performance 
management, talent management and 
leadership development. 
The DS Smith narrative tells of a need to 
realise the true potential of our employees and 
it was decided that an objective assessment 
against ﬁ xed competencies would provide 
a framework to better identify and develop 
talent throughout the business. Therefore, 
bespoke DS Smith leadership and technical 
competencies have been designed that 
provide a consistency of vocabulary and 
standards for recruitment, development 
and assessment across the Group. 
This is evidence of the Group’s commitment 
to ensuring equal opportunities and 
transparency in all recruitment and 
employment practices.
To continue to develop the consistency of 
performance appraisals across national and 
business boundaries within the Group, a new 
performance management system has been 
launched with all senior managers across 
the Group that assesses their performance 
against personal objectives, the new 
competencies and how they live out the 
DS Smith values in their work life. The next 
steps for 2012/13 will be to expand the 
new system further within the Group and to 
continue to develop the predictive measures 
for identifying potential and talent. 
A new training course has also been 
developed for new and potential leaders 
across the Group that through a range of 
modules builds leadership skills that help 
deliver and live out the messages of the 
DS Smith narrative. This means there will 
be a common standard of what makes 
a ‘DS Smith Leader’, that they will be 
equipped to manage, lead and coach 
as well as act as role models of the values 
and culture to their colleagues. At present this 
course is running in the UK and in 2012/13 
will be extended to other Group locations.
In addition, training programmes are 
carried out by the Group’s businesses 
in response to their speciﬁ c operational 
performance requirements. The individual 
training and development needs of employees 
are met through a variety of schemes including: 
management development programmes, 
which in some cases involve external 
accreditation; support for studying external 
vocational and professional qualiﬁ cations; 
and schemes for coaching and mentoring 
managers, using both external and 
internal resources. 
The DS Smith Group is also committed, as 
a minimum, to meeting the labour rights and 
legislation requirements in each of the countries 
in which it operates; in practice the Group 
often exceeds the local and international 
requirements. As DS Smith’s operations are 
almost entirely located in member countries 
of the OECD, human rights matters are not 
perceived as a signiﬁ cant Group risk. DS Smith Plc

How risk is managed at DS Smith
The Board
Overall responsibility
The Group Steering Team
Responsible for making recommendations to the 
Board and for proposing risk mitigation plans
The Risk Committee
Responsible for the detailed analysis of risks and 
the implementation of proposed plans
Risk management
The Group maintains rigorous procedures for understanding 
and managing its risks.
The Group has various risks, both external and internal, which could 
have a material impact on its performance. The Group’s exposure is 
mitigated to some extent by the range of geographies and markets 
served that constitute the business of the Group, and by the broad 
customer base. The principal Group-wide risks, their impact on the 
Group and how we mitigate those risks, are set out below. 
There are further references to risks faced by the Group in the 
Financial review, Corporate Governance section and in the Notes 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report. The Group 
seeks to mitigate insurable risks through an insurance programme
that covers property, liability and other risks where it is relevant 
and cost-effective to do so.
Key risks
Dependence on UK, continental European and other global economic conditions
Impact Mitigation 
 The demand for packaging will vary according to the economic 
climate in which the Group operates, in particular the UK and 
continental Europe. This is particularly true of customers outside the 
fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector, where purchases are more 
discretionary in nature. The impact of the current slow-down in these 
regions on the operations of the business is difﬁ cult to predict and 
could potentially lead to a decline in demand for packaging products. 
There is no visibility on when the current uncertain economic outlook 
will improve.
DS Smith seeks to focus on supplying packaging to FMCG 
customers who, because they supply consumers with grocery and 
home care products, tend to show more resilient volumes compared 
to suppliers of discretionary purchases. In the event of a sustained fall 
in demand, the Group would take mitigating action to protect its 
proﬁ tability, as set out below. 
 Availability and volatile pricing of raw materials 
Impact Mitigation 
  In 2011/12 the Group spent c. £900 million on purchasing paper, 
plastics and other raw materials. The Group also spent c. £126 million 
on energy. These costs have increased substantially over the prior year, 
and to date the Group has largely recovered these costs in pricing, 
typically with the usual three to six month delay depending on the 
business. However, in the event that, due to competitor behaviour or 
other factors, DS Smith were unable to recover further price increases 
on a similar time-scale, the proﬁ tability of the Group would be 
substantially reduced.
 The Group is seeking to improve the speed with which we are 
contractually able to recover input costs, by bringing the UK contract 
structures, typically with six month price-review periods, into line with 
our continental European operations which operate on a three month 
price-review structure. We also seek to differentiate our packaging 
through a focus on adding value to our customers’ supply chains 
by focusing on service, quality and innovation. A description of 
our exposure to energy costs speciﬁ cally is given later in this Risk 
management section. www.dssmith.uk.com

Key risks continued
Strategy implementation and acquisition risk 
Impact Mitigation 
The Group has a strategy to become the leading supplier of  
recycled packaging for consumer goods. It aims to achieve this  
through a combination of cost control, improved procurement  
processes and through organic investment and acquisition. In  
particular, on 30 June 2012 DS Smith will complete its acquisition  
of SCA Packaging, with targeted cost synergies of €75 million and 
capital savings of €40 million, both to be achieved over three years. 
Were the Group not able to implement its savings or were the Group 
not able to ﬁnd further suitable acquisition targets available at prices 
that enable the Group to achieve its strategic return on capital targets, 
or were the Group unable to fund such acquisition or investment on 
acceptable terms or to integrate the acquired businesses effectively,  
this could curtail the delivery of the Group’s strategy and negatively 
impact the Group’s ﬁnancial returns. 
The management team of DS Smith is being developed with  
additional resource, both from within the Group and externally, 
dedicated to operational efﬁciency, procurement, acquisition and 
integration activities. There is considerable experience of this work 
within the senior team, gained both within the Group and from  
their previous roles.
Restrictions due to level of indebtedness
Impact Mitigation
As at 30 April 2012 the Group had net cash of £321.7 million.  
At completion of the SCA Packaging acquisition, the Group will  
pay consideration proceeds of approximately €1.6 billion from cash 
reserves and committed banking facilities. The average interest rate  
on the resultant debt balance is expected to be 4.5 per cent. Were 
events, either speciﬁc to DS Smith, or to the ﬁnancial systems externally, 
to mean that capital was not available at competitive rates, this  
could have a material impact on the proﬁtability of the Group.  
A one percentage point change in the interest rate paid by the  
Group would increase interest costs by c. £10 million.
In addition, the Group will temporarily increase its level of  
indebtedness to above the target level of 2.0x net debt/EBITDA,  
in order to fund the acquisition of SCA Packaging. The new debt 
ﬁnancing arrangements require the Group to dedicate a substantial 
proportion of operating cash ﬂow to make payments on the debt, and 
contain certain restrictions on the Group. These include, among other 
things, the ability to take on further borrowings, pay dividends, make 
certain disposals or to move assets.
The average term of the facilities committed is four years and eight 
months and 63 per cent of the Group’s debt is at ﬁxed rates for a 
period of 12 months or more. The Group sources its debt ﬁnance  
from a mixture of private placements with institutional investors and  
bank debt from a syndicate of 15 institutions. The counterparty risk  
is carefully monitored such that the failure of one lender would not 
materially impact on the Group’s access to capital. Cash deposits  
are placed with institutions with a Standard and Poors credit rating  
of A-minus or above. In countries where this is not possible, deposits  
are held with strong local banks.
The Group expects to reach its target of ≤2.0x net debt/EBITDA  
by the end of the ﬁrst full ﬁnancial year of ownership of SCA 
Packaging. A number of the more onerous restrictions are contained 
only in term loan A, which is expected to be reﬁnanced shortly  
after completion of the SCA Packaging acquisition.

Business Review
Key risks continued
The funding position of the Group’ s deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes
Impact Mitigation 
The Group’s UK deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme is sensitive to a 
number of key factors: the value of the assets, the discount rate used to 
calculate the scheme’s liabilities (based on corporate bond yields) and 
the mortality assumptions for the members of the scheme. The valuation 
of the Group’s various pension schemes as at 30 April 2012, of which 
the UK scheme makes up the largest proportion, was a deﬁcit of 
£104.2 million. While the UK scheme is now closed to future accrual, 
changes in these assumptions could mean that the deﬁcit increases 
further. On completion of the SCA Packaging acquisition, the Group 
has now assumed responsibility for deﬁned beneﬁt pension obligations 
with an asset value (at 30 September 2011) of approximately  
£45 million and liabilities of approximately £100 million. 
On 30 April 2011 the Group’s UK deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme 
closed to future accrual. This decision was taken by the trustees in light 
of the growing deﬁcit of the scheme and the trustees’ responsibility to 
safeguard the accrued beneﬁts to existing members. The Group also 
reached agreement with the trustees for a proﬁle of future payments  
to repay the deﬁcit, being annual payments of £14.8 million starting  
in 2011/12, increasing by 2 per cent per annum, for 10 years.
Environmental risks
Impact Mitigation 
Were a material environmental incident to occur at a DS Smith site,  
this could result in material ﬁnancial costs and reputational damage  
that could undermine our commercial position as a provider of 
environmental solutions. New regulations relating to environmental 
standards and to climate change and CO
2
 emissions can give rise  
to signiﬁcant additional costs of compliance. 
As set out in the Corporate Responsibility review section of this Annual 
Report, the Group has detailed processes in place at all sites to ensure 
that, as a minimum, we comply with all relevant environmental rules  
and regulations.
Fall in demand
Impact Mitigation 
The proﬁtability of the Group is sensitive to volume, the mix of sales and 
product pricing. A fall in demand could arise due to competitive action, 
product substitution, changes in consumer preferences or an overall 
decline in the macroeconomic environment. A 5 per cent reduction in 
corrugated packaging volumes across the Group would theoretically 
result in a fall in Group operating proﬁt by around £25 million, to the 
extent not mitigated by cost control.
In the event of falling demand, the Group would take prompt action  
to address its cost base. Further, the strategy of the Group is to focus  
on developing packaging for FMCG, as this sector has historically  
shown substantially less volatility in demand during periods of economic 
downturn, than industrial users of packaging.
Other risks
Competition in the paper market and the corrugated packaging market
Impact Mitigation 
DS Smith is the largest producer of corrugated case material (CCM)  
in the UK, and also the largest producer of corrugated packaging. 
Including the capacity of SCA Packaging, the Group will be one of the 
largest manufacturers of CCM in Europe and will be the second largest 
supplier of corrugated packaging in Europe. In the event of material 
new paper production capacity being installed by our competitors,  
this could impact the market for CCM, which is largely a commoditised 
product, both directly or through the impact of imports, which could  
in turn inﬂuence pricing in the corrugated packaging market.
We aim to develop long-standing relationships with our corrugated 
packaging customers based on the value that we add to their supply 
chain, and to differentiate DS Smith by the service, quality and 
innovation that we offer. We are also implementing plans to reduce  
our costs in the UK Packaging division and to improve procurement.  www.dssmith.uk.com

Risk management continued
Other risks continued
Energy costs 
Impact Mitigation 
The Group’s exposure to energy costs is set out in the Financial review 
in this Annual Report. The most signiﬁcant energy risk relates to the 
purchase of gas in the UK, where a 10 pence per therm increase 
represents an increase in operating costs of £9 million. 
The Group aims to mitigate its exposure to energy costs by a 
combination of diversifying away from fossil fuels and, where  
this is not possible, through long-term purchasing strategies. 
The Group is looking to maximise in-house energy generation from  
its combined heat and power (CHP) plants in the UK and France. 
The Group operates a centralised approach to purchasing energy in 
the UK and France. The impact of energy costs is managed through  
the use of long-term contracts and through hedging techniques. The 
Group monitors its hedging instruments to ensure that it is not overly 
reliant upon any single counterparty. 
Operational failure such as IT systems and controls or facilities failure
Impact Mitigation 
Like most businesses, the Group depends on its IT systems and controls 
for the management of its operations. Were these to fail for a material 
length of time, this could disrupt the Group from transacting its business. 
Were an incident such as a ﬁre to happen at a major site, this could 
impact on the operations and ﬁnancial performance of the Group.
The Group manages its IT through a combination of experienced  
staff and contracted-out teams. The Group has back-up arrangements in 
place at all its major sites. The Group operates to the highest standards 
of safety at its facilities. The Group has a large network of sites such 
that manufacturing of some products could be transferred between sites. 
The Group is also insured against losses arising from certain incidents 
that might impact on the operations of our facilities. Note, however, that 
certain losses are either not insurable or not economically insurable, 
such as losses due to natural disasters, riots, acts of war or terrorism.
Competition
Impact Mitigation 
The Group operates in a market controlled by laws governing 
competitive behaviour. Penalties for breaching competition laws  
could result in substantial ﬁnes.
The Group has a rigorous programme of training for all relevant 
employees, to ensure that they fully understand the applicable laws  
and the high standards to which they are expected to operate. 
Furthermore, the Group operates a Workplace Malpractice helpline  
in those jurisdictions where this is permissible, providing a conﬁdential 
route for employees to report perceived malpractice of any type.
Industrial relations breakdown
Impact Mitigation 
The Group including SCA Packaging will employ c. 22,000 people. 
Were an issue to arise that caused a material breakdown in industrial 
relations, such that there was a prolonged strike or other industrial 
action within a part of the business, this could have a material impact 
on the ﬁnancial performance of the Group.
The Group maintains good relationships with all signiﬁcant 
organisations that seek to represent its employees. Furthermore, the 
Group aims to provide employees with a safe working environment 
and a culture that fosters excellent performance and encourages 
self-development. Through being an employer of choice, we aim  
to avoid material industrial relations issues arising. DS Smith Plc 
Annual Report & Accounts 2012
33
Business Review
Other risks continued
Employee safety
Impact Mitigation 
Employee safety is the Group’s top priority. Were an incident to  
arise where unsafe practice was found to be taking place, this could 
potentially result in the interruption of some of our operations for a 
period of time and the Group could incur ﬁnancial penalties and 
reputational damage.
The Group has a very detailed and extensive health and safety 
programme, which is embedded in all its operations. Further details  
of this programme are set out in the Corporate Responsibility review  
in this Annual Report.
Product liability
Impact Mitigation 
The Group’s products are used, amongst other things, for packaging 
food and drink products and accordingly are manufactured to  
conform to the relevant standards. Were any products to be defective, 
or were the applicable standards to become signiﬁcantly more onerous,  
this could give rise to both ﬁnancial and reputational damage to  
the Group.
The Group has not been held liable in any material product liability 
claims in the past several years. The Group observes all applicable 
safety standards and engages with industry bodies in their research  
on the use of packaging for food and drink products. 
T axation
Impact Mitigation 
The amount of taxation paid by the Group is dependent on the 
applicable tax law in the jurisdictions in which we operate and on the 
geographic mix of the business. Were the tax rate to be increased in 
those jurisdictions, or the geographic mix of the business to change to 
be skewed towards higher tax jurisdictions, then the overall tax rate of 
the Group may rise, impacting on the proﬁts that may be distributed  
to shareholders.
The Group actively manages its tax affairs in order to minimise  
the tax paid, within the scope of the tax laws where we operate. 
Foreign exchange rate movements
Impact Mitigation 
Following the SCA Packaging acquisition, approximately 65 per cent 
of the Group’s operating proﬁt, per annum, will be derived from non 
sterling currencies, principally the euro. The Group does not hedge for 
currency translation effects on revenue or operating proﬁt. As described 
in the Financial review section of this Annual Report the Group’s debt  
is mainly denominated in euros and this acts as a net investment hedge  
of the Group’s euro net assets.
In relation to currency translation, the conversion rate which is  
material to the Group is sterling to the euro. A decrease in the value  
of the euro by 1 cent would reduce operating proﬁt by c. £1.1 million  
and, after a beneﬁt to the interest cost of c. £0.3 million, pre-tax proﬁt  
by £0.8 million. 
Other social and environmental matters
Impact Mitigation 
The Group’s management of other social and environmental risks is 
described in the Corporate Responsibility review in this Annual Report.

Corporate Governance
What does good governance 
mean to DS Smith?
Dear Shareholders
DS Smith has gone through a period of great change in the last 12 months with 
more changes still to come. Managing this change has been a fundamental part of the 
good governance of this Company and the Company is committed to the principle and 
application of sound corporate governance. Meeting the ever-changing demands of the 
business environment and taking into account wider social and political inﬂ uences whilst at 
the same time ensuring that our various stakeholders – shareholders, employees, customers 
and the environment – are all given equal consideration, has been a challenge that your 
Board has taken very seriously. Ensuring that DS Smith has been able to rise to these 
demands as a cohesive Group has been at the heart of all your Board’s decisions.
This Report shows how the Board looked at the challenges laid down by the UK Corporate 
Governance Code last year and reviews the Code’s impact on the Company during the 
year. Through the Nomination Committee, a good deal of attention has been paid to the 
composition of the Board and succession planning, taking into account knowledge and 
experience, key skills, diversity and the mix between Executive and non-Executive Directors.
As regards diversity, the Board of DS Smith has considered carefully Lord Davies’ 
recommendations. We have a small Board, comprising two Executive Directors, three 
non-Executive Directors and a non-Executive Chairman, and therefore believe it difﬁ cult to 
set targets or timescales for the percentage of women, or any other group, on our Board. 
We are committed to ensuring our Board continues to have both relevant experience and 
appropriate diversity. We believe the Board would be strengthened by the addition of 
women with the right skills and experience and will continue to seek to identify suitable 
candidates. In view of this, we are optimistic that the targets for Board composition set 
out in the Davies recommendations can be met.
Executive remuneration has again been a hot topic and the Remuneration Committee’s Report 
(on pages 43 to 54) sets out in detail the Company’s approach to this important area.
Last year, before the Code came into force, the Board agreed that the Chairman and 
non-Executive Directors would put themselves up for re-election annually but the Executive 
Directors would only stand for re-election every three years. Having reviewed best practice 
and after further discussion, the Board has now resolved that all Directors will stand for 
re-election annually.

Governance
The Company has complied throughout the 
ﬁ nancial year with all the provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. The Board 
has regard to corporate governance issues in 
all of its decision making. Further explanation 
of how the principles and supporting principles 
of the Code have been applied is set out 
below and in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report. The Company’s Auditor has reviewed 
the compliance with those provisions of 
the Code speciﬁ ed for their review. 
Board and Board Committees
The role of the Board
The Board is collectively responsible for 
promoting the success of the Company by 
directing and supervising the Company’s affairs. 
The Board’s role is to provide leadership of the 
Company within a framework of prudent and 
effective controls which enable risk to be 
assessed and managed.
The Board sets the Company’s strategic 
aims, ensures that the necessary ﬁ nancial 
and human resources are in place for the 
Company to meet its objectives, and reviews 
management performance.
In addition, the Board sets the Company’s 
values and standards and ensures that its 
obligations to its shareholders and others are 
understood and met.
The ofﬁ ces of Chairman and Group Chief 
Executive are held separately. During the year, 
each of the non-Executive Directors has at all 
times acted independently of management 
and has no relationships which would materially 
interfere with the exercise of their independent 
judgement and decision making. Gareth Davis 
was regarded as independent when 
appointed Chairman.
All Board members attend all Board and 
relevant Committee meetings unless exceptional 
circumstances prevent them from attending.
For meetings where Directors were unable 
to attend, where practicable, they gave full 
consideration to the matters being discussed 
and provided their input to the Chairman.
In addition to formal Board meetings, the 
Chairman and Group Chief Executive maintain 
regular contact with all Directors and hold 
informal meetings with non-Executive Directors 
to discuss issues affecting the Company. 
Individual Directors are encouraged to make 
site visits during the year. The Board reviews 
the performance of the Group and undertakes 
a strategic review on an annual basis. There 
is a formal schedule of matters reserved for 
consideration and approval by the Board, 
which was reviewed and updated in April 
2012. These include the annual budget, 
substantial acquisitions and disposals, the 
approval of the full-year and half-year results 
and a review of the overall system of internal 
control and risk management.
Each Director has access to all information 
relating to the Group and to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary (who is 
responsible for ensuring that Board procedures 
are followed and is also the Company’s 
General Counsel) and, as required, external 
advice at the expense of the Group. The 
Directors are provided with opportunities for 
training to ensure that they are kept up-to-date 
on relevant new legislation and regulation 
changes, corporate governance developments 
and changing commercial risks. On 
appointment, new Directors are given 
appropriate induction training, tailored to 
their speciﬁ c needs, taking into account their 
individual qualiﬁ cations and experience, which 
includes individual time with the Chairman, 
Group Chief Executive and Group Finance 
Director and site visits to major business units.
The Board carried out a comprehensive 
appraisal of its performance and that of 
the Committees and the individual Directors 
between January and March 2012. The 
review was carried out by an external facilitator, 
who has no other connection with the Group, 
and who was appointed to provide a more 
independent view and a new focus for 
the 2012 Board evaluation. The review 
investigated a variety of aspects associated 
with Board effectiveness, speciﬁ cally:
1)   the way in which the Board deﬁ nes its role 
and approaches its work (strategy, risk and 
control, performance management, and 
communication); and
2)   the way in which the Board works together 
(culture and dynamics), and optimises its use 
of time and its contribution to the Company.
The facilitator obtained feedback from each 
Director through detailed one-to-one interviews 
and attendance as an observer at a Board 
meeting. The feedback was collated into a 
report which was discussed with each Director 
and then presented to the Board. All Directors 
and the Company Secretary participated in the 
exercise. Individual Directors were encouraged 
to discuss feedback with the facilitator.

Corporate strategy
The main discussions on strategy for 2011/12 
were around the disposal of the Ofﬁ ce Products 
Wholesaling division and the acquisition of the 
packaging division of SCA. The Company’s 
medium-term targets are to remain focused on 
recycled packaging to consumer companies; 
reducing cyclicality of returns; and reducing 
non-integrated paper production.
Board committees
Details of the matters discussed in the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees 
during 2011/12 are set out in the following 
pages. In addition to those matters, the 
Remuneration Committee reviewed and updated 
its terms of reference in April 2012 and the Audit 
and Nomination Committees’ terms of reference 
were reviewed and updated in June 2012.
Board visibility
In addition to regular reports from the Group 
Chief Executive and Group Finance Director the 
Board received reports from and engaged with 
divisional managers and key members of the 
support teams.

Corporate Governance continued
The facilitator concluded as follows:
 During the review the Board demonstrated a 
methodical and thorough approach to its 
work. The Board demonstrated strategic 
clarity and conviction, and spends a 
signiﬁcant amount of time on risk and 
control. The Board is assisted by improving 
ﬁnancial information, professional internal 
and external audit processes, and a strong 
Audit Committee. There is an active and 
collaborative approach to performance 
management, and a constructive 
Remuneration Committee. The dynamics  
and contribution of the Board are fostered 
through an open and transparent culture 
(promoted by the Group Chief Executive 
and executive team), high quality debate, 
an even contribution, and respected  
Board leadership. The Board and the 
Committees beneﬁt from carefully planned 
agendas, and effective support from the  
Company Secretary.
 There is an open Board culture. The Board is 
focused on its ability to deliver value, and to 
make a signiﬁcant difference through its 
culture and dynamics. The Executive Directors 
are open and honest in their dealings with 
the non-Executive Directors, respect their 
views and listen to their concerns. Non-
Executive Directors address the right issues 
and are both challenging and supportive.

The Board held eight scheduled meetings during the year and six ad hoc meetings were held to discuss speciﬁc issues, principally relating to the SCA Packaging acquisition.  
In addition to the AGM in September there was a General Meeting held in February 2012. Figures in brackets denote the maximum number of meetings that could have  
been attended.
1. Gareth Davis stepped down as a member of the Audit Committee on his appointment as Chairman of the Board in January 2012
2. Peter Johnson retired from the Board on 4 January 2012
3. Philippe Mellier was appointed as a member of the Audit and Nomination Committees in January 2012
4. Jonathan Nicholls was appointed as a member of the Remuneration Committee in January 2012
 The responsibilities of the Audit Committee 
and Board are appropriately drawn.  
The Remuneration Committee will focus on 
ensuring the remuneration policy consistently 
reﬂects the business strategy and goals. The 
Nomination Committee needs to continue  
to focus on bench strength and executive 
succession planning as a priority. 
Three areas were identiﬁed by the facilitator  
for further Board discussion, all of which  
will become more important following the 
Company’s latest transaction:
 There is a need for a greater level of Board 
knowledge and discussion regarding the 
international landscape, the Company’s 
attention to customers, and the relevance  
of the Board’s future composition.
 The understanding of the Board and its 
visibility of risk and executive succession 
planning needs to be further developed.
 The Board should give further consideration to 
having more site visits and using the informal 
time Directors spend together for further 
discussions which would complement the 
formal Board meetings.
The Board has discussed the ﬁndings of the 
facilitator in detail and an action plan has been 
developed by the Chairman, with the assistance 
of the Company Secretary, to address the  
areas identiﬁed.
Following this evaluation the Board  
recommends the re-election of Directors  
standing for re-election at the 2012 Annual 
General Meeting.

Governance
Board Committees
The principal Committees of the Board are  
the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees. All Board Committees have  
written terms of reference agreed by the Board. 
These are available on the Company’s website 
at http://www.dssmith.uk.com/aboutus/
corporate-governance or are available  
on request to the Company Secretary.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Jonathan 
Nicholls. The other members are Chris Bunker 
and Philippe Mellier. In addition to the 
Committee members, the Chairman, the Group 
Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director, 
representatives from Internal Audit and the 
Group Financial Controller attend parts of these 
meetings by invitation. The Board is satisﬁed 
that Jonathan Nicholls and the members of the 
Audit Committee have both current and relevant 
ﬁnancial experience (as set out on page 35).
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee 
include all the matters indicated by the Code, 
except the oversight of business risks which  
is the direct responsibility of the Board. The 
primary objective of the Audit Committee is  
to assist the Board in fulﬁlling its responsibilities 
relating to:
 the accounting principles, policies and 
practices adopted in the Group’s accounts;
 external ﬁnancial reporting and  
associated announcements;
 the appointment, independence, effectiveness 
and remuneration of the Group’s Auditor;
 the resourcing, plans and effectiveness of 
Internal Audit performed on behalf of the 
Company by a major accountancy ﬁrm 
(currently KPMG), which is independent  
from the Group’s Auditor;
 the adequacy and effectiveness of the 
ﬁnancial control environment; and
 the Group’s compliance with the Code.
The Committee receives and reviews regular 
reports from the external Auditor, Internal Audit 
and the Group Finance Director. Under its terms 
of reference the Committee is empowered to 
seek independent external advice but did not 
do so during the year.
The Committee meets with the external Auditor 
to determine annually their qualiﬁcations, 
expertise, resources, independence, objectivity, 
and effectiveness. The Audit Committee 
receives written conﬁrmation from the external 
Auditor as to any relationships that might have 
a bearing on their independence, whether they 
consider themselves independent within the 
meaning of the UK regulatory and professional 
requirements, and on their quality control 
processes and ethical standards.
In order to ensure the independence and 
objectivity of the Auditor, the Committee 
maintains and regularly reviews the Auditor 
Independence Policy which covers services 
which may be provided by, and fees paid to, 
auditors. Audit fees are negotiated with the 
Group Finance Director and approved by the 
Audit Committee. The policy on the supply of 
non-audit services by external auditors is as 
follows: The Group should not employ the 
Auditor to provide non-audit services where 
either the nature of the work or the extent of 
such services might impair the Auditor’s 
independence or objectivity. The external 
Auditor is permitted to undertake some 
non-audit services, providing they have the  
skill, competence and integrity to carry out the 
work in the best interests of the Group, on, for 
example, advisory services and due diligence 
activities associated with potential acquisitions 
and disposals and major changes in 
accounting regulations. Non-audit services and 
fees are reported to the Audit Committee twice 
a year. For guidance, annual non-audit fees 
payable to the external Auditor should not 
exceed 75% of the annual Group audit fee 
without prior formal approval of the Committee. 
During 2011/12, total non-audit fees were 
136% of the annual Group audit fee. The most 
signiﬁcant element related to the proposed 
acquisition of SCA Packaging, where the use  
of external auditors was approved by the Audit 
Committee. Approval for permitted non-audit 
services is sought as required by this policy 
which speciﬁes that individual projects which 
would cost over £100,000 must be referred  
to the Chairman of the Committee for prior 
approval. The outcome of these reviews  
was not only that performance of the relevant 
non-audit work by the Auditor was the most 
cost-effective way of conducting business, but 
also that no conﬂicts of interest existed between 
such audit and non-audit work. In addition, 
£5.4 million was paid to other accounting ﬁrms 
for non-audit work, including £0.9 million for 
work relating to Internal Audit.
Deloitte LLP , a leading international audit 
partnership, was ﬁrst appointed as Auditor to 
the Group companies in 2006 and their fees 
are regularly compared with peer companies 
by the Committee. There are no contractual 
restrictions on the Group with regard to 
Deloitte’s appointment. In accordance with 
professional standards, the partner responsible 
for the audit is changed every ﬁve years.
During the year, the Committee met privately 
with the external Auditor after each Committee 
meeting. The Chairman of the Audit Committee 
also held separate private meetings during the 
year with the external Auditor, representatives 
from Internal Audit and the Group Finance 
Director. The Committee received sufﬁcient, 
reliable and timely information from 
management to enable it to fulﬁl its 
responsibilities. The Committee is satisﬁed  
that the Group’s executive compensation 
arrangements do not prejudice robust  
controls and good stewardship.
At its meeting in June 2011, the Committee 
reviewed the annual ﬁnancial statements of the 
Company and received reports from Internal 
Audit on internal control matters and from the 
external Auditor on the conduct of their audit, 
their review of accounting policies, areas of 
judgement and the ﬁnancial statements and  
their comments on statements concerning risk  
and internal control. A similar review was 
undertaken in December 2011 when the 
half-year results were considered. At these 
meetings and the meeting in April 2012,  
the Committee dealt with the following  
particular matters:
 at the year-end a series of tests were 
undertaken to determine whether there had 
been any impairment to the balance sheet 
carrying values of goodwill and other 
intangible assets. The key assumptions  
behind these calculations can be found  
in note 10 to the ﬁnancial statements;
 at the meeting in June 2011 it received a 
report from Internal Audit covering, amongst 
other things, the work undertaken by the 
Internal Audit function and management 
responses to proposals made in the audit 
reports issued by the function during the year; www.dssmith.uk.com

Corporate Governance continued
 it considered the effectiveness of systems  
for monitoring and reporting on risks  
faced by the Group;
 it carried out an appraisal of the external 
Auditor and Internal Audit function, the  
results of which were reported to the Board.  
The Committee concluded that each area 
operated satisfactorily during the year; 
 it reviewed and updated the terms of 
reference of the Audit Committee; and
 it oversaw the continuing development  
and the operation of the Group’s Workplace 
Malpractice Policy.
The performance of the Committee was 
evaluated as part of the Board performance 
evaluation process described above.
Nomination Committee
Gareth Davis became Chairman of the 
Nomination Committee on 4 January 2012, 
taking over from Peter Johnson on his retirement 
from the Board. The other members of the 
Nomination Committee are Miles Roberts, Chris 
Bunker, Philippe Mellier and Jonathan Nicholls.
The Nomination Committee evaluates the 
balance of skills, knowledge and experience 
(including the length of service of each Director) 
of the Board, develops role speciﬁcations, 
considers the appointment of Directors,  
reviews succession planning and diversity  
at Board level, identiﬁes the skills required of  
future Directors and makes recommendations  
to the Board as a whole. A rigorous process  
is in place for the appointment of new  
Directors, involving the use of external 
recruitment consultants followed by meetings 
with the Committee and then with the Board. 
The Committee had developed a succession 
plan for the appointment of a new Chairman  
to replace Peter Johnson. The Committee 
regarded the appointment of Gareth Davis as 
Chairman as the best for the Company, based 
on his skill, experience and knowledge of the 
Company. Consequently the Committee did  
not consider it appropriate to place an external 
advertisement for the position of Chairman.
The performance of the Committee was 
evaluated as part of the Board performance 
evaluation process described above.
Other Board Committees
The Board has delegated certain powers, 
mainly of a routine nature, to the General 
Purposes Committee, which comprises  
the Group Chief Executive and the Group 
Finance Director under the chairmanship of  
the Group Chief Executive.
Conﬂicts of interest
The Company’s Articles of Association permit 
the Board of Directors to authorise a conﬂict of 
interest or potential conﬂict of interest notiﬁed by 
a Director (subject to conditions if appropriate), 
provided that the Board considers this to be in 
the best interests of the Company.
Each of the Directors in ofﬁce reviews their 
individual position regularly and new Directors 
review their individual positions prior to joining 
the Board. Directors are reminded from time to 
time of their obligations. The Company has put 
procedures in place via the Company Secretary 
whereby the Directors can notify any future 
conﬂicts or potential conﬂicts of interest that may 
arise so that the Board can consider whether 
authorisation is appropriate. Any notiﬁcations 
are reviewed at the next Board meeting and,  
if considered appropriate, authorised. Directors 
do not participate in the discussion, or vote 
regarding their own conﬂicts. If authorised, any 
conﬂicts are entered in the Conﬂicts Register.
An annual review of conﬂicts is carried out and 
this is incorporated into the year-end process  
of verifying Directors’ interests. The procedures 
continue to operate effectively.

accordance with the Financial Services 
Authority’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules  
on the dissemination of inside information to 
ensure the protection of such information that 
has not already been made available generally 
to the Company’s shareholders. The Board also 
receives feedback from major shareholders

Regular communication with shareholders also 
takes place through the Annual Report and via

In addition, the Company provides Interim 
Management Statements and trading updates.
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the 
Group’s system of internal control, including 
ﬁnancial, operational and compliance  
controls, and risk management systems, and  
for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system, 
however, can only be designed to manage 
rather than to eliminate risk and therefore can 
provide only reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or  
loss. In accordance with the Turnbull guidance, 
the Company has in place the procedures 
necessary to ensure that there is an ongoing 
process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the signiﬁcant risks to the  
Group. These procedures have been in place 
throughout the year under review and up to  
the date of the approval of these ﬁnancial 
statements and have been reviewed by  
the Board during the year. A Group Risk 
Committee, comprising the Group Steering 
Team (Group Chief Executive, Group Finance 
Director, Company Secretary, Group Human 
Resources Director, Chief Procurement Ofﬁcer 
and Divisional Chief Executives) meets regularly. 
The Group Risk Committee discusses the key 
risks facing the Group and whether there are 
any material new risks, and the adequacy  
and suitability of the mitigation arrangements  
in place to manage those risks.
The Board determines the objectives and  
broad policies of the Group. It meets regularly 
and there is a schedule of matters which  
are required to be brought to it for decision.  
The Board has delegated to management the 
responsibility for establishing a system of internal 
control appropriate to the business environments 
in which the Group operates. Key elements  
of this system include:
 a clearly deﬁned divisionalised organisation 
structure for monitoring the conduct and 
operations of individual business units;

these risks. Risk consideration is embedded

business area management as well as to  
the Audit Committee.
The Board can conﬁrm that it has carried out  
an annual review of the overall effectiveness  
of the Group’s system of internal control and risk 
management procedures, during the year and 
up to the date of approval of this Annual Report. 
This included a process of self-certiﬁcation by 
senior divisional management in which they 
were asked to conﬁrm that their divisions have 
complied with Group policies and procedures 
and to report any signiﬁcant control weaknesses 
identiﬁed during the past year. In addition,  
it involved reviewing the results of the work  
of the Group’s Internal Audit function and the  
risk identiﬁcation and management processes 
identiﬁed above.
Going concern
In considering the going concern basis  
for preparing the ﬁnancial statements, the 
Directors have considered the Company’s 
objectives and strategy, risks and uncertainties  
in achieving its objectives and its review of 
business performance which are all set out in 
the Strategic summary, Operating review and 
Financial review sections of this Annual Report 
and Accounts. The Group’s liquidity and funding 
arrangements are described in notes 16 and  
18 to the ﬁnancial statements as well as in  
the capital structure and treasury management 
section of the Financial Review and the Directors 
consider that the Group has signiﬁcant covenant 
and liquidity headroom in its borrowing facilities 
for the foreseeable future.
After reviewing the Company’s expenditure 
commitments, current ﬁnancial projections and 
expected future cash ﬂows (with appropriate 
sensitivities applied), together with the available 
cash resources and undrawn committed 
borrowing facilities (and including consideration 
of the impact from the acquisition of SCA 
Packaging), the Directors have considered  
that adequate resources exist for the Company  
to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Directors 
continue to adopt the going concern basis  
in preparing the ﬁnancial statements. DS Smith Plc

Remuneration Report
The aim of our remuneration policy is to attract, develop and retain 
leaders who are focused and adequately incentivised to deliver 
outstanding business results.
Dear Shareholders
As the new Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to introduce our report 
on remuneration for 2012, for which we seek your support at our Annual General Meeting 
on 4 September 2012.
The Remuneration Report is designed to provide you with the necessary information to 
demonstrate the link between our Group’s strategy, its performance, and the remuneration 
outcomes for its senior executives. It is also intended to deliver the remuneration disclosures 
required by UK regulation.
I know that senior executive remuneration has been the subject of much comment, 
particularly in the last year or so. In the past the Remuneration Committee has sought the 
views of shareholders before making any substantial changes to policy and I intend to 
continue that good practice.
This has been the year in which the Group has changed signiﬁ cantly with the disposal 
of the Ofﬁ ce Products Wholesaling division and the announcement of the acquisition of 
SCA Packaging. Our remuneration strategy reﬂ ects that change to ensure that we continue 
to attract, reward and retain the key people to drive the business forward whilst retaining 
our ‘pay for performance’ culture. Within an increasingly demanding, competitive and 
international environment we want our employees to be fairly compensated and incentivised 
to deliver our strategic vision. 
For the ﬁ nancial year ahead, following the announcement of such a transformational 
acquisition, the Committee has considered the impact on the remuneration arrangements 
and policy for the senior executive team. Whilst no changes requiring shareholder approval 
are proposed, some amendments to the policy are proposed for the year ahead. These 
changes are necessary to reﬂ ect the revised complexity, breadth and near doubled size of the 
business and to ensure that the arrangements are aligned with the achievement of our strategic 
objectives. At the same time, this has to be balanced with the need to align senior executives 
with the achievement of a fully integrated, enlarged Group focused on the long-term interests 
of the shareholders and not simply for the delivery of an acquisition.
We seek, through a substantial proportion of performance-related variable remuneration, 
to ensure that outstanding performance is well rewarded and that underperformance is 
addressed through a structured process of executive development and performance appraisal. 
The Committee is ﬁ rmly of the view that payment for failure is totally unacceptable, whilst 
executives should be well rewarded for outstanding performance. It will exercise the powers 
it has at its disposal to achieve these goals.
I was appointed as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee in January this year, taking 
over from Gareth Davis on his appointment as Chairman of the Board. I would like to conﬁ rm 
that both I and the Committee continue to be committed to the principles of good governance 
and best practice.

Remuneration Report continued
(A) Introduction
The Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’), is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code  
(the ‘Code’). The Committee is a committee of the Board. Its terms of reference can be found on the Company’s website. The Committee’s key 
objectives are to:
 set and agree with the Board a competitive and transparent remuneration framework which is aligned to the Company’s strategy and is in  
the interests of both the Company and its shareholders; and
 determine the speciﬁc remuneration packages for each of the Executive Directors, the Chairman and Company Secretary. It also considers  
the remuneration of senior executives reporting to the Group Chief Executive, taking into account recommendations from him.
Details of the membership of the Remuneration Committee are set out on page 43. All members of the Committee are independent  
non-Executive Directors.
In accordance with section 439 of the Companies Act 2006, shareholders’ approval of the Remuneration Report will be sought at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’). The Remuneration Report has been approved by the Board of Directors.
(B) Compliance
The Board, in conjunction with the Committee, has taken the necessary steps to ensure that the Company complies with the provisions of the  
Code which relate to Directors’ remuneration. 
This Report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (Schedule 8) and the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority. In this Report we describe how the principles  
of good governance relating to Directors’ remuneration, as set out in the Code, are applied in practice. The Committee conﬁrms that throughout the 
year it has complied with these governance rules and best practice provisions.
The Regulations require our Auditor to report to shareholders on the audited information within this Report and to state whether, in their opinion, the 
relevant sections have been prepared in accordance with the Act. The Auditor’s opinion is set out in the Auditor’s Report and we have clearly marked 
the audited sections of the Report.
The members of the Committee have no personal ﬁnancial interest, other than as shareholders of the Company, in the matters to be decided by  
the Committee, no potential conﬂicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
(C) Advisers to the Committee
New Bridge Street (a brand of Aon Hewitt Limited) has been appointed by the Committee to provide advice on the remuneration of Executive 
Directors and other senior executives. New Bridge Street also provides advice to the Company in connection with the operation of the Company’s 
share-based incentive schemes. The Committee consults with the Chairman of the Company and with the Group Chief Executive, who may attend 
meetings of the Committee, although they are not involved in deciding their own remuneration. The Committee is assisted by the Company Secretary 
and the Group Human Resources Director, and also receives advice from Mercer Limited, the Actuary to the Company’s pension scheme, in relation 
to Executive Directors’ pensions. New Bridge Street and Mercer are signatories to the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Advisers. Neither New 
Bridge Street nor any other part of Aon Hewitt provided any other services to the Company during the year.
(D) General policy on remuneration
The Committee’s overall policy is to ensure that the remuneration packages are competitive and enable the Company to attract, retain and  
motivate Executive Directors and other senior managers of sufﬁcient calibre to meet the Company’s needs. The Committee regards remuneration 
policy as an essential tool to underpin the performance culture of the Group and the remuneration packages are designed to align the interests of 
executives with those of our shareholders. We seek, through a substantial proportion of performance-related variable remuneration, to ensure that 
outstanding performance is well rewarded and that underperformance is addressed through a structured process of executive development and 
performance appraisal.
Following the announcement of the acquisition of SCA Packaging, the Committee has considered the impact on the remuneration arrangements  
and policy for the senior executive team. Whilst no changes requiring shareholder approval have been proposed, some amendments to the policy 
are proposed for the year ahead. These changes are necessary to reﬂect the revised complexity, breadth and near doubled size of the business and 
to ensure that the arrangements are aligned with the achievement of our strategic objectives. At the same time, this has to be balanced with the need 
to align executives with the achievement of a fully integrated, enlarged Group focused on the long-term interests of the shareholders and not simply  
for the delivery of an acquisition.
As well as considering the impact of the reconﬁgured Group on the 2012/13 remuneration policy (details of which are provided below), it  
has also been necessary for the Committee to consider whether any changes should be made to outstanding awards under our share schemes.  
As with most rights issues, existing awards will be adjusted to reﬂect the increased number of shares in issue following the Rights Issue. DS Smith Plc 
Annual Report & Accounts 2012

Governance
The acquisition of SCA Packaging will be completed at the end of June 2012 and the Company has therefore only had limited access to non-publicly 
available information with regard to SCA Packaging’s ﬁnancial performance. Accordingly, the Remuneration Committee has set provisional targets  
for the SCA Packaging elements of the 2012/13 incentive schemes and the targets will be reviewed again following completion of the transaction.
The Committee is ﬁrmly of the view that payment for failure is totally unacceptable, whilst executives should be well rewarded for outstanding 
performance. It will exercise the powers it has at its disposal to achieve these goals. In particular, it is worth noting the following safeguards that exist 
in the Company’s remuneration policy:
 Executive Directors have 12 month notice periods, with instalments payable for leavers rather than a lump sum.
 claw back exists in the bonus and long-term plans to recover payments if there is a material misstatement of results or if there is serious misconduct.
 bonuses are not contractual and also not payable to ‘bad leavers’ if an executive has left (or is under notice) at the time of payment.
 deferred bonuses (half of the annual bonus) and long-term incentives will lapse in the case of ‘bad leavers’.
As in previous years, the main elements of the remuneration policy in 2012/13 will be as follows:
 basic salary;
 pension provision;
 annual bonus scheme; and
 long-term incentives, comprising the Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) and Share Matching Plan (‘SMP’).
Basic salaries and pension provision are not linked to performance (except when basic salaries are reviewed), whilst payments under the annual 
bonus scheme and any long-term incentive scheme operated by the Company are wholly dependent upon performance against agreed targets.  
Only basic salary is pensionable.
Variable performance-related remuneration for Miles Roberts and Steve Dryden for 2012/13 will account for approximately 64% (2011/12: 57%) 
of total target remuneration (excluding pensions and beneﬁts).
The Board is ultimately accountable for executive remuneration but delegates responsibility to the Committee. The Committee addressed the following 
main issues during the year:
Date Key agenda item
21 June 2011 – Authorise 2011 bonus payments;

Remuneration Report continued
The Committee has reviewed salaries in the context of the roles, experience and responsibilities of the Executive Directors and senior executives.  
It is cognisant of the current environment for executive pay and understands investors’ view that Executive Director salaries should not normally  
increase faster than those of the executive team generally. It is also fully aware of the duty it has to shareholders to ensure that the right remuneration 
arrangements are in place. The Group Chief Executive’s basic salary was increased by 6.5% on 1 August 2011 and the Group Finance Director’s 
basic salary was increased by 6.0%. Other senior executives’ basic salaries were increased in the range of 0% to 10.7% from 1 August 2011.  
This compares to an average increase of 3.0% for the rest of the workforce. Whilst there is no overall policy on the relationship between Executive 
Directors’ pay and that of the workforce, the Company aims to pay fairly across the business.
The last 12 months have seen a transformation at DS Smith as the Group strives to implement its strategy to become a focused, international supplier 
of recycled packaging for the FMCG market. The 2011 calendar year closed with the completion of the disposal of the Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling 
division. This was closely followed in January 2012 by the announcement of the acquisition of SCA Packaging which received overwhelmingly 
positive support from shareholders at the General Meeting.
Against this background, the Remuneration Committee has been considering how to ensure that key management performance and remuneration is 
aligned with the interests of our investors. The Remuneration Committee believes this can best be achieved by having key management well rewarded 
for achieving truly stretching objectives, and furthermore that the shape of this reward should emphasise the development of a signiﬁcant shareholding 
in the Company by those key managers.
The Company is consulting with its major shareholders, the Association of British Insurers and RREV prior to ﬁnalising the details of the remuneration 
arrangements summarised below:
Element of remuneration package Basic salary and beneﬁts
Purpose – Reﬂect the individual’s experience and role within the Group;
– Help recruit and retain key senior executives.
Policy for 2012/13 –  Increase Executive Directors’ basic salary to the mid-market level over the next two years  
(taking into account the criticality of each individual);
– Regard given to individual skills, experience and performance.
Summary of how it operates – Paid monthly in cash;
– Normally reviewed by the Committee annually and ﬁxed for the 12 months commencing 1 August;
–  Salary is supplemented with normal beneﬁts available to Executive Directors and senior managers  
including car allowance, life cover and medical insurance.
Element of remuneration package Annual bonus
Purpose – Incentivise executives to achieve speciﬁc, predetermined goals during a one-year period;
– Reward ongoing delivery and contribution to strategic initiatives;
–  Deferred proportion of bonus, awarded in shares, provides a retention element and additional alignment  
of interests with shareholders.
Policy for 2012/13 –  Bonus awards will be measured against the achievement of Group objectives. In 2012/13 there will  
also be a requirement for the integration and synergy savings to be substantially as indicated in the  
acquisition prospectus;
–  At target 50% of maximum bonus will be payable. Maximum bonus is 150% of salary for the Executive 
Directors and generally 100% for the other most senior executives;
– Percentage of bonus deferred and awarded in shares.
Summary of how it operates –  The Executive Directors have objectives related to Group proﬁt before tax and amortisation (‘PBTA’) and 
ROACE. Other senior executives are measured against a mix of Group PBTA, ROACE and Business  
Segment operating proﬁt, as relevant to each individual’s job;
–  Bonus results are determined by the Committee after the year end, based on performance against targets;
– 50% of the bonus is paid in cash and 50% is paid in deferred shares;
–  The deferred shares vest after three years and are paid together with an amount equal to the value of dividends 
payable on the vested shares during the deferral period. The deferred element is subject to forfeiture for  
‘bad leavers’ who depart prior to vesting. DS Smith Plc

Governance
Element of remuneration package Performance Share Plan and Share Matching Plan
Purpose –  Drive longer-term performance and retention and align interests of executives and shareholders  
through building a shareholding;
– Retain key executives over a set performance period – usually three years.
Policy for 2012/13 –  PSP Awards (Nil Cost Options) made annually, with vesting dependent on the achievement of TSR  
(50%), EPS (25%) and ROACE (25%) performance conditions. SMP Awards (Nil Cost Options) will  
vest dependent on the achievement of EPS (50%) and ROACE (50%) performance conditions;
–  Executive Directors normally receive annual PSP grants to a maximum value of 150% of salary, plus SMP 
grants to a maximum of 75% of salary (1.5x the ﬁrst 50% of salary worth of deferred shares earned under  
the annual bonus plan). Other senior executives generally receive PSP grants at 100% of salary plus SMP 
grants to a maximum of 50% of salary.
Summary of how it operates –  TSR performance is measured against the Industrial Goods and Services Supersector within the FTSE 250 
over the performance period;
– EPS performance is measured based on average adjusted EPS achieved over the performance period;
–  ROACE performance is measured based on average adjusted ROACE achieved over the  
performance period;
– The three conditions are measured independently;
–  Under the TSR tranche, threshold performance is set at ranking at median relative to the Group, at which point 
25% of the award vests. This increases on a straight-line basis to full vesting for ranking at the upper quartile;
–  Under the EPS tranche, at threshold performance 25% of the award vests, increasing on a straight-line basis 
to maximum performance or more where full vesting occurs;
–  Under the ROACE tranche, at threshold performance 25% of the award vests, increasing on a straight-line 
basis to maximum performance or more where full vesting occurs;
– The Committee has the discretion to vary the metrics used each year and their relative weightings.
(E) Basic salaries
The basic salary for each Executive Director is targeted at the rates of salary for similar roles within a selected group of UK businesses of similar size 
with substantial overseas operations. In reviewing these salaries, the Committee is fully aware of the duty it has to shareholders to ensure that the right 
remuneration arrangements are in place. It has concluded that the increased international dimension of the enlarged Group, its near doubled size and 
the complexity this brings means that, subject to satisfactory individual performance, salary levels for Executive Directors and certain senior executives 
should move to the mid-market level over the next two years. Whilst the increased complexity of the business and responsibilities of the executives  
should be recognised, this should be aligned with the successful achievement of the integration of the new businesses. When determining the level  
of salary, the Committee takes into account market salary levels, the relative performance of the Group and of the individual Director, together with  
their experience in the particular job. The Committee also considers relevant information on the remuneration of other senior employees elsewhere in  
the Group and, where appropriate, communicates its views on the levels of such remuneration to the Group Chief Executive. During its deliberations, 
the Committee has regard to salary levels in other countries where this is relevant for any non-UK based senior executive. The table of emoluments  
of the Directors is set out on page 51. 
The current basic salaries of Miles Roberts and Steve Dryden are £570,000 and £357,000 respectively. These were ﬁxed following a review  
on 1 August 2011 and reﬂected the Committee’s views of the excellent achievement of each Executive Director as well as the Company’ s  
strong performance.  www.dssmith.uk.com

Remuneration Report continued
(F) Annual bonus
The Executive Directors participate in an annual bonus scheme which has been approved by the Committee. 
The annual bonus payable to Miles Roberts and Steve Dryden for the ﬁnancial year 2011/12 was 50% based on PBTA with the other 50% based 
on ROACE. The outcome of the results for the ﬁnancial year 2011/12 means that Miles Roberts earned a bonus of 100% of salary (£570,000) 
and Steve Dryden earned a bonus of 100% of salary (£357,000). Full bonus was achieved for both the PBTA and ROACE targets and this required 
the Executive Directors to exceed the top end of the range of ﬁnancial targets, a ﬁnancial performance signiﬁcantly ahead of what was anticipated  
at the start of the year and a very signiﬁcant improvement on the results for 2010/11.
The Committee has reviewed the maximum potential bonus for 2012/13 for the Executive Directors, which is being increased from 100% to 150% of 
basic annual salary, of which half will be deferred in shares. The Committee has set a range of demanding targets to reﬂect the Company’s announced 
strategic objectives of substantially improved earnings quality, particularly with regard to PBTA growth and improved ROACE. The growth targets set are 
signiﬁcantly higher than in the past reﬂecting the prospects for the business following the disposal and acquisition. The threshold above which payment 
starts to be made will be signiﬁcantly above 2011/12 actual performance and target performance will be signiﬁcantly ahead of the Group’s historic 
best performance. 
The annual bonus schemes are not contractual and bonuses under the schemes are not eligible for inclusion in the calculation of the participating 
executives’ pension scheme beneﬁts. No bonus payments are made to ‘bad leavers’ if an executive has left (or is under notice) at the time of payment 
and the deferred element will also lapse. Claw back provisions have been introduced into the annual bonus plan and the DSBP so that individuals 
are liable to repay/forfeit some or all of their bonus if there is a material misstatement of results or if there is serious misconduct.
(G) Performance Share Plan awards
The Company operates a PSP which was approved by shareholders in 2008. The individual grant limit under this Plan is 150% of basic salary  
per annum. In exceptional circumstances this may be increased to 200% of basic salary.
The 2011 award to Executive Directors was 150% of salary. Award levels for the other most senior executives were generally at the 100% of  
salary level. It is intended to award at the same levels in 2012. Following the acquisition of SCA Packaging, the Committee intends to review  
the membership of the PSP . 
Under the PSP , the Committee has the power to vary the metrics used each year and their relative weightings. It also has the power to review  
the speciﬁc targets for each award to ensure that they remain appropriate, but the new targets must be at least as challenging in the circumstances  
as the original targets were when they were set. 
It is proposed that for the 2012 awards the same balance of metrics as for the 2011 awards will be used. The TSR targets will remain the same  
and these, together with the revised EPS and ROACE targets, are set out in the table below:
Percentage vesting as a proportion 
Relative TSR
1
 
(50% of award)
Average EPS
2
(25% of award)
Average adjusted ROACE
3
(25% of award)
100% Upper quartile 23p 13.3%
Between 25% and 100% Between median and upper quartile Between 19.2p and 23p Between 11.6% and 13.3%
25% Median 19.2p 11.6%
1.  The Industrial Goods and Services Supersector within the FTSE 250 currently contains 45 companies and is considered to provide a better basis for comparison than the  
FTSE 250 as a whole. The Committee considers there are too few publicly quoted competitors to DS Smith to form a more bespoke group
2.  Average adjusted EPS as disclosed in the Annual Report
3.  Average adjusted Group operating proﬁt divided by the monthly average of capital employed in each year 
4.  The EPS and ROACE calculations will be based on the average ﬁgures for the forthcoming three ﬁnancial years, commencing with the ﬁnancial year starting immediately  
prior to the award. Targets may be adjusted by the Committee (for example, to reﬂect the impact of acquisitions and disposals) to ensure that the conditions achieve their  
original purpose
Each element operates independently and is capable of vesting regardless of the Company’s performance in respect of the other elements.  
The Committee considers that the targets are signiﬁcantly more demanding than those set in previous years and achieving signiﬁcant vesting  
will require performance which is better than anything achieved previously.
Claw back provisions have been introduced into the PSP and the SMP (described below) so that individuals are liable to repay/forfeit some  
or all of their awards if there is a material misstatement of results or if there is serious misconduct. Awards lapse in the case of ‘bad leavers’. DS Smith Plc

Governance
(H) Share Matching Plan
This Plan was approved by shareholders in 2011. The number of shares in a matching award will be based on the number of shares in the  
related DSBP . The maximum match for the Executive Directors will be 1.5:1 (on the ﬁrst 50% of deferred shares earned under the annual bonus) for  
a stretch level of performance and the maximum will be 1:1 for other participants. 25% of the maximum match (i.e. 0.375:1 for Executive Directors, 
0.25:1 for others) will be available for achieving a threshold level of performance. The performance measures applying to the Matching Shares  
are EPS and ROACE. The growth targets set are signiﬁcantly higher than in the past reﬂecting the prospects for the business following the previously 
described disposal and acquisition. The potential total value of matching awards will not increase as a consequence of the change to the quantum  
of the annual bonus plan.
Matching awards normally vest three years after grant, to the extent that the applicable performance conditions have been satisﬁed, the related  
DSBP award has not lapsed and provided the participant is still employed within the Group.
If a DSBP award lapses before the vesting of the related matching award then that matching award will lapse at the same time.
(I) Shareholding guidelines
Senior executives are expected to retain in shares half of the after-tax gains on the vesting of long-term incentive plan awards until they have built up  
a holding of 150% of base salary for the Group Chief Executive, 100% for the Group Finance Director and 75% for the rest of the Group Steering 
Team. There is also a 50% of base salary target for other senior executives. In addition, irrespective of the retention of shares, the Committee expects 
that these levels of share ownership should normally be achieved by 2015 or within four years of appointment if later. If these levels are not achieved, 
the Committee reserves the right not to make, or to scale back, further awards.
The interests of the Directors in the share capital of the Company and awards made under the PSP (last award 2011) and DSBP (last award 2011)  
are shown on pages 52 to 54.
Non-Executive Directors are expected to build up and then maintain a shareholding that is equivalent to 50% of their annual fee from the Company 
within two years of their date of appointment. All of the non-Executive Directors have met their minimum shareholding requirements. The Directors’ 
interests in shares can be seen on page 54.
(J) Pension and beneﬁts 
Beneﬁts in kind include provision of a company car, free fuel, permanent health insurance, life cover and private medical cover.
Miles Roberts receives an annual pension allowance of 30% of salary, in lieu of pension beneﬁts, plus death in service cover equal to four times  
basic salary. This payment is not considered to be salary for the purpose of calculating any bonus payment.
Steve Dryden participates in the Group’s Registered Deﬁned Contribution Scheme with death in service cover equal to four times basic salary.  
Members of this scheme are required to contribute a minimum of 3% of their basic salary to qualify for matching Company contributions, with  
higher levels of Company contributions payable (up to a maximum of 6%) if the members pay a higher contribution.
Steve Dryden has elected to pay contributions at a level that qualiﬁes for the maximum Company contribution. Steve Dryden also receives a  
cash supplement of £65,000 per annum. This payment is not pensionable and is not considered to be salary for the purpose of calculating any  
bonus payment.
(K) Service contracts and compensation
The Committee’s general policy is that the notice periods for Executive Directors appointed in future will not exceed one year, although on  
appointment it may be necessary in exceptional cases to offer a longer initial period which reduces to one year or less after a speciﬁc date.
The service contracts for Miles Roberts and Steve Dryden are dated 4 May 2010 and 1 April 2008 respectively. The service contracts may be 
terminated by 12 months’ notice by the Company, and by the Executive Director. The Company may terminate the contract with immediate effect by 
making a payment equal, in Miles Roberts’ case, to basic salary and pensions allowance for any unexpired period of notice and, in Steve Dryden’s 
case, to basic salary for any unexpired period of notice. The Company may make such payment in a lump sum or in monthly instalments from the 
termination date. These monthly payments will be reduced to take account of any alternative employment or consultancy income during the period 
over which such instalments are payable. www.dssmith.uk.com

Remuneration Report continued
(L) Policy on external appointments
Executive Directors are allowed to accept external appointments as a non-Executive Director of up to two other companies provided that these are  
not with competing companies and are not likely to lead to conﬂicts of interest. In normal circumstances, the Group Chief Executive may not accept 
more than one external appointment. Executive Directors are normally allowed to retain the fees paid from these appointments.
Miles Roberts has no external appointments. Steve Dryden is a non-Executive Director of Fiberweb plc and received fees of £38,000 for the year 
ended 30 April 2012 (2010/11: £38,000).
(M) Fees for non-Executive Directors and the Chairman
The remuneration for non-Executive Directors consists of annual fees for their services as members of the Board and, where relevant, for their work  
on selected Committees. Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment for a term of three years whereupon they are normally renewed but 
generally for no more than three terms in aggregate.

current aggregate limit is £750,000 and the aggregate amount paid in the ﬁnancial year to the non-Executive Directors was £414,742. Executive 
Directors are remunerated in respect of their executive appointments, under the terms of their service contracts, and receive no additional fees for

During the year the Company made a nine-for-eight rights issue and the Directors’ interests in the PSP have been adjusted accordingly.
The vesting of each award granted in 2009 is split 80% based on the Company’s TSR compared to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Industrial 
Goods and Services Supersector, and 20% based on the average ROACE. 25% of the TSR part vests if the Company is ranked median, rising  
until 100% vests if the Company is ranked in the upper quartile. The threshold (at which 25% vests) and maximum targets are 10.3% and  
11.5% for ROACE.
The vesting of each award granted in 2010 is split 50% based on the Company’s TSR compared to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Industrial 
Goods and Services Supersector, 25% based on average adjusted EPS and 25% based on the average ROACE. 25% of the TSR part vests if the 
Company is ranked median, rising until 100% vests if the Company is ranked in the upper quartile. The threshold (at which 25% vests) and maximum 
targets are 10.2p and 12.1p for EPS and 11.1% and 12.2% for ROACE. The EPS targets have been adjusted to reﬂect the increased shares  
in issue following the Rights Issue.
The vesting of each award granted in 2011 is split 50% based on the Company’s TSR compared to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Industrial 
Goods and Services Supersector, 25% based on average adjusted EPS and 25% based on the average ROACE. 25% of the TSR part vests if the 
Company is ranked median, rising until 100% vests if the Company is ranked in the upper quartile. The threshold (at which 25% vests) and maximum 
targets are 15.2p and 17.2p for EPS and 12.5% and 15.0% for ROACE. The EPS targets have been adjusted to reﬂect the increased shares  
in issue following the Rights Issue.
For all of the above awards the TSR calculations have been prepared on the standard Datastream basis for rights issues.

As disclosed previously, in order to facilitate the recruitment of Miles Roberts in unusual circumstances, and to ensure that his interests were directly  
and immediately aligned with those of the Company’s shareholders, the Company granted several conditional share awards as detailed below 
principally as compensation for lost entitlements to bonus, deferred share awards and long-term share incentive awards relating to his previous 
employer, McBride plc.
The awards made to him were as follows:
 Substitute Share Bonus Award as compensation for loss of his share bonus entitlement with his previous employer for the year 2009/10 as a result  
of his recruitment by the Company. The value of shares awarded reﬂects the proportion of the period of 12 calendar months beginning on 1 July 
2009 during which Miles Roberts was actively employed by McBride plc and was based on an assessment of the likely bonus which would have 
become payable to him had he remained employed by McBride plc;
 Replacement Deferred Shares Award. This award reﬂects the value of shares as at October 2009 which Miles Roberts forfeited as a result of his 
recruitment by the Company. As this award replaces an award with vesting dependent only on continued employment, the vesting of the 
Replacement Deferred Shares Award is not subject to performance conditions;
 The Replacement 2008 LTIP (subject to performance conditions as detailed below) was awarded in respect of an award made by his previous 
employer and forfeited as a result of his recruitment. The value of this award was based on the value of shares under award at October 2009. The 
award is subject to a performance condition measuring the TSR of McBride plc up to the date Miles Roberts joined the Company and thereafter the 
Company’s TSR against a comparator group of companies comprising the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) constituted as at the date of 
grant of the award over a three-year performance period commencing on 1 July 2008. The award vested in full and became exercisable on  
17 October 2011; and
 The Recruitment Award (subject to the 2010 PSP performance conditions as described in section (O) of this Report) was made to facilitate his 
recruitment and in lieu of the 2009 LTIP award which he would have been granted at McBride plc if he had remained in employment. The value  
of the award was based on the normal grant policy of 150% of his basic salary. 
During the year the Company made a nine-for-eight rights issue and the interests in the above plans have been adjusted accordingly.
(R) All-employee share schemes
In the UK a Sharesave Plan was introduced in January 2011. Executive Directors are eligible (along with all UK employees of the Company and 
participating subsidiaries of the Group) to participate in this Plan. Under this HMRC approved Plan options are granted to participants who have 
contracted to save up to £250 per month over a period of three years at a discount of up of 20% to the average closing mid-market price of a  
DS Smith Plc ordinary share on the three dealing days prior to invitation. Options cannot normally be exercised until a minimum of three years has 
elapsed. In common with most plans of this type there are no performance conditions applicable to options granted under this Plan. A similar Plan  
is planned to be rolled out to other regions.

(S) Directors’ interests in shares
The beneﬁcial interests of the Directors and their families in the ordinary shares of the Company were as shown below. Each Director took up his full 
entitlement under the terms of the Rights Issue:
30 April 2011 30 April 2012
Name of Director Beneﬁcial Non-beneﬁcial Beneﬁcial Non-beneﬁcial
Gareth Davis 40,000 – 85,000 –

Jonathan Nicholls 19,130 – 109,307 –
There have been no changes to the shareholdings set out above between the ﬁnancial year end and the date of the Report. It is currently intended 
that any ordinary shares required to fulﬁl entitlements under the PSP , the DSBP , the Substitute Share Bonus Award, the Replacement Deferred Share 
Award, the Replacement 2008 LTIP and the Recruitment Award will be provided by the David S Smith Group General Employee Beneﬁt Trust  
(the ‘Trust’), which buys shares on the market to do so. The Trust will also be used to fulﬁl certain entitlements under the Executive Share Option  
Scheme and the Sharesave Plan (along with new issue shares for other entitlements).

which is shown in the table above.
Cautionary statement
The purpose of the Annual Report is to provide 
information to the members of the Company,  
as a body, and no-one else. The Company, its 
Directors, employees, agents and advisers do 
not accept or assume responsibility to any other 
person to whom this document is shown or

date of preparation of this Annual Report and 
the Company undertakes no obligation to 
update these forward-looking statements. 
Nothing in this Annual Report should be 
construed as a proﬁt forecast.
Results for the year
The ﬁnancial results are shown on pages  
60 to 102.
Dividends
An interim dividend of 2.8 pence net per 
ordinary share was paid on 23 January 2012 
and the Directors recommend a ﬁnal dividend 
of 4.0 pence net per ordinary share which, 
together with the restated interim dividend of 
1.9 pence, increases the total dividend for the 
year, restated for the rights issue, at 5.9 pence 
(2010/11: 4.5 pence). Subject to approval  
of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting 
to be held on 4 September 2012, the ﬁnal 
dividend will be paid on 1 November 2012  
to shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 5 October 2012. The dividends 
per ordinary share stated above are those 
actually paid or to be paid. Historic dividends 
per share have been restated in the ﬁve year 
summary on page 107.
Share capital
Details of the issued share capital and the  
rights and restrictions attached to the shares, 
together with details of movements in the 
Company’s issued share capital during the  
year are shown in note 24. Following the  
Rights Issue announced on 17 January  
2012, 490,751,669 new ordinary shares  
of 10 pence each were issued at a price of 
£0.95 per share, resulting in net proceeds on 
issue of approximately £450.2 million. These 
new shares ranked equally in all respects with 
the existing ordinary shares. Pursuant to the 
Company’s employee share option schemes, 
643,178 ordinary shares of 10 pence each 
were issued during the year. No shares pursuant 
to the Company’s employee share option 
schemes were issued between 30 April 2012 
and 27 June 2012 inclusive. The Company 
has not utilised its authority to make market 
purchases of shares granted to it at the 2011 
Annual General Meeting but will be seeking  
to renew such authority at this year’s Meeting.
Acquisitions and divestments
SCA Packaging Kuban acquisition and disposal
The Group acquired 100% of the equity  
of SCA Packaging Kuban in July 2011  
for €5.0 million cash consideration and  
€1.5 million deferred consideration payable  
in December 2011, exclusively with a view  
to resale. The business was subsequently sold  
in December 2011 to the Group’s associate, 
Rubezhansk, for €6.5 million with nil proﬁt  
or loss on disposal.
SCA Packaging acquisition
On 17 January 2012 the Directors  
announced arrangements regarding the 
proposed acquisition of the packaging  
division of Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget 
SCA (publ) excluding the kraftliner assets  
(‘SCA Packaging’) for €1.7 billion on a cash, 
debt and, to the extent legally possible and 
commercially practicable, pension free basis 
(‘the Acquisition’). Net consideration will be 
approximately €1.6 billion after taking into 
account a pension price adjustment. In 
addition, there will also be customary 
post-completion adjustments. 
On 25 May 2012, the European  
Commission granted competition clearance  
for the Acquisition. The clearance requires  
DS Smith Plc to divest three sites after the 
Acquisition, currently representing approximately

1% of the enlarged Group proﬁt. Completion  
is expected to take place on 30 June 2012.
The Group incurred Acquisition related costs  
of £18.4 million on professional advisory fees 
and due diligence costs. These fees have been 
included in administrative expenses in the 
Group’s Consolidated Income Statement. Due 
to the nature of these costs, they have been 
reported as exceptional costs. 
Other acquisition
The Group made additional minor acquisitions 
of subsidiary businesses of £2.3 million, of 
which the majority relates to the acquisition  
of an additional 35% shareholding in Rapak 
AD, which brings the Group’s holding in  
Rapak AD at 30 April 2012 to 85%.
Disposal
On 30 December 2011 the Ofﬁce Products 
Wholesaling division was sold to Unipapel  
SA. Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling principally 
comprises Spicers Limited, Spicers (Ireland) 
Limited, Spicers France SAS, Spicers Belgium 
NV and Spicers Nederland BV . 
Discontinued operations relates to the disposal 
of the Ofﬁce Products Wholesaling division. 
The gain on sale of the discontinued operation 
was £67.1 million before tax (£58.0 million 
after tax).
Research and development
One of the key ways in which the Group seeks 
to differentiate itself is the use of sophisticated 
design tools to ensure that the best packaging 
designs are offered, in order to optimise 
packaging in our customers’ supply chain and 
bring reductions in carbon footprint. Research  
is conducted into design tool development, new 
types of corrugated packaging and innovative 
applications of it, such as R-Flute
®
, which is then 
rolled out through the organisation. The Group 
has a number of patented designs that are 
offered to customers across the business.
Directors
The biographies of the present Directors are  
on pages 34 and 35. All the Directors served 
throughout the year except as follows: Peter 
Johnson resigned as Chairman of the Board  
on 7 October 2011 and resigned as  
a Director on 4 January 2012. Gareth Davis  
was appointed as Deputy Chairman of the 
Board on 7 October 2011 and was conﬁrmed 
as Chairman on 4 January 2012. Other than 
as previously disclosed in this Report and in 
respect of existing service agreements, no 
Director, either during or at the end of the 
ﬁnancial year, has been materially interested  
in any signiﬁcant contract or arrangement  
in relation to the Group’s business.
The rules regarding the appointment and 
replacement of Directors are contained in the 
Company’s Articles of Association (‘Articles’), 
which may only be amended with shareholder 
approval in accordance with relevant 
legislation. The powers of the Directors are 
contained in the Company’s Articles. The 
Articles give the Directors powers, subject to 
relevant legislation, to authorise the issue and 
buy-back of the Company’s shares by the 
Company, subject to authority being given  
to the Directors by shareholders in general 
meeting. The Company annually seeks the 
authority of shareholders to authorise the 
exercise by Directors of these powers.
Re-election of Directors
The Articles require that all Directors who have 
either been appointed by the Board since the 
last Annual General Meeting, or for whom the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting is the  
third Annual General Meeting since they were 
elected or last re-elected by the Company in 
general meeting, retire from ofﬁce but they are 
eligible to submit themselves for re-election by 
the shareholders. However, in accordance with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, which 
recommends that all directors of FTSE 350 
companies be subject to annual re-election,  
the Board has resolved that all Directors will 
retire and stand for re-election at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting on 4 September 
2012 and annually thereafter.
Formal performance evaluation has conﬁrmed 
that the individual performance of the Directors 
offering themselves for re-election has been 
effective and they have demonstrated 
commitment to the role.
Directors’ interests in shares
The interests of the Directors and their immediate 
families in the ordinary shares of 10 pence 
each of the Company (in terms of shares, 
options and conditional share awards), were  
as shown in the tables on pages 52 to 54.
Directors’ indemnities
The Company has entered into qualifying 
third-party indemnity arrangements for the 
beneﬁt of its Directors in a form and scope 
which comply with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Group Company Secretary
Matt Jowett was appointed as Group  
General Counsel and Company Secretary  
of the Company on 1 July 2011 in place  
of Carolyn Cattermole, who stepped down  
on 30 June 2011.
Employee involvement and communications
The Group is committed to frequent and 
effective employee communications to promote 
the understanding and involvement of all its 
employees in the Group’s business objectives 
and performance. Communications and 
personnel policies have been developed  
to reﬂect the philosophy of operating 
management. Information is regularly 
communicated by brieﬁngs and newsletters.  
The Group operates a European Works 
Council, with representatives drawn from  
across the entire workforce in the EU countries  
in which the Group operates. Meetings are 
held to provide an exchange of information 
of transnational importance and to consult with 
employees on the strategy and direction of the 
Company. At each meeting, presentations are 
made on the Group’s business strategy, ﬁnancial 
results, health and safety and environmental 
performance. The Group also has a number  
of divisional national Consultation Forums which 
promote information exchange, consultation 
and representation between the Group and  
its employees. Business decisions concerning 
capital investment, employment and training 
take into account the Group’s public and local 
responsibilities. The Group supports the 
involvement of its operations in local  
community activities.

Governance
Equal opportunities
DS Smith is an equal opportunities employer. 
The Group is ﬁrmly committed to both the 
principle and realisation of equal opportunities 
and its policies are designed to provide such 
equality irrespective of age, disability, sex, 
sexual orientation, race, religion or nationality. 
Every possible step is taken to ensure that 
individuals are treated equally and fairly.  
The Group applies the same criteria to people 
with disabilities as it does to other employees. 
Where appropriate, facilities are adapted  
and retraining is offered to any employee who 
develops a disability during their employment.
Pension fund
The Group had, in the year under review, four 
UK pension arrangements: one deﬁned beneﬁt 
scheme (which closed to future service beneﬁts 
with effect from 30 April 2011 and all affected 
members of the deﬁned beneﬁt scheme were 
offered membership of the Group’s deﬁned 
contribution scheme for future service), one 
deﬁned contribution scheme, which was 
introduced for new employees joining the 
Group on or after 1 May 2005, one Group 
personal pension plan (which closed and  
all members were invited to transfer into  
the Group’s deﬁned contribution scheme  
on 1 March 2012) and a statutory  
Stakeholder arrangement.
The deﬁned beneﬁt scheme is a trust-based 
arrangement and the investments of the assets 
are managed on a discretionary basis by a 
number of Investment Managers, in either 
segregated or pooled arrangements.
The deﬁned contribution scheme is a trust-based 
arrangement offering members a range of 
investments. The trustees have selected Friends 
Life as the preferred provider. The Group 
personal pension plan was a contract-based 
arrangement offering members a range of 
investments with AVIVA and other external 
investment fund managers, and the Stakeholder 
arrangement is provided through Investment 
Solutions Limited. All such assets are held 
independently from the Group. The trustees  
of the deﬁned beneﬁt scheme and the deﬁned 
contribution scheme send an Annual Report  
to all members of the respective schemes. The 
Trustee Company of the deﬁned beneﬁt scheme 
has an Investment Sub-Committee, established 
in line with the recommended guidelines of the 
Myners Report. Peter Murray of AllenbridgeEpic 
Investment Advisers is appointed as an 
independent adviser to the Investment Sub-
Committee of the deﬁned beneﬁt scheme.
Health and safety
The Group recognises its responsibilities  
and continues to promote all aspects of health  
and safety in the interests of its employees  
and members of the public. A Health and 
Safety Policy Statement has been approved  
by the Board.
Signiﬁcant agreements
The Company is required to disclose any 
signiﬁcant agreements that take effect, alter  
or terminate on a change of control of the 
Company. The Company has a number  
of borrowing and related derivative facilities 
provided by various lenders. These facilities 
agreements generally include change of control 
provisions which, in the event of a change  
of ownership of the Company, could result in 
renegotiation or withdrawal of these facilities. 
These signiﬁcant agreements are as set out  
in note 18.
There are a number of other agreements that 
take effect, alter or terminate upon a change  
of control of the Company following a takeover 
bid, such as commercial contracts and joint 
venture agreements. None is considered to  
be signiﬁcant in terms of their potential impact 
on the business of the Group as a whole.
Payment to suppliers
Although the Company does not follow any 
formal code or standard on payment practice, 
the Company agrees terms and conditions  
in the UK with each supplier, which include 
terms of payment. The Company pays each 
supplier accordingly, subject to all the terms  
and conditions of the order being satisﬁed  
by such supplier. As DS Smith Plc is a holding 
company, whose principal business is to  
hold shares in Group companies, it has  
no trade creditors.
Charitable and political donations
The Group contributed £78,000  
(2010/11: £76,000) to charities.  
No payments were made to political  
parties. Donations were made by operating 
divisions to support their local communities. 
The Group also supported a number of  
other charities across a range of causes. 
During the year the DS Smith Charitable 
Foundation was established to provide  
support to charities in areas aligned with  
the activities and values of the business.
Annual General Meeting
The notice of the Annual General Meeting  
of the Company to be held on 4 September 
2012, together with explanations of the 
Resolutions to be proposed and details of the 
proxy appointment deadline and voting record 
date, appears at the back of this Annual Report.
Auditor
Each Director conﬁrms that:
(a)  so far as he is aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Company’s 
Auditor is unaware; and
(b)  he has taken all the steps he ought to have 
taken as a Director in order to make himself 
aware of any relevant audit information and 
to establish that the Company’s Auditor is 
aware of that information.
Resolutions to re-appoint Deloitte LLP as Auditor 
of the Company and to authorise the Directors 
to determine the remuneration will be put to the 
Annual General Meeting.

Directors’ Report continued
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing  
the Annual Report and the ﬁnancial statements 
in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare 
ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. 
Under that law the Directors are required  
to prepare the Group ﬁnancial statements  
in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by  
the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation and have chosen to prepare  
the parent Company ﬁnancial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the accounts unless they are satisﬁed 
that they give a true and fair view of the state  
of affairs of the Company and of the proﬁt  
or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing the parent company ﬁnancial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and  
then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and accounting estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent;
 state whether applicable UK Accounting 
Standards have been followed, subject  
to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the ﬁnancial statements;
 prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the  
going concern basis unless it is inappropriate 
to presume that the Company will continue  
in business.
In preparing the Group ﬁnancial statements, 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires 
that Directors:
 properly select and apply  
accounting policies;
 present information, including accounting 
policies, in a manner that provides  
relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
 provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the speciﬁc requirements  
in IFRSs is insufﬁcient to enable users  
to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions  
on the entity’s ﬁnancial position and  
ﬁnancial performance; and
 make an assessment of the Company’s  
ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are  
sufﬁcient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position  
of the Company and enable them to ensure  
that the ﬁnancial statements comply with  
the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of  
fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate  
and ﬁnancial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may  
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
We conﬁrm that to the best of our knowledge:
 the ﬁnancial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the relevant ﬁnancial 
reporting framework, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position 
and proﬁt or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
 the management report, which is 
incorporated into the Directors’ Report, 
includes a fair review of the development  
and performance of the business and  
the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties  
that they face.

Financial Statements 
Independent Auditor’s Report to the members  
of DS Smith Plc 
 
We have audited the financial statements of DS Smith Plc for the year  
ended 30 April 2012 which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, 
the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, 
the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Parent Company 
Balance Sheet, the related notes 1 to 31 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements and the related notes 1 to 11 to the Parent Company Balance 
Sheet. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements is applicable law  
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied  
in the preparation of the parent Company financial statements is applicable 
law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice). 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.  
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for  
the opinions we have formed. 
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the 
Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to 
audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures  
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent Company’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the  
financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware  
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion: 
 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the  
Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 30 April 2012  
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
 the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
 the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared  
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice; and 
 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB 
As explained in note 1(a) to the Group financial statements, the Group  
in addition to complying with its legal obligation to apply IFRSs as adopted  
by the European Union, has also applied IFRSs as issued by the International 
Standards Board (IASB).

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
1. Significant accounting policies 
(a) Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved  
by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the EU (‘adopted IFRSs’), and have also applied 
IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The 
Company has elected to prepare its parent Company financial statements  
in accordance with UK GAAP; these are presented on pages 102 to 106. 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical  
cost basis except that assets and liabilities of certain financial instruments,  
defined benefit pension plans and share-based payments are stated at their 
fair value. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going 
concern basis as set out on page 42 of the Corporate Governance section. 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management  
to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect whether and how 
policies are applied and affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expenses. Judgements made by management in the application 
of adopted IFRSs that have a significant effect on the financial statements and 
estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are 
discussed in accounting policy (v). 
No changes have been made to the Group’s accounting policies in the  
year ended 30 April 2012. The accounting policies set out below have been 
applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial 
statements. The accounting policies have been applied consistently by all 
Group entities. 
(b) Basis of consolidation 
(i) Subsidiaries 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated 
financial statements from the date that control commences until the date  
that control ceases. Control is achieved where the Company has the power 
to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as  
to obtain benefits from its activities. The results of subsidiaries acquired  
or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income 
statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date  
of disposal, as appropriate. Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains 
and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions  
are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. 
(ii) Associates 
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence  
and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. Significant 
influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy 
decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies. 
The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the total 
recognised gains and losses of associates on an equity accounted basis,  
from the date that significant influence commences until the date that 
significant influence ceases.  
(iii) Non-controlling interests 
Non-controlling interests are shown as a component of equity in the  
statement of financial position net of the value of options over interests  
held by minorities in the Group’s subsidiaries. 
 
(c) Revenue 
Revenue comprises the fair value of the sale of goods and services, net of 
value added tax, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the 
Group. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement 
when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred  
to the buyer. 
(d) Government grants 
(i) Emission quotas 
The Group participates in Phase II of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. 
Emission quotas received in a period are initially recognised at a nominal 
value of nil. As a result, no asset or liability is recognised on the statement  
of financial position at initial recognition. A provision is recognised if there  
is any anticipated shortfall in the level of quotas received or purchased when 
compared with actual emissions in any given period, measured at the market 
price of such quotas at the balance sheet date. Excess emission quotas 
acquired as part of a business combination are recognised as an intangible 
asset at their fair value on the date of acquisition. 
(ii) Other 
Other government grants are recognised in the statement of financial position 
initially as deferred income when there is reasonable assurance that they will 
be received and that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to 
them. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are offset 
against the expenses in the same periods in which the expenses are incurred.  
(e) Dividends 
Dividends attributable to the equity holders of the Company paid during  
the year are recognised directly in equity.  
(f) Foreign currency translation 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the foreign 
exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets  
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet  
date are translated into sterling at the foreign exchange rates ruling at that 
date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation of monetary assets  
and liabilities are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets  
and liabilities that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency  
are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. 
The assets and liabilities of all the Group entities that have a functional 
currency other than sterling are translated at the closing exchange rate  
at the date of the statement of financial position. Income and expenses for  
each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless  
this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of  
the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and 
expenses are translated at the date of the transactions).  
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the  
net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings, and other financial 
instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in the 
translation reserve. On the disposal of foreign currency entities, the cumulative 
exchange difference recorded in the translation reserve is taken to the income 
statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.  www.dssmith.uk.com

Financial Statements 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 
 
1. Significant accounting policies continued 
(g) Intangible assets 
(i) Goodwill 
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition 
method. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and 
joint ventures represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition  
and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.  
Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. The useful  
life of goodwill is considered to be indefinite. Goodwill is allocated to  
cash-generating units and is tested annually for impairment. 
(ii) Research and development 
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining 
new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised  
in the income statement as an expense as incurred. 
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are  
applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially 
improved products and processes, is capitalised if the product or process is 
technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources 
to complete development. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost  
of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.  
Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as  
an expense as incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is stated  
at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
(iii) Computer software 
Computer software that is integral to a related item of hardware is included 
within tangible fixed assets. All other computer software is treated as an 
intangible asset. 
(iv) Intellectual property 
Intellectual property is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation  
and impairment losses. 
(v) Other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated  
at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.  
(vi) Amortisation 
Amortisation of intangible assets (excluding goodwill) is charged to  
the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives  
of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. Intangible assets (other 
than goodwill) are amortised from the date they are available for use.  
The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
Intellectual property Up to 20 years
Customer relationships 10 years
Computer software 3 – 5 years
Goodwill is systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date, 
and when there is an indication of impairment. 
(h) Property, plant and equipment and other investments 
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses.  
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over 
the estimated useful lives of each item of property, plant and equipment, and 
major components that are accounted for separately (or in the case of leased 
assets, the lease period, if shorter). Land is not depreciated. 
The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
Freehold and long leasehold properties 10 – 50 years
Plant and equipment, fixtures and fittings  
(including IT hardware) 3 – 20 years
Motor vehicles 3 – 5 years
Other investments consist of available for sale investments in unquoted  
equity and debt securities and are carried at cost, less any impairment. 
(i) Impairment 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets, including tangible and  
intangible non-current assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets 
are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable 
amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying  
amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable  
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. 
(i) Calculation of recoverable amount 
The recoverable amount of the Group’s assets is calculated as the value in 
use, being the present value of expected future cash flows, using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects the current assessment of the time value of money  
or the net selling price, if greater. For an asset that does not generate largely 
independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the  
cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
(ii) Reversals of impairment 
Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed. In respect of  
other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the 
estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is 
reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed 
the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation  
or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. 
(j) Derivative financial instruments  
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate, 
currency and commodity swaps, to manage interest rate, currency and 
commodity risks associated with the Group’s underlying business activities 
and the financing of these activities. The Group has a policy not to, and  
does not undertake any speculative activity in these instruments.  
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair  
value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and  
are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as  
assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair  
value is negative. 
Derivative financial instruments are accounted for as hedges when  
designated as hedges at the inception of the contract and when the  
financial instruments provide an effective hedge of the underlying risk.  
Any gains or losses arising from the hedging instruments are offset against  
the hedged items.   DS Smith Plc

For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as: 
 fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair  
value of a recognised asset or liability; 
 cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows  
that is attributable to a particular risk associated with either a statement  
of financial position item or a highly probable forecast transaction; or 
 hedges of the net investment in a foreign entity. 
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of all other 
derivatives are taken to the income statement. These may arise from 
derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied because they  
are not effective as hedging instruments. 
The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluing derivatives 
designated as hedging instruments depends on the nature of the  
hedging relationship as follows: 
Fair value hedges: the carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted  
for gains or losses attributable to the risk being hedged; the derivative is 
remeasured at fair value and gains and losses from both are taken to the 
income statement. The Group discontinues fair value hedge accounting if  
the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge 
no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the Group revokes  
the designation. 
Cash flow hedges: the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is 
recognised in the income statement. Amounts taken to equity are transferred  
to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, 
such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. Where the hedged item  
is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are 
transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.  
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised  
without replacement or roll-over, the hedged transaction ceases to be highly 
probable, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously 
recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs  
and are transferred to the income statement or to the initial carrying amount  
of a non-financial asset liability as above. If a forecast transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred  
to the income statement. 
Hedges of net investment in a foreign entity: the effective portion of the  
gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while 
the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement. Amounts taken to 
equity are transferred to the income statement when the foreign entity is sold. 
The net present value of the expected future payments under options over 
interests held by minorities in the Group’s subsidiaries are shown as a 
financial liability. At the end of each period, the valuation of the liability is 
reassessed with any changes recognised in the profit or loss for the period. 
(k) Treasury shares 
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of  
the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised  
as a change in equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares 
and presented as a deduction from total equity. 
(l) Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are stated at their cost less impairment provisions. 
(m) Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net 
realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of 
business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.  
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in first-out principle and includes 
expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their 
existing location and condition. In the case of manufactured inventories and 
work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based  
on normal operating capacity. 
(n) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.  
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part  
of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash  
and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows. 
(o) Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, less attributable transaction 
costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated 
at amortised cost with borrowing costs being accounted for on an accruals 
basis in the income statement using the effective interest method.  
At the reporting date, accrued interest is recorded separately from the 
associated borrowings within current liabilities. 
(p) Employee benefits 
(i) Defined contribution schemes 
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an 
employee benefit expense within personnel expenses in the income statement, 
as incurred. 
(ii) Defined benefit schemes 
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension schemes  
is calculated separately for each scheme by estimating the amount of future 
benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current 
and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to its present value amount and 
recognised in the income statement as personnel expense; a corresponding 
liability for all future benefits is established on the statement of financial 
position and the fair value of any schemes’ assets is deducted.  
The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit rated  
bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the duration of the schemes’ 
obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the 
projected unit method. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately 
in the statement of comprehensive income. 
(iii) Share-based payment transactions 
The Group operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.  
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant  
of the options is recognised as personnel expense, with a corresponding 
increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally 
become entitled to the awards. The fair value of the options granted is 
measured using a stochastic model, taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the options were granted. The total amount to be 
expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair  
value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market  
vesting conditions.  
For options remaining outstanding under the Executive Share Option  
Scheme (1999), which ceased to be operated from September 2008  
(see note 24), non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions 
about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.  
At each reporting date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of  
options that are expected to become exercisable. It recognises the impact  
of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and  
a corresponding adjustment to equity.  www.dssmith.uk.com

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 
 
1. Significant accounting policies continued 
(q) Provisions 
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the 
Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past 
event, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation, 
and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to 
settle the obligation and are discounted to present value where the effect  
is material. 
(r) Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are stated at their cost. 
(s) Leases 
(i) Finance leases 
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at the 
inception of the lease at the lower of their fair value and the present value of 
the minimum lease payments. Depreciation on leased assets is charged to the 
Consolidated Income Statement on the same basis as owned assets. Leasing 
payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements and the 
interest is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement as it is incurred. 
(ii) Operating leases 
Operating lease rentals are charged to the Consolidated Income  
Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any premium or 
discount on the acquisition of a lease is spread over the life of the lease  
on a straight-line basis. 
(t) Taxation 
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred 
tax. Income tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement except  
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly to equity, in which  
case it is recognised in equity. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, 
using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to  
tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided for using the balance sheet liability method, 
providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for 
taxation purposes.  
The tax effect of certain temporary differences is not recognised,  
principally with respect to goodwill; temporary differences arising on the 
initial recognition of assets or liabilities (other than those arising in a business 
combination or in a manner that initially impacted accounting or taxable 
profit); and temporary differences relating to investment in subsidiaries and 
associates to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable 
future and the Group is able to control the reversal of such temporary 
differences. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected 
manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that 
future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable  
that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
(u) Assets held for sale  
Non-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities,  
that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than  
through continuing use, are classified as held for sale. Immediately before 
classification as held for sale, the assets, or components of a disposal  
group, are remeasured in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. 
Thereafter, generally the assets, or disposal group, are measured at the  
lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. 
Any impairment loss on a disposal group is first allocated to goodwill,  
and then to remaining assets and liabilities on pro rata basis, except that  
no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets and 
employee benefit assets, which continue to be measured in accordance with 
the Group’s accounting policies. Impairment losses on initial classification  
as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are 
recognised in profit or loss. Gains are not recognised in excess of any 
cumulative impairment loss. 
(v) Critical accounting policies  
The application of the Group’s accounting policies requires management  
to make estimates and assumptions; these estimates and assumptions affect 
the reported assets and liabilities and financial results of the Group. Actual 
outcomes could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. 
The Group’s accounting policies that are most critical to an understanding  
of the results and position of the Group, and the judgements involved in  
their application, are as follows: 
(i) Impairments 
When applying IAS 36, ‘Impairment of Assets’, the Group compares  
the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with the higher  
of their net realisable value and value in use to determine whether  
an impairment exists. 
Value in use is calculated by discounting the cash flows expected to  
be generated by the asset/group of assets being tested for evidence of 
impairment. The use of different estimates, assumptions and judgements,  
in particular those involved in (a) determining a value based on our current 
expectations of future conditions and the associated cash flows from the 
Group’s operations, (b) our determination of the level at which groups of 
assets can be reasonably tested for impairment separately from other parts  
of the business and (c) our treatment of centrally held assets, could each  
result in materially different carrying values of assets and assessments of 
impairment. See note 10 for additional information. 
(ii) Pensions and other post-retirement benefits 
IAS 19, ‘Employee Benefits’, requires the Group to make assumptions 
including, but not limited to, future asset returns, rates of inflation, discount 
rates and life expectancies. The use of different assumptions, in any of the 
above calculations, could have a material effect on the accounting values of 
the relevant statement of financial position assets and liabilities which could 
also result in a change to the cost of such liabilities as recognised in profit  
or loss over time. These assumptions are subject to periodic review. See  
note 23 for additional information. 
(iii) Accounting for carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions 
There are currently no accounting standards that specifically address 
accounting for emission allowances. The Group has applied a ‘net liability’ 
approach. Under a ‘net liability’ approach, no assets or government grants 
are recognised when allowances are initially received. This is because they 
are ascribed a nominal value of nil. As allowances granted to the Group  
are used to offset the liability from CO2 emissions, no accounting entries  
are required so long as the related emissions generated are within the 
allowance received from the government. If such emissions are in excess  
of the allowance received (known as a shortfall position) a provision is  
made at the current market price for carbon credits. In the case where 
emission quotas are acquired through an acquisition, any surplus emission 
quotas are fair valued in accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’.  DS Smith Plc

(w) IFRS standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective 
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) have issued new standards  
and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements.  
IAS 19 (revised 2011) ‘Employee Benefits’ is considered to be the most significant of the upcoming changes which is effective for the year ended  
30 April 2014 and requires the replacement of the expected rate of return on assets and interest charge on pension scheme liabilities with a net financing 
cost based on the discount rate. The Group does not anticipate that the adoption of the remaining standards and interpretations that are effective for the  
year ending 30 April 2014 will have a material effect on its financial statements on initial adoption. None of these standards have currently been endorsed 
by the EU.

2. Segment reporting 
Operating segments 
IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, requires operating segments to be identified on the same basis as is used internally for the review of performance and allocation 
of resources by the Group Chief Executive (who is the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined by IFRS 8). Further details of these business segments are 
given in the Business Review. Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. 
Central administration costs are allocated to the individual segments on a consistent basis year on year. Assets and liabilities have been analysed by segment 
at a capital employed level, which excludes items of a financing nature, taxation balances, post-retirement benefit liabilities and non-current asset investments. 
Debt and associated interest is managed at a Group level and therefore has not been allocated across the business areas. The Office Products and 
Wholesaling division has been classified as a discontinued operation and was sold during the year ended 30 April 2012 (note 29).

SCA Packaging acquisition costs of £18.4m relate to the planned acquisition of the packaging division of Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget SCA and  
consist of professional advisory fees, due diligence costs and other acquisition related costs. Due to the nature of these costs, they have been reported  
as exceptional costs. 
The UK Packaging restructuring costs of £30.6m primarily relate to the restructuring of the UK Packaging business, and the exit costs from the closure and  
sale of two paper mills. Continental European Corrugated Packaging costs of £6.3m relate to restructuring in France and Plastic Packaging costs of £5.4m 
primarily relate to restructuring in the UK and Germany.  
Total intangible asset, tangible fixed asset and inventory impairment charges are £36.5m and primarily relate to property, plant and equipment within the  
UK, primarily relating to paper assets.  
The exceptional gain of £10.0m relates to the Group’s associate investment in OJSC Rubezhansk Paper and Packaging Mill (Rubezhansk). In 2008/09 an 
exceptional loss of £18.1m was incurred when the carrying value of the Group’s investment was written down to £nil due to the uncertainty in the financial 
position of the business, following a breach of its banking covenants caused by exchange rate movements. In November 2011, revised facilities were  
agreed with the banks and hence it was considered appropriate to re-instate the investment in associate at fair value. 
2010/11 
The UK Packaging restructuring costs of £0.9m relate to two small packaging plants in the UK and Plastic Packaging costs of £0.5m relate to restructuring  
in France. Following the acquisition of Otor in September 2010, a restructuring programme was put in place in France to facilitate Otor’s integration with  
the Group. This resulted in restructuring costs of £2.3m within Continental European Corrugated Packaging. 
The acquisition related costs relate to the acquisition of Otor. The pension curtailment gain primarily relates to the closure of the UK Group Scheme to  
future accrual and is described in note 23. Impairment charges relate to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment within the UK Packaging and  
the Plastic Packaging segments. Disposal costs predominantly relate to the disposal of Çopikas, the Group’s subsidiary in Turkey, and a small packaging 
business in the UK.

The Emergency Budget on 22 June 2010 announced that the UK current tax rate would reduce from 28% to 24% over a period of four years from 2011.  
In the 2012 Budget, a reduction from 1 April 2012 to 24%, a reduction from 1 April 2013 to 23% and further changes to reduce the rate to 22% by  
April 2014 were announced. The rate reduction to 24% was substantively enacted on 26 March 2012 and was effective from 1 April 2012. Accordingly 
the rate applying to UK assets and liabilities has also been reduced from 26% to 24%, creating a rate adjustment, which is partly reflected in the 
Consolidated Income Statement, and partly in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or Equity. 
The rate reduction from 24% to 22% has not yet been substantively enacted; had it been, the effect would have been to reduce the net deferred tax asset  
in the UK by £2.2m, of which it is estimated that £3.0m would have been credited to the Consolidated Income Statement and £5.2m would have been 
charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

UK Packaging 130.9 137.3
Continental European Corrugated Packaging 102.6 110.2
Plastic Packaging 38.1 40.3
 271.6 287.8
Segments with no CGUs containing individually significant goodwill – 7.3
Total goodwill 271.6 295.1
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable amounts  
of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.  
The key assumptions in the value in use calculation were: 
 cash forecasts derived from the latest budgets and forecasts for the two years ending 30 April 2014 as approved by the Directors. Cash flows beyond  
the forecast period were extrapolated assuming a growth rate of 3% (2010/11: 3%); and 
 the pre-tax discount rate for the Group is 10.1% (2010/11: 11.0%). The Group believes that the risk profiles across the significant markets in which  
it operates are not significantly different, hence the same discount rate is applied across all CGUs (except for the Group’s investment in associate). 
The value in use is based upon anticipated discounted future cash flows. The Directors believe the assumptions used are appropriate, but in addition have 
conducted sensitivity analysis to determine the changes in assumptions that would result. Based on this analysis the Directors believe that no reasonably 
possible change in any of the key assumptions detailed above would cause the carrying value of CGUs to exceed their recoverable amounts. Therefore  
at 30 April 2012 no impairment charge is required against the carrying value of goodwill above those specific impairments detailed above.

OJSC Rubezhansk Paper and  
Packaging Mill (Rubezhansk) Manufacturer of paper and packaging Ukraine 31 December  49.6% 49.6%
Rubezhansk is accounted for using the equity method within these financial statements. 
In 2008/09, the Group fully impaired the carrying value of its investment in Rubezhansk due to a breach in Rubezhansk’s banking covenants caused by 
foreign exchange losses following the significant decline in the Ukrainian Hryvnia against the US dollar. 
Whilst the uncertainty of the financial position continued at Rubezhansk, the Group did not recognised any profits in respect of its investment in the associate.  
In November 2011, revised facilities were agreed with the banks and hence it was considered appropriate to re-instate the investment in associate in the 
Group balance sheet at fair value of £10.0m and resume recognition of the Group’s share of profit or loss from that date. 
The Group accounts for its investment in Rubezhansk as an associate because the Group has the ability to exercise significant influence over the investment 
due to the Group’s 49.6% equity holding. The Group does not have control over Rubezhansk under IAS 27 ’Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’ 
because it does not, by virtue of its shareholding or other agreement, have more than half the voting rights.

At 30 April 2012, 73% (30 April 2011: 79%) of the Group’s interest-bearing loans and borrowings, after taking into account the effect of cross-currency 
swaps, were denominated in euros in order to hedge the underlying assets of the Group’s relevant continental European operations. Interest rates on floating-
rate borrowings are based on London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) or base rates. 
Bank loan facilities 
In August 2010, the Group entered into a term loan facility of €81m with three banks, which would have matured on 29 August 2013. This facility was 
repaid in full in September 2011. 
In August 2008, the Group entered into a syndicated revolving credit facility of £287.5m, which would have expired on 29 August 2013. In September 
2011 this facility was increased to £610.0m with a new expiry date of 23 September 2016. Advances drawn down under the facility bear interest at  
a margin over LIBOR or EURIBOR. 
Note purchase agreements 
In November 2002, the Group entered into a note purchase agreement with a number of institutions that purchased US$105m of DS Smith Plc’s  
6.24% senior notes and £25m of 6.85% senior notes, which will mature on 14 November 2012. The Group entered into a swap transaction with  
a bank counterparty under which it made a payment of US$80m in return for €81.6m. The swap counterparty also agreed to pay fixed-rate dollar interest  
of 6.24% per annum in exchange for floating euro rate interest at rates linked to EURIBOR. In addition, swap counterparties also agreed to pay fixed-rate 
dollar interest of 6.24% per annum on a principal amount of US$25m in exchange for floating dollar interest linked to dollar LIBOR and fixed-rate sterling 
interest of 6.85% per annum on a principal of £25m in exchange for floating sterling interest linked to sterling LIBOR. 
In August 2004, the Group entered into a further note purchase agreement with a number of institutions that purchased US$105m of DS Smith Plc’s  
5.66% senior notes and US$95m of 5.80% senior notes, which will mature on 25 August 2014 and 25 August 2016, respectively. The Group entered  
into swap transactions with a bank counterparty under which it made payments of US$105m and US$20m in return for €86.5m and €16.5m, respectively, 
and a payment of US$75m in return for £40.8m. The swap counterparty agreed to pay fixed-rate dollar interest of 5.66% per annum and 5.80% per annum, 
respectively, in exchange for floating euro rate interest at rates linked to EURIBOR and fixed-rate dollar interest of 5.80% per annum in exchange for fixed-rate 
sterling interest at rates of 6.21% per annum. 
In August 2010, the Group issued €59m of 4.395% senior notes, which will mature on 13 August 2018 and €59m of 4.825% senior notes which will 
mature on 11 August 2020.

19. Financial instruments 
The Group’s activities expose the Group to a number of key risks which have the potential to affect its ability to achieve its business objectives. A summary  
of the Group’s key financial risks and the policies and objectives in place to manage these risks is set out in the Financial Review and Risk Management 
sections of the Business Review. 
The derivative financial instruments set out in this note have been entered into to help achieve the Group’s risk management objectives.  
The Group’s treasury policy is not to engage in speculative transactions. 
(a) Carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and liabilities

The fair value is the amount for which an asset or liability could be exchanged or settled on an arm’s-length basis. For financial instruments carried at fair 
value, market prices or rates are used to determine fair value where an active market exists. The Group uses forward prices for valuing forward foreign 
exchange and commodity contracts and uses valuation models with present value calculations based on market yield curves to value note purchase 
agreements, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps. All derivative financial assets and liabilities are shown at fair value on the Statement of Financial 
Position. Under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ hedge accounting rules, only portions of the note purchase agreements which 
form part of an effective fair value hedge are carried at fair value in the Statement of Financial Position. The fair value of financial assets and liabilities which 
bear floating rates of interest is estimated to be equivalent to book value. 
IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ requires the classification of fair value measurements using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects  
the significance of the inputs used in making the assessments: 
 Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; 
 Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly  
(i.e. derived from prices); and 
 Level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). 
All of the Group’s financial instruments are Level 2 financial instruments. The Group does not hold any Level 1 or Level 3 financial instruments.

(b) Derivative financial instruments 
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate, currency and commodity swaps, to manage interest rate, currency and commodity 
risks associated with the Group’s underlying business activities and the financing of these activities. All derivatives have been designated as effective hedging 
instruments and are carried at their fair value.

(ii) Fair value hedges 
At 30 April 2012, the Group held interest rate and currency swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate and currency risk on fixed rate  
debt payable by the Group. The receive leg of the swap contracts is largely identical in all critical aspects to the terms of the underlying debt and thus the 
hedging is highly effective. The pre-tax loss on the hedging derivative instruments taken to the income statement in the year was £0.8m (2010/11: loss  
of £13.5m) offset by a pre-tax gain on the fair value of the debt of £0.6m (2010/11: gain of £12.6m). 
(iii) Hedges of net investments in foreign operations 
The Group holds currency swap contracts as hedges of long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries. The pre-tax gain on the hedges recognised in equity in 
the year was £14.8m (2010/11: loss of £4.7m). The gain is matched by a similar loss in equity on the retranslation of the hedged foreign subsidiary’s net 
assets. During the year, hedge ineffectiveness arising from hedges of net investments resulted in a loss of £0.1m recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement (2010/11: loss of £0.3m).   www.dssmith.uk.com

(d) Risk identification and risk management 
(i) Capital risk 
The Group funds its operations from the following sources of cash: operating cash flow, borrowings, shareholders’ equity and disposals of peripheral 
businesses, where appropriate. The Group’s objective is to achieve a capital structure that results in an appropriate cost of capital whilst providing flexibility  
in immediate and medium-term funding so as to accommodate material investments or acquisitions. The Group also aims to maintain a strong statement of 
financial position and to provide continuity of financing by having a range of maturities and borrowings from a variety of sources. 
The Group’s overall treasury objectives are to ensure sufficient funds are available to carry out its strategy and to manage financial risks. The Group’s treasury 
strategy is controlled through the Treasury Committee, which meets regularly and includes the Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director, the Group 
Financial Controller, the Group Treasurer and the Group Tax Manager. The Group Treasury Function operates in accordance with policies and procedures 
approved by the Board and controlled by the Group Treasurer. The function arranges funding for the Group, provides a service to operations and implements 
strategies for interest rate, foreign exchange rate and energy exposure management. 
(ii) Market risk 
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument fluctuate because of a change in market prices. The Group is exposed  
to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. 
Interest rate risk 
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. The risk is managed by the  
Group maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings and by the use of interest rate swap contracts. Hedging activities  
are evaluated regularly to align with expectations of changes in interest rates; ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the 
statement of financial position or protecting interest rate expense through interest rate cycles. The Group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets  
and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note. 
At 30 April 2012, 63% (30 April 2011: 58%) of the Group’s interest-bearing loans and borrowings were fixed. The sensitivity analysis below shows  
the impact on profit and total equity of a 100 basis points rise in market interest rates (representing management’s assessment of the reasonably possible 
change in interest rates) in all currencies in which the Group had variable rate borrowings at 30 April. 
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year, the interest rates on all external interest-bearing loans and cash deposits have been increased  
by 100 basis points, and the resulting increase in the net interest charge has been adjusted for the effect of the Group’s interest rate derivatives. The effect  
on equity includes the above impact on the income statement and the impact of a 100 basis points increase in interest rates on the market values of the 
Group’s interest rate derivatives.  
The results are presented before non-controlling interests and tax.

Under interest rate swap contracts the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest rate amounts calculated on agreed 
notional principal amounts. At 30 April 2012, losses of £0.1m (30 April 2011: losses of £0.9m) (net of tax) are deferred in equity in respect of cash flow 
hedges of interest rate risk. This will be recycled to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item also affects the income statement, which  
will occur over time to 2016. 
Foreign exchange risk 
Foreign exchange risk on investments 
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from net investments in Group entities, the functional currencies of which differ from the Group’s 
presentational currency. The Group hedges this exposure through borrowings denominated in foreign currencies and through cross-currency swaps. Gains  
and losses for hedges of net investments are recognised in reserves. 
Foreign exchange risk on borrowings 
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk on borrowings denominated in foreign currencies. The Group hedges this exposure through cross-currency 
swaps designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges.  
Foreign exchange risk on transactions 
Foreign currency transaction risk arises where a business unit makes product sales and material purchases in a currency other than its functional currency.  
Part of this risk is hedged using foreign exchange contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges.  
At 30 April 2012, losses of £0.3m (30 April 2011: losses of £0.6m) (net of tax) are deferred in equity in respect of cash flow hedges. This will be recycled 
to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item also affects the income statement, which occurs within two years.   DS Smith Plc

The following sensitivity analysis shows the impact on the Group’s results of a 10% change in the year-end exchange rate of sterling against all other 
currencies. 10% represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The analysis is only on financial 
instruments denominated in a foreign currency and excludes the impact of financial instruments designated as net investment hedges. Loans that are treated  
as net investment hedges are not recorded within the impact on the Group’s profit as the impact of foreign exchange movements on these is offset by equal 
and opposite movements in the foreign assets that the instruments hedge. 
The results are presented before non-controlling interests and tax.

Commodity risk 
The Group’s main commodity exposures are to changes in UK gas and UK electricity prices. Part of this commodity price risk is managed by a combination  
of physical supply agreements and derivative instruments. At 30 April 2012, losses of £1.5m (30 April 2011: gains of £4.5m) (net of tax) are deferred  
in equity in respect of cash flow hedges in accordance with IAS 39. This will be recycled to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item  
also affects the income statement, which will occur within two years.  
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase in these prices, which is management’s assessment of the reasonably possible 
approximation of how much markets can move on average, over any given year. In some years prices will be less volatile and in others they may be  
more volatile. A decrease of 10% in these prices would produce an opposite effect on equity. As all of the Group’s commodity financial instruments  
achieve hedge accounting under IAS 39, there is no impact on profit for either year. 
The results are presented before non-controlling interests and tax.

(iii) Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to perform or fail to pay amounts due, causing financial loss to the Group. 
In the current economic environment, the Group has placed increased emphasis on the management of credit risk. The carrying amount of financial assets  
at 30 April 2012 was £969.4m (30 April 2011: £590.7m) and is analysed in note 19(a). This represents the maximum credit exposure.  
The majority of the Group’s trade receivables are due for maturity within 90 days. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited 
due to the Group’s customer base being large and diverse. Management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal 
provision for bad and doubtful debts (note 14).

Credit risk on financial instruments held with financial institutions is assessed through reference to the long-term credit ratings assigned to that counterparty  
by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s.  
(iv) Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group, although solvent, will have difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities as they  
fall due. 
The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining adequate financial resources and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and  
by matching these to the maturity profile of financial assets and liabilities.

The Group has total unrecognised deferred tax assets relating to tax losses of £4.2m (30 April 2011 £4.4m). These losses have no time restriction over when 
they can be utilised. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be 
available against which the Group can utilise these benefits.

 except where the deferred tax liability arises on goodwill; 
 except on initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither  
the accounting profit nor the taxable profit or loss; and 
 in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of  
the temporary differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The provision for employee benefits mainly represents that for long-service awards. The restructuring provision includes amounts associated with the closures 
and restructuring costs described in note 4. Other provisions mainly relate to an acquired onerous service contract and to provisions for vacant leaseholds  
and various legal claims. The timing of the utilisation of these provisions is uncertain, except where the associated costs are contractual, in which case the 
provision is utilised over the time period specified in the contract.

Ordinary equity shares of 10 pence each:   
Issued, allotted, called up and fully paid 927.0 435.6 92.7 43.6
On 22 February 2012 the Company issued 490,751,669 new ordinary shares in respect of a 9 for 8 rights issue at a price of 95 pence per share.  
The gross proceeds of the rights issue were £466.2m. The related transaction costs amounting to £16.9m have been netted against proceeds. 
Of the remainder issued, the majority relates to a placing in respect of employee share options of 643,178 ordinary shares of 10 pence. 
The number of shares in issue up to and including 2011 has been revised to reflect the bonus element of the rights issue as required by IAS 33  
‘Earnings Per Share’ which has restated the comparative earnings per share and dividend per share. 
The net movement in share capital and share premium is disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. 
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at meetings of  
the Company. In respect of the Company’s shares that are held by the Group (see below), all rights are suspended until those shares are reissued.  
The concept of authorised share capital was abolished in October 2009 pursuant to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; therefore authorised  
share capital has not been presented at 30 April 2012. 
Translation reserve 
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations and the 
translation of liabilities that hedge the Company’s net investment in a foreign subsidiary.  
Hedging reserve 
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged 
transactions that have not yet occurred.  
Share premium 
The share premium account represents the difference between the issue price and the nominal value of shares issued.  
Own shares  
The reserve for the Company’s own shares comprises the cost of the Company’s shares held by the Group. The Group operates a General Employee  
Benefit Trust, which acquires shares in the Company that can be used to satisfy the requirements of the Executive Share Option Scheme, Performance Share 
Plan (PSP), Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP), Replacement 2007 and 2008 Long Term Incentive Plans, Replacement Deferred Share Award, Substitute  
Share Bonus Award and Recruitment Award. At 30 April 2012, the Trust held 6.3m shares (30 April 2011: 5.2m shares). The market value of the shares  
at 30 April 2012 was £10.6m (30 April 2011: £11.3m). Dividends receivable on the shares owned by the Trust have been waived. 
Non-controlling interests 
The Group had a liability of £5.2m at 30 April 2012 (30 April 2011: £5.5m) and a corresponding entry against non-controlling interests in respect of the 
non-controlling shareholders’ put option in Toscana Ondulati SpA. This amount was calculated with reference to the recent profitability of the company using  
a multiple based formula. The fair value of the put options decreased during the year by £0.2m (2010/11: £0.4m increase). This charge was recorded 
within finance costs through the income statement and then transferred out of retained earnings into non-controlling interests. 
23. Post-retirement benefits  
Liability for defined benefit obligations 
The Group operates a funded, defined benefit scheme in the UK, the DS Smith Group Pension scheme (‘the Group scheme’). On 30 April 2011,  
the Group scheme was closed for future accrual. The Group made agreed contributions of £29.8m to the Group scheme in 2011/12 (2010/11: £30.1m). 
The Group operates various local pension arrangements for overseas operations and unfunded arrangements for senior executives; these are, in aggregate, 
not significant to the Group. The following financial information includes amounts related to these other arrangements, where appropriate. A charge over 
certain assets of the Group has been made as security for certain of the unfunded arrangements. The most recent full actuarial valuation of the Group  
scheme was at 30 April 2010. All UK valuations used the projected unit method.  
Liability for defined benefit obligations 
Principal actuarial assumptions are as follows: 
 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 
Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.0% 5.3% 5.6% 6.4% 5.9%

0.5% decrease in discount rate (70.0)
0.5% increase in inflation (61.0)

Pensioner currently aged 65 21.1 23.3 21.0 23.2
Member currently aged 45 22.5 24.8 22.4 24.8
A change in the statutory revaluation of deferred pension increases, which will be based on the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) (previously indexation was 
referenced to the Retail Prices Index (RPI)) has been reflected in the actuarial assumptions for the Group scheme. A similar change in assumptions has been 
made for future pension increases, but it should be noted that the Trustee of the Group scheme will keep this indexation under review. 
The amounts recognised in the Statement of Financial Position in respect of post-retirement benefits and the expected long-term rates of return applied to the 
schemes’ assets in the relevant financial period are as follows:

Financial Statements 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 
 
24. Share-based payment expense  
The Group’s share-based payment arrangements are as follows: 
(i) A Performance Share Plan (PSP). Awards under the PSP normally become exercisable after three years subject to remaining in service and the satisfaction 
of performance conditions measured over the three financial years commencing with the year of grant. Awards have been made under the PSP in 2008, 
2009, 2010 and 2011. The performance conditions are as detailed below. 
 The 2008 award is subject to three equally-weighted performance measures: 
(i) the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) compared to the constituents of the Industrial Goods and Services Supersector within  
the FTSE 250; 
(ii) average adjusted earnings per share (EPS); and 
(iii) average adjusted return on average capital employed (ROACE). 
For those senior executives working in one of the three Business Segments, the three measures (equally weighted) are TSR (as above),  
average adjusted operating profit and average adjusted ROACE for the relevant segment. 
 The 2009 award is subject to two performance measures: 
(i) 80% of each award based on a TSR component as per above; and 
(ii) 20% of each award based on average adjusted ROACE. 
For those senior executives working in one of the three Business Segments, the two measures are TSR and ROACE for the relevant segment. 
 The 2010 and 2011 awards are subject to three performance measures: 
(i) 50% of each award based on a TSR component as per above;  
(ii) 25% of each award based on average adjusted EPS; and 
(iii) 25% of each award based on average adjusted ROACE. 
(ii) Replacement 2007 and 2008 Long Term Incentive Plans for Mr M W Roberts. The Replacement 2007 LTIP vested on 10 October 2010 and the 
Replacement 2008 LTIP became exercisable on 17 October 2011. The Replacement 2008 LTIP vested in full on 17 October 2011 but has not yet 
been exercised. The Replacement 2008 LTIP award was subject to a performance condition measuring the TSR of McBride Plc up to the date Mr Roberts 
joined the Company and thereafter the Company’s TSR against a comparator group of companies comprising the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment 
trusts) constituted as at the date of grant of the award over a three-year performance period commencing on 1 July 2008. 
(iii) The Replacement Deferred Shares Award and the Substitute Share Bonus Award are subject to substantially the same terms as the Company’s Deferred 
Share Bonus Plan, except that they will vest on 1 September 2012 and 1 September 2013 respectively. Mr Roberts will be entitled to a cash payment 
on vesting, representing a value equivalent to the dividends which would have been paid on his vested shares while they were subject to his awards. 
There are no performance conditions governing the vesting of the Replacement Deferred Shares Award and the Substitute Share Bonus Award because 
the awards they replicate had no performance conditions attaching to them. 
(iv) The Recruitment Award is subject to substantially the same terms as the awards made under the Company’s PSP in 2009. The award is due to vest  
on 19 October 2012.  
(v) A Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP) is operated for Executive Directors and, from 2012/13, for senior executives. Shares awarded under the Plan  
will vest automatically if the Director or senior executive is still employed by the Company three years after the grant of the award. 
(vi) A Share Matching Plan (SMP) is operated for Executive Directors and senior executives with the first award due to be made in 2012/13. The award  
will normally vest after three years subject to remaining in service and the satisfaction of performance conditions measured over the three financial years 
commencing with the year of grant. The performance conditions, which will be set on award, will be against EPS and ROACE. 
(vii) An Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS). This scheme ceased to be operated from September 2008. In normal circumstances, the vesting of any 
options granted under the ESOS is subject to remaining in service and to the growth in the Company’s normalised earnings per share equaling or 
exceeding the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index plus an average of 3% per annum over the three financial years commencing with the year of grant. 
(viii) A Sharesave Plan was introduced in the UK in January 2011. All UK employees of the Company and participating subsidiaries of the Group are eligible 
to participate in this Plan. Under this HMRC approved Plan options are granted to participants who have contracted to save up to £250 per month over 
a period of three years at a discount of up to 20% to the average closing mid-market price of a DS Smith Plc ordinary share on the three dealing days 
prior to invitation. Options cannot normally be exercised until a minimum of three years has elapsed. In common with most plans of this type there are  
no performance conditions applicable to options granted under this Plan. 
Full details of the awards described in (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) and (vi) are set out in the Remuneration Report.

model were: a share price of £2.127; the exercise prices shown above; an expected initial volatility of the share price of 33.9% and long term volatility  
of 28.7%; the options life disclosed above; an annual risk-free interest rate of 2.2%; and an expected dividend yield of 2.9. The volatility of share price 
returns measured as the standard deviation of expected share price returns was based on statistical analysis of daily share prices from 1 January 1970.

(b) SCA Packaging Kuban acquisition and disposal 
The Group acquired 100% of the equity of SCA Packaging Kuban in July 2011 for €5.0m cash consideration and €1.5m deferred consideration payable  
in December 2011, exclusively with a view to resale. The business was subsequently sold in December 2011 to the Group’s associate, OJSC Rubezhansk 
Paper and Packaging Mill for €6.5m with nil profit or loss on disposal. 
(c) Other acquisitions 
The Group made additional minor acquisitions of subsidiary businesses, net of cash and cash equivalents of £2.3m, of which the majority relates to a the 
acquisition of an additional 35% shareholding in Rapak AD, which brings the Group’s holding in Rapak AD at 30 April 2012 to 85%.  
Acquisition related costs 
SCA Packaging 
On 17 January 2012 the Directors announced arrangements regarding the proposed acquisition of the packaging division of Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget 
SCA (publ) excluding its kraftliner assets (‘SCA Packaging’) for €1.7bn on a cash, debt and, to the extent legally possible and commercially practicable, 
pension free basis. Net consideration will be approximately €1.6bn after taking into account a pension price adjustment. In addition, there will also be 
customary post-completion adjustments.  
On 25 May 2012, the European Commission granted competition clearance for the acquisition. The clearance requires the Group to divest three sites  
after the acquisition, currently representing approximately 1% of the enlarged Group profit. Completion is expected on 30 June 2012. 
The Group incurred acquisition related costs of £18.4m on professional advisory fees and due diligence costs connected with the acquisition. These fees  
have been included in administrative expenses in the Group’s Consolidated Income Statement. Due to the nature of these costs, they have been reported  
as exceptional costs.  
2010/11 
Otor 
On 1 September 2010, the Group acquired 100% of the voting share capital of Otor Finance S.A., a holding company which owns and controls  
80% of Otor S.A. On this date and as part of the same acquisition, the Group acquired an additional 15% of the voting share capital of Otor S.A.  
As a result, the Group’s total voting and ownership interest in Otor S.A. at acquisition date was 95%. Total consideration transferred comprised cash of 
£156.6m. In October 2010 the Group increased its ownership interest to 100%. Professional advisory fees and due diligence costs connected with the 
acquisition of Otor in 2010/11 were £7.2m.

Notes to the Company Balance Sheet  
1. Significant accounting policies 
A summary of the significant accounting policies, which have been applied 
consistently, is set out below:  
(a) Accounting basis  
The financial statements of DS Smith Plc (the Company) have been prepared 
on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention and  
have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and  
UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP). 
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is  
exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.  
Under FRS 1 ‘Cash Flow Statements’, the Company is exempt from  
the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that  
the parent undertaking includes the Company in its own consolidated 
financial statements. 
The Company has also taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 29 
‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’, not to present Company only information 
as the disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated financial 
statements comply with the requirements of this standard. 
The Company balance sheet at 30 April 2011 has been restated to  
remove the net defined benefit pension liability. In accordance with  
FRS 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’, the Company has chosen to take the multi-
employer exemption from disclosing the assets and liabilities of the scheme  
as it is not possible to separately identify those that relate to the Company 
employees. This exemption is considered to be consistent with current market 
practice and therefore restatement is considered appropriate. The net pension 
liability of £99.1m at 30 April 2011 has been reduced to £nil and there  
is a corresponding increase in shareholders’ funds to £584.8m. 
(b) Income recognition 
Dividend income from subsidiary undertakings is recognised in the  
profit and loss account when declared by the subsidiary undertaking. 
(c) Tangible fixed assets  
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. 
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost or valuation less the estimated 
residual value of all tangible fixed assets in equal annual instalments over their 
estimated useful lives at the following rates:  
Plant and equipment  3 – 5 years 
Leasehold improvements  over the period of the lease 
Land is not depreciated.  
(d) Fixed asset investments  
Fixed asset investments are valued at cost less provisions for impairment. 
(e) Deferred taxation  
In accordance with FRS 19 ‘Deferred Tax’, deferred tax is provided in full  
on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to 
pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected  
to apply when they crystallise, provided at current tax rates and based on 
current legislation. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of 
income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from 
those in which they are included in the financial statements.  
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded  
as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets  
and liabilities are not discounted.  
(f) Foreign currencies  
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the financial year end. Exchange 
differences arising on translation are taken to the profit and loss account. 
(g) Pension contributions  
The Company participates in a funded, defined benefit scheme in  
the UK, the DS Smith Group Pension scheme (‘the Group scheme’).  
On 30 April 2011, the scheme was closed for future accrual.  
As the Company is unable to identify its share of scheme assets and  
liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis, the Company treats 
contributions to defined benefit schemes as if they were contributions to  
a defined contribution scheme in accordance with the exemption permitted  
by FRS 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’. As a result the amount charged to the profit 
and loss account represents the contributions payable to the scheme in 
respect of the relevant accounting period.  
(h) Financial instruments  
Financial instruments are reported in accordance with FRS 26 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate, 
currency and commodity swaps, to manage interest rate, currency and 
commodity risks associated with the Group’s underlying business activities 
and the financing of these activities. The Group has a policy not to, and  
does not undertake any speculative activity in these instruments.  
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on 
the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value 
is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.  
Derivative financial instruments are accounted for as hedges when designated 
as hedges at the inception of the contract and when the financial instruments 
provide an effective hedge of the underlying risk.  
Any gains or losses arising from the hedging instruments are offset against  
the hedged items.  
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:  
 fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair  
value of a recognised asset or liability; and 
 cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash  
flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a 
recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction. 
(i) Share options  
The Company operates an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan. 
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant  
of the options is recognised as an expense. The fair value of the options 
granted is measured using a stochastic model, taking into account the terms 
and conditions upon which the options were granted. The total amount to  
be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair 
value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting 
conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about 
the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. At each 
balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the numbers of options 
that are expected to become exercisable.  
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the 
income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity. 
Where applicable, the fair value of employee services received by subsidiary 
undertakings within the DS Smith Plc Group in exchange for options granted 
by the Company is recognised as an expense in the financial statements of 
the subsidiary by means of a recharge from the Company.

NOTES
(i)  Only those Members registered in the Register of Members of the Company as at 6pm on 2 September 2012 shall be entitled to attend  
and vote at the Meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their names at that time.
(ii)  Members are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of their rights to attend and speak and vote on their behalf at the Meeting.  
A shareholder may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the Annual General Meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise  
the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that shareholder. A proxy need not be a shareholder of the Company.
(iii)  A proxy may be appointed by any of the following methods:
 completing and returning the enclosed Form of Proxy; or
 by logging onto the Registrars’ website www.sharevote.co.uk using the Voting ID, Task ID and Shareholder Reference Number printed on  
the Form of Proxy enclosed. Shareholders who have already registered with the Registrars’ online portfolio service Shareview can submit  
a proxy by logging into their proﬁle at www.shareview.co.uk and clicking on the link to vote under “Your DS Smith Plc holding details”; or
 members of CREST should use the CREST electronic appointment service (see (vii) below).
 If two or more valid but differing appointments of a proxy are received in respect of the same share for use at the same meeting, the one which  
is last received (regardless of its date or the date of its signature) shall be treated as replacing and revoking the others as regards that share; if the 
Company is unable to determine which was received last, none of them shall be treated as valid in respect of that share. To be effective, Forms  
of Proxy must reach the Registrars at the address shown on the Form and the Registrars must receive any electronic appointment of proxy not later 
than 48 hours before the time of the Meeting. Completion and return of the Form or appointing a proxy electronically will not, however, prevent  
a Member from attending and voting at the Meeting. A Member must inform the Registrars in writing of any termination of the authority of a proxy.
(iv)  Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated under Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to enjoy information rights  
(a ‘Nominated Person’) may, under an agreement between them and the shareholder by whom they were nominated, have a right to be 
appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the Annual General Meeting. If a Nominated Person has no such proxy 
appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, they may, under any such agreement, have a right to give instructions to the shareholder  
as to the exercise of voting rights.
(v)  The statement of rights of shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies in Notes (ii) and (iii) above does not apply to Nominated Persons. 
The rights described in these paragraphs can only be exercised by shareholders of the Company.
(vi)  Nominated persons are reminded that they should contact the registered holder of their shares (and not the Company) on matters relating to their 
investments in the Company.
(vii)  CREST Members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the Meeting  
to be held on 4 September 2012 and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal 
Members or other CREST sponsored Members, and those CREST Members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their 
CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
 In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a ‘CREST Proxy 
Instruction’) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear’s speciﬁcations and must contain the information required for such 
instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment  
to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID  
RA19) by the latest time for receipt of proxy appointments speciﬁed in (iii) above. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the  
time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve  
the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through  
CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
 CREST Members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear does not make available 
special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of 
CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST Member concerned to take (or, if the CREST Member is a CREST personal Member  
or sponsored Member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such 
action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection,  www.dssmith.uk.com 
Annual Report & Accounts 2012

Notice of Annual General Meeting 2012 continued
CREST Members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST 
Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
 The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertiﬁcated Securities 
Regulations 2001. The CREST Manual can be reviewed at www.euroclear.com/CREST.
(viii)  As at 10 July 2012 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document), the Company’s issued share capital consists  
of 926,976,137 ordinary shares, carrying one vote each. Therefore, the total voting rights in the Company as at 10 July 2012 are 
926,976,137.
(ix)  A member of the Company which is a corporation may authorise a person or persons to act as its representative(s) at the Annual General 
Meeting. In accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, each such representative may exercise (on behalf of the corporation) the 
same powers as the corporation could exercise if it were an individual member of the Company, provided that they do not do so in relation to the 
same shares.
(x)  Under section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 members meeting the threshold requirements set out in that section have the right to require the 
Company to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of the Company’s accounts (including the Auditor’s 
Report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the Annual General Meeting; or (ii) any circumstance connected with an auditor  
of the Company ceasing to hold ofﬁce since the previous meeting at which annual accounts and reports were laid in accordance with section 
437 of the Companies Act 2006. The Company may not require the shareholders requesting any such website publication to pay its expenses  
in complying with sections 527 or 528 of the Companies Act 2006. Where the Company is required to place a statement on a website under 
section 527 of the Companies Act 2006, it must forward the statement to the Company’s Auditor not later than the time when it makes the 
statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting includes any statement that the 
Company has been required under section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 to publish on a website.
(xi)  Any member attending the Meeting has the right to ask questions. The Company must cause to be answered any such question relating to the 
business being dealt with at the Meeting but no such answer need be given if (a) to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation for the 
Meeting or involve the disclosure of conﬁdential information, (b) the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to  
a question, or (c) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the Meeting that the question be answered.
(xii)  A copy of this Notice, and other information required by section 311A of the Companies Act 2006, can be found in the Annual Report section  
of the Investors page on our website www.dssmith.uk.com.
(xiii)  Copies of the following documents will be available for inspection at the Company’s Registered Ofﬁce and at the ofﬁces of Allen & Overy  
LLP , One Bishops Square, London E1 6AD during normal business hours from the date of this Notice and until the conclusion of the Meeting:

 (b) letters of appointment of the Chairman and the non-Executive Directors.
(xiv) The Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees will be available to answer relevant questions at the Meeting.
(xv) You may not use any electronic address provided either in this Notice of Meeting or any related documents (including the Form of Proxy)  
to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.

Resolutions 10-11:
Re-appointment of Auditor and Auditor’s remuneration
The auditor of a company must be re-appointed at each general meeting at which accounts are presented. Resolution 10 proposes the re-appointment 
of the Company’s existing Auditor, Deloitte LLP , until the next Annual General Meeting and Resolution 11 gives authority to the Directors to determine  
the Auditor’s remuneration.
Resolution 12:
Authority to allot shares
At the Annual General Meeting held on 6 September 2011, shareholders authorised the Directors, under section 551 of the Companies Act 2006,  
to allot shares without the prior consent of shareholders for a period expiring at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2012 or,  
if earlier, on 1 November 2012. It is proposed to renew this authority and to authorise the Directors under section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 
 to allot ordinary shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into shares in the Company for a period expiring no later than  
1 November 2013.
Paragraph (a)(i) of Resolution 12 will allow the Directors to allot ordinary shares up to a maximum nominal amount of £30,899,204.57 representing 
approximately one third (33.33%) of the Company’s existing issued share capital and calculated as at 10 July 2012 (being the latest practicable date 
prior to publication of this circular). In accordance with institutional guidelines issued by the Association of British Insurers, paragraph (a)(ii) of Resolution 
12 will allow Directors to allot, including the ordinary shares referred to in paragraph (a)(i) of Resolution 12, further of the Company’s ordinary shares  
in connection with a pre-emptive offer by way of a rights issue to ordinary shareholders up to a maximum nominal amount of £61,798,409.13, 
representing approximately two thirds (66.67%) of the Company’s existing issued share capital and calculated as at 10 July 2012 (being the latest 
practicable date prior to publication of this circular). The Directors have no present intention of exercising this authority. However, if they do exercise  
the authority, the Directors intend to follow emerging best practice as regards its use, as recommended by the Association of British Insurers.
Resolution 12 will be proposed as an ordinary resolution to renew this authority until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting or, if earlier,  
the close of business on 1 November 2013. 
Resolution 13:
Directors’ powers to disapply pre-emption rights
Also at last year’s meeting, a special resolution was passed, under sections 570 and 573 of the Companies Act 2006, empowering the Directors to 
allot equity securities for cash without ﬁrst being required to offer such shares to existing shareholders. It is proposed that this authority also be renewed. 
If approved, the Resolution will authorise the Directors to issue shares in connection with a rights issue and otherwise to issue shares for cash up to a 
maximum nominal amount of £4,634,880.69 which includes the sale on a non pre-emptive basis of any shares the Company may hold in treasury  
for cash. The maximum nominal amount of equity securities to which this authority relates represents approximately 5% of the issued share capital of  
the Company as at 10 July 2012 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this circular).
The Directors do not intend to issue more than 7.5% of the issued share capital of the Company for cash on a non pre-emptive basis in any rolling  
three year period without prior consultation with the shareholders and the Investment Committees of the Association of British Insurers and the National 
Association of Pension Funds. Resolution 13 will be proposed as a special resolution to renew this authority until the conclusion of the next Annual 
General Meeting or, if earlier, the close of business on 1 November 2013.
Resolution 14:
Company’s authority to purchase shares
This Resolution, which will be proposed as a special resolution, seeks to renew the existing authority for the Company to purchase its own shares in  
the market. This authority gives the Company greater ﬂexibility in managing its capital resources. The Directors have no speciﬁc intention of using this 
authority and would do so only when, in the light of market conditions, they believed that the effect of such purchases would be to increase earnings 
per share, and that the purchases were in the interests of shareholders generally. The Directors would also give careful consideration to gearing levels  
of the Company and its general ﬁnancial position. The purchase price would be paid out of distributable proﬁts. Resolution 14 speciﬁes the maximum 
number of shares which may be purchased (representing approximately 10% of the Company’s issued share capital at 10 July 2012, being the latest 
practicable date prior to publication of this document), the minimum and maximum prices at which they may be bought and when the authority  
will expire, reﬂecting the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and the Listing Rules of the FSA. The minimum price at which the shares may  
be purchased is their nominal value and the maximum price is the higher of 5% above the average of the middle market values of those shares for  
the ﬁve business days before the purchase is made and the amount stipulated by Article 5(1) of the Buy-back and Stabilisation Regulation 2003.   www.dssmith.uk.com 
Annual Report & Accounts 2012

Notice of Annual General Meeting 2012 continued
The Companies Act 2006 enables certain listed companies to hold shares in treasury, as an alternative to cancelling them, following a purchase of 
own shares by the Company. Shares held in treasury may subsequently be cancelled, sold for cash or used to satisfy share options and share awards 
under the Company’s share schemes. Once held in treasury, the Company is not entitled to exercise any rights, including the right to attend and vote  
at meetings, in respect of those shares. Further, no dividend or distribution of the Company’s assets may be made to the Company in respect of those 
shares whilst held in treasury. Accordingly, if the Directors exercise the authority conferred by Resolution 14, the Company will have the option of 
holding those shares in treasury rather than cancelling them. The total number of ordinary shares that are under option through the Company’s share 
option schemes at 10 July 2012 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this notice) is 7,261,451 of which 333,810 are options  
over unissued ordinary shares. The proportion of issued ordinary share capital that the options over unissued ordinary shares represented on this  
date was 0.04% and the proportion of issued ordinary share capital that they will represent if the full authority to purchase shares (existing and being 
sought) is used is 0.03%. The authority will expire at close of business on 1 November 2013 or at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting 
(whichever is the earlier). It is the present intention of the Directors to seek a similar authority annually.
Resolution 15:
Notice of general meetings
The notice period required by the Companies Act 2006 for general meetings of the Company is 21 days unless shareholders approve a shorter  
notice period, which cannot however be less than 14 clear days. (Annual General Meetings must always be held on at least 21 clear days’ notice.)
At last year’s Annual General Meeting, shareholders authorised the calling of general meetings other than an Annual General Meeting on not less  
than 14 clear days’ notice and it is proposed that this authority be renewed. The authority granted by this resolution, if passed, will be effective until  
the Company’s next Annual General Meeting, when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed.
Note that if a general meeting is called on less than 21 clear days’ notice, the Company will make a means of electronic voting available to all 
shareholders for that meeting. The ﬂexibility offered by this resolution will be used where, taking into account the circumstances, the Directors consider 
this appropriate in relation to the business of the meeting and in the interests of the Company and shareholders as a whole.
Recommendation
Your Directors believe that all the proposals in the resolutions to be considered at the Annual General Meeting are in the best interests of the Company 
and its shareholders and recommend shareholders to vote in favour of the resolutions. The Directors will be voting in favour of the resolutions in respect 
of their own shareholdings.

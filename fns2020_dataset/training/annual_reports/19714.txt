Chairman’s statement
Strategic	report
Stock	Spirits	Group	|	Annual	Report	&	Accounts	2015 04 Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 05
As	Chairman	of	Stock	Spirits	Group	PLC,	 
I	am	pleased	to	present	our	Annual	
Report	&	Accounts	for	the	year	ended	
31	December	2015.
Since	becoming	Chairman	of	Stock	
Spirits	I	have	met	with	many	
shareholders	and	listened	to	their	
views.	These	views	have	been	
considered,	fed	back	to	my	Board	
colleagues	and	discussed	accordingly.	 
I	look	forward	to	meeting	investors	 
(old	and	new)	again	in	the	near	future.
2015	was	a	very	difficult	year	for	the	
Group	in	Poland	where	a	number	of	
factors	adversely	impacted	our	overall	
results.	Whilst	the	Group	results	are	
highly	influenced	by	the	results	of	the	
Polish	business,	it	is	important	not	to	
overlook	the	performance	in	our	other	
markets	which	have	delivered	strong	
results,	in	some	cases	ahead	of	our	
expectations.	In	particular	in	the	Czech	
Republic	and	Slovakia	we	have	continued	
to	demonstrate	our	strength	and	success	
in	new	product	development	and	our	
capability	to	work	with	partners	and	
grow	their	brands	with	equal	
commitment	to	our	own	portfolio.
Our	ongoing	focus	on	effective	cash	
management	across	the	Group,	resulted	
in	strong	cash	generation	again	in	2015,	
and	we	ended	the	year	with	a	robust	
balance	sheet	and	net	debt	of	€57.2m.	
The	need	to	issue	revised	profit	
guidance	in	November	2015	was	very	
disappointing,	especially	given	the	
various	initiatives	the	team	had	
undertaken	during	the	year	to	
overcome	the	challenges	we	face	in	
Poland.	As	a	consequence	of	issuing	
the	revised	profit	guidance	and	the	
subsequent	impact	on	the	share	price,	 
I	initiated	a	review	of	Group	strategy,	
as	well	as	a	full	‘root	and	branch’	review	
of	the	Polish	market	and	our	business	
in	that	country.
Our	CEO,	Chris	Heath,	will	cover	the	
Polish	review	in	his	section	of	this	
report	so	I	will	not	go	into	detail	here.
The	Board's	key	conclusions	arising	
from	the	Group	Strategic	Review	are:
• The	principal	elements	of	our	
strategic	goals	outlined	at	the	time	
of	the	Group’s	Initial	Public	Offering	
in	October	2013	are	still	valid.	
However	we	cannot	ignore	the	
significant	changes	in	the	Polish	
market	and	the	ongoing	difficulty	of	
completing	meaningful	acquisitions	
in	the	Central	and	Eastern	European	
region.	The	latter	has	been	impacted	
by	the	effective	elimination,	in	the	
short-term,	of	two	of	the	principal	
countries	previously	earmarked	as	
potential	acquisition	targets	i.e.	
Ukraine	and	Belarus.
• The	Board	believes	that	the	Group	
is	currently	too	dependent	on	the	
Polish	business,	especially	in	an	
environment	where	margins	are	
under	severe	pressure	from	
competitors.	We	will	therefore	
continue	to	seek	value-accretive	
acquisitions	to	grow	the	footprint	 
of	the	business.	However,	the	area	
targeted	for	geographic	expansion	
will	be	broadened	to	include	 
other	European	countries	 
beyond	Central	and	Eastern	 
Europe	and	we	will	consider	larger	
deals	which	will	move	the	dial.
“Stock	Prestige	combines	our	
heritage	with	our	modern	approach	
to	great	effect,	creating	a	top-quality	
spirit	to	be	enjoyed	by	all.” Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 06
• In	addition,	a	number	of	assets	have	
been	identified	which	we	feel	are	
intrinsically	undervalued.	If	we	are	
unable	to	deliver	an	enhancement	
in	the	value	of	these	assets	in	the	
short	term,	we	will	seek	other	
opportunities	to	realise	their	
intrinsic	value,	which	may	result	in	
their	disposal.
• There	will	be	a	renewed	focus	to	
further	extend	the	portfolio	of	third	
party	products	in	our	core	markets,	
utilising	the	strength	of	our	
distribution	platforms	which	will	
help	to	diversify	and	strengthen	our	
product	portfolios.
• An	ongoing	review	of	the	cost	base	
has	identified	a	number	of	
opportunities	to	deliver	savings,	
which	will	be	partly	reinvested	in	
other	areas	of	the	business	that	we	
intend	to	strengthen.	This	will	
include	significant	investment	in	
upgrading	our	Sales	and	Marketing	
capabilities.
• With	regard	to	shareholder	returns,	
should	the	business	not	announce	a	
meaningful	M&A	transaction	in	the	
near	term,	the	Board	intends	to	
increase	the	dividend	and	to	
distribute	surplus	cash	to	
shareholders.	Ahead	of	this,	the	
Board	is	recommending	a	final	
dividend	payable	in	respect	of	the	
full	year	2015	of	€0.0455	per	share	
(2014:	€0.025).	The	total	dividend	
payable	in	respect	of	2015	will	 
be	some	55%	higher	than	the	
previous	year.
In	November	2015,	the	Group	
completed	a	very	successful	refinancing	
process.	The	new	facility	provides	the	
Group	with	greater	flexibility,	
considerable	headroom	and	significantly	
lower	finance	costs	going	forwards.
People
Our	people	are	key	assets	of	the	
business	and	I	would	like	to	recognise	
the	commitment	of	all	our	employees	
and	thank	them	for	their	ongoing	
contribution	and	support	during	this	
difficult	period.

Chairman’s statement continued Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 07
There	have	been	no	changes	to	the	
Directors’	Remuneration	Policy,	details	
of	which	are	contained	within	the	
corporate	governance	section	of	this	
report.	Executive	Directors	and	senior	
managers’	interests	remain	fully	aligned	
with	shareholders	as	the	majority	have	
a	very	significant	personal	investment	in	
the	Company.
Governance
I	would	firstly	like	to	thank	Jack	Keenan,	
who	retired	from	the	Board	as	
Chairman	in	May	2015.	Jack	oversaw	
the	business	in	its	transition	from	a	
private	equity	owned	business	to	a	
public	company	on	the	London	Stock	
Exchange.	My	Board	colleagues	and	I	
wish	Jack	well	in	his	retirement.
Following	my	appointment	as	Chairman,	
the	Board	subsequently	appointed	Mirek	
Stachowicz	as	an	Independent	Non-
Executive	Director.	Mirek,	who	is	already	
making	an	important	contribution,	brings	
extensive	experience	of	Central	and	
Eastern	Europe,	and	Poland	in	particular,	
together	with	a	wealth	of	FMCG	
knowledge.	I	welcome	Mirek	to	the	
Board	and	look	forward	to	working	 
with	him.
Andrew	Cripps	was	appointed	in	
November	as	the	Senior	Independent	
Director	following	my	appointment	as	
Chairman.	All	committee	compositions	
are	fully	compliant	with	the	Corporate	
Governance	Code,	see	page	62	of	this	
report	for	further	details.
I	am	personally	very	committed	to	
high	standards	of	corporate	
governance.	The	Board	and	its	sub	
committees	have	met	regularly	
throughout	the	year	and	full	
evaluations	have	been	undertaken	and	
discussed.	In	addition,	a	detailed	
review	of	controls	and	processes	was	
initiated	across	the	Group,	and	
especially	in	Poland.	Consequently	a	
significant	amount	of	work	has	been	
undertaken	to	strengthen	and	
improve	our	control	environment,	and	
where	appropriate	systems	and	
procedures	have	been	changed.	 
This	work	has	been	a	key	priority	and	
is	now	nearing	completion	in	Poland	
and	is	being	rolled	out	in	the	rest	of	
our	jurisdictions	in	2016.
More	details	on	our	corporate	
governance	are	provided	later	in	the	
report,	as	well	as	the	reports	from	 
the	committee	chairmen	of	our	
Remuneration,	Audit	and	Nominations	
committees.	I	thank	the	Executive	and	
Non-Executive	Directors	with	whom	I	
serve	for	their	support	and	insight	in	
helping	to	run	the	Group	as	effectively	
as	possible.
Our	new	auditors,	KPMG	have	managed	
a	very	smooth	transition	from	our	
previous	auditors.	We	continue	to	work	
with	Ernst	&	Young	as	advisors	for	other	
services	such	as	tax,	debt	advisory	and	
transaction	services,	and	other	advisors	
for	more	specialist	engagements.
Looking ahead
Firstly,	I	want	to	reiterate	that	having	
completed	both	a	strategic	and	
operational	review,	your	Board	and	I	are	
fully	committed	to	turning	around	the	
fortunes	of	the	Group	and	returning	it	
to	sustainable	long-term	growth.
The	business	has	many	strengths	
which	we	must	build	on,	including	our	
exceptional	brands,	our	proven	
capability	in	new	product	
development,	a	strong	financial	
structure,	our	leading	edge	
production	facilities,	and	of	course	
our	people.	There	is	still	much	to	do,	
but	I	am	confident	that	the	measures	
being	taken	are	the	correct	ones,	and	
with	a	fully	motivated	management	
team	in	place,	I	am	sure	we	can	deliver	
on	our	objectives.

Chief Executive Officer’s statement
Strategic	report
As difficult as 2015  
has been, I am 
encouraged by the 
performance in a 
number of our 
markets, and that  
the strategy we  
have followed  
there continues  
to deliver the 
expected results 
Stock	Spirits	Group	|	Annual	Report	&	Accounts	2015 08 Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 09
2015	was	another	year	of	disruption	in	
the	Polish	market	and	I	am	personally	
very	disappointed	that	we	had	to	issue	
revised	profit	guidance	in	November	
2015.	Our	team	in	Poland	have	worked	
incredibly	hard	to	put	in	place	the	
necessary	building	blocks	to	return	the	
business	to	growth	and	I	acknowledge	
their	hard	work	and	commitment	during	
this	difficult	period.	Immediately	
following	the	year-end,	we	commenced	
a	‘root	and	branch’	review	in	Poland	and	
I	will	comment	on	this	later.
In	other	markets,	I	am	very	pleased	with	
the	results	we	achieved	in	2015	and	it	
reassures	me	that	our	commercial	
strategy	remains	valid	and	robust.	 
Apart	from	Poland,	where	trading	in	
quarter	1	significantly	impacted	our	
overall	performance,	we	have	seen	
EBITDA	consistent	or	improved	margins	
across	all	of	our	other	core	markets.
In	the	Czech	Republic	we	grew	our	
market	share	and	delivered	significant	
increases	in	both	Net	sales	revenue	and	
EBITDA.	I	am	delighted	with	the	success	
of	the	new	products	we	launched	during	
the	year,	particularly	the	new	variants	in	
the	Fernet	range,	which	helped	to	revive	
a	category	which	has	seen	little	
excitement	in	terms	of	new	products	in	
the	last	few	years.	As	market	leader	it	is	
a	great	testament	to	the	strength	of	our	
brand	equity	that	we	have	been	able	to	
stimulate	this	category.	Also	boosted	by	
successful	new	flavour	launches,	our	
Božkov	brand	continues	to	go	from	
strength	to	strength	and	remains	the	
biggest	selling	spirits	brand	in	the	
Czech Republic. 
In	both	our	International	and	Slovakian	
markets,	we	made	great	progress	in	
2015,	with	the	successful	launch	of	new	
products	in	Slovakia	and	the	continued	
development	of	our	tailored	core	
product	portfolios	across	the	region	
delivering	strong	profit	growth.	
In	Italy,	we	had	a	slow	start	to	the	year	
following	the	further	excise	duty	
increase	on	1	January	2015.	All	spirits	
categories	were	impacted,	but	
especially	the	brandy	category	as	the	
excise	increase	followed	on	from	other	
significant	price	increases	driven	by	
brandy	raw	material	cost	inflation.	As	
leader	of	this	category	we	were	
especially	impacted	by	this,	however	
the	changes	we	made	to	our	commercial	
activities	resulted	in	more	positive	
momentum	during	the	second	half	of	
the	year.	In	Italy	we	also	retained	our	
leadership	of	the	vodka	and	limoncello	
categories.	The	forecast	improvement	
in	the	underlying	Italian	economic	
conditions	are	very	welcome,	and	we	
feel	confident	that	this	can	only	benefit	
the	spirits	category	going	forward.		
Being	positioned	with	leading	brands	in	
important	categories	we	expect	to	
benefit	from	any	improvement.
We	now	have	significant	third	party	
distribution	agreements	in	almost	all	of	
our	core	markets	and	all	are	performing	
well.	The	more	established	agreements	
in	Poland	and	the	Czech	Republic	have	
gone	from	strength	to	strength	in	2015	
and	the	new	agreements	to	distribute	
Beam	Suntory	products	in	Croatia	and	
Bosnia	have	made	a	great	start.	Our	
capability	to	launch	and	build	premium	
brands	from	our	distribution	partners	
with	equal	passion	and	success	as	our	
own	brands	is	a	clear	demonstration	of	
our	distribution	strength	and	brand	
building	credentials.
Returning	to	Poland,	we	dedicated	
much	time	and	resource	in	2015	to	
rebuilding	important	customer	
relationships,	reorganising	and	
restructuring	our	sales	teams,	launching	
new	products,	repackaging	existing	core	
brands	and	upgrading	processes	and	
controls	where	appropriate.	
Our	results	in	quarter	1	were	very	 
poor	as	the	disruption	following	the	
significant	excise	duty	increase	in	2014	
continued	into	2015	and	key	customers	
significantly	reduced	their	inventory	
levels	of	our	products.	Since	then	we	
have	seen	steady	progress	and	
improving	financial	results.	
Encouragingly,	from	a	consumer	
perspective,	the	vodka	market	continued	
to	recover	during	the	year,	demonstrating	
the	resilience	of	the	underlying	consumer	
demand	despite	the	exceptionally	large	
excise	duty	increase	in	2014.	As	a	result,	
over	the	whole	year	there	was	only	a	
small	decline	in	vodka	volumes,	whilst	the	
vodka	market	remained	flat	in	value	
terms.	Throughout	the	year	we	continued	
to	witness	some	very	aggressive	
competitor	activity	where	market	share	
gains	appear	to	have	been	driven	at	the	
expense	of	profit	margins.	As	detailed	
later,	delays	in	customer	orders	during	
the	run-up	to	the	key	Christmas	trading	
period	adversely	affected	our	quarter	 
4	results	and	led	to	the	revised	profit	
guidance	issued	in	November.
“We	have	created	many	wonderful	new	products	at	Stock	over	the	last	
eight	years,	but	my	favourite	Stock	brand	is	Żołądkowa	Gorzka	which	
dates	back	to	the	1950s.	The	flavour	and	texture	of	the	liquid	is	
wonderful	and	we	still	use	the	same	authentic	recipe	today.” Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 10
Polish 'root and branch' review
In	January	2016	we	confirmed	that	our	
2015	results	would	finish	towards	the	
top	of	our	revised	profit	guidance	and	
explained	that	in	addition	to	the	
strategic	review	that	had	been	initiated,	
we	had	also	commenced	a	detailed	‘root	
and	branch’	review	of	the	Polish	market.
A	very	rigorous	and	detailed	exercise	
was	undertaken	in	conjunction	with	
Ernst	&	Young	to	examine	our	brands,	
our	pricing,	our	new	product	
development	programme,	our	
competitors,	our	customers,	route	to	
market	and	emerging	trends.	We	also	
considered	a	number	of	scenarios	that	
could	result	from	the	impending	
introduction	of	a	new	retail	sales	tax.
The	key	conclusions	from	the	review	of	
the	Polish	market	were:
• After	a	period	of	accelerated	
volume	decline	due	to	the	large	
shelf	price	increases	caused	by	the	
excise	duty	increase	in	January	
2014,	consumer	demand	trends	for	
vodka	improved	throughout	2015	
and	have	stabilised	at	low	single	
digit	decline	in	volume	terms.
• This	is	despite	the	growth	of	beer	
volumes	in	2015	due	to	the	very	
warm	summer	and	higher	than	usual	
level	of	beer	promotional	activity.
• Apart	from	a	short	period	of	
exceptionally	warm	weather	in	
2015,	the	long-term	trend	of	
flavoured	vodkas	outperforming	
clear	vodkas	continues.	Note	that	
during	hot	weather,	some	
flavoured-vodkas	consumers	
temporarily	switch	to	drinking	clear	
vodka	mixed	with	soft	drinks.
• Polish	consumers	have	their	
favourite	brands	but	some	will	switch	
brands	when	the	price	differential	
between	directly	competing	brands	
becomes	too	large.
• Consumers	continue	to	want	to	 
try	new	products,	especially	new	
variants	of	existing,	well	 
established	brands.
• As	well	as	whisky,	some	other	
non-vodka	spirits	categories	are	
starting	to	grow,	albeit	from	a	 
very	low	base.
• Vodka	sales	through	discounters	fell	
in	2014	but	grew	rapidly	in	2015	
due	to	aggressive	pricing	support	
from	competitors.	It	is	likely	that	
this	growth	will	continue	for	the	
foreseeable	future,	but	probably	 
at	a	slower	pace	as	discounter	
penetration	approaches	saturation.
• Despite	the	recent	growth	of	
discounters,	traditional	convenience	
Strategic	report
Chief Executive Officer’s statement continued
Our	first	full	
strength	
sparkling	clear	
vodka,	Stock	
Sparkling Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 11
stores	have	only	lost	a	few	percentage	
points	of	market	share	over	the	last	
five	years	and	still	represent	the	
majority	of	vodka	sales	in	Poland.
• However,	the	traditional	trade	
channel	is	evolving,	with	buying	
groups	and	regional	chains	taking	a	
larger	share	of	this	channel.
• It	is	too	early	to	know	exactly	how	
the	new	retail	sales	tax	expected	to	
be	introduced	in	Poland	during	2016	
will	impact	the	market.	This	will	need	
to	be	monitored	and	appropriate	
actions	taken	in	a	timely	manner. 
I	will	not	cover	all	of	the	ways	in	which	
we	are	responding	to	the	findings	of	
the	review	as	some	are	commercially	
sensitive,	but	some	of	the	key	 
actions	include:
• Continually evaluate our route to 
consumer	and	adapt	our	business	
model	as	appropriate.	
• Increase	the	number	of	traditional	
and	small	format	stores	we	cover	
directly	or	indirectly.
• Continue to support our  
wholesaler	partners.

The	‘root	and	branch’	review	has	been	
extremely	helpful	in	validating	activities	
and	actions	we	already	had	in	place	and	
in	highlighting	areas	that	require	change	
and/or	further	development.
I	expect	that	a	number	of	the	actions	
being	taken	will	produce	tangible	results	
in	the	first	half	of	this	year,	whilst	others	
will	take	longer	to	bear	fruit. Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 12
Progress towards strategic goals
As	highlighted	in	the	Chairman's	report	
on	page	5,	a	strategic	review	has	recently	
been	undertaken	of	the	whole	business.	
The	conclusions	of	this	review	and	a	
general	update	on	progress	towards	
achieving	our	strategic	goals	are	
contained	in	the	Chairman's	statement	
and	in	other	areas	of	the	Strategic	
Report.	I	will	therefore	not	repeat	all	of	
the	points	in	detail	here,	but	in	summary,	
we	believe	that	our	overarching	strategy	
remains	robust,	but	needs	refining	in	
certain	areas	to	reflect	recent	changes	in	
the	trading	environment	in	Central	and	
Eastern	Europe.
Group financial performance
In	view	of	the	very	poor	trading	
performance	in	quarter	1	in	Poland,	at	
our	half-year	results	published	in	
August	2015	we	issued	a	full	year	profit	
guidance	for	EBITDA	of	between	€60m	
and	€68m.	As	highlighted	in	the	
half-year	results,	the	business	faced	the	
risks	of	continuing	aggressive	
competitor	behaviour	and	erratic	
customer	ordering	patterns.	A	number	
of	other	assumptions	underpinned	the	
guidance,	including	the	stabilisation	of	
market	conditions	in	Poland,	the	
performance	of	new	products	and	
stability	of	raw	material	pricing.	
Performance	of	the	Group	during	
quarter	2	and	quarter	3	suggested	that	
this	range	remained	achievable,	
although	as	time	progressed,	it	seemed	
more	likely	that	we	would	finish	towards	
the	lower	end	of	the	range.	Quarter	4	is	
traditionally	a	very	strong	trading	
period	due	to	the	impact	of	Christmas.	
This	seasonal	spike	in	trading	was	
experienced	in	all	of	our	markets,	with	
the	exception	of	Poland	where	a	
number	of	wholesale	customers	did	not	
place	orders	in	line	with	the	internal	
forecasts	for	that	time	of	the	year.	
During	November,	the	lack	of	orders	
from	key	customers,	coupled	with	our	
lack	of	confidence	that	the	shortfall	
would	be	recovered	in	December,	
resulted	in	the	Group	issuing	a	trading	
statement	and	revising	the	full	 
year	EBITDA	forecast	range	to	 
€50m	–	€54m.		
During	December,	some	of	the	
customers	who	had	not	placed	orders	as	
expected	during	November,	did	in	fact	
place	orders,	and	in	January	2016,	the	
Group	confirmed	its	full	year	profit	
delivery	towards	the	top	of	the	range	of	
the	November	guidance,	after	absorbing	
an	additional	currency	impact	of	€0.5m	
since	we	published	our	half-year	results.	
The	full	year	adjusted	EBITDA	for	the	
Group	for	2015	is	€53.7m,	a	decrease	
versus	last	year	of	€12.6m.	Much	of	the	
decrease	occurred	during	quarter	1,	and	
as	already	mentioned,	due	to	poor	
trading	in	Poland.	Our	results	were	
impacted	by	movements	in	foreign	
exchange	primarily	arising	from	the	
translation	effect	from	the	Swiss	Franc	
and	GB	Pound.	This	had	the	impact	of	
reducing	the	full	year	EBITDA	by	€1.6m,	
versus	2014.
In	November	we	concluded	a	
refinancing	of	the	Group.	We	repaid	the	
previous	facility	in	full,	and	moved	to	a	
revolving	credit	facility,	resulting	in	a	
reduction	in	borrowing	costs	going	
forwards,	increasing	our	borrowing	
flexibility	and	providing	the	Group	with	
significant	headroom.	
We	have	maintained	our	strong	cash	
generation.	The	additional	inventory	we	
were	carrying	at	the	half-year	as	a	
consequence	of	the	new	warehouse	in	
Poland,	has	been	depleted	and	our	cash	
flow	in	the	second	half	was	especially	
strong.	Our	adjusted	net	free	cash	flow	
for	the	full	year	was	€46.9m	resulting	in	
net	debt	reducing	from	€82.4m	at	the	
end	of	2014	to	€57 .2m	at	the	end	of	
December	2015,	and	reduction	in	 
net	debt	of	€34.8m	since	the	end	of	 
June	2015.
New product development (NPD)
The	Group	has	established	a	very	strong	
track	record	of	developing	successful	
new	brands	and	new	variants	of	existing	
brands.	In	2015	we	launched	43	new	
products,	and	significantly	strengthened	
our	portfolio	by	launching	products	not	
only	in	our	core	categories,	but	also	into	
new	emerging	categories,	such	as	
vermouth.		We	have	broken	into	new	
Strategic	report
Chief Executive Officer’s statement continued Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 13
styles	of	products	within	our	established	
categories	with	the	launch	of	shot	pots	
for	our	successful	Lubelska	brand	and	
the	revolutionary	Stock	Sparkling	clear	
vodka,	to	name	a	few.	
Our	capability	in	launching	new	products	
has	not	been	restricted	to	our	own	
brands	but	also	extends	to	new	products	
from	our	distribution	partners.	We	have	
successfully	launched	Captain	Morgan	
White	in	the	Czech	Republic	and	Jim	
Beam	Apple	in	Poland.	
At	the	end	of	2015	we	launched	a	new	
premium	range	of	flavoured	vodkas	in	
Poland	with	unique	flavours,	under	the	
Saska	brand.	Although	we	remain	the	
leader	of	flavoured	vodkas	in	Poland,	we	
see	the	Saska	range	as	filling	an	
important	gap	in	the	category.	We	
continue	to	view	new	products	as	
essential	to	refreshing	our	portfolio	and	
satisfying	the	needs	of	consumers,	and	
see	considerable	opportunity	to	launch	
new	products	in	the	future.	As	a	
consequence	we	have	a	very	busy	
pipeline	of	activity	lined	up	for	2016 
and	beyond.
People
I	recognise	the	efforts	of	all	of	our	
employees	and	thank	them	for	their	
unstinting	commitment,	energy	and	
support	during	another	difficult	year.	
Ian	Croxford,	our	Chief	Operating	
Officer,	and	other	members	of	the	Group	
team	assumed	responsibility	for	the	
Polish	business	early	in	2015	following	
the	departure	of	the	previous	
management	team.	They	have	put	in	
place	a	number	of	key	building	blocks	to	
help	return	the	Polish	business	to	long	
term	growth.	Their	tenure	is	now	coming	
to	an	end,	as	we	welcomed	Bradley	
Holder	as	Stock	Polska	Finance	Director	
in	February	2016,	and	we	are	making	
good	progress	with	the	appointment	of	a	
new	Managing	Director	to	lead	the	
business	forward.
In	the	Czech	Republic,	Jan	Havlis	
joined	from	Procter	&	Gamble	as	the	
new	Managing	Director	in	February	
2016,	and	Petr	Kasa	joined	the	
business	in	December	2015	as	the	 
new	Finance	Director.
During	2015,	Steve	Smith	retired	from	
the	Group	and	Michael	Kennedy	became	
the	Managing	Director	for	International	
and	Italy,	joining	us	from	Drambuie,	
where	he	had	previously	been	the	 
Group	CEO.
We	have	taken	our	time	to	select	the	
right	people	for	these	senior	roles	and	I	
am	delighted	we	will	shortly	have	in	
place	a	full	and	exceptionally	talented	
management	team.
Production
Early	in	2015	we	officially	opened	our	
new	storage	facility	at	our	site	in	Lublin,	
Poland.	The	new	facility	will	provide	us	
with	storage	capacity	of	40,000	pallets	
and	meet	the	demand	arising	from	an	
increasing	number	of	new	liquids	for	
our	new	and	existing	products.	Given	
our	very	busy	agenda	for	new	products	
both	now,	and	in	the	future,	this	
provides	us	with	sufficient	capacity	for	
a	number	of	years	ahead.	We	moved	an	
under-utilised	bottling	line	from	the	
Czech	Plzen	factory	to	Poland	where	it	
is	now	in	full	operation.	
Outlook
As	difficult	as	2015	has	been	I	am	
encouraged	by	the	performance	in	a	
number	of	our	markets,	and	that	the	
strategy	we	have	followed	there	
continues	to	deliver	the	expected	
results.	I	am	positive	that	as	the	market	
develops	the	actions	we	are	taking	in	
Poland	will	over	time	deliver	the	 
desired	results.
We	move	forwards	into	2016	acutely	
aware	of	the	objectives	that	need	to	be	
delivered	and	I	remain	focused	upon	
delivering	an	improvement	in	the	value	
of	the	business.

Spirits market overview
In	every	one	of	the	last	five	years	and	
over	the	last	decade,	total	spirits	
volume	performance	in	Central	and	
Eastern	Europe	was	superior	to	that	of	
Europe	as	a	whole*.	Spirits’	performance	
in	Central	and	Eastern	Europe,	as	in	any	
region,	can	be	impacted	by	temporary	
fluctuations	in	its	local	economies,	but	it	
benefits	from	the	influence	of	
significant	consumer	trends	which,	
when	leveraged	correctly,	can	drive	
sustainable	spirits	value	growth.
Whilst	the	spirits	market	in	Central	and	
Eastern	Europe	is	not	immune	to	
fluctuations	in	local	economies,	its	
sustainable	value	growth	is	
underpinned	by	positive	underlying	
consumer	trends.	
The	growth	of	Stock	Spirits	reflects	our	
ability	to	identify	and	take	advantage	of	
these	trends	by	evolving	our	brand	
portfolio,	supported	by	consistent	
investment	in	brand	communications,	
innovation	and	operational	capabilities.	
In	the	short	term,	disposable	incomes	
fluctuate	with	economic	circumstances,	
but	the	long-term	evolution	of	Central	
and	Eastern	European	markets	has	seen	
a	progressive	growth	in	standards	of	
living	and	disposable	income	and	with	
them	an	expansion	of	consumer	choice	
which	is	positively	impacting	the	demand	
for	higher	value	spirits	in	the	region.	
Desire for affordable luxury
As	disposable	income	grows,	greater	
numbers	of	Central	and	Eastern	
European	consumers	are	able	to	choose	
higher	quality	products	for	which	they	
are	prepared	to	pay	more.	They	seek	
spirits	from	trustworthy	brands	of	
better	and	more	consistent	quality	than	
they	were	able	to	purchase	historically.	
This	can	be	through	a	desire	to	display	
their	own	success,	expertise,	values	or	
life	style	through	their	choice	of	brands,	
but	the	behaviour	can	also	be	driven	by	
the	desire	to	retain	accessible	everyday	
luxuries	when	economic	times	are	
challenging.	Affordable,	perceived	
high-quality	brands	remain	the	
preferred	choice	and	spirits	are	just	
such	an	affordable	luxury.	
Diversification of drinking occasions
The	number	and	variety	of	drinking	
occasions	in	Central	and	Eastern	Europe	
is	changing	over	time,	with	a	gradual	
increase	in	“on	the	go”	and	“out	of	home”	
drinking	occasions	accompanying	
social change.
These	new	drinking	occasions	are	a	
growing	part	of	consumption	routines	
and	are	opening	up	opportunities	for	
different	formats	and	pack	sizes.	For	
example,	ready-to-drink	products	are	
enabling	consumers	to	replicate	
out-of-house	drinking	experiences	in	a	
convenient,	practical	format	on	the	go	 
Key trends
The key consumer 
trends driving spirits’ 
value growth in  
Central and Eastern 
Europe are:
•	 Desire	for	affordable	
luxury
•	 Diversification	of	 
drinking	occasions
•	 Increasing	spirits	
consumption  
by	female	and	younger	 
adult	drinkers
•	 Growing	confidence	in	
local provenance
•	 Raised	awareness	of	
health	and	social	
responsibility. Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 23
or	at	home.	In-home	drinking	is	also	
diversifying	with	a	move	from	traditional	
meal	associated	usage	to	contemporary	
needs	such	as	connoisseurship,	by	
choosing	higher-quality	spirits	as	a	
reward	at	the	end	of	the	day.
Increased spirits consumption amongst 
females and younger adult consumers 
Changes	in	society	in	Central	and	
Eastern	Europe	are	prompting	greater	
consumption	by	female	and	younger	
adult	drinkers	and	these	consumers	
seek	different	tastes	and	alcohol-by-
volume	to	those	available	historically.	
Flavoured	spirits	and	relatively	lower	
alcohol	by	volume	spirits	have	grown	
faster	than	traditional	spirits	in	recent	
years	as	females	and	younger	adult	
drinkers	seek	easy	drinkability	and	
tastes	which	appeal	to	mixed-gender	
groups	of	friends.	There	is	also	a	
growing	desire	for	innovation	and	
novelty	as	these	consumers	see	their	
drinks	choice	as	a	means	of	self-
expression	and	want	to	drink	new	and	
different	flavours.
Growing confidence in local provenance
Immediately	after	the	collapse	of	the	old	
regimes	in	Central	and	Eastern	Europe,	
there	were	a	limited	number	of	high-
quality	brands	of	local	provenance	
available,	a	sense	that	international	
brands	were	superior	coupled	with	a	
historical	suspicion	of	inconsistent	
quality	and	counterfeiting.	Now	that	the	
new	economies	are	longer	established	
and	memories	of	the	old	regimes	are	
fading,	there	is	a	resurgence	of	pride	in	
local	achievements,	provenance	and	
culture	and	a	dawning	recognition	that	
local	brands	can	be	as	good	or	superior	
to	imported	ones.	Local	spirits	remain	
the	vast	majority	of	spirits	volume	in	
Central	and	Eastern	Europe	and	there	is	
a	noticeable	trend	to	drink	better-
quality	exponents	of	those	local	spirits	
from	trusted	brands	and	manufacturers.	
The	fact	that	many	of	these	markets	are	
“dark”	i.e.	marketing	communications	
are	strictly	regulated	and	limited,	makes	
it	difficult	for	imported	brands	to	
steal-share	through	the	deployment	of	
heavyweight	advertising	investment	in	
the	fashion	often	witnessed	in	other	
markets.	In	this	context,	affordable,	
high-quality	local	brands	are	best	placed	
to	act	as	a	bridge	to	the	fulfilment	of	
rising	consumer	aspirations.	
Increasing international mobility
Before	the	fall	of	the	old	regimes	in	
Central	and	Eastern	Europe	and	the	
reunification	of	Europe,	international	
travel	was	extremely	limited	for	the	
residents	of	our	core	markets,	as	were	
direct	encounters	with	other	
international	cultures.	There	were	very	
limited	visits	to	our	markets	by	foreign	
visitors.	The	situation	is	radically	
different	today	and	is	forecast	to	remain	
so	going	forward.	A	combination	of	
greater	numbers	of	consumers	in	our	
core	markets	travelling	widely	abroad,	
for	economic	reasons	as	migrant	
workers,	for	education	or	for	pleasure,	
plus	hugely	increased	numbers	of	
visitors	from	abroad	visiting	our	
markets	for	the	same	reasons	are	
influencing	the	local	drinking	cultures.	
New	usage,	categories	and	drinks	retail	
formats	are	developing	in	response	to	
increased	international	mobility.
Raised awareness of health  
and social responsibility 
A	combination	of	government	
regulation	and	increased	consumer	
awareness	of	the	health	and	social	
responsibility	issues	associated	with	
alcohol	consumption	is	prompting	
demand	for	lower	alcohol	by	volume	
spirits	ranges	and	increased	
consumption	of	spirits	in	longer	mixed	
drinks	rather	than	purely	as	shots,	the	
traditional	mode	of	consumption	in	
much	of	Central	and	Eastern	Europe.	
Spirits	brands	whose	ranges	include	
lower	alcohol-by-volume	and	versatile	
mixers	are	well	placed	to	take	
advantage	of	this	trend.	
Spirits well placed to grow value 
sustainably 
The	combination	of	our	aspirational	
brands,	wide	range	of	innovative	tastes,	
breadth	of	alcohol-by-volume	options	
and	flexible	packaging	formats	means	
Stock	Spirits	Group	is	well	placed	to	
grow	sustainably	in	Central	and	Eastern

consumer	needs.

New Božkov flavours 
 
Three	new	flavours	of	Božkov	Tuzemský	
were	launched	in	the	Czech	Republic,	
bringing	new	tastes	to	a	familiar	favourite.	 
Our	new	products	build	on	the	heritage	and	
taste	of	Božkov	Tuzemský	the	best-selling	
domestic	rum	and	spirit	in	the	Czech	
Republic,	augmented	by	new	flavours.	
Božkov	Special	Almond	marries	the	taste	of	
the	original	recipe	with	bitter	almond	
kernels,	giving	the	drink	a	pleasant	almond	
aroma	and	flavour.	Božkov	Special	Coffee	
combines	the	traditional	flavour	with	
Ethiopian	coffee.	Božkov	Special	Mango	
brings	an	exotic	fruit	flavour.	The	consumers	
involved	in	the	development	of	the	three	
new	Božkov	Special	flavours	were	very	taken	
with	the	unexpectedly	smoother	flavour	and	
sweeter	aftertaste,	which	go	very	well	when	
combined	with	the	hugely	popular	
“tuzemský”	taste.	This	gives	our	consumers	
their	favourite	traditional	flavour	with	a	new,	
unexpected	twist	and	has	contributed	to	
Božkov	volume,	value	and	share	growth	
ahead	of	the	category	during	2015.
Golden Ice Plum 
 
Fruit	spirits	is	the	second	biggest	spirits	
category	in	Slovakia.   
 
Following	the	acquisition	of	Imperator,	
Golden,	the	second	biggest	brand	in	Fruit	
Spirits,	joined	the	Stock	Spirits	portfolio.	An	
opportunity	was	identified	to	build	on	
Golden’s	established	equity	by	introducing	
innovative	taste	attributes	to	differentiate	
within	the	category	and	command	a	price	
premium.	The	concept	of	“ice	wines”,	offering	
greater	sweetness	and	fuller	taste,	was	
increasingly	familiar	to	affluent	Slovakians.	
Stock	was	able	to	introduce	the	“Ice”	concept	
to	the	fruit	spirits	category	to	enhance	
perceived	quality	and	taste	delivery.	Golden	
“Ladová	Slivka”	(Ice	Plum)	is	a	new	twist	on	a	
traditional	Slovak	recipe.	Smooth	and	strong,	
it	combines	true	fruit	distillate	with	high	
quality	spirits	to	produce	a	full,	sweet	taste	
and	delicate	aroma.	The	bottle	incorporates	
matt	frosting	to	enhance	the	“ice”	impression.

and	most	frequent	direct	contact	with	all	of	
our	consumers.
It	is	a	key	vehicle	to	communicate	our	brands’

Stock	Spirits	reviews	the	perception	and	
effectiveness	of	its	packaging	designs	versus	
the	competitive	set	via	continuous	brand	
health	tracking	research.	This	led	to	
evolutionary	design	changes	on	three	of	our	
core	brands	during	2015	to	enhance	
consumer	appeal	and	on	shelf	impact.	The	
� Zoł ˛ adkowa	Gorzka	range	design	evolved	to	
convey	a	greater	sense	of	the	brands

differentiate	its	flavours.	 � Zoł ˛ adkowa	De

look	and	an	improved	size	perception	
through	its	new	taller	bottles.	Božkov

Saska  
 
Saska	is	a	new	and	unique	range	of	vodkas	
and	vodka-based	liqueurs	for	those	who	
enjoy	high	quality	spirits	created	in	the	 
time	honoured	Polish	tradition	delivered	 
in	a	stylish,	contemporary	design.	 
 
Capturing	the	essence	of	Polish	hospitality	
and	many	years	of	master	distilling	
experience,	Saska’s	unique,	distinctive	range	
of	tastes	are	designed	to	be	savoured	and	are	
best	enjoyed	in	an	unhurried	manner.	
Tradition,	experience	and	patience	are	the	
essence	of	the	Saska	range,	which	includes	
both	clear	and	flavoured	varieties.	Saska’s	
unique	flavours	are	inspired	by	tinctures	
created	in	the	great	Polish	aristocratic	
mansions	in	the	times	of	feasting	and	
hospitality	embodied	by	the	Saska	dynasty	
from	which	the	brand	takes	its	name.	Our	
modern	master	distillers	drew	their	
inspiration	from	these	historic	Polish	recipes,	
creating	a	range	that	includes	an	appealing	
combination	of	distinctive	fruit	aromas	Saska	
Czarny	Bez	(Black	Elderberry),	Saska	Dzika	
Róża	(Wild	Rose)	and	Saska	Śliwka	Węgierka	
(Plum),	Saska	Debowa	with	hints	of	oak	and	
the	refined,	crystal	clear	taste	of	the	finest	
vodka	in	Saska	Czystas.
Fernet Cranberry  
 
Slovakia	has	a	long	tradition	of	fruit-based	
spirit	distillation	and	consumers	there	have	a	
high	interest	in	fruit	tastes,	as	exemplified	by	
the	leading	herbal	bitter	in	Slovakia	being	the	
fruitier	Fernet	Stock	Citrus	rather	than	the	
more	bitter	Fernet	Stock	Original	which	is	 
the	leading	bitter	in	the	Czech	Republic.	
Fernet	Stock	Cranberry	was	launched	to	
build	on	the	strength	of	the	Fernet	brand	in	
Slovakia,	to	expand	consumption	and	
frequency	amongst	the	new	emerging	
generation	of	young	adult	drinkers	who	are	
looking	for	novel	new	tastes	with	an	easier	
drinkability	that	can	be	shared	with	mixed	
groups	of	male	and	female	friends.	The	
introduction	of	Fernet	Stock	Cranberry	met	
their	needs	and	contributed	to	brand	
volume,	value	and	share	growth	in	Slovakia	
during	2015.
Lionello Stock  
Vermouth and Aperitivo  
Growing	consumer	and	customer	interest	in	the	
vermouth	and	aperitivo	categories	as	bases	for	
numerous cocktail recipes provided	an	
opportunity	for	Stock	to	revitalise	its	vermouth	
portfolio	to	meet	our	customer	needs	and	
expand	share	in	a	neighbouring	category	to	
spirits	leveraging	our	strong	brand	name.
Three	classic	vermouth	flavours,	rooted	in	
Stock’s	proud	Italian	heritage,	branded	with	
the	name	of	our	entrepreneurial	founder,	
Lionello	Stock,	were	launched	in	2015,	Extra	
Dry,	Bianco	and	Rosso.	We	also	launched	a	
Lionello	Aperitivo	to	gain	share	of	the	
fashionable	and	growing	prosecco	and	
aperitivo	cocktail	trend	visible	in	many	of	our	
markets.	Our	original	recipes	are	so	
perfectly	balanced	that	not	one	of	over	50	
botanicals	in	the	secret	blend	overwhelms	
the	taste,	helping	to	create	the	perfect

our	authentic	company	history. Strategic report

Key brands
Poland	is	the	Group’s	largest	and 
most	important	market.
Following	a	challenging	2014,	which	 
had	been	impacted	by	the	15%	duty	
increase	and	the	subsequent	prolonged	
disruption	in	the	Polish	market	(as	
discussed	in	last	year’s	annual	report),	
we	anticipated	a	difficult	start	to	2015	
which	proved	to	be	the	case,	with	a	very	
poor	result	in	the	first	quarter	adversely	
affecting	the	full	year	result.	
As	we	reported	at	our	half -year	results	in	
August,	in	January	2015	we	replaced	the	
previous	senior	management	in	Poland	with	
senior	executives	from	the	Stock	Group	
management	team.	This	team	set	about	
stabilising	our	Polish	business,	restructuring	
our	sales	force	and	rebuilding	important	
customer	relationships,	creating	a	new	
premium	HORECA	(on-trade)	sales	team	
and	reinvigorating	our	new	product	
development	programme.	
At	the	half-year ,	we	reported	that	
although	we	were	fighting	back	with	what	
we	believe	are	the	right	long-term	
initiatives,	the	market	was	proving	to	be	
very	tough	given	the	significant	price	
pressure	being	exerted	by	major	
competitors,	and	the	accelerated	growth	
of	the	discounter	channel.
Encouragingly,	as	the	year	progressed,	
consumer	demand	trends	steadily	
improved	and	compared	to	2014,	vodka	
sales	finally	closed	the	year	at	-2.2%	in	
volume	terms	and	remained	broadly	flat	
in	value	terms.
However ,	the	tough	trading	conditions	
seen	in	H1	continued	into	the	second	half	
of	the	year.	In	some	areas,	competitors	
became	even	more	aggressive,	seemingly	
willing	to	reduce	their	margins	further	to	
drive	volume	and	market	share	gains.	By	
nature	of	their	scale,	the	clear	mainstream	
and	clear	economy	vodka	sectors	were	
the	primary	battle	grounds	and	we	ceded	
market	share	in	these	areas	as	we	chose	
not	to	match	competitor	discounting.
Despite	the	continued	difficult	trading	
environment,	we	made	good	progress	
during	the	year	on	many	of	the	essential	
commercial	initiatives	we	introduced,	
with	a	continued	focus	upon	value	
accretion.	As	a	result,	margins	
significantly	improved	in	the	second	half,	
cash	generation	was	strong	and	the	
business	developed	a	stronger	portfolio	
of	products	for	the	future.	
However ,	in	November ,	our	consistent	
investment	in	support	of	the	traditional	
trade	was	challenged	when	a	number	of	
key	wholesalers	supplying	that	channel	
did	not	order	in	line	with	expectations.	
Given	the	significance	of	normal	trading	
levels	in	the	lead	up	to	the	important	
Christmas	season,	this	resulted	in	the	
Group	having	to	issue	revised	full	year	
profit	guidance.
Following	this	we	initiated	a	'root	and	
branch'	review	of	the	Polish	business.	This	
has	confirmed	our	understanding	of	the	
market	and	trading	conditions,	identified	
key	trends	and	areas	of	focus	for	us	and	
we	are	adapting	our	plans	to	address	the	
findings	of	this	review.	Details	are	
provided	in	the	CEO's	statement.
A	proposal	to	introduce	new	retail	tax	
during	2016	is	currently	being	discussed	
by	the	Polish	government.	It	is	not	yet	
clear	how	this	could	impact	the	spirits	
sector ,	but	we	are	monitoring	this	very	
carefully	and	will	take	appropriate	action	
if	it	is	introduced.
The	full	year	results	show	Net	sales	
revenue	of	€137.2m	and	EBITDA	of	
€37.7m.

Our core brands
The	relaunch	of	our	mainstream	clear	
vodka	brand,	 �Zoł˛ adkowa	de	Luxe,	in	new	
improved	packaging	helped	strengthen	
the	brand’s	equity	from	a	consumer	
perspective.	Consumer	research	results	
post	the	re-launch	have	highlighted	that	
the	brand	has	further	improved	its	
perception	across	a	number	of	key	
consumer	parameters.	In	such	a	tough	
trading	environment	this	improved	
brand	equity	remains	a	strong	positive.	
Market	share	of	the	brand	has	however	
been	impacted	by	the	price	war	
instigated	by	our	competitors	and	the	
brand	has	suffered	a	significant	loss	of	
market	share	as	a	consequence.
The	Lubelska	range	has	been	extended	
with	the	launch	of	a	number	of	new	
flavours	including	new	limited	edition	
variants	in	the	largest	flavour	segment,	
lemon,	whilst	the	iconic	 �Zoł˛ adkowa 
Gorzka	brand	has	been	refreshed	with	
new	improved	packaging	and	a	new	fig	
flavour	variant.	
Our	investment	in	strengthening	the	
brand	equity	of	our	core	flavoured	
brands	coupled	with	the	continuous	
programme	of	innovation	has	enabled	
Stock	to	retain	its	leadership	position	in	
this	sector	against	a	much	more	
aggressively	priced	competitive	set	than	
was	historically	present	in	the	market.
NPD
We	launched	33	new	products	in	2015.	
The	majority	of	these	are	focused	on	
the	ongoing	premiumisation	of	our	
portfolio	and	all	are	margin	accretive.
A	number	of	new	premium	products	
were	showcased	at	the	half-year,	such	
as	Amundsen	Expedition	vodka	and	
Stock	Sparkling	vodka,	which	are	
designed	to	grow	our	share	of	the	
premium	segment.	In	the	second	half	 
of	the	year	a	new	range	of	clear	and	
flavoured	vodkas	have	been	launched	
under	the	Saska	brand.	This	is	a	
premium,	contemporary	range	 
rooted	in	the	finest	Polish	distilling	
traditions,	with	innovative	new	and	
appealing	flavours.
To	further	strengthen	our	support	for	
the	traditional	trade	we	have	re-
launched	our	economy	Balsam	Kresowy	
brand	in	new	packaging,	with	a	new	
range	of	flavours,	including	a	clear	
vodka,	as	a	differentiated	product	
specifically	for	the	traditional	trade.
A	number	of	other	new	products	were	
also	launched	in	other	growing	spirits	
categories	which	offered	incremental	
margin	to	our	portfolio.
Whilst	the	impact	of	the	recent	
launches	was	not	material	in	2015,	we	
have	developed	a	strong	portfolio	to	
take	into	2016	and	beyond,	with	a	
well-developed	pipeline	of	new	
products	lined	up	for	the	future.
Distribution brands
We	made	a	great	start	with	the	initial	
distribution	of	Beam	Suntory	brands 
in	Poland	in	2014	and	this	success	
continued	in	2015,	with	Jim	Beam	
recording	further	volume,	value	and	
share	growth	and	increasing	its	share 
of	the	important	and	growing	 
whiskey	category.	
Here	we	have	demonstrated	again	that	
we	can	satisfy	the	strategic	objectives	
of	our	partners	whilst	at	the	same	time	
strengthening	the	platform	from	which	
we	are	able	to	develop	and	launch	 
our	own	premium	brands.	
New management team
We	are	making	good	progress	on	 
the	appointment	of	the	new	 
Managing	Director.
In	February	2016,	Bradley	Holder	
joined	the	team	as	the	new	Finance	
Director	of	our	Polish	business.	Bradley	
has	a	comprehensive	understanding	of	
the	beverage	market,	having	previously	
worked	for	both	Pepsi	and	Coca	Cola	
and	having	lived	and	worked	in	Poland	
for	the	last	20	years.
Future outlook
We	have	many	pillars	of	strength	from	
which	to	move	forwards	and	return	our	
Polish	business	to	growth.	The	business	
has	a	strong	portfolio	of	brands,	
significant	balance	sheet	strength,	a	
strong	track	record	of	new	product	
development,	a	well	invested,	high	
quality,	low	cost	manufacturing	base,	
and	a	new	and	highly	experienced	new	
management	team.
The	recent	'root	and	branch'	review	has	
identified	a	number	of	areas	where	we	
perform	well	and	some	areas	where	we	
need	to	improve.	It	will	take	time	to	
implement	all	of	the	planned	changes	
but	these	areas	are	now	being	
addressed	with	the	full	commitment	 
of	the	management	team.

back	to	full	strength	and	moves	forward	
from	a	position	of	strength	with	
ambitious	plans	for	the	future.
Regulatory changes
The	Czech	government	has	announced	
a	number	of	changes	that	may	come	into	
force	during	2016	which,	we	anticipate,	
will	impact	alcohol	consumption.	
The	first	is	a	ban	on	smoking	in	all	on	
trade	outlets,	e.g.	restaurants,	bars	and	
pubs.	Based	on	the	experience	in	other	
countries	when	a	smoking	ban	has 
been	introduced,	we	expect	there	to	 
be	a	short-term	decline	in	alcohol	
consumption,	followed	by	a	mid- 
term	recovery.	
A	further	measure	is	the	compulsory	
introduction	of	electronic	cash	
machines	in	all	on-trade	outlets	to	
provide	detailed	records	of	all	sales.	
There	is	little	precedent	of	the	impact	
that	this	measure	may	have,	but	we	
expect	that	a	number	of	smaller,	
down-market	outlets	will	close	as	a	
result.	We	expect	some	of	the	lost	
sales	from	these	outlets	will	be	
recovered	in	those	which	remain	open,	
but	there	may	be	an	overall	reduction	
in	alcohol	sales,	particularly	of	
economy	products.	
In	anticipation	of	these	measures,	 
we	have	undertaken	a	review	of	our	
commercial	and	marketing	approach	 
to	the	on-trade	and	have	begun	to	
implement	a	number	of	changes	which	
we	anticipate	will	help	to	mitigate	most	
of	the	potential	risks.

Italy	is	our	third	largest	market	in	
turnover	and	profit	terms.	The	market	
remains	highly	fragmented	from	a	
supply	perspective:	spirits	are	the	third	
largest	category	within	alcoholic	drinks	
in	Italy,	with	wine	and	beer	remaining	
larger	by	volume*.	The	spirits	market	
consists	of	a	number	of	mature	
categories,	including	bitters,	vodka,	
brandy,	whisky	and	liqueurs.	Despite	
our	relatively	small	overall	share	of	total	
spirits	in	Italy,	at	5.8%	value	share,	in	
our	key	focus	modern	trade	channel**	
we	hold	leading	positions	in	a	number	of	
key	categories	in	the	off-trade,	with	the	
number	one	brands	in	the	clear	vodka,	
vodka-based	liqueurs	and	limoncello	
categories	and	the	number	two	brand	in	
the	brandy	category.***
Whilst	trading	conditions	remain	very	
tough	in	Italy,	there	are	some	
improvements	in	consumer	confidence,	
and	the	economy	is	beginning	to	show	
some	growth	after	a	number	of	years	 
of	decline.
The	long-term	volume	decline	of	the	
spirits	market	has	been	impacted	by	the	
four	recently	introduced	excise	duty	
increases	and	a	VAT	increase.	In	2015,	
the	market	declined	by	a	further	2.5%	in	
volume,	but	grew	by	0.6%	in	value.**
In	our	main	categories,	clear	vodka	
achieved	volume	and	value	growth	in	
2015.	Keglevich	remains	the	leading	
clear	vodka	in	the	off-trade	in	Italy	and	
we	grew	our	volume	and	value	share	of	
this	important	category	during	2015.	
Our	Keglevich	flavoured	range	also	
outperformed	the	category	and	we	
retained	our	number	one	position.***
In	the	contracting	limoncello	category,	
Limoncé	retained	brand	leadership	and	
held	share	in	spite	of	competition	from	
aggressively	priced	private	label	and	
rival	competitor	brands.***
The	category	most	impacted	by	the	
duty	increases,	together	with	the	rise	
in	wine	distillate	costs	during	2014,	
was	brandy.	The	increase	in	shelf	prices	
has	caused	a	significant	decline	in	
category	volumes	and	value	and	we	
have	been	the	most	heavily	affected	 
of	the	leading	brands.***
Our	overall	Net	sales	revenue	has	
declined	versus	last	year,	primarily	
reflecting	the	decline	in	brandy	
volumes.	EBITDA	is	slightly	lower	than	
last	year,	however	EBITDA	margins	
have	remained	in	line	with	2014,	
following	careful	cost	management.
Duty and VAT increases
Following	the	four	recently	introduced	
excise	duty	increases,	resulting	in	a	
cumulative	29%	increase	in	excise	duty	
since	October	2013,	there	have	been	
no	additional	increases	since	January	
2015.	No	further	excise	duty	increases	
have	been	announced.	However,	the	
new	Italian	Stability	Law	of	2016	 
has,	subject	to	the	performance	of	 
the	economy	over	the	next	year,	
introduced	a	potential	VAT	increase	 
to	24%	from	1	January	2017	and	a	
further	rise	to	25%	in	2018.

The	regional	report	for	“Other”	markets	
includes	Slovakia,	Bosnia,	Croatia	and	
our	export	activities.
In	2015,	we	delivered	an	increase	in	net	
sales	revenue	to	€30.3m	and	an	increase	
in	both	EBITDA	to	€5.1m	and	EBITDA	
margin	to	16.9%.	
Growth	was	particularly	strong	in	Slovakia	
where	our	previous	investment	in	
enhanced	sales	and	marketing	capabilities	
and	new	product	launches	following	the	
acquisition	of	Imperator ,	is	now	making	
positive	returns.	New	products	launched	in	
2014	and	2015,	such	as	the	Golden	Iced	
fruit	spirits	range	&	Fernet	Stock	herbal	
bitters	new	flavours,	have	performed	
particularly	well.	
These	initiatives	contributed	to	growth	
of	Stock’s	volume	and	value	ahead	of	the	
total	spirits	category	in	2015	and	
reinforced	our	position	as	the	second-
biggest	spirits	company	in	the	Slovakian	
off-trade.	MAT	%	value	share	grew	from	
11.3%	last	year	to	12.1%	this	year.	*
Stock	grew	absolute	volume,	value	and	
market	share	in	Slovakia	in	all	of	the	core	
herbal	bitters,	fruit	spirits	and	vodka	
categories	during	2015.*
Building	on	the	earlier	success	of	Golden	
Iced	Pear	in	the	fruit	spirits	category,	a	
new	variant,	Golden	Iced	Plum,	was	
launched	in	September.	The	consumer	
appeal	of	the	Golden	Iced	range	helped	
Stock	to	grow	volume	and	value	ahead	of	
the	fruit	spirits	category,	achieving	an	
increase	in	value	share	from	17 .8%	last	
year	to	19.7%	this	year.**
In	the	herbal	bitters	category,	we	
launched	innovative	new	flavours,	
including	Fernet	Cranberry,	which	have	
been	very	well	received	by	consumers.	
These	launches	were	followed	by	the	
addition	of	Fernet	Grand,	a	more	
premium	expression	of	the	brand	aimed	
primarily	at	on	trade	consumption.	Our	
value	share	of	herbal	bitters	was	39.2%	
at	the	end	of	2015,	a	growth	of	1.4%	
versus	the	previous	year.***
Our	continued	investment	in	media	
advertising,	and	the	effectiveness	of	the	
enlarged	sales	force,	have	helped	to	drive	
strong	annual	results	for	Slovakia.	
EBITDA	has	grown	by	22%	during	the	
year	and	EBITDA	margin	has	improved	
by	just	over	3%	points	to	22%.
Our	fully	owned	businesses	in	Croatia	and	
Bosnia	performed	well	in	2015,	with	
turnover	growth	of	15%	and	29%	
respectively	versus	the	prior	year.	The	
introduction	of	the	Beam	Suntory	brands	
in	Croatia	and	Bosnia	have	contributed	
to	the	positive	results	in	these	markets.	
Our	export	activity	has	also	seen	
excellent	results,	following	a	detailed	
review	of	the	product	portfolio	for	
individual	markets,	and	a	reorganisation	
of	the	sales	team.	UK,	Germany	and

Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 38
We	pride	ourselves	on	our	well-invested,	
highly	efficient	and	low	cost	
manufacturing	facilities.	Annual	
investment	is	vital	to	maintain	this	
competitive	strength,	and	in	2015	 
we	have	continued	with	our 
investment	programme.	
At	the	end	of	2014,	we	opened	our	new	
liquid	processing	and	storage	facilities	
in	Poland.	This	has	provided	us	with	
greater	flexibility	around	liquid	
processing	and	storage	to	meet	the	
demands	of	our	ever	increasing	range	of	
liquids.	The	new	facilities	have	enabled	
us	to	successfully	produce	new	
products	during	the	year,	without	
impacting	efficiency	or	the	cost	base.	It	
also	provides	the	Group	with	capacity	
for	future	growth	in	our	liquid	portfolio.	
Further	investment	was	made	in	
production	capability	to	support	new	
products,	along	with	maintenance	of	
our	fire	safety	systems,	and	we	moved	
under-utilised	bottling	equipment	from	
our	plant	in	Plzen	in	the	Czech	Republic	
to	Poland,	where	this	is	now	in	full	
service	and	still	offers	further	 
capacity	headroom.
Overall	efficiency	levels	have	improved	
since	2014,	including	increased	bottling	
line	speeds,	which,	given	the	level	of	
new	products	introduced	in	the	year	
and	lower	volumes,	is	a	testament	to	the	
flexibility	of	our	facilities.	Line	efficiency	
in	Plzen	alone	improved	by	13%	through	
training	programs	and	investment	in	
maintenance.	We	have,	importantly,	
begun	investment	in	new	production	
technology	to	support	our	pipeline	 
of	new	products.
During	the	year	we	opened	a	purpose-
built	new	warehouse	in	Poland.	Over	
the	half-year-end,	both	the	old	and	new	
warehouses	were	operational	and,	as	a	
consequence,	inventory	levels	were	
higher	than	normal	during	this	
transition	period.	The	old	warehouse	is	
now	closed	and	inventory	levels	have	
returned	to	more	normal	levels.	The	
new	warehouse	will	allow	more	
efficient	and	flexible	loading	in 
addition	to	improvements	in	 
inventory	management.
The	Drietoma	site	in	Slovakia,	which	we	
had	closed	in	2014	following	the	full	
integration	of	the	operation	into	the	
Plzen	facility,	was	sold	in	early	2015.
Further	investment	has	been	made	
during	the	year	in	our	IT	infrastructure,	
which	included	a	new	warehouse	
management	system	for	our	new	
warehouse	in	Poland	which	will	go	live	
in	the	first	half	of	2016,	and	a	major	
system	upgrade	for	the	ERP	system	
supporting	our	Italian	business.
We have continued  
to invest in new 
production technology 
to support our pipeline 
of new products
Operations Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 39
Overview
Our	people	remain	a	core	strength	to	
the	Group	and	they	have	continued	 
to	show	energy	and	support	during	
another	challenging	year.
The	structure	of	the	Group	remains	
largely	unchanged	from	2014	and	it	
employs	923	people*	across	our	
markets,	service	centres	and	in	our	
Group	office.
During	2015,	we	continued	to	invest	in	
standards	and	competency,	particularly	
in	the	commercial	and	sales	area	and	in	
operations.	We	have	progressed	the	
Marketing	Academy	we	began	in	2013	
and	are	now	moving	into	our	fourth	
year	of	this	very	successful	activity	to	
recruit	undergraduates	for	a	one	year	
internship	into	our	local	marketing	
teams.	This	provides	us	with	invaluable	
insights	from	core	target	consumers	as	
well	as	providing	them	with	high	quality	
training	and	work	experience.
In	Operations,	the	Stock	Academy	in	
Lublin	has	delivered	further	training	in	
technical,	health	and	safety,	
communication	skills	and	other	training	
requirements.	English	language	courses	
continue	to	be	very	popular	amongst	
the	workforce,	with	23	employees	
attending	English	language	courses	
during	2015.
Recruitment
A	key	focus	for	the	business	during	2015	
was	the	recruitment	of	a	number	of	new	
senior	management	positions.	This	
activity	has	taken	time	to	select	the	right	
candidates	with	the	skills	to	move	the	
business	to	its	next	stage	of	development.
We	have	now	appointed	new	Managing	
Directors	for	the	International	and	
Italian	business	and	the	Czech	Republic,	
together	with	new	Finance	Directors	
for	Poland	and	Czech.	All	the	new	
members	of	the	senior	team	have	very	
strong	FMCG	backgrounds,	local	
market	expertise	and	substantial	
experience	at	senior	levels	in	blue-chip	
organisations.	Their	depth	of	
experience	and	commercial	skills	will	
assist	in	leading	the	business	forwards.
Internal	promotions	have	seen	a	
number	of	employees	move	into	more	
senior	roles,	as	we	develop	our	own	
talent	and	succession	planning.
The	members	of	the	Group	team	who	
have	been	running	the	Polish	business,	
and	have	been	based	in	Poland	for	the	
last	year,	will	return	to	their	previous	
Group	roles.
'One Stock'
We	have	launched	a	programme	of	
cultural	and	organisational	change	to	
support	the	Group's	strategy	and	help	
to	integrate	the	business	further.	The	
programme,	'One	Stock',	encompasses	
best	practice	in	internal	communication,	
employee	engagement,	leadership	
development,	succession	planning	 
and	development	of	core	capabilities	
by function.
Together	with	a	full	management	team	
and	a	revised	strategy,	this	programme	
can	gather	momentum	to	support	the	
future	development	of	the	Group.
Training and development
We	continue	to	support	our	people	
through	training	and	development,	so	
that	they	can	both	grow	professionally,	
and	meet	the	evolving	challenges	of	 
our	industry.	We	also	care	about	a	
diverse	workforce.
In	our	production	plant	in	Lublin	
(Poland),	during	2015,	there	were	just	
under	9,000	hours	of	training,	with	the	
average	employee	receiving	a	week's	
(35	hours)	training.
As	part	of	our	management	and	talent	
development	programme,	we	
developed	a	bespoke	post	graduate	
diploma	with	a	renowned	university	in	
Poland	(Kozminsky),	and	21	employees	
from	all	levels	and	departments	within	
the	operations	team	participated	in	the	
program	and	completed	their	post-
graduate	studies	in	management.
As	an	example	of	our	internal	
promotion	programs,	in	the	same	plant	
in	Lublin,	all	mid-level	managers	are	
employees	that	have	been	promoted	
from	operators'	positions.
A key focus for the 
business during 2015 
was the recruitment  
of a number of new 
senior management 
positions

recycle	93%	of	the	waste	we	produced	
on	site.	We	reduced	electricity	usage	
by	16%,	gas	by	36%	and	water	by	34%	
compared	to	last	year.
Our	health	and	safety	mascot	in	Poland,	‘Sztosia’	together	with	‘Sztokus’. Strategic report
Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 42
Following	the	success	of	the	"Sztokus"	
initiative,	in	2015	we	introduced	
another	mascot	named	"Sztosia"	(image	
on	previous	page),	as	the	partner	of	
Sztokus,	to	represent	safety	awareness	
and	to	promote	a	series	of	specific	
health	and	safety	initiatives.
Czech	Republic
In	2015,	employees	received	training	in	
waste	reduction,	improving	recycling	
efficiency	and	chemical	management	
processes.	We	are	also	intending	to	roll	
out	a	"Sztokus"	style	environmental	
awareness	campaign	in	the	Czech	
Republic	during	2016.		
Workplace
We	continue	to	support	our	people	
through	training	and	development,	so	
that	they	can	both	grow	professionally,	
and	meet	the	evolving	challenges	of	 
our	industry.	We	also	care	about	a	
diverse	workforce.
Diversity
The	success	of	a	business	depends	on	its	
people,	therefore	we	are	committed	to	
providing	every	employee	and	potential	
employee	with	equal	opportunity	in	all	
areas	of	employment.	The	Group	
recognises	the	communities	in	which	it	
operates	and	the	benefits	of	having	a	
diverse	workforce	at	all	levels.
The	Group	takes	its	responsibilities	with	
regard	to	equality	and	diversity	
seriously	and	expects	all	employees	to	
observe	this	also.	This	is	underpinned	by	
our	Equality	and	Diversity	policy	which	
can	be	found	on	our	website.
The	senior	management	teams	in	our	
markets comprise mainly local nationals 
who	understand	the	cultures	in	which	
we	operate.	We	have	a	recruitment	
policy	to	ensure	that	we	recruit	high	
calibre	individuals	matched	to	the	
requirements	of	the	role	we	wish	them	
to	undertake,	irrespective	of	gender,	
age,	race,	religion,	sexual	orientation,	
national	origin	or	disability.	As	a	
consumer-focused	business,	we	
recognise	the	value	that	a	diverse	mix	of	
employees	provides	us	with,	particularly	
in	terms	of	consumer	insights.
As	an	example	of	our	diversity,	at	 
31	December	2015	we	had	a	diverse	
mix	of	age	with	13%	under	30	and	18%	
over	50	years	old,	and	in	the	bottling	
area,	3	out	of	4	shift	leaders	are	women.	
In	our	production	plant	in	Czech	
Republic,	69%	of	the	managerial	
positions	are	held	by	women.
As	at	31	December	2015,	at	Board	level,	
83%	(5	out	of	6)	Directors	are	male,	
while	at	a	senior	management	level	88%	
(7	out	of	8)	are	male	and	across	the	
Group	61%	(560	out	of	923)	of	all	
employees	are	male.
Human rights
The	Group	complies	fully	with	relevant	
legislation	in	the	countries	in	which	it	
operates	and	ensures	that	human	rights	
are	protected	in	all	the	production	
plants	and	offices	from	which	the	Group	
operates.	As	mentioned	previously,	we	
have	a	Code	of	Conduct	which	we	ask	
all	our	suppliers	to	adhere	to	which	
requires	that	they	and	the	persons	
acting	on	their	behalf	act	without	
regard	to	gender,	age,	race,	religion,	
sexual	orientation,	national	origin	or	
disability	in	accordance	with	our	
Equality	and	Diversity	Policy.

Kate	Adams,	artist,	co-founder	and	director	of	Project	Art	Works,	said:	
“Project	Art	Works	feels	immensely	privileged	to	work	with	Stock	Spirits	in	this	way.	It	generates	a	sense	of	value	
around	the	work	for	our	participants	and	provides	a	unique	route	into	its	wider	dissemination.	Corporate	giving	is	
an	increasingly	important	part	of	our	funding	and	companies	such	as	Stock	Spirits	Group	who	have	supported	us

Strategic	report
Stock	Spirits	Group	|	Annual	Report	&	Accounts	2015 44 Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 45
As	has	already	been	commented	in	
earlier	sections	of	this	report,	the	full	
year	results	are	disappointing	given	the	
favourable	results	in	many	of	our	
markets,	the	initiatives	which	have	been	
undertaken	in	Poland	to	address	the	
supply	chain	disruption	which	continued	
into	2015,	and	the	impact	of	very	
aggressive	competitor	activity.
At	our	half-year	results	we	reported	
that	the	Group	had	experienced	a	very	
poor	quarter	1,	due	to	trading	issues	in	
Poland.	We	experienced	further	trading	
issues	in	Poland	during	quarter	4	due	to	
erratic	buying	patterns	of	key	
customers.	Volumes	were	directly	
affected	which,	as	a	consequence,	has	
impacted	Net	sales	revenue	and	
operating	profit.
Net	sales	revenue	of	€262.6m	has	
reduced	from	€292.7m	in	2014.	The	
Group	has	continued	to	premiumise	its	
portfolio	during	2015	through	the	
launch	of	new	products,	many	in	higher	
margin	categories,	and	are	discussed	on	
page	26,	together	with	improvements	to	
market	and	product	mix,	and	modest	
price	increases,	which	has	enabled	the	
Group	to	increase	the	net	sales	price	
per	case	by	10%.
Overall	cost	of	goods	has	decreased	year	
on	year	as	a	result	of	lower	volumes,	
from	€138.8m	in	2014	down	to	€122.0m	
in	2015.	On	a	unit	cost	basis	the	cost	of	
direct	materials	and	conversion	cost	has	
in	fact	reduced	in	2015	versus	2014,	
with	much	of	the	decrease	associated	
with	reduced	cost	of	grain	and	alcohol.	
The	increase	in	cost	per	case	from	€9.64	
per	case	in	2014	to	€10.38	per	case	is	
driven	entirely	by	product	mix.
Selling	costs	show	a	decrease	versus	
2014	due	to	lower	volumes.
Other	operating	expenses	reflect	a	
number	of	costs	that	have	been	
incurred	to	re-stabilise	the	Polish	
business.	These	costs	relate	to	items	
such	as	severance	costs	of	the	former	
management	team,	recruitment	costs	of	
the	new	management	team,	additional	
consultancy	costs,	etc.	In	addition,	
advisors	fees	(e.g.	legal)	for	the	cost	of	
refinancing	the	business,	and	€1.3m	of	
negative	foreign	exchange	cost	are	
included	in	other	operating	expenses.	
These	costs	have	not	been	shown	as	
either	exceptional	or	non-recurring,	
although	we	expect	them	to	be	of	a	
non-recurring	nature,	and	constitute	a	
significant	portion	of	the	increase	in	
other	operating	expenses	versus	2014.	
Whilst	the	costs	of	refinancing	are	
borne	within	other	operating	expenses	
the	benefit	arising	from	this	activity	will	
be	shown	within	finance	expenses,	and	
more	detail	is	provided	later.	Other	
operating	expenses	also	include €0.7m 
(2014:	€0.03m)	of	non-cash	costs	
relating	to	the	performance	share	plan	
and	share-based	payments	scheme.
Operating	profit	has	decreased	to	
€41.7m	from	€53.6m	in	2014	and	
reported	profit	from	€35.8m	to	€19.4m.
Within	note	6	of	the	accounts	the	market	
segmentation	includes	Corporate	costs.	
This	segment	includes	the	costs	of	the	
head	office	in	the	UK,	the	service	centre	
in	Switzerland	(Group	procurement	and	
operations),	costs	of	the	Group	
performance	share	plan,	expenses	
associated	with	being	a	listed	Company,	
the	costs	of	the	Board	and	a	number	of	
Group	wide	costs,	such	as	Group	
insurance,	bank	refinancing	etc.		The	
majority	of	costs	in	this	segment	are	
borne	in	either	GB	Pounds	or	Swiss	
Francs.	The	strengthening	of	these	
currencies	versus	the	Euro	in	2015	has	
resulted	in	a	negative	translation	FX	
impact	of	€1.6m.	As	a	consequence,	this	
results	in	an	apparent	increase	in	these	
costs	versus	2014	to	the	extent	of	this	
negative	impact.	During	the	year	
significant	initiatives	have	been	
undertaken	to	reduce	the	level	of	
Corporate	costs.	The	change	of	auditors	
following	the	tender	process	in	2014	
has	resulted	in	a	decrease	in	auditors	
fees,	both	at	the	Group	level	and	in	our	
markets,	as	shown	in	note	12	of	the	
accounts.	We	have	successfully	
undertaken	a	tendering	process	for	the	
provision	of	the	Annual	Report	&	
Accounts	and	corporate	website,	and	
moved	to	a	new	supplier	which	has	
reduced	the	cost	of	this	service.	Our	
group	insurance	costs	have	been	reduced	
following	a	review	of	our	insurance	
arrangements	and	the	level	of	investment	
that	has	been	made	in	fire	prevention	
systems	and	health	and	safety	operations	
at	our	production	locations,	the	benefit	
will	be	realised	in	2016.
For	internal	purposes	the	Group	uses	
EBITDA	to	measure	the	performance	of	
the	business.	The	adjusted	EBITDA	for	
the	Group	for	the	full	year	2015	is	
€53.7m	(2014:	€66.4m)	which	includes	
the	impact	of	€1.6m	of	negative	foreign	
exchange	impact	versus	2014.	Details	of	
the	adjustments	are	contained	within	
note	7	to	the	accounts.
Non-recurring and exceptional costs
In	2015	there	have	been	no	exceptional	
costs,	and	non-recurring	costs	of	€1.0m	
are	associated	with	the	disposal	and	
impairment	of	fixed	assets.	In	the	prior	
year	the	costs	relating	to	exceptional	
items,	of	€1.1m,	were	principally	
associated	with	amendments	to	the	
bank	facilities	and	further	costs	
incurred	on	the	corporate	restructuring	
following	the	IPO.	Non-recurring	
expenses	in	2014	were	also	incurred	on	
the	disposal	of	fixed	assets	and	asset	
impairment,	resulting	from	the	closure	
of	the	Imperator	production	facilities	 
in	Slovakia.
The	reported	EBITDA	has	been	
adjusted	to	remove	the	impact	of	these	
costs	and	a	reconciliation	is	shown	in	
note	7	to	the	accounts.
Finance income & expense and taxation
Finance	income	of	€2.4m	(2014:	€7.7m)	
shows	a	decrease	from	last	year	due	to	a	
lower	gain	on	foreign	exchange	of	
€2.0m	(2014:€6.5m)	which	has	arisen	
on	intercompany	loans	and	the	impact	
from	the	devaluation	of	the	currencies	
these	loans	are	denominated	in.
“It	has	a	great	kick	of	fresh	
berries	in	both	taste	and	smell,	
and	being	lower	alcohol	makes	it	
easy	to	drink.” Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 46
Finance	costs	of	€12.6m	include	not	
only	the	cost	of	third-party	debt	but	
also	the	accelerated	amortisation	of	
bank	charges.	In	November	2015	we	
refinanced	the	Group	(details	included	
under	Net	debt	and	financing	section)	
and	as	a	consequence	the	remaining	
unamortised	bank	charges	relating	to	
the	prior	facility	(2011	ING	facility)	have	
been	fully	written	off.	This	accounted	
for	€4.3m	of	the	current	year	finance	
expense.	By	virtue	of	its	nature	this	cost	
will	not	recur	in	2016.
In	2014	we	completed	a	number	of	
amendments	to	the	ING	debt	facility	
which	had	resulted	in	a	reduction	to	
the	margins	we	paid	on	our	third-party	
debt.	The	impact	of	the	reduced	
margins	are	reflected	in	the	2015	
expense	and	as	a	consequence	reflect	 
a	reduction	of	€2.3m,	from	€7.9m	in	
2014	to	€5.6m	in	2015.
Our	tax	charge	reflects	a	number	of	
factors;	the	current	year	tax	expense,	
provisions	for	prior	year	tax	expense	
and	the	amortisation	of	a	deferred	tax	
asset	(created	following	corporate	
restructuring	at	the	time	of	the	IPO	
in 2013).	
The	current	year	tax	expense	of	€5.9m,	
shows	a	considerable	reduction	from	
2014	(€10.6m)	primarily	due	to	lower	
taxable	profits.	
In	2015	we	have	again	increased	the	
level	of	provisions,	by	€2.7m,	in	respect	
to	outstanding	and	potential	tax	risks	
arising	from	open	tax	audits	and	
investigations.	The	most	significant	
relates	to	tax	risks	in	respect	of	our	
Italian	business,	where	our	tax	affairs	
have	not	been	closed	since	2005.	The	
process	is	proving	to	be	both	lengthy	
and	costly,	and	we	expect	will	take	
further	time	to	complete.
Cash flow
As	commented	in	last	year’s	report,	the	
2014	cash	flow	was	affected	by	the	
increase	in	working	capital	at	the	
year-end	arising	from	sales	occurring	
during	the	month	of	December.	This	
resulted	in	a	delay	in	the	cash	being	
generated	during	2014	and	resulted	in	a	
higher	cash	flow	in	early	2015.	At	the	
end	of	June	2015	we	opened	a	new	
warehouse	in	Poland,	and	for	a	period	of	
time	during	the	transition	of	operations,	
the	Group	carried	higher	levels	of	
inventory.	The	additional	inventory	
absorbed	the	increased	cash	flow	
generated	earlier	in	the	year.		The	
former	warehouse	has	now	ceased	
operation	and	inventory	has	returned	to	
more	normal	levels.	As	a	consequence,	
we	enjoyed	especially	strong	cash	flow	
in	the	second	half	of	the	year.	Adjusted	
net	free	cash	flow	was	€46.9m	
(2014:€29.3m)	and	a	free	cash	flow	
conversion	of	87.2%	(2014:	44.2%).	
The	Group	paid	out	dividends	during	
the	year	of	2p	(2.50	cents)	per	share	as	a	
final	dividend	in	respect	of	financial	year	
2014,	and	an	interim	dividend	of	1p	
(1.25	cents)	per	share	in	respect	of	the	
financial	year	2015.
It	is	worth	noting	that	the	Board	has	
identified	a	technical	issue	with	the	
payment	of	the	interim	dividend,	which	
is	being	addressed	and	is	described	in	
note	29	of	the	financial	statements.
Net debt and financing 
In	November	2015	the	Group	
concluded	the	arrangement	of	a	new	
bank	facility	comprising	of	a	multi-
currency,	unsecured,	€200m	revolving	
credit	facility.	The	former	facility	was	
repaid	in	full.	The	new	facility	provides	
the	Group	with	increased	flexibility	
allowing	us	to	amend	our	levels	of	debt	
according	to	the	seasonality	of	cash	
flow.	The	RCF	carries	significantly	lower	
margins	which	will	benefit	2016	and	
future	years.	As	shown	in	note	30	to	the	
accounts,	if	the	net	debt	were	to	remain	
unchanged	from	the	year-end	
throughout	2016,	the	interest	charge	
would	be	€3.5m,	reflecting	an	expected	
further	reduction	in	finance	costs	of	
€2.1m.	Further	details	of	the	new	
facility	are	provided	in	note	23	of	the	
accounts.	The	Group	has	retained	the	
factoring	facility,	for	which	the	
threshold	has	been	increased	to	€50m	
from	the	prior	€40m	facility.	The	
factoring	facility	has	not	been	utilised	 
at	the	year-end.
The	strong	cash	flow	during	the	year	
resulted	in	net	debt	at	the	end	of	
December	2015	reducing	to	€57.2m	
from	€82.4m	in	2014,	and	a	reduction	in	
leverage	to	1.07	from	1.24	in	2014.
There	remains	sufficient	headroom	
within	the	current	bank	facilities	to	
support	our	strategy	going	forwards,	as	
we	retain	headroom	within	the	new	RCF	
and	in	addition	have	available	the	
factoring	facility	of	€50m.

All	debt	continues	to	be	drawn	in	 
local	currency	to	provide	flexibility	in	
facilities	and	a	natural	hedge	for	cash	
flow	and	balance	sheet	protection.
Debt maturity profile
For	the	majority	of	2015	the	Group’s	
bank	facilities	consisted	of	long-term	
loans	and	a	revolving	credit	facility	
(RCF).	Further	details	can	be	found	in	
note	23.	As	previously	mentioned,	these	
facilities	have	now	been	fully	repaid	and	
replaced	with	a	new	RCF.	This	is	not	
subject	to	any	amortisation	profile	 
and	has	a	term	of	5	years	from	
November 2015.
€5.6m	of	the	RCF	is	utilised	to	back	
excise	duty	guarantees	in	a	number	of	
our	markets.	This	utilisation	reduces	the	
available	balance	of	the	RCF	but	does	
not	constitute	drawings	against	the	
facility,	and	as	such	this	utilisation	is	 
not	disclosed	as	a	liability	in	the	 
balance	sheet.
Foreign exchange
The	Group	remains	exposed	to	the	
impact	of	foreign	currency	exchange	
with	the	major	trading	currencies	being	
the	Polish	Złoty	and	the	Czech	Koruna.	
The	Group	where	possible	aims	to	
match	currency	cash	flows,	liabilities	
and	assets	through	normal	commercial	
business	arrangements.	An	example	of	
this	is	all	external	third	party	debt	is	
drawn	in	local	currency.	There	are	no	
hedging	instruments	in	place	to	manage	
transaction	exposure,	where	this	arises.
Other	currencies	that	the	Group	is	
exposed	to	from	non-trading	activity	
are	GB	Pound	and	Swiss	Franc.	
Exposures	in	these	currencies	are	as	a	
result	of	operations	and	bank	balances	
arising	in	our	UK	based	head	office	and	
service	centre	based	in	Switzerland.	
We	are	limited	on	the	natural	hedging	
that	is	available	to	manage	these	
exposures,	given	the	non-trading	
activity	of	these	operations.
The	majority	of	exposure	during	2015	
reported	within	operating	profit	has	
arisen	in	the	non-trading	operations	of	
the	Group,	where	the	strengthening	of	
GB	Pound	and	Swiss	Franc	have	
resulted	in	increasing	the	costs	of	these	
non-trading	operations	and	translation	
impacts	upon	working	capital	reported	
in	these	entities.
The	Group	will	continue	to	monitor	 
its	foreign	currency	exposures	and,	
where	necessary,	to	appropriately	
manage	risk,	will	implement	
hedging arrangements.
In	late	2015,	the	Polish	Złoty	has	
devalued	and	this	has	continued	into	
2016.	The	level	of	devaluation,	if	it	
continues,	represents	a	significant	risk	
to	the	results	of	the	group	in	2016.	If	
the	2015	financial	results	for	the	
Polish	segment	were	restated	at	the	
February	2016	closing	rate	for	the	
Polish	Złoty	of	4.35,	the	results	would	
have	been	reduced	by	approximately

Principal risks and viability statement
Stock	Spirits	Group	believes	the	following	to	be	the	principal	risks	facing	its	business	and	the	steps	we	take	to	
manage	and	mitigate	these	risks.	If	any	of	these	risks	occur,	Stock	Spirits	Group’s	business,	financial	condition	
and	performance	might	suffer	and	the	trading	price	and	liquidity	of	the	shares	may	decline.	Not	all	of	these	risks	
are	within	our	control	and	this	list	cannot	be	considered	to	be	exhaustive,	as	other	risks	and	uncertainties	may	
emerge	in	a	changing	business	environment.
Risk Description and impact How we manage and mitigate
Economic  
and political 
change
The	Group’s	results	are	affected	by	overall	economic	
conditions	in	its	key	geographic	markets	and	the	level	
of	consumer	confidence	and	spending	in	those	
markets.	The	Group’s	operations	are	primarily	in	
Central	and	Eastern	European	markets	where	there	is	
a	risk	of	economic	and	regulatory	uncertainty.	Recent	
proposals	by	the	new	government	in	Poland	to	impose	
additional	taxes	on	foreign	owned	financial	
institutions	and	retail	chains	illustrate	this	risk.	In	the	
Group’s	experience,	the	local	laws	and	regulations	in	
the	region	where	it	operates	are	not	always	fully	
transparent,	can	be	difficult	to	interpret	and	may	be	
applied	and	enforced	inconsistently.	In	addition,	the	
Group’s	strategy	involves	expanding	its	business	in	
several	emerging	markets,	including	in	certain	Central	
and	Eastern	European	countries	that	are	not	members	
of	the	European	Union.	Political,	economic	and	legal	
systems	and	conditions	in	emerging	market	
economies	are	generally	less	predictable.
We	monitor	and	analyse	economic	indicators	and	
consumer	consumption	trends,	which	in	turn	influences	
our	product	portfolio	and	new	product	development.
The	majority	of	countries	that	we	currently	operate	 
in	are	part	of	the	European	Union,	and	therefore	 
are	subject	to	EU	regulation.	We	monitor	the	 
economic	conditions	within	each	market	and	review	
our	product	portfolio,	route	to	market	and	adjust 
our	position accordingly.	
Taxes Increases	in	taxes,	particularly	increases	to	excise	
duty	rates	and	VAT,	could	adversely	affect	demand	for	
the	Group’s	products.
Demand	for	the	Group’s	products	is	particularly	
sensitive	to	fluctuations	in	excise	taxes,	since	excise	
taxes	generally	constitute	the	largest	component	of	
the	sales	price	of	spirits.	
The	Group	may	be	exposed	to	tax	liabilities	resulting	
from	tax	audits:	the	Group	has	in	the	past	faced,	
currently	faces	and	may	in	the	future	face,	audits	and	
other	challenges	brought	by	tax	authorities.	Changes	
in	tax	laws	and	related	interpretations	and	increased	
enforcement	actions	and	penalties	may	alter	the	
environment	in	which	the	Group	does	business.	In	
addition,	certain	tax	positions	taken	by	the	Group	are	
based	on	industry	practice	and	external	tax	advice	
and/or	are	based	on	assumptions	and	involve	a	
significant	degree	of	judgement.
Through	our	membership	of	local	market	spirits	
associations	we	seek	to	engage	with	local	tax	and	
customs	authorities	as	well	as	government	
representatives	and,	where	appropriate,	provide	
informed	input	to	the	unintended	consequences	of	
excise	increases	e.g.	growth	of	illicit	alcohol	and	
potential	harm	to	consumers.
The	Group	engages	the	services	of	a	professional	
global	firm	of	tax	advisors	and	undertakes	regular	
audits	of	our	own	tax	processes,	documentation	and	
compliance.	We	aim	to	operate	the	business	in	a	
tax-efficient	and	compliant	manner	at	all	times.
Strategic	report Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 49
Risk Description and impact How we manage and mitigate
Strategic 
transactions
Key	objectives	of	the	Group	are:	(i)	the	development	
of	new	products	and	variants;	and	(ii)	expansion,	in	the	
Central	and	Eastern	European	region,	through	the	
acquisition	of	additional	businesses.	Unsuccessful	
launches	or	failure	by	the	Group	to	fulfil	its	expansion	
plans	or	integrate	completed	acquisitions	could	have	a	
material	adverse	effect	on	the	Group’s	growth	
potential	and	performance.	
We	have	a	robust	new	product	development	process	
which	has	delivered	highly	successful	innovations	and	
which	we	continuously	seek	to	improve.	We	seek	to	
maintain	a	pipeline	of	potential	acquisition	targets	and	
have	an	experienced	management	team	capable	of	
exploring,	pursuing	and	executing	transaction	
opportunities	swiftly	and	diligently,	however	the	
owners	of	target	businesses	may	have	price	
expectations	that	are	beyond	the	valuation	that	 
we	can	place	on	their	business.	As	referred	to	in	the	
Chairman's	statement,	two	of	the	principal	countries	
where	material	acquisitions	were	planned	to	be	made	
–	Ukraine	and	Belarus	–	have	been	extended	to	longer	
term	target	territories.
Consumer 
preferences
Shifts	in	consumer	preferences	may	adversely	affect	
the	demand	for	the	Group’s	products	and	weaken	the	
Group’s	competitive	position.	A	decline	in	the	social	
acceptability	of	the	Group’s	products	may	also	lead	to	
a	decrease	in	the	Group’s	revenue.	In	some	countries	
in	Europe,	the	consumption	of	beverages	with	higher	
alcohol	content	has	declined	due	to	changing	social	
attitudes	towards	drinking.
The	Group	undertakes	extensive	consumer	research	
and	has	a	track	record	of	successful	new	product	
development	to	constantly	meet	changing	consumer	
needs.	We	have	developed	a	range	of	lower	alcohol	
products	and	feel	confident	that	we	have	the	expertise	
to	continue	to	develop	products	that	meet	and	satisfy	
consumer	needs.
Talent The	Group’s	success	depends	substantially	upon	 
the	efforts	and	abilities	of	key	personnel	and	its	ability	
to	retain	such	personnel.	The	executive	management	
team	has	significant	experience	in	the	international	
alcoholic	beverages	and	FMCG	industries	and	has	
made	an	important	contribution	to	the	Group’s	
growth	and	success.	The	loss	of	the	services	of	any	
member	of	the	executive	management	team	of	the	
Group	or	of	a	company	acquired	by	the	Group,	could	
have	an	adverse	effect	on	the	Group’s	operations.	The	
Group	may	also	not	be	successful	in	attracting	and	
retaining	such	individuals	in	the	future.	
The	Group	operates	a	competitive	remuneration	policy	
that	aims	to	retain,	motivate	and,	where	necessary,	
attract	key	individuals.	Our	recruitment	of	several	high	
calibre	managers	during	2015,	as	referred	to	in	the	
CEO's	statement,	is	evidence	of	our	ability	to	attract	
talented	individuals.	We	have	developed	a	formal	
succession	planning	process	to	mitigate	the	risk	of	
losing	key	personnel.	
Marketplace 
and 
Competition
Stock	Spirits	Group	operates	in	a	highly	competitive	
environment	and	faces	competitive	pressures	from	both	
local	and	international	spirits	producers,	which	may	
result	in	pressure	on	prices	and	loss	of	market	share.	
Changes	in	the	Group’s	distribution	channels	may	also	
have	an	adverse	effect	on	the	Group’s	profitability	
and	business.	
A	significant	portion	of	the	Group’s	revenue	is	derived	
from	a	small	number	of	customers.	The	Group	may	
not	be	able	to	maintain	its	relationships	with	these	
customers	or	renegotiate	agreements	on	favourable	
terms,	or	may	be	unable	to	collect	payments	from	
some	customers,	which	will	lead	to	an	impact	in	its	
financial	condition.	
The	Group	is	also	dependent	on	a	few	key	products	in	
a	limited	number	of	markets	which	contribute	a	
significant	portion	of	its	revenue.	
Stock	Spirits	Group	has	mechanisms	and	strategies	in	
place	to	mitigate	the	damage	of	profit	erosion	but	there	
is	no	assurance	they	may	work	in	such	economies	and	
competitive	environments.
We	constantly	review	our	distribution	channels	and	
our	customer	relationships.	We	understand	the	
changing	nature	of	the	trade	channels	and	customers	
positions	within	those	channels.	We	trade	across	all	
channels	and	actively	manage	our	profit	mix	by	both	
channel	and	customer.	 Strategic report

Risk Description and impact How we manage and mitigate
Exchange rates The	Group’s	business	operations	and	results	reported	
in	Euros	are	subject	to	risks	associated	with	
fluctuations	in	currency	exchange	rates.	
The	Group	generates	revenue	primarily	in	Polish	
Złoty	and	secondarily	in	Czech	Koruna	and	a	large	
portion	of	the	Group’s	assets	and	liabilities	are	
denominated	in	Złoty	and	Koruna.	
The	Group's	non-trading	activities	are	conducted	
through	its	head	office	in	the	UK	and	service	centre	
based	in	Switzerland,	and	are	mainly	transacted	in	GB	
Pound	and	Swiss	Francs.
Additionally,	the	Group’s	financial	covenants	are	
tested	in	Euros.	Consequently,	movement	in	the	other	
currencies	in	which	the	earnings,	assets	and	liabilities	
of	certain	of	the	Group’s	subsidiaries	are	denominated	
could	adversely	impact	the	Group’s	ability	to	comply	
with	these	financial	covenants.
The	Group	aims	to	hedge	transaction	risk	by	matching	
cash	flows,	assets	and	liabilities	through	normal	
commercial	activities	where	possible.	For	example	all	
debt	is	currently	drawn	in	local	currency	by	market.	
For	locations	where	we	have	non-trading	activities,	
there	is	a	limitation	on	the	natural	hedging	that	is	
available	to	cover	currency	exchange	risk.
We	monitor	currency	exposure	as	an	integral	part	of	
our	monthly	review	process	and,	where	appropriate,	
will	implement	hedging	instruments.
Disruption  
to operations 
or systems
The	Group’s	operating	results	may	be	adversely	
affected	by	disruption	to	its	production	and	storage	
facilities,	in	particular	its	main	production	facilities	in	
Poland	and	the	Czech	Republic,	or	by	a	breakdown	of	
its	information	or	management	control	systems.
In	addition	to	holding	appropriate	insurance	cover	to	
protect	the	business	in	the	event	of	a	production	
disruption	or	other	business	interruption,	our	two	
primary	bottling	sites	offer	sufficient	flexibility	that	
each	site	is	capable	of	bottling	all	of	our	core	SKUs.	 
We	also	have	well-established	and	tested	Business	
Continuity	and	Disaster	Recovery	policies.	Our	
information	and	management	control	systems	are	
subject	to	internal	audit	following	a	risk-based	
methodology.	We	also	periodically	engage	
independent	specialists	to	assess	and	test	the	security	
and	resilience	of	our	network	against	hacking	and	
other	cyber	threats,	which	include	penetration	testing.
Laws and 
regulations
The	Group	is	subject	to	extensive	laws	and	regulations	
limiting	advertising,	promotions	and	access	to	its	
products,	as	well	as	laws	and	regulations	relating	to	its	
operations,	such	as	health,	safety	and	environmental	
laws.	These	regulations	and	any	changes	to	these	
regulations	could	limit	its	business	activities	or	
increase	costs.	In	some	cases,	such	as	the	proposed	
introduction	in	the	Czech	Republic	of	a	ban	on	
smoking	indoors	and	mandatory	cash	registers	for	
hotels,	restaurants	and	bars	(HORECA),	the	changes	
in	law	impact	the	Group	indirectly.
The	Group	may	be	affected	by	litigation	directed	at	
the	alcoholic	beverages	industry	and	other	litigation	
such	as	intellectual	property	disputes,	product	
liability	claims,	product	labelling	disputes	and	
administrative	claims.	The	Group	may	be	exposed	to	
civil	or	criminal	liabilities	under	anti-bribery	laws	and	
any	violation	of	such	laws	could	have	a	material	
adverse	effect	on	its	reputation	and	business.
The	Group	has	established	clear	processes	and	
controls	to	monitor	compliance	with	laws	and	
regulations,	and	changes	to	them,	and	also	any	
litigation	action.	The	Audit	Committee	report	explains	
the	major	ongoing	project	that	was	started	in	2015,	
designed	to	embed	comprehensive	controls	within	the	
key	business	processes	across	all	our	businesses.	We	
operate	a	detailed	anti-bribery	and	anti-corruption	
policy	and	process.	Regular	update	training	is	
conducted	across	the	business	and	we	undertake	
regular	reviews	to	assess	the	adequacy	and	
effectiveness	of	our	policy	and	processes. Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 51
Risk Description and impact How we manage and mitigate
Supply of  
raw materials
Changes	in	the	prices	or	availability	of	supplies	and	
raw	materials	could	have	a	material	adverse	effect	on	
the	Group’s	business.	Commodity	price	changes	may	
result	in	increases	in	the	cost	of	raw	materials	and	
packaging	materials	for	the	Group’s	products	due	to	a	
variety	of	factors	outside	the	Group’s	control.	The	
Group	may	not	be	able	to	pass	on	increases	in	the	
costs	of	raw	materials	to	its	customers	and,	even	if	it	is	
able	to	pass	on	cost	increases,	the	adjustments	may	
not	be	immediate	and	may	not	fully	offset	the	extra	
costs	or	may	cause	a	decline	in	sales	volumes.	
Where	possible	the	Group	will	negotiate	term	contracts	
for	the	supply	of	core	raw	materials	and	services	on	
competitive	terms	to	manage	pricing	fluctuations.
Funding and 
liquidity
Market	conditions	could	subject	the	Group	to	
unexpected	needs	for	liquidity,	which	may	require	the	
Group	to	increase	its	levels	of	indebtedness.	Access	to	
financing	in	the	longer	term	depends	on	a	variety	of	
factors	outside	the	Group’s	control,	including	adverse	
capital	and	credit	market	conditions.	
Higher	interest	rates	and	more	stringent	borrowing	
requirements	could	increase	the	Group’s	financing	
charges	and	reduce	profitability.	
The	Group	maintains	a	strong	focus	on	cash,	our	future	
requirements	for	funding	and	the	overall	external	
market	for	financing.	We	undertake	regular	and	
detailed	reviews	of	both	short-term	and	longer-term	
liquidity	requirements	by	market,	including	our	growth	
ambitions.	We	are	confident	that	we	have	the	
appropriate	processes	and	relationships	in	place	to	
respond	to	any	unexpected	liquidity	needs	and	have	
not	only	secured	lower	cost	and	more	flexible	re-
financing	during	2015,	as	described	in	the	Financial	
Review,	but	have	also	placed	ourselves	in	the	best	
position	to	access	funding	in	the	longer	term.
Viability statement
The	Directors	have	assessed	the	viability	of	the	Group	over	a	three-year	period	and	confirm	that	they	have	a	reasonable	
expectation	that	the	Group	will	continue	to	operate	and	meet	its	liabilities,	as	they	fall	due.	The	Directors	have	determined	that	
the	three-year	period	to	December	2018	is	an	appropriate	period	over	which	to	provide	its	viability	statement,	after	taking	
into	consideration	a	number	of	factors,	including	that	the	Group's	strategic	planning	process	covers	a	three-year	period	and	
that	the	spirits	industry	is	considered	to	be	non-cyclical.
The	Directors'	assessment	has	been	made	with	reference	to	the	Group's	current	position,	the	Group's	strategy,	the	Board's	risk	
appetite	and	the	principal	risks	facing	the	Group	in	severe	but	plausible	scenarios,	taking	account	of	the	velocity	of	the	risk	
impact	and	the	effectiveness	of	any	mitigating	actions,	including	insurance,	as	detailed	above.	The	strategy	and	associated	
principal	risks	underpin	the	Group's	three	year	plans	and	scenario	testing,	which	the	Directors	review	annually.
This	assessment	has	considered	the	potential	impacts	of	these	risks	on	the	business	model,	future	performance,	solvency	and	
liquidity	over	the	period.	Whilst	this	review	does	not	consider	all	of	the	risks	that	the	Group	may	face,	the	Directors	consider	
that	this	stress-testing	based	assessment	of	the	Group's	prospects	is	reasonable	in	the	circumstances.

Governance
Chairman's Letter
Dear shareholders 
I am pleased to present our Corporate Governance report for the year ended 31 December 2015. As you can read in more 
detail in the Audit Committee Report, we have continued to strengthen the governance policies, controls and processes to 
support the growth strategy of the Group during this year, and the years to come.
The Board is firmly committed to ensuring that our corporate governance policies are complied with in all jurisdictions in which 
the Group operates, by setting up proper processes. We are convinced that strong corporate governance is good for our 
business and underpins the delivery of shareholder value. We believe that corporate governance structures and processes will 
help our business to perform in a more efficient and competitive way in the marketplace and will lead to strong relationships 
with all of our stakeholders. 
During the year Jack Keenan (Chairman) retired from the Board and I would like to thank him for his contribution in the 
transition from a private equity owned company to a PLC. The Board of Stock Spirits Group PLC now comprises myself as 
Chairman, three Independent Non-Executive Directors and two Executive Directors.
As Chairman of the Board, I work with the Company Secretary to set the agenda for Board meetings. These are structured to 
ensure that sufficient time is spent on important matters, and all Directors have the opportunity to contribute. During the year, 
the Board has reviewed and evaluated strategy and considered potential opportunities in our current territories as well as 
expansion into other territories. Alongside strategy, the Board regularly reviews, among other things, the performance of each 
of the markets, and considers the principal risks and associated procedures and processes to mitigate them. This year the 
Board has dedicated a special focus to the situation in Poland, and has been monitoring very closely the performance of this 
business. Further detail on the principal risks can be found on pages 48 to 51.
In the second half of the year, we carried out an internal Board evaluation to review the performance of the Board, its 
committees and the individual Directors, including the Chairman. The exercise was facilitated internally by the Company 
Secretary under my direction and details of the process and outcomes are shown on page 62. I believe regular and appropriate 
Board and Committee evaluation is an area that is fundamental to improving Board effectiveness and ensuring objectives  
can be met. It enables us to review the effectiveness of individual Directors, the processes under which the Board operates, 
and the quality, timeliness and appropriateness of information submitted by management. Next year we will carry out an 
external evaluation as it will have been three years since the formation of this Board. Your Board regularly meets with Group 
management, both at Board and Board Committee meetings and otherwise, which enables the Non-Executive Directors to 
gain a good understanding of the business and what is happening on the ground. We believe that this is an essential 
requirement for Directors. 
We have set out, in the following pages, details of how the Company has applied the main principles of the 2014 version of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and its compliance with the various provisions. 
David Maloney 
Chairman

The Corporate Governance report forms part of the Directors’ report.
Introduction 
This report explains key features of the Company’s governance structure to provide a greater understanding of how the main 
principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code, published in 2014 by the Financial Reporting Council (‘the Code’), have  
been applied, and to highlight areas of focus during the year. The report also includes items required by the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules. A copy of the Code can be obtained at www.frc.org.uk. 
Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
The Company has complied with the provisions of the Code in this financial year, except with Rule A.4.1 as the Company had no 
Senior Independent Director between May and November 2015 while the Board was being restructured after the former 
Chairman Jack Keenan retired.
Governance overview
The Board is collectively responsible to the shareholders for the long-term success of the Company. The Board has delegated 
certain responsibilities to Board Committees to assist it with discharging its duties. The Board Committees play an essential 
role in supporting the Board to implement its vision and strategy, and to provide focused oversight of key aspects of the 
business. The full terms of reference for each committee are available on the Company’s website www.stockspirits.com.

Governance
How the Board works continued
Role of the Chairman
The Board is chaired by David Maloney, a Non-Executive Director who met the independence criteria in the Code on his 
appointment. David Maloney replaces Jack Keenan, who retired on 18 May 2015. It is the Chairman’s duty to lead the Board 
and to ensure Directors have sufficient resources available to them to fulfil their statutory duties. The Chairman is responsible 
for setting the Board’s agenda, ensuring adequate time is available for discussion of all agenda items and ensuring a particular 
focus on strategic issues. 
The Chairman promotes a culture of openness and debate by facilitating the effective contribution of Non-Executive Directors 
in particular, and by encouraging constructive relations between Executive and Non-Executive Directors. 
Role of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO)
Chris Heath is the Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Through delegation from the Board, he is responsible for executive 
management of the Group, including the implementation of the Group’s strategic objectives. In fulfilling his duties, the Chief 
Executive Officer is supported by the Senior Management Team, whom he also leads (biographies for the Senior Management 
Team can be found on pages 56 and 57). 
Interaction between the Chairman and the CEO
The roles of the Chairman and the CEO are separate, with a distinct division of responsibilities. 
The partnership between David Maloney and Chris Heath is based on mutual trust and is facilitated by regular contact 
between the two. The separation of authority enhances independent oversight of the executive management by the Board 
and helps to ensure that no one individual on the Board has unfettered authority. 
Role of the Senior Independent Director
Following David Maloney’s change in role to Chairman in May 2015, Andrew Cripps was appointed as the Senior Independent 
Director (SID) in November 2015. Andrew is available to shareholders if they have concerns that the normal channels of 
Chairman, CEO or other Executive Directors have failed to resolve, or for which such channels of communication are 
inappropriate. The SID also acts as an internal sounding board for the Chairman, and serves as intermediary for the other 
Directors, with the Chairman, when necessary. While there were no requests from shareholders or Directors for access to  
the SID during the reporting period, the role of the SID is considered to be an important check and balance in the Group’s 
governance structure. In accordance with the Code, neither the Chairman nor the SID are employed as executives of the Group. 
Non-Executive Director independence 
The Board considers and reviews each Non-Executive Director’s independence on an annual basis, as part of the Directors’ 
performance evaluation. In carrying out the review, consideration is given to factors such as their character, judgement, 
commitment and performance on the Board, and relevant committees, and their ability to provide objective challenge to 
management. The Board has considered the findings from the Board evaluation exercise and reviewed the independence of 
each Non-Executive Director. The Board is of the view that all were, and continue to be, independent in accordance with the 
provisions of the Code.
Board meeting attendance
During the year ended 31 December 2015, there were nine scheduled Board meetings. The table below summarises the 
attendance of the Directors.

Corporate governance framework continued Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 61
Where Directors are unable to attend meetings, they receive the papers scheduled for discussion at the relevant meetings, 
giving them the opportunity to raise any issues and give any comments to the Chairman in advance of the meeting.
The Board delegates authority to its Committees to carry out certain tasks on its behalf, so that it can operate efficiently  
and give the right level of attention and consideration to relevant matters. The composition and role of each Committee is 
summarised in each of the respective committee reports. 
Board composition, qualification and independence 
The Board is committed to high standards of corporate governance and, as such, its composition, members’ experience, 
balance of skills and effectiveness are regularly reviewed to ensure the right mix of people on the Board and its committees. 
Following the retirement of Jack Keenan on 18 May 2015 and the appointment of Mirek Stachowicz on 9 November 2015, the 
Board continues to comprise six Directors: a Chairman (who, for the purposes of the Code, was independent on appointment); 
a Senior Independent Non-Executive Director; two Independent Non-Executive Directors; and two Executive Directors.  
The Directors have a wide range of skills and experience including expertise in the food and drinks industry, within Europe 
and beyond.
Appointment and tenure
All Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, serve on the basis of letters of appointment that are available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered office. The letters of appointment set out the expected time commitment of Non-
Executive Directors who, on appointment, undertake that they will have sufficient time to meet what is expected of them. 
The Executive Directors’ service contracts are also available for inspection at the Company’s registered office.
The Company does not place a term limit on a Director’s service, as all continuing Directors will present themselves for annual 
re-election by shareholders at the Company’s Annual General Meetings (AGMs).
Director induction and training 
The Chairman, with the support of the Company Secretary, is responsible for the induction of new Directors and the ongoing 
development of all Directors. New Directors receive a full, formal and tailored induction on joining the Board, designed to 
provide an understanding of the Group’s business, governance and key stakeholders. The induction process includes site visits, 
meetings with key individuals, and briefings on key business, legal and regulatory issues facing the Group.
As the internal and external business environment changes, it is important to ensure the Directors’ skills and knowledge are 
refreshed and updated regularly. Accordingly, the Chairman, with the assistance of the Company Secretary, ensures that 
regular updates on corporate governance, regulatory and technical matters are provided to Directors at Board meetings. 
Operational site visits and meetings with senior management in local teams were also organised during the year. In this way, 
Directors keep their skills and knowledge relevant so as to enable them to continue to fulfil their duties effectively. 
Information and support available to Directors
All Board Directors have access to the Company Secretary, who advises them on Board and governance matters. 
The Chairman and the Company Secretary work together to ensure Board papers are clear, accurate, delivered in a timely 
manner to Directors, and of sufficient quality to enable the Board to discharge its duties. As well as the support of the 
Company Secretary, there is a procedure in place for any Director to take independent professional advice at the Company’s 
expense in the furtherance of their duties, where considered necessary.
Director re-election 
In accordance with the Code and the Directors’ letters of appointment, the Directors will put themselves forward for annual 
re-election. Following recommendations from the Nomination Committee, the Board considers that all Directors continue to 
be effective, committed to their roles and to have sufficient time available to perform their duties. Accordingly, all Directors 
will seek re-election at the Company’s forthcoming AGM. 
Directors’ conflicts of interest
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations in which they have, or may have, interests that conflict with those of the 
Board, unless that conflict is first authorised by the Board. This includes potential conflicts that may arise when a Director 
takes up a position with another company. The Company’s articles allow the Board to authorise such potential conflicts, and 
there is a procedure in place to deal with any actual or potential conflict of interest. The Board deals with each appointment  
on its individual merit, and takes into consideration all relevant circumstances. All potential conflicts approved by the  
Board are recorded in an Interests Register, which is reviewed by the Board at least quarterly to ensure the procedure is 
working effectively.  Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 62

Appointment and tenure continued
Board evaluation and effectiveness 
The effectiveness and performance of the Board is vital to our continuing success. An internal evaluation of the performance of 
the Board, its Committees and the Chairman was carried out during the year. The process of evaluating the performance was 
undertaken by the Company Secretary under the direction of the Chairman. A tailored, high-level questionnaire was 
distributed for the Directors to complete. This was structured to provide Directors with an opportunity to express their  
views about: 
• the performance of the Board and its committees, including how the Directors work together as a whole;
• the balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the Directors; and
• individual performance, and whether each Director continues to make an effective contribution.
Following evaluation, it was agreed that all Directors contribute effectively, demonstrate a high level of commitment to their role, 
and together provide the skills and experience that are relevant and necessary for the leadership and direction of the Company.
The responses to the evaluation of the Board and its Committees were reviewed with the Chairman and considered by the 
Board. The results of the evaluation indicated that the Board is working well and that there are no significant concerns among 
the Directors about its effectiveness. It was generally felt that the actions agreed as a result of the previous year’s evaluation 
had been progressed. These were as expected in a newly floated company such as non-executive knowledge of the business 
operations, quality and details of Board materials, greater emphasis on strategy, and increased focus on risk management and 
internal control. The actions arising from the 2015 evaluation followed a similar theme, but with no significant concerns. 
The results of the evaluation of the Chairman’s performance were considered by the SID and were discussed with the Chairman at 
a separate one-to-one meeting. The performance of individual Directors was evaluated by the Chairman, with input from the 
Committee Chairmen and other Directors. For 2016, the Board will commission an independent external evaluation. 
Shareholder engagement 
Primary responsibility for shareholder relations rests with the Chief Financial Officer, Lesley Jackson. She ensures there is 
effective communication with shareholders on matters such as governance and strategy, and is responsible for ensuring the 
Board understands the views of major shareholders on such matters.
As part of a comprehensive investor relations programme, formal meetings with investors are scheduled to discuss the Group’s 
interim and final results. In the intervening periods, the Company continues its dialogue with the investor community by 
meeting key investor representatives, attending investment conferences and holding investor roadshows. 
During the year, the Chief Financial Officer, CEO and the Chairman have met with a number of shareholders and potential 
shareholders. External presentations are posted on the Company’s website at www.stockspirits.com/investors. 
The Chairman also met with the Company’s largest shareholders following his appointment, and again following the Company’s 
review of expectations in November; he is always available to meet individual shareholders on request. In addition, he is 
available to meet shareholders at the Company’s Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The Company’s AGM will take place at 11.00am on Tuesday, 17 May 2016 at the offices of Nomura at One Angel Lane, London, 
EC4R 3AB. All shareholders have the opportunity to attend and vote, in person or by proxy, at the AGM. The notice of the 
AGM can be found on our website, www.stockspirits.com, and in a booklet that is being issued at the same time as this Report. 
The Notice of the AGM sets out the business of the meeting and an explanatory note on all resolutions. Separate resolutions 
are proposed in respect of each substantive issue. 
The AGM is the Company’s principal forum for communication with private shareholders. In addition to the Chairman of the 
Board, the senior management will be available to answer shareholders’ questions at the AGM. 
Committees
The Company has established an Audit Committee, a Nomination Committee, a Remuneration Committee and a Disclosure 
Committee. The Board delegated specific responsibilities to these Committees. The role and responsibilities of each Board 
Committee are set out in formal Terms of Reference, which are available on the Company’s website. The Board Committees 
make recommendations to the Board as they see fit, as contemplated by their Terms of Reference. 
Disclosure Committee
The Committee is chaired by David Maloney (Chairman), and its members are Chris Heath (CEO), Lesley Jackson (CFO) and 
Elisa Gomez de Bonilla (General Counsel).  Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 63
Role of the Disclosure Committee
The Disclosure Committee assists the Board in discharging its responsibilities for the identification of ‘inside information’ and 
makes recommendations about how and when the Group should disclose such information. In doing so, the Committee 
considers all relevant transactions, projects and other circumstances that could potentially give rise to insider information. The 
Committee is also responsible for analysing market expectations and rumours relating to the Group’s performance, and for 
monitoring the materiality of any variance between the Group’s performance and its own forecasts. 
Activity of the Disclosure Committee
During the year ended 31 December 2015, the Disclosure Committee discussed matters by email, especially as regards share 
dealings of permanent insiders and persons discharging managerial responsibilities (PDMRs). No meeting as such was required 
during 2015 as the full Board was present when the necessary disclosures were issued in 2015.
Internal controls
Risk management and internal control 
The Board recognises its responsibility to present a balanced and understandable assessment of the Group’s position and 
prospects, and has responsibility for ensuring that management maintain an effective system of risk management and internal 
control, and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
As part of this process, the Board carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten the Group's business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity. The principal risks identified, and the 
actions that the Group takes to mitigate them, are shown on pages 48 to 51.
Internal control framework
We have a clear framework for identifying, evaluating and managing risk faced by the Group on an ongoing basis, both at an 
operational and strategic level, which has been in place for the year under review and up to the date of this report, and which 
accords with ‘Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting’ issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council (FRC). Our risk identification and mitigation processes have been designed to be responsive to the 
constantly changing environment. Our internal control process starts with identifying risks, compliance matters and other 
issues at a local level in each of the Company’s markets, and then consolidates it at a Group level at the Board. We do this 
through routine reviews carried out by process owners and facilitated by relevant dedicated, specialist teams. We record risks 
in our risk registers, assess the implications and consequences for the Group, and determine the likelihood of occurrence. The 
Group’s risk register is subject to regular review and scrutiny by the Board, as well as by the Audit Committee as regards the 
financial risks. Appropriate action is taken to manage and mitigate the risks identified. 
The main features of the Group’s internal control and risk management systems in relation to the process for preparing 
consolidated accounts include:
• Organisational structure, delegations of authority and reporting lines
• Group accounting and control procedures, with a centralised Group finance function that provides direction and support 
to market finance teams as well as managing the Group consolidation and reporting requirements
• Budgetary process and financial review cycle, with a quarterly review of annual budget, business performance and 
assessment of risks
• Risk management through monitoring and maintenance of a risk register for each business unit
• Capital expenditure control
• Internal Audit regular reports on controls
• Competence and integrity of our personnel
Effectiveness of internal controls
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of our risk management and internal control process, including financial reporting, 
to ensure it remains robust. The review covered all material controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls, 
in the financial period to 31 December 2015 and the period to the approval of this Annual Report & Accounts. Further details 
are set out in the Audit Committee report on pages 64 to 68.

Governance
I am pleased to report on the role and activities of the Audit Committee for the year.
The principal objectives of the Committee are to monitor the Group’s internal controls and financial risk management, to 
review the integrity of the Group’s published financial reports, including these Annual Report & Accounts, and to oversee the 
conduct of the external audit.
In last year’s Audit Committee Report, we explained the steps initiated to enhance internal controls across our Group, 
following the issues discovered in our Polish business in 2014. We have continued our focus on this key area throughout 2015 
and into 2016, with the Audit Committee overseeing a major project intended to redesign and embed comprehensive controls 
within the key business processes across all our businesses. The new controls framework started to go live in Poland at the end 
of 2015 and is scheduled for implementation in our other countries by mid-2016. We believe this will substantially strengthen 
the Group’s risk management and internal controls.
The Audit Committee is satisfied that it is in compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code in relation 
to audit committees and auditors.
The Committee has complied with the Competition and Markets Authority Order on Statutory Audit Services for Large 
Companies for the year ended 31 December 2015.
Composition of the Committee

All the members of the Committee are Independent. Andrew Cripps is a qualified accountant, and the Board is satisfied that he 
brings recent and relevant financial experience to the Committee, as recommended by the Corporate Governance Code.
Elisa Gomez de Bonilla (General Counsel and Company Secretary) serves as Secretary to the Committee. The Chairman of the 
Company, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Head of Internal Audit, Risk and Compliance and audit 
engagement partner from our external auditor generally attend our Audit Committee meetings by invitation. We also ask 
other members of senior management to present to the Committee as appropriate. 
Committee meetings are planned so as to enable review of trading statements, the half-yearly report, and the Annual Report & 
Accounts, with additional meetings taking place as necessary. The Committee met five times during 2015.
Responsibilities and role of the Audit Committee
The Committee’s main responsibilities are to oversee, monitor and make recommendations to the Board on:
• the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control and risk management, including control over financial reporting
• the effectiveness of internal audit, including co-ordination with the activities of external audit
• the Group’s policies and procedures relating to business conduct, including whistle-blowing arrangements and  
fraud-prevention and detection procedures
• the Group’s overall approach to ensuring compliance with laws, regulations and policies
• the appointment of the external auditor, including a tender selection process where appropriate, as well as terms of 
engagement and remuneration
• the scope of the external audit, its findings and the effectiveness of the audit process
• the overall relationship with the external audit firm including the provision of non-audit services to ensure that 
independence and objectivity are maintained
• the integrity of the financial statements, including a review of the significant accounting policies and financial  
reporting judgements
• whether, taken as a whole, these Annual Report & Accounts are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy
The full Terms of Reference of the Committee are available on our website at www.stockspirits.com 
The Committee’s role is primarily advisory: it reports its findings to the Board. Ultimate responsibility for internal control, the 
Annual Report & Accounts, half-yearly reports and quarterly interim statements remains with the Board.
Main activities of the Committee during the year
Internal controls and risk management
As part of our continuous monitoring of risk management and internal controls, we receive and review the corporate risk 
register together with a report on changes in significant risks in our main businesses and other control related information at 
each meeting. Over the year, we have reviewed reports from the CEO and the Company Secretary, as well as from other 
members of management and the internal audit team.
At each meeting the Committee reviewed progress on a major project to develop and implement more comprehensive controls 
across the business, following the shortcomings identified in 2014. This has involved cross functional teams across our 
principal markets challenging and redeveloping procedures and controls to ensure they are effective, and not open to misuse. 
The process of implementing and embedding this tighter framework commenced in Poland at the end of 2015 and remains on 
target to be implemented in the remaining markets during 2016.
In addition, the Committee reviewed a number of matters relevant to the financial structure of the Group. These included the 
adequacy of the Group’s financing facilities, updates on the Group’s risk-management and insurance programmes, the 
availability of distributable reserves within the Company its ability to pay dividends. Subsequent to the year-end it has become 
apparent that a portion of the reserves, believed to be distributable at the time the interim dividend was declared, were 
technically undistributable. This is being made good by payment of dividends to the Company by subsidiaries and a resolution 
to regularise this position will be put to the Annual General Meeting (see note 29 on page 134). Internal controls have been 
enhanced to rigorously check reserves are technically distributable going forwards. Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 66
Governance
Main activities of the Committee during the year continued
Internal audit
The remit of internal audit is to undertake financial, operational and strategic audits across the Group using a risk-based 
methodology. In line with our usual practice, internal audit prepared an inventory of the key auditable control and risk areas 
across the Group, informed by the Principal Risks identified in our Annual Report & Accounts and the latest quarterly risk 
registers prepared by our businesses, which drove priorities for the internal audit plan for 2015. This plan contained audits and 
reviews focused on areas identified as having the most risk to the business, covering all parts of the Group down to individual 
sites, processes and activities, and all aspects of the business. 
During 2015, the Committee received internal audit reports on such areas as the design and operating effectiveness of controls 
around excise duty management, compliance with competition law and cyber security, the latter being based on the UK 
government’s cyber essentials scheme. In each case, the audits confirmed the general sufficiency of controls and proposed areas 
for improvement. Results were graded, and where improvements were identified, appropriate remedial actions were agreed with 
the management concerned and the Committee ensures that these are followed up. We considered the internal control issues 
raised in internal audit reports that we received during the year, the adequacy of internal audit resources and the effectiveness of 
the internal audit function. I am also pleased to have again met representatives of our internal audit function in each of our key 
markets. The Committee also held a session with the Head of Internal Audit without other members of management being 
present. Given the importance of the major internal controls project referred to above, for the 2016 internal audit plan, the 
Committee agreed with the recommendation that the internal audit team focus audits on providing assurance over compliance 
with the comprehensive programme of controls implemented by that project.
Whistle-blowing
Part of our remit is to oversee the Group’s processes for handling reports from whistle-blowers. Our Code of Business 
Conduct encourages all employees to report any potential improprieties in financial reporting or other matters. We have an 
independent compliance hotline ('Speak up') operated by an external agency. This is available to all employees, suppliers, 
customers and other stakeholders, in each of the languages used throughout the Group, and, subject to legal requirements, 
callers can remain anonymous if they wish. All contacts received are reported to and reviewed by the Audit Committee. Where 
appropriate, our legal and/or internal audit teams may be asked to investigate issues and report to us on the outcome. 
The Committee also received regular updates from the Group General Counsel on significant litigation and disputes.
Review of Annual Report & Accounts and preliminary results announcement
The Committee has considered the appropriateness of the accounting policies used. Further, the Committee carried out a 
comprehensive review of the Annual Report and Accounts (ARA) as a whole and considered a number of factors, including the 
balance between reporting of positive and negative aspects, consistency throughout the ARA and enquiries made of business 
unit managers and other relevant management of the most significant challenges, set-backs and achievements of the year. 
Supported by a presentation requested from internal audit, the Committee has recommended to the Board that, taken as a 
whole, the ARA is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy. 
Significant issues considered in relation to the Annual Report & Accounts
In reviewing the financial statements with management and the auditors, the Committee has discussed and debated the critical 
accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty set out in note 4 to the financial statements. 
As a result of their review, the Committee has identified the following issues that require particular judgement or have 
significant impact on interpretation of this ARA.
Revenue recognition 
In the Group’s main markets, seasonal sales peaks occur around the Christmas period, therefore procedures for appropriate 
cut-off and recording of revenue and related rebates to the correct period are important. In line with normal practice, the 
businesses within the Group provide discounts, rebates, promotions and marketing support to customers, the calculation of 
which can involve estimation and judgement. We reviewed the procedures performed by management and the auditors to 
ensure the accuracy and completeness of such reserves at the year end. The Group’s policy is set out on page 105.
Audit Committee report continued Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 67
Carrying value of intangible assets 
The Group’s policies on accounting for separately acquired intangible assets and goodwill on acquired businesses are set out 
on page 108. Goodwill on acquisitions and acquired intangible assets, such as brands, which are judged to have indefinite lives 
are initially recorded at fair value, and are subject to testing for impairment at each balance sheet date. As is customary, such 
testing involves estimation of the future cash flows attributable to the asset, or cash-generating unit of which it is part, and 
discounting these future cash flows to today’s value. The Committee has reviewed the key assumptions behind these 
valuations, notably the expected development of future cash flows and the discount rates used, as well as considering 
reasonable sensitivities to these estimates and concluded that these support the carrying values set out in notes 15 and 16. 
Taxation 
As is normal, the Group has a number of outstanding tax assessments, and regularly undertakes reviews to assess tax risks 
across the Group – for example, risks associated with VAT and transfer pricing. A revised tax assessment was received by the 
Group's Czech subsidiary after the year end, and the Italian authorities continue their enquiries into the Group's Italian 
subsidiary for the period prior to its restructure. The Group has undertaken a review of potential tax risks and current tax 
assessments, and while it is not possible to predict the outcome of any pending enquiries, the Committee concur with 
management’s assessment of the additional provisions made during the year.
Going concern
In assessing whether the Company is a going concern, and accordingly making our recommendation to the Board, we 
considered a paper prepared by management based on guidance published by the Financial Reporting Council and reviewed 
the findings of the external auditors. The assessment was made for the period of 12 months from the date of this report, in 
accordance with accepted practice. Based on internal forecasts, we reviewed the Group’s debt-maturity profile, including 
headroom and compliance with financial covenants, and its capital structure. We stress-tested this by adjusting the Company’s 
internal full-year forecast cash flow by a combination of the principal risks we have identified – notably an economic downturn 
leading to loss of revenue, and customer default (see Principal risks – Economic and Political Change; and Marketplace and 
Competition). See note 2 to the accounts (Going concern), page 102. The Committee concluded that the application of the 
going-concern basis for the preparation of the financial statements remained appropriate.
External audit
As reported last year, we conducted a formal competitive tender process for our external audit services in the second half of 
2014, following which KPMG LLP was appointed as the Group's auditor at the last Annual General Meeting in May 2015.
During the year, the Audit Committee assessed the ongoing effectiveness and quality of the external audit process on the basis 
of a questionnaire-based internal review with members of the Audit Committee, the external auditors and key members of the 
finance team. The Committee concluded that the audit process was effective, while identifying a number of learnings that will 
be applied to future audits as part of our commitment to continuous improvement. Our external audit for 2014, which was 
performed by our former auditors, Ernst & Young, was also reviewed by the audit quality review team of the Financial 
Reporting Council (FRC), and the Committee was satisfied with their conclusions.
The Committee maintained a dialogue with our new external auditors, KPMG, on the key financial statement risks on which the 
half-year review and full-year audit would focus. KPMG’s approach to materiality informed discussion of the appropriate level 
of materiality for the audit, and the Committee concurred with KPMG’s proposals as set out in their report. The Committee 
continued to meet regularly with the external auditors in the absence of management.
Before concluding our recommendation on the Annual Report & Accounts in March 2016, we reviewed a report from KPMG 
on the findings from their audit with particular attention on key issues arising out of the audit, including their views on critical 
estimates and judgements, key assumptions, clarity of disclosures and proposed audit adjustments. We discussed these with 
management and satisfied ourselves that the issues raised had been properly dealt with. We received and considered 
confirmation of the independence and objectivity of the auditors, and reviewed the effectiveness of the audit process by 
interrogation of management and auditors. The Committee also sought assurance from management that all appropriate 
matters had been brought to the auditors’ attention. Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 68
Governance
Non-audit services policy and auditor independence 
We have a policy on non-audit services provided by the external or internal auditors. Specific approval must be sought from 
the Audit Committee for:
• single or linked advice from our auditors, the cost of which is likely to exceed €50,000 in the financial year; and
• employment into control positions of individuals who have worked directly on the external audit in the previous two years.
Our policy also states that we require annual confirmation of the independence of an audit firm in accordance with its own and 
required regulatory and ethical guidelines. We review a quarterly report from the Chief Financial Officer of the actual level and 
nature of non-audit work and periodic confirmation from KPMG of their independence. 
The total fees paid to KPMG for audit services for the year were €723,000 and non-audit fees amounted to €60,000. The 
non-audit work entirely comprised a more detailed review of enhancements to internal controls in Poland than was required as 
part of the external audit for this year. We are satisfied that this non-audit work did not detract from the objectivity and 
independence of our external auditors. Further details of the fees paid to the external auditor are set out in note 12.
Governance
The Committee has reported in accordance with its Terms of Reference and in particular has recommended to the Board the 
adoption of this Annual Report & Accounts and the proposal to reappoint KPMG LLP as independent auditors at the AGM. A 
formal evaluation of the effectiveness of the Committee was carried out during the year (see page 62); based upon the results 
of that evaluation, the Committee believes that it has operated effectively during the year.

John Nicolson and Andrew Cripps are Independent Non-Executive Directors, and David Maloney, Chairman of the Board, met 
the independence criteria in ‘The Code’ on appointment. Elisa Gomez de Bonilla (General Counsel and Company Secretary) 
serves as secretary to the Committee, except for one meeting where Dorothy Lowry (Group HR Director) acted as Secretary 
to the meeting. The Chief Executive Officer generally attends our Committee meetings by invitation. We also ask other 
members of senior management, such as the Group HR Director, to present to the Committee during the year. 
Responsibilities and roles of the Committee 
The Nomination Committee is responsible for regularly reviewing the structure, size and composition (including the skills, 
knowledge, independence and experience) required of the Board compared to its current position, and making recommendations 
to the Board with regard to any changes; giving full consideration to succession planning for Directors, taking into account the 
challenges and opportunities facing the Company, and the skills and expertise that will, therefore, be needed on the Board in the 
future; and identifying and nominating for the approval of the Board candidates to fill Board vacancies as and when they arise. 
The Nomination Committee takes into account the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014 (The Code)  
and any regulatory requirements that are applicable to the Company. It ensures that external evaluations of the Board are 
carried out according to the applicable regulations. The full Terms of Reference of the Committee are available on our website, 
www.stockspirits.com.

Main activities of the Committee during the year
The Committee met in March 2015 to determine Directors’ independence or non-independence for the purpose of 
recommending to the Board the reappointment of Directors at the AGM. 
In May 2015 the Committee met to discuss succession planning of senior management, both in terms of permanent succession 
and also short-term cover for senior roles. The Board recognises that effective succession planning is fundamental to Board 
effectiveness. By ensuring there is development of talented personnel to move into senior management positions where 
appropriate, and to provide cover for such positions, this helps to mitigate the risks associated with unforeseen events such as 
the departure of a key individual, and also assists in promoting diversity. The necessary plans for short-term cover for senior 
roles were discussed and agreed on. As outlined in last year’s Annual Report, a formal permanent succession plan has been 
developed, and this was enhanced. The Committee considers that it is an area of continuous review and focus, and will continue 
working on it during 2016. 
A key focus of the Committee has also been to discuss the future organisation structure of the Group. As the Board discusses 
the future strategy of the Group, any decisions will inevitably impact on the optimum structure. We will continue to discuss this 
topic through 2016.
The Committee identified the key skills and experience required of the new Non-Executive Director. Following an external 
search by Odgers (a Global Search Firm), the Board agreed with the advisors a short list and a number of interviews were 
conducted by the members of the Nomination Committee. The Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer then held the final 
interview with the recommended candidate and once confirmed, the Nomination Committee proposed to the Board and the 
Board agreed to appoint Miroslaw Stachowich, a Polish national with significant experience in Eastern Europe, as new Non-
Executive Director of the Company.
In accordance with the recommendation for FTSE 350 companies set out in the Code, all of the Company’s Directors will stand 
for re-election at the forthcoming AGM. The biographical details of the current directors can be found on pages 54 and 55. The 
Committee considers that the performance of each of the Directors standing for re-election continues to be effective, and that 
they each demonstrate commitment to their role, including commitment of time for Board and Committee meetings and any 
other duties.
The corporate responsibility section on pages 40 to 43 of the report explains the Group’s approach to diversity, including 
gender diversity percentages. 
The terms and conditions of appointment of Non-Executive Directors, including the expected time commitment, are available 
for inspection at the Company’s registered office.

Committee Chairman Statement 
I am pleased to introduce the Remuneration Report for our Company.
Our Directors’ remuneration policy is designed to support the delivery of the strategy of the Group (which has been described 
in the Strategy report in pages 3 to 51) as well as ensuring we reward and retain our management team. 
The Annual Report on Remuneration (pages 79 to 84), sets out how the policy was applied in 2015 and details the rewards 
received by Directors. It also sets out how we intend to apply the policy in 2016. 
We do not propose any changes to the Directors’ remuneration policy this year. Consequently, the Remuneration Report is 
only subject to an advisory vote by shareholders at the AGM. 
As indicated by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in their respective statements, the Group’s performance during 
2015 was not in line with expectations and annual targets, which resulted in the need in November of restating the guidance 
given by the Group in August 2015. This has resulted in no annual bonus being paid to the Directors of the Company and the 
senior executive management team and no salary increases will be applied in 2016. 
Recognising the very extensive work done by many people in the organisation during 2015, the Committee has, however, 
agreed to pay some discretionary bonuses to a few top-performing people within the management team in the markets and 
central functions (below the Executive Director level), and to apply salary increases in 2016 for the rest of the organisation in 
line with the average increased price index for 2016 in the territories where the Company is present. 
In 2016, annual bonuses will continue to be based on a combination of annual financial and personal targets which support 
delivery of the Company’s strategy. In 2015 we made our second awards under the Performance Share Plan; these awards 
include a stretching total shareholder return (TSR) performance condition over the three-year performance period as well as 
total earnings per share targets (EPS) over the three-year performance period. Awards to be made to the Directors in 2016 will 
be at the same level as in 2015 (140% of salary) and based also on 50% EPS target and 50% TSR. 
It is worth noting that our two Executive Directors have a large investment in the Company's shares as described on page 82 of 
this report, which we believe encourages the alignment with our shareholders' interests.
I hope you find this report clear and helpful and we count on your support at the AGM.

Directors’ Remuneration policy 
The remuneration arrangements for the Executive Directors have been designed in accordance with the principles set out in 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, and current market and best practice. There have been no changes to the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy from that set out in the Annual Report 2013, and the remuneration policy will not be subject to a 
shareholder vote at the 2016 AGM. 
For ease of reference, we reproduce our Directors' remuneration policy in the next section of the report.
Role of the Remuneration Committee:
The Remuneration Committee determines and agrees with the Board the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of 
the Executive Directors and the senior executive management team. The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is a matter 
for the Chairman of the Board and the Executive Directors subject to the constraints contained in the Company’s Articles of 
Association. No Director or manager shall be involved in any decisions as to their own remuneration. 
The Remuneration Committee will determine the policy for and scope of service agreements, termination payments and 
compensation commitments for the Executive Directors and the senior executive management team. It also ensures that 
Directors’ contractual terms on termination are observed, ‘that failure is not rewarded’ and that the duty to mitigate loss is fully 
recognised. The Remuneration Committee will also agree the policy for authorising claims for expenses from the Directors.
The full Terms of Reference of the Remuneration Committee are available on our website at www.stockspirits.com. 
Directors’ remuneration policy
Remuneration structure 
The table below sets out the elements that are included in the remuneration package for Executive Directors and explains how 
each element of the package operates. The Committee ensures that the incentive structure to be applied does not raise 
environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour. 
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures 
Salary To provide salaries that are 
sufficient to attract and retain 
experienced and capable 
executives who can drive the 
business forward. 
In considering the base salary 
(and other elements of 
remuneration) of Executive 
Directors, the Committee  
takes due regard of the pay  
and conditions of the 
workforce generally.
Salaries are paid in equal 
monthly instalments and 
are normally reviewed on 
an annual basis.
The current salaries for 
the Executive Directors 
are set out in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
Having due regard to  
the average level of 
increase for other Group 
employees, annual  
salary reviews will be 
conducted taking full 
consideration of external 
market relativities 
through formal published 
surveys; the economic 
environments in which  
the Company operates; 
and the Company’s  
ability to pay based on 
past performance and 
future outlook.

Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures 
Benefits To operate a competitive benefits 
structure that provides adequate 
protection to our Directors  
and aids in their recruitment  
and retention. 
Benefits currently 
provided include private 
medical cover, critical 
illness cover, life insurance 
and an annual car 
allowance. 
Additional benefits  
may be provided as 
appropriate to take into 
account the nature and 
location of the role. 
The Committee monitors 
the overall cost of the 
benefit provision on a 
periodic basis. The current 
benefit cover includes:
–  critical illness cover of 
75% of salary,
–  life assurance of  
4x salary,
–  car allowance of 
£12,000 p.a.,
– private medical benefits.
Critical illness cover, life 
assurance and private 
medical cover are 
provided through third 
party providers and 
therefore the cost to  
the Company and the 
value to the Executive 
Director may vary from 
year to year.
Not applicable.
Pension Provide a competitive means  
of long-term retirement saving 
for executives.
The Company will provide 
a monthly cash allowance 
in lieu of a contribution  
to a pension scheme or 
contribute an amount  
to a money-purchase

Plan (ABP)  
and Deferred 
Annual Bonus 
Plan (DABP)
Rewards achievement of annual 
financial objectives while 
encouraging a long-term focus 
through the use of deferred  
share awards.
The annual bonus may be 
paid in cash or in deferred 
shares (under the DABP). 
The Committee’s current 
intention is for 25% of any 
bonus to be deferred 
under the DABP. 
However, under the rules 
of the ABP, the Committee 
may decide to satisfy it 
entirely in shares.
Any deferred shares will 
be granted in the form of 
nil (or nominal) cost 
options or conditional 
awards, and will normally 
be subject to a two-year 
vesting period. Dividend 
equivalents may be 
payable on the deferred 
share awards. 
Claw-back and, in the case 
of deferred share awards, 
malus provisions, will 
apply (see below).
Maximum bonus 
(including cash and 
deferred shares) of  
140% of salary.
The performance targets 
used for the annual  
bonus will be set by the 
Committee at the start of 
each financial year. The 
metrics and weightings 
used may vary from year 
to year to reflect changing 
business priorities. The 
measures will be based  
on financial performance 
and the individual Key 
Result Areas (KRAs) for 
each executive.  Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 74

At the discretion of the

Remuneration Committee 
determines that the 
performance conditions 
have been satisfied). 
The awards are subject  
to forfeiture and

provisions will apply to 
any vested awards.
Maximum PSP award 
opportunity of 200%  
of salary (or 300% in 
exceptional circumstances). 
However, awards for 2015 
were limited to 140% of 
salary. In 2016, the awards 
will be limited to 140% of 
salary and will include the 
usual claw-back provisions.
The vesting of PSP awards 
granted to Executive 
Directors will be subject 
to performance conditions 
set by the Committee 
prior to grant.
For 2014, 100% of the 
awards were based on 
relative total shareholder 
return (TSR) performance.
For subsequent awards 
(those made in 2015 and 
to be made in 2016 and 
beyond), 50% of the 
awards will be based  
on adjusted EPS 
performance, and 50% 
will be based on relative 
TSR performance.
The EPS targets will be set 
prior to each grant, taking 
into account the future 
outlook at that time. A 
sliding scale of targets will 
be set with no more than 
25% vesting at threshold 
performance. 
The TSR condition will  
be measured relative  
to an appropriate peer 
group of companies, with 
25% vesting at median

Further details on the operation of the incentive schemes
Annual bonus
The payment of any bonus is ultimately at the discretion of the Committee. The Committee retains the ability, in exceptional 
circumstances, to adjust previously set targets and/or set different performance measures if events occur that cause the 
Remuneration Committee to determine that the measures are no longer appropriate, and that amendment is required so that 
they achieve their original purpose.
Performance share awards
The Remuneration Committee may, acting fairly and reasonably, vary performance conditions applying to existing PSP awards 
if an event has occurred that causes the Remuneration Committee to consider that it would be appropriate to amend the 
performance conditions, and the varied conditions are not materially less challenging than the original conditions would have 
been but for the event in question.
In relation to performance conditions applying to future PSP awards, the Remuneration Committee retains the ability to adjust 
the weightings and/or set different performance measures to those described above if it considers it appropriate to do so. 
However, the Committee would notify its major shareholders in advance of any such changes. 
Claw-back provisions
Claw-back provisions may be operated at the discretion of the Committee in respect of awards granted under the ABP, the 
DABP and the PSP in certain circumstances (including where there has been a material misstatement of accounts, an error in 
assessing any applicable performance condition or misconduct on the part of the participant). Claw-back may be operated 
during a period of two years following the vesting of a DABP or PSP award, or within two years following the payment of an 
ABP bonus. 
Malus provisions
Malus provisions may be operated at the discretion of the Committee in respect of awards granted under the DABP in certain 
circumstances (including where there has been a material misstatement of accounts, an error in assessing any applicable 
condition or misconduct on the part of the participant). Malus may be operated before the vesting of an award. 
Differences in policy from the wider employee population
The Company’s approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the Group. However, there are some differences between 
the policy for Executive Directors as set out above and its approach to payment of employees generally – for example, there is an 
increased emphasis on performance-related pay for Executive Directors through a higher annual bonus opportunity and 
participation in the PSP , plus a higher proportion of their total remuneration is also at risk. The Committee has not consulted 
directly with employees on the executive remuneration policy, but it takes into account the pay and employment conditions of  
the general workforce when considering any changes to the quantum or structure of the executive remuneration packages.
Non-Executive Directors’ fees
The remuneration for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors takes the form solely of fees.
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity
To attract and retain high- 
calibre Non-Executive 
Directors by offering 
competitive fees.
Fees are paid on a per-annum basis and 
are not varied for the number of days 
worked. The fees are set to take into 
account the responsibilities of the role, 
the experience of the Chairman and 
Non-Executive Directors, and the 
expected time commitment involved. 
Additional fees may be paid to reflect 
extra responsibilities such as for the 
Senior Independent Director, or when 
acting as Chairman or a member of any 
of the Board Committees. 
The current fees for the Chairman and Non-
Executive Directors are set out in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration. The fee levels may be reviewed 
biannually, and may be increased if appropriate to do 
so. The maximum aggregate fee to all Directors that 
may be paid is limited to £2,000,000 under the 
Company’s Articles of Association. Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 76

Legacy arrangements
This provides details on certain arrangements that were entered into with the Executive Directors prior to admission, and which 
were fully disclosed in the prospectus. No further awards will be granted under either agreement. Details of the outstanding 
awards under the agreements are set out below, and further details are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Joint ownership equity (JOE) agreements 
Prior to admission, the Executive Directors owned shares in a Group Company under a joint ownership equity arrangement.  
As part of the corporate reorganisation on admission, these shares were exchanged for shares in the Company, and the 
Executive Directors each entered into a new agreement (the JOE agreements) in relation to such shares. Under these 
agreements, each of the Executive Directors was granted an option to purchase the interest in shares held by the trustee. 
Each option is exercisable for five years from the date of admission, and is not subject to performance conditions or forfeiture. 
Details of the awards are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration. Dividends are payable on the JOE shares.
Top-up option agreements and substitute option agreement
The top-up option agreements document one-off share-option awards granted to the Executive Directors on admission to 
reward management for bringing the Company to admission. The substitute agreement documents a one-off share award 
granted to the Chief Financial Officer on admission in substitution for a commitment over shares in another Group Company 
given in 2012. These nil-cost options are not subject to forfeiture or performance conditions, and are ordinarily exercisable up 
until the tenth anniversary following grant. The Chief Executive Officer was granted a top-up option over 535,137 shares. The 
Chief Financial Officer was granted a top-up option over 226,728 shares and a substitute option over 531,773 shares. Dividend 
equivalents are payable on the vested shares between grant and exercise.

Service contracts and letters of appointment 
Each Executive Director has been appointed under a service contract. These contracts contain the following obligations on the 
Company that could give rise to, or impact on, remuneration payments or payments for loss of office:
• To provide pay, contributions to a pension scheme (or a cash allowance in lieu) and benefits as specified in the contract.
• To give the Executive Director eligibility at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee to participate in short- and  
long-term incentive plans.
• To provide 30 working days’ paid holiday per annum, or pay in lieu of any accrued but untaken holiday on termination  
of employment.
• To provide sick pay as specified in the contract.
• To terminate the contract on not less than 12 months’ notice by either the Company or the Director or to make a payment 
in lieu of notice equal to value of the base salary either in one lump sum or in phased instalments and reduced by amounts 
earned from alternative remunerative positions obtained during the notice period. 
Each of the Non-Executive Directors is appointed by letter of appointment for an initial term of three years. Their 
appointments may be terminated earlier without compensation on three months’ notice and are subject to annual re-election 
by the shareholders.
The Executive Directors’ service contracts and the Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment are kept available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered office. 
Payments for loss of office
In the event of an Executive Director’s departure, the Company will honour the contractual entitlements of that Director. The 
Company’s approach to payments for loss of office will be based on the following principles:
Notice period/pay in lieu
Executive Directors have rolling contracts with 12-month notice periods. The Company may elect to terminate employment 
immediately by making a payment in lieu of notice equivalent to the Executive Director’s salary for the notice period. The 
payment in lieu of notice may be made in monthly instalments, which can be reduced to the extent the Executive Director 
obtains alternative paid employment. All other benefits including pension contributions or allowance (as the case may be) will 
cease on termination. 
The Company may terminate a Director’s employment without notice (or payment in lieu) in certain circumstances, including 
where the executive commits a serious breach of his or her service agreement or is found guilty of gross misconduct.
Outstanding incentive awards 
Leavers 
As a general rule, incentive awards (e.g. outstanding PSP and DABP awards and entitlement to annual bonus) will lapse on a 
participant ceasing to hold employment or to be a Director within the Company’s Group. 
Good leavers
However, if the reason for the cessation for employment falls within certain good-leaver categories (which include, for 
example, cessation due to a participant’s injury, disability, retirement, redundancy, the employing company or business being 
sold out of the Company’s Group) or in other circumstances at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, then the 
incentive award will ordinarily vest/or be payable on the normal vesting/payment date, subject to performance and time 
pro-rating. 
The Remuneration Committee retains the discretion not to time pro-rate if it considers it appropriate to do so. Under the rules 
of the PSP, the Committee may allow the outstanding share award to vest early to a good leaver and if a participant dies, his or 
her award will ordinarily vest early (unless the Remuneration Committee decides otherwise).
In the case of DABP awards, outstanding awards for a good leaver will vest early to such extent as the Committee  
determines appropriate. Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 78
Governance
Directors’ remuneration policy continued
Takeovers
In the event of a takeover or winding up of the Company (not being an internal corporate reorganisation), all PSP awards will 
vest early, subject to: (i) performance and (ii) time pro-rating, although the Remuneration Committee can decide to reduce or 
eliminate the pro-rating of a PSP award or to disapply (or partially disapply) any performance conditions if it regards it as 
appropriate to do so in the particular circumstances. 
In the event of a takeover or winding up of the Company, the Remuneration Committee may allow bonuses for that financial 
year to be paid early, subject to: (i) the extent that the performance conditions have been satisfied at that time; and (ii) the 
pro-rating of the bonus to reflect the reduced period of time between grant and the date of such event, although the 
Remuneration Committee can decide to reduce or eliminate the pro-rating of a bonus.
In the event of a takeover or winding up of the Company (not being an internal corporate reorganisation), all DABP awards will 
vest early in full.
Internal corporate reorganisation
In the event of an internal corporate reorganisation, PSP and DABP awards may, at the discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee, be replaced by equivalent new awards over shares in a new holding company, provided that the Board of Directors 
of the new holding company agrees. If such replacement is not agreed before the internal corporate reorganisation takes place, 
then the PSP and DABP awards will vest on the basis that would apply in the case of a takeover.
JOE agreements, top-up option agreements and substitute-option agreement 
In the event of the Director’s loss of office or a change of control, any unexercised option will remain exercisable in accordance 
with the terms of the relevant agreement until the expiry of the relevant exercise period.
Outplacement services may be provided where appropriate, and any statutory entitlements or sums to settle or compromise 
claims in connection with a termination would be paid as necessary.
Recruitment of Directors
Where a new Executive Director is appointed, the principles outlined above in relation to the structure, components and 
maximum opportunities of the existing Executive Directors’ remuneration package and service contract terms will also apply 
to any newly appointed Director. Salaries for new hires will be set to reflect their skills and experience, the Company’s intended 
pay positioning and the market rate for the role. In accordance with the above policy table, the maximum variable pay that may 
be offered is 340% of salary (440% in exceptional circumstances).
It may be necessary to buy out incentive awards that would be forfeited on leaving the previous employer. In determining the 
structure of any buy-out award, the Committee will take into account the form of the awards forgone (cash or shares), the 
timing of the awards and their expected value. Replacement share awards, if used, may be granted under the PSP, although 
awards may also be granted outside of these schemes if necessary and as permitted under the Listing Rules. 
In the case of an internal promotion, any outstanding variable pay awarded in relation to the previous role will be allowed to 
pay out according to its terms of grant.
Fees for a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director will be set in line with the approved policy.
Non-Executive positions by Executive Directors
The Company’s policy is to allow the Executive Directors to take only one Non-Executive role in another company with prior 
consent from the Board, which cannot be unreasonably withheld.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Remuneration Committee is committed to open and transparent dialogue with shareholders, and seeks major shareholder 
views in advance of proposing significant changes to its policy. 
There were no changes to the Remuneration policy during 2015, so consultation with shareholders was not necessary on 
this occasion.

Annual Report on Remuneration
This part of the report details how the Remuneration Policy was implemented during 2015, and will be put to an advisory 
Shareholder vote at the 2016 AGM. The information in this section has been audited where stated.
Composition of the Remuneration Committee 
The members of the Remuneration Committee during the year are set out in the table below. During the year ended  
31 December 2015, the Committee held seven meetings, and attendance is summarised below:
Meetings eligible to attend Meetings attended
John Nicolson Chairman and Independent Non-Executive Director 7 7
David Maloney* Chairman of the Board 3 3
Andrew Cripps Senior Independent Non-Executive Director 7 7
Mirek Stachowicz** Independent Non-Executive Director 1 1
Jack Keenan* Chairman of the Board 3 3
* Jack Keenan retired on 18 May 2015 and David Maloney stepped down from the Committee on 9 November 2015. 
** Mirek Stachowicz joined the Company and became a member of the Committee on 9 November 2015. 
All members of the Committee are independent. 
Elisa Gomez de Bonilla (General Counsel and Company Secretary) serves as Secretary to the Committee except for one of the 
meetings where Dorothy Lowry (Group HR Director) served as Secretary, and the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
generally attends our Committee meetings by invitation. We also ask other members of senior management (such as the Group 
HR Director) to present to the Committee during the year. 
Advice provided to the Committee
During the year, the Committee were advised by New Bridge Street (NBS). NBS was appointed by the Committee at the time of 
the IPO and has continued advising it since then. NBS is a founder signatory to the Remuneration Consulting Group’s Code of 
Conduct, and its total fees in relation to Remuneration Committee advice during the year were £20,338 plus VAT. The 
Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and the safeguards against them, and is satisfied that NBS does not 
have any such interests, or connections with the Group, that may impair its independence. Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 80

Annual bonus awarded for 2015 (audited)
Due to the performance of the Company during 2015, there was no annual bonus for the Executive Directors for 2015. The 
bonuses were based on challenging financial and personal targets; 50% of the bonus was based on EBITDA, 30% on cash flow 
targets and 20% on individual Key Result Areas (KRAs). 
The targets themselves are considered to be commercially sensitive as they refer to the specific strategy of the Company. 
Many of the Company's competitors are not listed companies of the same size of the Company, and would have a competitive 
advantage if such targets are disclosed publicly. The targets will be disclosed when they are no longer considered to be 
commercially sensitive. The Committee does not have a fixed timeframe for when the targets will no longer be commercially 
sensitive, but it will continue to review this on an annual basis.

Directors’ share interests (audited)
The table below sets out the Directors’ shareholdings and, for the Executive Directors, a summary of their outstanding scheme 
interests (being the PSP, JOE and option awards). 
The Executive Directors are subject to shareholding guidelines requiring them to build and maintain a shareholding equivalent 
to 100% of base salary. Their achievement against these guideline limits is set out in the table below. It can be noted that their 
shareholdings are very well above the requirement set up in the guidelines, which clearly indicates the alignment of the 
Executive Directors’ interests with those of our shareholders and their high commitment in delivering the results of the 
Company in line with the Group’s strategy.

How the Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be applied for 2016
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy to be applied for 2016 is consistent with that set out in the Remuneration Policy Report.
Base salaries
The current salaries for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are £490,000 (€671,233) (2014: £490,000 
(€604,938)) and £318,000 (€435,616) (2014:£318,000 (€392,593)) respectively. No changes are proposed for 2016. 
Annual bonus
The annual bonus plan for 2016 will be based on achievement against a range of financial targets and individual Key Result 
Areas (KRAs). The KRAs are linked to the financial, strategic and operational performance of the business, and include 
measures relating to business and sales growth, market share, brand-building and organisational targets. The Annual Bonus 
will be based 50% on achievement of the EBITDA target, 30% on the cash target and 20% on the KRAs. These performance 
targets are the key drivers to sustain the growth of the Group, and the individual KRAs ensure that the Executive Directors are 
committed to the Group’s strategy. The forward-looking targets are deemed to be commercially sensitive. Under the Directors’ 
remuneration policy, the maximum bonus opportunity is 140% of salary, and 25% of any bonus paid for 2016 will be issued in 
the form of deferred shares. Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 84
Governance
Annual Report on Remuneration continued
Performance Share Plan
The next award of shares under the Performance Share Plan will be made within six weeks after the preliminary 
announcement of the 2015 annual results. This year, awards of 140% of salary will be granted. The awards vest after three 
years subject to continued employment and the achievement of the performance targets.
50% of any awards to be made will be subject to a relative total shareholder return (TSR) performance condition that compares 
Stock Spirits Group’s TSR performance to a peer group of 13 international food and beverage companies, vesting as follows:
Stock Spirits TSR relative to the TSR comparator group Percentage of the awards that will vest
Below median Nil
Median 25%
Between median and upper quartile Pro rata between 25% and 100%
Upper quartile or above 100%
The remaining 50% of any awards made will be subject to an earnings per share target. The targets for the awards to be issued 
in 2016, will be published on RNS at the time the awards are made, within 6 weeks from the announcement of the 2015 results.
There will also be an underlying requirement for any vesting to occur which will be that, at the time of vesting, the 
Remuneration Committee must be satisfied with the overall financial performance of the Group.
Fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The annual fee policy for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors remains the same as last year. 
Shareholding vote at the AGM
The voting outcome at the 2015 AGM was as follows:

Remuneration policy remains unchanged for 2016, and will therefore not be subject to a vote.

Directors' report
The Corporate Governance report on pages 59 to 63 forms part of the Directors’ report. 
The Directors’ report, prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and the UK Listing 
Authority’s Rules, and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, comprises pages 85 to 88. 
Directors 
The Directors in office at the date of this report are shown on pages 54 to 55. All served throughout the year under review, 
except for Mirek Stachowicz, who was appointed as a Director on 9 November 2015. Jack Keenan was a Director until his 
retirement on 18 May 2015. 
Directors’ interests in the Company’s shares 
The interests of the Directors of the Company at the 31 December 2015, and their connected persons, in the issued shares of 
the Company disclosed in accordance with the FCA’s Listing Rules, are given in the Remuneration Report on pages 71 to 84. 
The Remuneration Report also sets out details of any changes in those interests between the year-end and 10 March 2016.
Powers of Directors 
Our Directors’ powers are determined by UK legislation and the Company’s Articles of Association (the Articles), which are 
available on our website, www.stockspirits.com. The Articles may be amended by a special resolution of the members. The 
Directors may exercise all of the Company’s powers, provided that the Articles, or applicable legislation, do not stipulate that 
any such powers must be exercised by the members. 
Further details of Directors’ contracts, remuneration and their interests in the shares of the Company at 31 December 2015 
are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 71 to 84. 
Indemnification of Directors and insurance 
The indemnification for Directors provided by the Company has been arranged in accordance with the Company’s Articles of 
Association (the Articles) and the Companies Act 2006. As far as is permitted by legislation, all officers of the Company are 
indemnified out of the Company’s own funds against any liability incurred while conducting their role in the Company, unless 
such liability is to the Company or an associated company. The Company has appropriate Directors’ and Officers’ liability 
insurance cover in place in respect of any legal action against, amongst others, its Executive and Non-Executive Directors. 
Appointment and replacement of Directors 
The rules about the appointment and replacement of Directors are contained in the Company’s Articles. They provide that 
Directors may be appointed by ordinary resolution of the members, or by a resolution of the Directors. In addition to powers to 
remove a Director conferred by legislation, the Company may also remove a Director by special resolution. 
Compensation for loss of office 
We do not have arrangements with any Director that would provide compensation for loss of office or employment resulting 
from a takeover, except that provisions of the Company’s share plans may cause options and awards granted under such plans 
to vest on a takeover. Further information is provided on page 77.
Other statutory information 
During the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, the Group made the following statements, which are regarded as 
a profit forecast (in the case of the statements made in 2015) or a profit estimate (in the case of the statement made in 2016) 
for the purposes of the Financial Services Authority’s Listing Rule 9.2.18:
• 20 August 2015 – “While there are risks facing the business from continuing aggressive competitor behaviour and erratic 
customer ordering patterns, we currently believe that our full-year EBITDA will be within the range of €60m to €68m.”
• 27 November 2015 – “In August we provided the market with guidance that our full-year results were expected to fall in 
the range of €60m to €68m EBITDA, based on some key assumptions. Since then, in Poland, we have seen continued 
aggressive pricing from competitors and irregular buying patterns by customers. This has led to continued movement in 
sales away from Traditional Trade to Discounters in Poland. During November, customers’ orders fell significantly short of 
expected commitments, and consequently, we currently do not have confidence that this shortfall will be made up in 
December. As a result, we now expect the range for the full-year EBITDA to be between €50m to €54m EBITDA, before 
any foreign exchange impact.”
• 26 January 2016 – “Trading in Q4, and therefore for the full-year 2015, was in line with the guidance we provided in 
November 2015 – both in Poland and in our other core markets. We therefore expect our Group EBITDA for 2015 to be in 
the upper half of the range €50m – €54m, after taking into account FX.” Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 86

Financial risk management 
The Group’s financial risk management objectives and policies, including its use of financial instruments, are set out in note  
30 to the Group’s consolidated financial statements on pages 134 to 138. 
Post-balance sheet events 
There were no events after the balance sheet date that require adjustment to or disclosure in these financial statements. 
Future business developments 
Further details on these are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 3 to 51. 
Research and development 
The Company does not undertake any material research and development activities. 
The existence of branches outside the UK 
The Group’s activities in overseas jurisdictions are carried out through subsidiary companies. The Company does not have  
any branches outside the UK. 
Employee involvement and policy regarding disabled persons 
A description of the action taken by the Company in relation to employee involvement, including how the Company provides 
employees with information on matters concerning them and the Group, can be found on page 40. 
The Company has an equal opportunities policy, and procedures are in place that are designed to provide for full and fair 
consideration and selection of disabled applicants to ensure they are properly trained to perform safely and effectively, and to 
provide career opportunities that allow them to fulfil their potential. Where an employee becomes disabled in the course of 
their employment, the Company will actively seek to retain them wherever possible by making adjustments to their work 
content and environment, or by retraining them to undertake new roles.
Greenhouse gas emissions
In 2015, SSG’s total Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (indirect) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions were 35,182 tonnes and  
9,312 tonnes of CO
2
 respectively (CO
2
e), a total of 44,494 tonnes. This is an 11% reduction compared to 50,014 tonnes in 2014 
(39,940 tonnes of Scope 1 and 10,074 tonnes of Scope 2 CO
2
e). The emissions intensity factor rose from 402 grams CO
2
e per 
litre of packaged product to 439 grams. This was because the emissions of the Group’s Baltic Distillery fell by only 8% 
compared to the 18% fall in packaged goods production. Baltic Distillery, accounting for 74% of group emissions, remains the 
largest single emitter in the Group as its core activity is energy intensive rectification. As production volumes fall, operations 
become less efficient and fixed energy usages, such as heat and lighting, have a greater impact on the CO
2
e KPI. 
As in prior years, we have applied the latest available DEFRA UK location based conversion factors (2015) to calculate the 
current year emissions. All data capture procedures, conversion and reporting have undergone independent limited assurance 
by ERM Certification and Verification Services. The 2015 independent assurance statement is available on the Stock Spirits 
Group website.
The Group complies with all current regulations on emissions including greenhouse gas emissions, where such regulation exists 
in our markets. We have reviewed the impact on the business from the EU Energy Efficiency Directive (2012/27/EU), for 
example, the Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (ESOS) in the UK. Within our Group, only our Czech business is currently 
required under this Directive to carry out an energy efficiency audit. We are compliant with our obligations in this respect.
We have reported on all of the emissions sources required under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Reports) Regulations 2013. These sources fall within our consolidated financial statements. We do not have responsibility for 
any emission sources that are not included in our consolidated financial statements. 
Significant agreements 
The Group is a party to the following significant agreements that would take effect, alter or terminate on a change of control of 
the Company following a takeover bid: 
• Facilities agreement dated 18 November 2015 for a €200,000,000 revolving credit facility (RCF) with a banking club 
consisting of five banks including HSBC who also act as the Agent. The loans bear variable rates of interest which are 
linked to the inter-bank offer rates of the drawers, WIBOR, PRIBOR or EURIBOR as appropriate. Each of the loans have a 
variable margin element to the interest charge. The margin is linked to a ratchet mechanism where the margin decreases as 
the Group's leverage covenant decreases. Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 88
Governance
Dividend 
A dividend of €0.0125 per share was paid at the half year stage (see note 29 to the financial statements), and the Directors 
recommend a final dividend of €0.0455 – to be paid on 27 May 2016 – to shareholders on the share register at the close of 
business on 6 May 2016. The shares will be quoted ex-dividend on 5 May 2016. The FX fixing date will be 6 May 2016.
Total ordinary dividends paid and proposed for the year amount to €0.058. 
Going concern 
The Directors have considered the Group’s debt maturity and cash-flow projections, and an analysis of projected-debt 
covenant compliance. The Board is satisfied that the Group’s forecasts and projections, taking into account reasonable changes 
in trading performance, shows that the Group will continue in operation for a period of at least 12 months from the date of this 
report, and has neither the intention nor the need to liquidate or materially curtail the scale of its operations. For this reason 
the Group continues to adopt the going-concern basis in preparing its financial statements. More information can be seen in 
note 2 to the financial statements. 
Statement on disclosure to auditors 
So far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information, that would be needed by the Company’s auditors 
in connection with preparing their audit report (which appears on pages 90 to 93), of which the auditors are not aware; 
each Director, in accordance with Section 418(2) of the Companies Act 2006, has taken all reasonable steps that he or 
she ought to have taken as a Director to make him or her aware of any such information, and to ensure that the auditors 
are aware of such information. 
Auditors 
KPMG LLP is the statutory auditor of the Company, and resolutions for its reappointment and to authorise the Directors to 
agree the auditor’s remuneration will be submitted at the 2016 Annual General Meeting. 
Approval of Directors’ report 
This Directors’ report was approved for and signed on behalf of the Board.

Directors' report continued Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 89
Statement of Directors' responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and parent company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. Under 
that law, they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and 
applicable law, and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements on the same basis. 
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company, and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of 
the Group and parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies, and then apply them consistently
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and 
• prepare the financial statements on the going-concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions, and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company, and 
enable them to ensure its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group, and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic report, Directors’ report, 
Directors’ remuneration report and Corporate governance report that complies with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect of the ARA
We confirm that, to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company, and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
• the Strategic report and Directors' report include a fair review of the development and performance of the business and 
the position of the issuer and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
We consider the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy.
By order of the Board.

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of Stock Spirits Group PLC for the year ended 31 December 2015 set out on  
pages 96 to 158. In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at  
31 December 2015 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU);
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and 
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements, the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest 
effect on our audit, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows:
Sales incentives and revenue cut-off
Refer to page 64 (Audit Committee Report), page 103 (Accounting Policies) and page 114 (Note 5).
The risk – The Group negotiates a variety of sales incentive arrangements including customer rebates and retrospective 
discounts with most of its customers. The reductions as a result of these arrangements are significant in the income statement 
of the period, in particular from the Polish operations.
There are a large number of individual customer arrangements for the Group to monitor and there is a risk over the incorrect 
inclusion or non-inclusion of sales incentives in the current period and year-end accruals, or incorrect calculation of the 
amounts recorded. Accruals for incentives are not all confirmed by customers at 31 December, albeit rebate measurement 
periods are retrospective and in most cases coterminous with the 31 December year-end. 
The business is seasonal in nature with peak revenues towards the end of the financial year, which increases the risk of 
inclusion of revenue in not the appropriate period. During the latter part of 2014 and 2015 trading conditions continued to be 
challenging, leading to a trading statement revising EBITDA forecasts downwards being issued in November 2015. These 
considerations give rise to an increased risk of management bias or fraud over the timing of revenue recognition.
Our response – Our procedures included the following:
• We selected a sample including significant and certain other customer contracts, understood the key terms and 
considered the appropriate amount and timing or revenue deductions.
• We performed a comparison of sales deductions as a proportion of sales throughout the year and across regions to 
identify any unusual trends and assessed whether this indicated further risk of revenue being inappropriately recognised 
in the current year. For a sample of rebates, we agreed the rebate calculation to the contract, and considered whether 
there is any evidence from customers of inaccurate calculations by assessing the ageing of rebate receivables and 
historical payments trends.
• We have sought customer confirmations of amounts owed with a sample of customers, and investigated any significant 
differences between confirmations received and the Group’s records.
• We have performed testing for unrecorded liabilities through samples of post year-end cash disbursements, invoices 
received and credit notes issued to assess completeness of recorded liabilities.
• We tested a sample of invoices issued close to the year-end to assess whether revenue was recorded in the appropriate 
period. We also inspected journal entries relating to revenue and for transactions close to the year-end, to assess whether 
they were booked into the correct period.
We also assessed whether the Group’s accruals disclosures and the recognition of revenues net of reserves is appropriate and 
in accordance with relevant accounting standards. Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 91
Transfer pricing and related uncertain tax positions 
Refer to page 64 (Audit Committee Report), page 103 (Accounting Policies) and pages 120 to 121 (note 13).
The risk – The Group has a number of outstanding tax assessments. The tax risks for the Group include transfer pricing 
amounts charged not being considered deductible by local authorities for corporation tax. The Directors are required to make 
judgements and estimates in determining the liabilities to be recognised with regard to the various taxation exposures. In Italy 
there are open tax enquiries for the periods 2006-2010, for which amounts have been provided against as detailed in the 
income tax note 13. 
Our response – Our procedures included the following:
• We held a programme of meetings with the Group’s tax team at Group and local levels to understand the tax strategy and 
related tax risks, any associated technical tax issues, and the status of any current tax challenges or litigation.
• We compared the Group's transfer pricing documentation to the latest market practices in this area.
• Using our own local tax specialists, we assessed the appropriateness of the liabilities and disclosures in the financial 
statements after having read the latest correspondence between Group and the various tax authorities, and have obtained 
documentation from the Group’s advisors containing their views on material tax exposures and any related litigation.
Recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives
Refer to page 64 (Audit Committee Report), page 103 (Accounting Policies) and pages 124 to 125 (note 17).
The risk – The appropriateness of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets is dependent on achieving sufficient 
levels of future cash flows. The assets are spread across a range of markets, and consequently forecast cash flows used in 
impairment testing are more complex, requiring assumptions to be made relating to differing economic environments within 
those markets. Estimating recoverable amount is subjective due to the inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting and 
discounting future cash flows.
Our response – Our procedures included the testing of controls relating to the regular update, monitoring, analysis and 
appropriate approval of the value-in-use models used in impairment testing. In addition:
• we considered the applied discounted cash flow model by challenging the reasonableness of assumptions including the 
forecast cash flows, long-term growth rates and the discount rates. We performed this testing by reference to past 
performance, future plans, external market data and by performing sensitivity analysis on the model for each market. Our 
assessment was based on our knowledge of the business and industry. Our procedures were particularly focused on the 
key assumptions relating to the Czech Cash Generating Unit for which the level of headroom is the most sensitive of all 
their CGUs
• where appropriate, we involved our own specialists, including an assessment of the inputs for the calculation of discount 
rates by location. Our procedures included forming our own assessment of the discount rate based on the key inputs by 
location, such as risk free rates, size premium, country premium and inflation
• we considered the adequacy of the presentation and disclosures related to goodwill and intangibles impairment and 
related estimation uncertainty. Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 92
Independent auditor's report

3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at €1.5 million. This has been determined with reference 
to a benchmark of profit before taxation, averaged across the past three years (of which it represents 4.3%), which we consider 
to be one of the principal considerations for members of the Company in assessing the financial performance of the Group.
We agreed with the Audit Committee to report to it all corrected and uncorrected misstatements we identified through our 
audit with a value in excess of €75,000, in addition to other audit misstatements below that threshold, which we believe 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the Group's eight reporting components, we subject five to audits for Group reporting purposes. The work on five of the 
components was performed by component auditors including at the key reporting components in Poland, Czech Republic, Italy 
and Slovakia. Audit procedures covered 97% of total Group revenue; 98% Group profit before taxation; and 97% total Group 
assets. The Group team performed the audit of the parent company, consolidation and certain Group based transactions such 
as intercompany balances.
The Group team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed 
above and the information to be reported back. The Group team approved the component's materiality, which were set 
individually for each component and ranged from €0.3 million to €1 million, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of 
the Group across the components.
The Group audit team visited four component locations in Poland, Czech Republic and Italy including to assess the audit risk 
and strategy. Telephone conference meetings were also held with these component auditors and others that were not 
physically visited. At these visits and meetings, the findings reported to the Group team were discussed in more detail, and any 
further work required by the Group team was then performed by the component auditor.
4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified 
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
5 . We have nothing to report on the disclosures of principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to: 
• the Directors’ viability statement on page 51 concerning the principal risks, their management and, based on that, the 
Directors’ assessment and expectations of the Group’s continuing in operation over the three years to 2018
• the disclosures in note 2 of the financial statements concerning the use of the going-concern basis of accounting.
6. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are required to report by exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have 
identified other information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the 
financial statements, a material misstatement of fact or that is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
• we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the Directors’ 
statement that they consider that the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy; or
• the Audit Committee report does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee. Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 93
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules, we are required to review: 
• the Directors’ statements, as set out on pages 51 and 88, in relation to going concern and longer-term viability; and
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement in the Corporate Governance Framework relating to the Company’s 
compliance with the eleven provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
Scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 89, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements, and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. A description of the scope of an 
audit of financial statements is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members as a body, and is subject to important explanations and disclaimers 
regarding our responsibilities, published on our website at www.kpmg.com/uk/auditscopeukco2014a, which are incorporated 
into this report as if set out in full, and should be read to provide an understanding of the purpose of this report, the work we 
have undertaken and the basis of our opinions.

Financial statements
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
at 31 December 2015
1. Corporate information
These consolidated financial statements were approved and authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of Stock Spirits 
Group PLC (the Company) on 10 March 2016.
Stock Spirits Group PLC is domiciled in England. The Company’s registered office is at Solar House, Mercury Park, Wooburn 
Green, Buckinghamshire, HP10 0HH, United Kingdom.
The Company, together with its subsidiaries (the Group), is involved in the production and distribution of branded spirits 
primarily in Central and Eastern Europe.
2. Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the 
Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements. Thus they continue to adopt a going concern basis of accounting in preparing the  
financial statements.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowings facilities are described in the paragraphs 
below. In addition note 30 to the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its 
capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities, and its exposure to 
credit risk and liquidity.
Details of the terms of each external loan facility are set out in note 23. The Group met its covenant requirements throughout 
the year ended 31 December 2015. 
The Group has positive adjusted free cash flow. On 18th November 2015, the Group signed a new facilities agreement for a 
€200,000,000 revolving credit facility. As at 31 December 2015 €132,496,000 was drawn, and €5,601,000 was utilised for 
customs guarantees in Italy and Germany, thereby leaving access to funds of €61,903,000 which could be drawn at short 
notice. See note 23 for further details.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group will be 
able to operate within the level of its current available facilities and maintain comfortable covenant headroom. The revolving 
credit facility is available as part of wider borrowing arrangements with the syndicate of banks and is not subject to annual 
renewal. Stock Polska Sp. z.o.o. also has a debt factoring facility of €49,765,000 which can be utilised to meet short term 
working capital requirements if necessary. Pursuant to the HSBC Credit Facility, the total amount of receivables subject to a 
factoring facility may not in aggregate exceed €50,000,000. See note 20 for further details.
After making enquiries, the Directors have reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group will have adequate 
resources to continue their operational existence and remain compliant with the covenant requirements for a period of at least 
12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
for preparing the financial statements. Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 103
3. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union. International Financial Reporting Standards are issued by the 
International Accounting Standard Board (IASB). 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors believe there are no 
material uncertainties that lead to significant doubt that the entity can continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 
months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as disclosed in the 
accounting policies below. Exceptions include but are not limited to post-employment benefits and assets classified as held for 
sale measured at fair value.
Changes in accounting policies
In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, the Group followed the same accounting policies and methods of 
computation as compared with those applied in the previous year, except for the adoption of new standards and interpretations 
and revision of the existing standards as of 1 January 2015.
New/Revised standards and interpretations adopted in 2015
The following amendments to existing standards and interpretations were effective for the year, but either they were not 
applicable to or did not have a material impact on the Group:
IAS 19 Employee Benefits – Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions (Amendments) 
New/Revised standards and interpretations not applied
The following standards and interpretations in issue are not yet effective for the Group and have not been adopted by the Group:
Effective dates*
IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts 1 January 2016
Amendments to IFRS 11: Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations 1 January 2016
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41: Bearer Plants 1 January 2016
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of Acceptable Methods  
of Depreciation and Amortisation 1 January 2016
Amendments to IAS 27: Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements 1 January 2016
Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28: Sale or Contribution of Assets between  
an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture 1 January 2016
Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle 1 January 2016
Amendments to IAS 1: Disclosure Initiative 1 January 2016
Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28: Investment Entities – Applying the 
Consolidation Exception 1 January 2016
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments no earlier than 1 January 2018
IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019
The Directors do not expect the adoption of these standards and interpretations to have a material impact on the consolidated 
or company financial statements in the period of initial application. The Directors have completed an initial assessment of the 
potential impact of IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 and don’t believe they will have a material impact on the results of the Group. The 
Directors have not yet completed an assessment of the potential impact of IFRS 16. The Group will continue to monitor any 
potential impact as the new standards become more imminent.
*  The effective dates stated above are those given in the original IASB/IFRIC standards and interpretations. As the Group prepares its financial statements in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union (EU), the application of new standards and interpretations will be subject to their having been 
endorsed for use in the EU via the EU Endorsement mechanism. In the majority of cases this will result in an effective date consistent with that given in the 
original standard or interpretation but the need for endorsement restricts the Group’s discretion to early adopt standards.  Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

Financial statements
3. Accounting policies continued
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries controlled by 
the Company for the years to 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or 
has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has: 
• power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee);
• exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
• the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns. 
Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control. To support this presumption and when  
the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and 
circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including: 
• The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee. 
• Rights arising from other contractual arrangements.
• The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights.
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one 
or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the 
subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary 
acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains 
control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary. 
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are part of the Group from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and 
continue to be part of the Group until the date that such control ceases. Control comprises the power to govern the financial 
and operating policies of the investee so as to obtain benefit from its activities and is achieved through direct or indirect 
ownership of voting rights currently exercisable or convertible potential voting rights or by way of contractual agreement. The 
subsidiary financial statements are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company and are based on consistent 
accounting policies. All intragroup balances and transactions including unrealised profit arising from them are eliminated in full.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the 
Group loses control of a subsidiary it (i) derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary; (ii) 
derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest; (iii) derecognises the cumulative translation differences 
recorded in equity; (iv) recognises the fair value of the consideration received; (v) recognises the fair value of any investment 
retained; (vi) recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss; (vii) recognises the parent’s share of any components previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss or retained earnings, as appropriate.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of any acquisition is measured as the 
aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree. For each business combination the acquirer measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree 
either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirer’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition costs incurred are 
expensed and included within exceptional items.
When the Group acquires a business it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and 
designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition 
date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.
Goodwill is initially recognised at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount 
recognised for non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is 
lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised in profit and loss.
After initial recognition goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment 
testing goodwill acquired in a business combination is from the acquisition date allocated to each of the Group’s cash 
generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination irrespective of whether assets or liabilities of the 
acquisition are assigned to those units. Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 105
Where goodwill forms part of a cash generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill 
associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or 
loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the 
operation disposed of and the portion of the cash generating unit retained.
Purchases of controlling interests in subsidiaries from entities under common control
Purchases of controlling interests in subsidiaries from entities under common control are accounted for using the pooling of 
interests method.
The assets and liabilities of the subsidiary transferred under common control are recorded in these financial statements at the 
historical cost of the controlling entity (the Predecessor). Related goodwill inherent in the Predecessor’s original acquisition is 
also recorded in the financial statements. Any difference between the total book value of net assets, including the 
Predecessor’s goodwill, and the consideration paid is accounted for in the consolidated financial statements as an adjustment 
to the shareholders’ equity.
These financial statements, including corresponding figures, are presented as if a subsidiary had been acquired by the Group 
on the date it was originally acquired by the Predecessor.
Acquisition of subsidiaries
The initial accounting for a business combination involves identifying and determining the fair values to be assigned to the 
acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the cost of the combination. If the initial accounting for a 
business combination can be determined only provisionally by the end of the period in which the combination is effected 
because either the fair values to be assigned to the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities or contingent liabilities or the cost of 
the combination can be determined only provisionally, the Group accounts for the combination using those provisional values. 
The Group recognises any adjustments to those provisional values as a result of completing the initial accounting within twelve 
months of the acquisition date.
Revenue recognition
Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all the following conditions are satisfied:
• The Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods; in general this is 
deemed to occur when customers take delivery of the goods.
• The Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor 
effective control over the goods sold.
• The amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
• It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity.
• The costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Revenue is generated from a sale of goods and is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will 
flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty. Revenue is 
reduced for estimated customer returns, discounts, rebates and other similar allowances. Sales incentives comprise:
•  Discounts and rebates – which are sales incentives to customers to encourage them to purchase increased volumes 
and are related to total volumes purchases and sales growth.
• Marketing services – which include merchandising, slotting and listing fees.
• Free stock – which is stock given to customers for nil or nominal payment.
The Group has concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements as it is the primary obligor in these revenue 
arrangements, has pricing latitude and is also exposed to inventory and credit risks.
Finance income
Finance income is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest method. The effective rate is the rate that exactly 
discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to its net carrying amount.
Finance income also includes foreign currency exchange gains on the retranslation of loans and gains arising from changes in 
the fair value of interest rate swap instruments. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

Segmental analysis
The accounting policy for identifying segments is based on internal management reporting information that is regularly 
reviewed by the chief operating decision-maker. 
For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on geographical area, and has five reportable segments:
• Poland
• Czech Republic
• Italy
• Other operational, including the Slovakian, International and Baltic Distillery entities.
• Corporate, including the expenses and central costs incurred by non-trading Group entities.
Management monitors the results of all operating segments separately as each of the geographic areas require different 
marketing approaches. Segment performance is evaluated based on EBITDA, adjusted for exceptional items and non-
recurring expenses. 
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group entity are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which the entity operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the Group financial statements, the results and financial 
position of each entity are reported in Euros (€), which is the presentational currency for the Group financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional 
currency (foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At each end of 
the reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the end of 
the reporting period. 
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates 
as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using 
the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. All resulting differences are taken to the income statement.
For the purpose of presenting Group financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are 
expressed in Euros using exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Income and expense items are translated 
at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as other comprehensive income 
and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.
The closing foreign exchange rates used in the consolidation are as follows:
2015 2014
PLN 4.26 4.29
CZK 27.03 27.74
GBP 0.74 0.78
CHF 1.08 1.20 Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 107
Employee benefits – severance indemnity
The provision for employee severance indemnity, mandatory for Italian companies pursuant to Law No. 297/1982, represents 
an unfunded defined benefit plan, according to IAS 19 (Revised), and is based on the working life of employees and on the 
remuneration earned by an employee over the course of a pre-determined term of service. 
For details of the actuarial assumptions used, see note 25. For the severance indemnity, the cost of providing benefits is 
determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each reporting period.  
Past service cost is recognised in full in the period of the plan amendment.
The severance indemnity obligation recognised in the statement of financial position represents the present value of the 
obligation as adjusted for unrecognised actuarial gains and losses and unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the 
fair value of plan assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to unrecognised actuarial losses and past service 
cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Contributions for severance indemnity are recognised as an expense in the income statement when employees have rendered 
service entitling them to the contributions.
Income taxes
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the financial statements with the following exceptions: 
• Where the temporary differences arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction 
that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable 
profit or loss.
• In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint 
ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the 
temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is probable that there will be 
taxable profits from which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rate that is expected to apply when 
the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date. Deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities are offset, only if a legally enforcement right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, the 
deferred income taxes relate to the same taxation authority and that authority permits the Group to make a single net payment. 
Income tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to other 
comprehensive income. Similarly, income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or 
charged directly to equity. Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

Property, plant and equipment
Buildings held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are stated in the 
statement of financial position at their cost less depreciation. Land is not depreciated.
Properties in the course of construction for production, rental or administrative purposes, or for purposes not yet determined, 
are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property 
assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use. Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets, other than land and properties under construction, 
over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation 
method are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where 
shorter, the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the 
difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
The following useful lives are used in the calculation of depreciation:
Land No depreciation
Buildings 20–50 years
Technical equipment 7–20 years
Other equipment 3– 10 years
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately
Intangible assets including brands, agency contracts, customer lists and patents acquired separately are reported at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets with a definite life are amortised on a straight-
line basis over their estimated useful lives of between two and 15 years. A useful life of 15 years has been applied to 
trademarks, with consideration to the age, history and profile of such trademarks. The estimated useful life and amortisation 
method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a 
prospective basis. Amortisation expense related to software is included within other operating expenses in the consolidated 
income statement. Amortisation expense related to customer relationships and trademark is included in selling expenses.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are identified and recognised separately from goodwill where they satisfy 
the definition of an intangible asset and their fair values can be measured reliably. The cost of such intangible assets is their fair 
value at the acquisition date. Fair value of identifiable brands acquired and recognised as part of a business combination are 
determined using the royalty or multi-period excess methods. All of the Group’s brands have indefinite useful lives, are not 
amortised but are subject to an annual impairment test or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
In arriving at the conclusion that a brand has an indefinite life, management considers their future usage, commercial position, 
stability of industry and all other aspects that might have an impact on this accounting policy. Management considers the 
business to be a brand business and expects to acquire, hold and support brands for an indefinite period. Subsidiary company 
history goes back to 1884 in Italy, 1920 in the Czech Republic and for over 100 years in Poland. Brands have a long tradition 
and companies have built customer loyalty over their history. 
A core element of the Group’s strategy is to invest in building its brands through an ongoing programme of spending on 
consumer marketing and through significant investment in promotional support. This policy is appropriate due to the stable 
long-term nature of the business and the enduring nature of the brands. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, other intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets acquired separately.  Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 109
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount 
of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the 
recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which 
the asset belongs. Where a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated 
to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a 
reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually, 
and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately 
in the income statement.
Goodwill
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment 
testing, goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the 
combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the Group are assigned to those units. Goodwill is reviewed for 
impairment annually or more frequently if there is an indication of impairment. Impairment of goodwill is determined by assessing 
the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit is less than the carrying value of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated, an impairment loss 
is recognised. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs, including an appropriate portion of fixed and variable 
overhead expenses, are assigned to inventories held by the method most appropriate to the particular class of inventory, with 
the majority being valued on a first-in-first-out basis. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price for inventories 
less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised when it is probable that a future economic benefit will flow to the Group. Trade and 
other receivables are carried at original invoice or contract amount less any provisions for discounts and doubtful debts. 
Provisions are made where there is evidence of a risk of non-payment taking into account ageing, previous experience and 
general economic conditions.
Sale of receivables under non-recourse factoring
The Group via Stock Polska Sp. z.o.o. has entered into two non-recourse receivables financing agreements with mFaktoring 
(formerly: BRE Faktoring), a part of Commerzbank, and Coface, supported by Natixis Bank. It may sell up to €16,901,000 (PLN 
72,000,000) and €32,864,000 (PLN 140,000,000) with each party respectively (at any one time) at face value less certain 
reserves and fees. Trade receivables sold under non-recourse factoring arrangements, are included net of the value of invoices 
which have been factored. Pursuant to the HSBC Credit Facility, the total amount of receivables subject to a factoring facility 
may not in aggregate exceed €50,000,000.
Assets classified as held for sale
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale only if available for immediate sale in their present 
condition; a sale is highly probable and expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification. Such assets 
are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and are not depreciated or amortised.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and in hand and short-term deposits 
with an original maturity of three months or less. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
at 31 December 2015

Financial statements
3. Accounting policies continued
Financial assets
Financial assets in the statement of financial position are loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are non-derivative 
financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current 
assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. These are classified as 
non-current assets.
Loans and receivables are initially measured at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, they 
are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are 
recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. Provision is 
made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full. Balances are written off when 
the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote. 
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention 
in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e. the date that the Group commits to purchase or 
sell the asset.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at 
the statement of financial position, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a 
provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present 
value of those cash flows.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the 
receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the 
receivable can be measured reliably.
The timing of cash outflows are by their nature uncertain and are therefore best estimates. Provisions are not discounted as 
the time value of money is not deemed to be material.
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are disclosed and described separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide a 
better understanding of the financial performance of the Group. They are material items of expense or income that have been 
shown separately due to the significance of their nature or amount. Exceptional items include significant costs of restructuring 
and reorganisation of the business, refinancing costs and other income and costs that are considered to be non-recurring.
Financial liabilities
Borrowings and other financial liabilities
Borrowings and other financial liabilities, including loans, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. 
Borrowings and other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. 
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest 
expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments 
through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period. 
Derivative financial instruments
The Group may enter into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate 
risk, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps. Further details of derivative 
financial instruments are disclosed in note 30 to the financial statements. Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 111
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at the reporting period date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately. 
The fair value of derivatives is classified as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the 
relationship is more than 12 months and as a current asset or a current liability if the remaining maturity of the relationship is 
less than 12 months. 
The entity does not apply hedge accounting.
Fair value measurement
The Group measures financial instruments, such as, derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair value is the price 
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at 
the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or 
transfer the liability takes place either:
• in the principal market for the asset or liability; and
• in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Group.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing  
the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic 
benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset  
in its highest and best use.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available  
to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. 
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the 
fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
as a whole:
• Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly 
or indirectly observable.
• Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether 
transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
Leases and hire purchase commitments
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Finance leases are capitalised on commencement of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of 
the minimum lease payments. Each payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant 
rate of interest on the finance balance outstanding. The rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in interest 
bearing loans and borrowings.
The finance charges are charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of 
interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.
Payments under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
at 31 December 2015

Share-based payments
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised together with a corresponding increase in other reserves in equity, over 
the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled. The cumulative expense recognised for equity-
settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired 
and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit for the 
period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of the period and is recognised 
in general and administrative expenses.
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as  
if the terms had not been modified, if the original terms of the award are met. An additional expense is recognised for any 
modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the 
employee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet 
recognised for the award is recognised immediately. This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control 
of either the entity or the employee are not met. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and 
designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cost based on the original award terms continues to be 
recognised over the original vesting period and an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for  
the incremental fair value of any modification.
Prior to 2014 the financial effect of awards by the parent company of options over its equity shares to employees of subsidiary 
undertakings was recognised by the parent company in its individual financial statements as an increase in its investment in 
subsidiaries with a credit to equity equivalent to the IFRS 2 cost in subsidiary undertaking. The subsidiary, in turn, recognised the 
IFRS 2 cost in its income statement with a credit to equity to reflect the deemed capital contribution from the parent company.
From 2014 the financial effect of awards by the parent company of options over its equity shares to employees of subsidiary 
undertakings is recognised by the parent company in its individual financial statements as a credit to the share-based payments 
reserve equivalent to the IFRS 2 cost and a corresponding intercompany receivable balance, as the cost will ultimately be 
recharged to the subsidiary on vesting of the options. The subsidiary in turn will recognise the IFRS 2 cost in its income 
statement with a credit to intercompany payables.
Cash-settled transactions
The cost of cash-settled transactions relating to share options issued at the IPO was measured initially at fair value at the grant 
date using a binomial model. The cost of cash-settled transactions relating to the Performance Share Plan was measured 
initially at fair value at the grant date using a Monte-Carlo model. See further details given in note 34.
This fair value is expensed over the period until the vesting date with recognition of a corresponding liability. The liability is 
re-measured to fair value at each reporting date up to, and including the settlement date, with changes in fair value recognised 
in employee benefits expense.
Repurchase and reissue of ordinary shares (own shares)
When shares recognised in equity are repurchases, the amount of the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable 
costs are recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares are classified as own shares and are presented in the own 
share reserve. When own shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity 
and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented within retained earnings.
Cash dividends to equity holders of the parent 
The Company recognises a liability to make cash distributions to equity holders when the distribution is authorised and the 
distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company. As per the corporate laws in the United Kingdom, an interim 
distribution is authorised by the Board, whilst a final distribution is authorised when it is approved by the shareholders.  Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 113
4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, management is required to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent  
from other sources. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material 
adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.
Other disclosures relating to the Group’s exposure to risks and uncertainties includes:
Financial risk management  note 30
Sensitivity analyses disclosures notes 17, 30
Judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which have the 
most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements:
Taxation
Management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based on the likely 
timing and level of future taxable profits together with an assessment of the effect of future tax planning strategies. 
Where Group entities are loss making, and are expected to continue to be loss making into the future it is judged that deferred 
tax assets should not be recognised in respect of these losses as it is not known when the losses will be able to be utilised in 
these entities. 
Fair value measurement of financial instruments
When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the statement of financial position cannot be 
measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the 
discounted cash flow (DCF) model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where 
this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs 
such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value 
of financial instruments. See note 30 for further disclosures.
Estimates and assumptions 
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year 
are described below. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the consolidated financial 
statements were prepared. However estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to 
accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or  
in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Measurement and impairment of indefinite life intangible assets
A key source of estimation uncertainty that has a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities within the next financial year is the measurement and impairment of indefinite life intangible assets. The 
measurement of intangible assets other than goodwill on a business combination involves estimation of future cash flows and 
the selection of a suitable discount rate. The Group determines whether indefinite life intangible assets are impaired on an 
annual basis and this requires an estimation of their value in use. This involves estimation of future cash flows and choosing a 
suitable discount rate (note 17). Brands are considered to have an indefinite life. Management considers the business to be a 
brand business and expects to acquire, hold and support brands for an indefinite period.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group’s impairment test for goodwill is based on a value in use calculation using a discounted cash flow model. The cash 
flows are derived from the Group’s three-year plans. The recoverable amount is most sensitive to the discount rate used for the 
discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. 
The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different cash generating units, including a sensitivity 
analysis, are further explained in note 17. The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
Estimates and assumptions continued
Taxation
The Group provides for anticipated risks, based on reasonable estimates, for tax risks in the respective countries in which it 
operates. The amount of such provisions are based on various factors, such as experience with previous tax audits and differing 
interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible authority.
Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws, and the amount and 
timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and 
complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made,  
or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded.
The Italian tax authorities have an open enquiry in the Italian subsidiary, Stock S.r.l., covering the years 2006, 2007,  
2008, 2009 and 2010. Adequate provisions are included within the Group accounts to cover any expected estimated  
future settlement. 
The Group’s Czech subsidiary, Stock Plzen Božkov s.r.o. received a tax assessment relating to 2011 from the Czech tax 
authorities in February 2016. The Group has made no specific provision against this assessment (see note 13).
Transfer pricing
The Group is an international drinks business and, as such, transfer pricing arrangements are in place to cover the fair 
recharging of management costs, as well as the sale of finished goods between Group companies. 
Employee severance indemnity provision
The determination of the obligation relating to the employee severance indemnity provision in Italy is based on assumptions 
determined with independent actuarial advice. The assumptions include discount rate, inflation, expected return on scheme 
assets, mortality and other demographic assumptions. The key assumptions are included in note 25.
Share-based payments 
The Group initially measured the cost of cash-settled transactions on share options issued at the IPO using a binomial model  
to determine the fair value of the liability incurred. The cost of cash-settled transactions on share options issued under the 
Performance Share Plan has been initially measured using the Monte-Carlo model. Estimating fair value for share-based 
payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms  
and conditions of the grant. This estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model 
including the expected life of the share option, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them. For cash-
settled share-based payment transactions, the liability needs to be remeasured at the end of each reporting period up to the 
date of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognised in the profit or loss. This requires a reassessment of the estimates 
used at the end of each reporting period. The assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment 
transactions are disclosed in note 34. 
Sales related discounts
For sales related discounts that must be earned, management make accruals related to customer performance, sales volume 
and agreed terms, and record deductions from revenue.
Provisions for bad debts and inventory obsolescence
Provisions are made with reference to the ageing of receivable and inventory balances and the view of management as to 
whether amounts are recoverable. Bad debt provisions will be determined with consideration to recent customer trading and 
management experience, and provision for inventory obsolescence to latest sales forecasts.

6. Segmental analysis
In identifying its operating segments, management follows the Group’s geographic split, representing the main products 
traded by the Group. The Group is considered to have five reportable operating segments: Poland, Czech Republic, Italy,  
Other Operational and Corporate. The Other Operational segment consists of the results of operations of the Slovakian, 
International and Baltic Distillery entities. The Corporate segment consists of expenses and central costs incurred by non-
trading Group entities.
Each of these operating segments is managed separately as each of these geographic areas requires different marketing 
approaches. All inter-segment transfers are carried out at arm’s length prices. The measure of revenue reported to the  
chief operating decision-maker to assess performance is based on external revenue for each operating segment and 
excludes intra-Group revenues. The measure of adjusted EBITDA reported to the chief operating decision-maker to assess 
performance is based on operating profit and excludes intra-Group profits, depreciation, amortisation, exceptional items  
and non-recurring expenses.

Transfer pricing
The Group is an international drinks business and, as such, transfer pricing arrangements are in place to cover the fair 
recharging of management and stewardship costs, as well as the sale of finished goods between Group companies. 
Tax inspection
The Group has undertaken a review of potential tax risks and current tax assessments, and whilst it is not possible to predict 
the outcome of any pending enquiries, adequate provisions are considered to have been included in the Group accounts to 
cover any expected estimated future settlements.
In 2015 the level of provisions have been increased by €2.7m, in respect to open tax audits and investigations. The most 
significant relates to tax risks in respect of our Italian business, Stock S.r.l. The Italian tax authorities have an open enquiry 
covering the years 2006 - 2010. The process is expected to take further time to complete.
The Group’s Czech subsidiary, Stock Plzen Božkov s.r.o. received a tax assessment relating to 2011 from the Czech tax 
authorities in February 2016. Management will be vigorously defending the Company’s position, and have therefore not  
made a provision against the assessment, which totals €1,050,000.
(ii) Unrecognised tax losses
The Group has tax losses which arose in the UK of €23,830,000 as at 31 December 2015 (2014: €21,444,000) that are 
available indefinitely for offset against future taxable profits of the companies in which the losses arose. A deferred tax asset 
has not been recognised in respect of these losses as it is not known when the losses will be utilised in the relevant entities.

Corporate restructuring
Post IPO the Group completed corporate restructuring transactions which have given rise to a significant deferred tax asset 
which will be amortised over a five-year period.
(iv) Change in tax rates
Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 23% to 21% (effective from 1 April 2014) and 20% (effective from 1 April 2015) 
were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. Further reductions to 19% (effective from 1 April 2017) and to 18% (effective 
1 April 2020) were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015. The deferred tax asset/liability at 31 December 2015 has been 
calculated based on rates current at that date. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

14. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of 
the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent 
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares that would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
Details of the earnings per share are set out below:

finance costs in 2015 (2014: foreign exchange gain in finance income of €6,533,000), adjusted basic earnings per share would 
have been €0.11 per share in 2015 (2014: €0.15 per share), and adjusted diluted earnings per share would have been €0.11 per 
share in 2015 (2014: €0.14 per share).

Brands are not amortised, as it is considered that their useful economic lives are not limited. An annual impairment assessment 
is performed to ensure carrying values are recoverable. Customer relationships are amortised over 12 years, with 9 years 
remaining. Trademarks are amortised over 15 years, with 12 years remaining. Software is amortised over 2–5 years.
The gross carrying value of fully amortised intangible assets that are still in use is €3,237,000 (2014: €2,796,000).
Amortisation relating to software is included within other operating expenses in the consolidated income statement.

17 . Impairment of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives
Goodwill acquired through business combinations and brands have been allocated for impairment testing purposes to three 
cash generating units based on the geographical location of production plants and the ownership of intellectual property. This 
represents the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill and brands are monitored for internal management purposes. 
Cash generating units
The Group has identified the cash generating units, used in the impairment review of intangible assets with indefinite lives, to 
be the Czech region, Italy region and Poland region.

Impairment review
Under IAS 36 the Group is required to complete a full impairment review of intangible assets using a value-in-use (VIU) 
calculation based upon DCF models. During the year ended 31 December 2015 the goodwill and brands in the Czech Region, 
Italy Region and Poland Region were subject to impairment review. 
(i) Czech Region
The recoverable amount of the Czech Region unit has been determined based on a value-in-use calculation using cash flow 
projections from the three-year planning process approved by senior management. The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash 
flow projections is 9.97% (2014: 10.4%) and cash flows beyond the three-year period are extrapolated using a 2.5% (2014: 
2.5%) growth rate. 
The following sensitivity analysis shows the impact on VIU headroom of different pre-tax discount rates and EBITDA delivery 
in the cash flow projections used in the impairment review models.

(ii) Italy Region
The recoverable amount of the Italy Region unit was determined based on a value-in-use calculation using cash flow 
projections from the three-year planning process approved by senior management. The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash 
flow projections is 12.02% (2014: 12.4%) and cash flows beyond the three-year period are extrapolated using a 2.2% (2014: 
2.0%) growth rate.

projections from the three-year planning process approved by senior management. The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash 
flow projections is 9.07% (2014: 10.5%) and cash flows beyond the three-year period are extrapolated using a 2.5% (2014:

Key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations
The calculation of value-in-use for all regions is most sensitive to the following assumptions:
• Spirits price inflation – small annual percentage increases assumed in all markets based on historic data.
• Growth in spirits market – assumed to be static or slightly declining in all markets based on recent historic trends.
• Market share – through company specific actions outlined in detailed internal plans, market share to be grown overall.
• Discount rates – rates reflect the current market assessment of the risks specific to each operation. The discount rate 
was estimated based on an average of guideline companies adjusted for the operational size of the Group and specific 
regional factors.
• Raw material cost – assumed to be at average industry cost.
• Excise duty – no future duty changes have been used in projections.
• Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the forecast period. The assumed growth rate reflects management 
expectation and takes into consideration growth achieved to date, current strategy and expected spirits market growth.
The value-in-use headroom for each cash generating unit where these sensitivities would be applicable has been detailed above.  Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

Sale of receivables under non-recourse factoring
The Group via Stock Polska Sp. z.o.o. has entered into two non-recourse receivables financing agreements with mFaktoring 
(formerly: BRE Faktoring), a part of Commerzbank, and Coface, supported by Natixis Bank. It may sell up to €16,901,000 (PLN 
72,000,000) and €32,864,000 (PLN 140,000,000) with each party respectively (at any one time) at face value less certain 
reserves and fees. As at 31 December 2015 mFaktoring charge interest on the drawn amounts of WIBOR 1M + 1.1% and a fee 
per invoice of 0.11%. Coface charge interest on the drawn amounts of WIBOR 1M + 1.05% and a fee per invoice of 0.19%. The 
proceeds from the sale can be applied for the general corporate and working capital purposes of the Group. Pursuant to the 
HSBC Credit Facility, the total amount of receivables subject to a factoring facility may not in aggregate exceed €50,000,000. 
At 31 December 2015 the factoring facility was not utilised (2014: €nil).

Customs deposits 141 4,511 – 4,404
Customs deposits are lodged with local Customs and Excise authorities and are therefore assets belonging to the Group. The 
deposits are to provide comfort to local Customs and Excise authorities that liabilities will be settled. These are cash deposits 
and are recognised as a receivable that does not meet the definition of cash and cash equivalents.
22. Assets classified as held for sale
During 2014 the small manufacturing facility in Slovakia, acquired as part of the acquisition of Imperator s.r.o. in 2012, was 
closed. Production of Imperator brands was fully transferred to the Group’s manufacturing facilities in the Czech Republic.
Following this closure the site was made available for sale, and was written down to the expected realisable value of €120,000. 
Additionally an impairment of €547,000 was recognised within other operating expenses. This impairment of fixed assets was 
considered to be a non-recurring expense within note 7.
In March 2015 this manufacturing facility in Slovakia was sold for €120,000, which was in line with the expected realisable 
value included at 31 December 2014. Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 129

1.  On 18 November 2015 the Group signed a new facilities agreement for a €200,000,000 revolving credit facility (RCF) with a banking club consisting of five 
banks including HSBC who also act as the Agent. The new facility is fully flexible and allows the Group to benefit from being able to increase or reduce 
borrowings as required, and utilise balance sheet cash more effectively. Margins have also been reduced which will serve to decrease finance costs going 
forwards. Each of the drawings under the new RCF have been drawn down in the local currencies. The first drawings under the new facility were made on 24 
November 2015, following the full repayment of the existing ING term loans. The loans bear variable rates of interest which are linked to the inter-bank offer 
rates of the country of drawing, WIBOR, PRIBOR or EURIBOR as appropriate. Please refer to the table below for the balances drawn down. Each of the loans 
have a variable margin element to the interest charge. The margin is linked to a ratchet mechanism, subject to a minimum margin, as the Group’s leverage 
covenant decreases.
  As at 31 December 2015 €5,601,000 (2014: €6,463,000) of the RCF was utilised for customs guarantees in Italy and Germany. These custom guarantees 
reduce the available RCF but do not constitute a balance sheet liability.
2.  On 24 November 2015, all three Term Loan balances were repaid in full, and drawings under the new RCF as described above were made. 
  At 31 December 2014 the Group had three Terms loans: Term Loan A (TLA), Term Loan B (TLB) and Term Loan C (TLC), split into eight variable rate loans, and 
a Revolving Credit Facility (RCF), with a banking club consisting of eight banks including ING who also acted as the Agent. On 17 July 2014 the Group signed 
an Amended and Restated Agreement (ARA) with the banking club. The ARA reduced the margins across all loans by 1.50 percent per annum, and removed 
security over Intellectual Property and receivables from the clauses. Each of the term loans were drawn down in multiple tranches in the local currencies of 
the drawers. The loans bore variable rates of interest which were linked to the inter-bank offer rates of the drawers, WIBOR, PRIBOR or EURIBOR as 
appropriate. Please refer to the table below for the balances drawn down for the various tranches. Each of the loans had a variable margin element to the 
interest charge. The margin was linked to a ratchet mechanism where the margin decreased as the Group’s leverage covenant decreased.
  The principal value of TLA was €68,000,000 and was an amortising loan with payments being made over the period to the maturity date of 2019. The principal 
value of TLB was €102,000,000 and was a non-amortising loan, with full payment being made at the maturity date of 2020. TLC was an amortising loan with a 
maturity date of 2020 and had a principal value of €70,000,000. The Group also had an RCF facility which allowed the drawdown of up to €70,000,000 of 
funds to assist with working capital requirements and to provide funding for acquisitions. As at 31 December 2014 €6,463,000 of the RCF was utilised for 
customs guarantees in Italy and Germany. These customs guarantees reduced the available RCF but did not constitute a balance sheet liability. 
3.  Costs of arranging the Group banking facilities are deducted from the original measurement of the loan facilities and amortised into finance costs throughout 
the period using the effective interest method. On repayment of the existing ING Term loans, all remaining unamortised arrangement fees totalling 
€4,328,000 were written off to the income statement, and are included in finance costs in 2015 (see note 9). The arrangement fees under the new facility total 
€300,000, and these will be amortised into finance costs throughout the period of the new facility. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

In 2011 the Group contracted to hedge 67% of interest payments, relating to the Czech Republic and Italian TLA and TLB 
balances with 2 interest rate swaps exchanging variable interest for fixed. At this time the Group also put in place an interest rate 
cap relating to the Polish TLA and TLB balances. These hedging arrangements expired on 30 September 2014 and no new hedging 
arrangements were put in place. Refer to note 30 for more details. The interest payments relating to TLC were unhedged. 
No security is provided to the lenders under the new RCF facility as at 31 December 2015.

assets in each of Stock S.r.l., Stock Plzen Božkov s.r.o., Stock Polska Sp. z.o.o., Baltic Distillery GmbH and Imperator s.r.o.
The Transaction Security given in favour of the banking club as at 31 December 2014 consisted primarily of pledges,

(i)  The provision for employee benefits represents expenses recognised in relation to a long-term incentive plan (LTIP) 
operated by the Group. The long-term incentive plan which existed prior to admission was amended so that 50%–70% of 
accrued awards crystallised upon admission, being paid out in cash. All remaining awards became exercisable in October 
2014. At the company’s discretion these options can be satisfied in cash and consequently these have been accounted for 
as long-term employee benefits under IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments.  Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

25. Provisions continued
(ii) Employee severance indemnity:
  The Group operates an employee severance indemnity, mandatory for Italian companies, for qualifying employees of its 
Italian subsidiary. Under IAS 19 (Revised), this represents an unfunded defined benefit plan and is based on the working 
life of employees and on the remuneration earned by an employee over the course of a pre-determined term of service.
  The most recent actuarial valuations of the present value of the severance indemnity obligation were carried out at 
31 December 2015 by an actuary. 
  The present value of the severance indemnity obligation, and the related current service cost and past service cost, were 
measured using the projected unit credit method. The principal assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial 
valuations were as follows: discount rate 2.58% p.a. (2014: 2.69% p.a.), inflation rate 2.00% p.a. (2014: 2.00% p.a.), 
revaluation rate 75% of inflation rate + 1.5 points = 1.38% p.a. (2014: 1.31% p.a.).

(iii)  Other provisions relate primarily to retirement benefits, sales agent indemnity fees and other various miscellaneous 
provisions. Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation exists at the year end date and where a 
reliable estimate can be made of the likely outcome. While these provisions are reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted 
for management’s best current estimates, the judgemental nature of these items means that future amounts settled may 
differ from those provided.
(iv)  Legal and contract related provisions relate to exposures for potential contractual penalties arising in the normal course of 
business. Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation exists at the year end date and where a 
reliable estimate can be made of the likely outcome. While these provisions are reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted 
for management’s best current estimates, the judgemental nature of these items means that future amounts settled may

Merger reserve
On 21 October 2013 129,064,871 shares were issued in exchange for the entire capital of OCM Luxembourg Spirits Holdings 
S.à.r.l. The net book value of OCM Luxembourg Spirits Holdings S.à.r.l. at the time of exchange was €114,279,000, which 
resulted in €99,033,000 being credited to the merger reserve in line with merger relief provided by Section 612 of the 
Company Act 2006. 
Consolidation reserve
As the Group was formed through a reorganisation in which Stock Spirits Group PLC became a new parent entity of the  
Group, the 2013 consolidated financial statements were prepared as a continuation of the existing Group using the pooling  
of interests method (or merger accounting). Merger accounting principles for this combination gave rise to a consolidation 
reserve of €5,130,000.
Other reserves
Other reserves includes the credit to equity for equity-settled share-based payments. Please see note 34 for full details. The 
charge for the period ending 31 December 2015 was €1,094,000 (2014: €653,000).
Own shares reserve
The own share reserve comprises the cost of the Company’s shares held by the Group. The Employment Benefit Trust (EBT) 
holds these shares on behalf of the employees until the options are exercised. At 31 December 2015 the Group held 5,906,255 
of the Company’s shares (2014: 6,305,792). 
The EBT holds the shares at cost. The shares held prior to 2015 were acquired for the exercise of Jointly Owned Equity (JOE) 
Share Subscription Agreements, as well as Top-Up Option and Substitute Option Agreements. Ownership of the JOE Share 
Subscription Agreements was shared between the EBT and the Executive Directors, and therefore the cost to the EBT was 
minimal. Top-Up Option and Substitute Option Agreements were allocated to the EBT on IPO for nil payment. Consequently 
no own shares reserve has been presented prior to 2015. In 2015 shares were acquired at market value for LTIP options, which 
became exercisable in October 2014. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

Cash dividends on ordinary shares declared and paid:

Proposed dividends on ordinary shares:  
Final cash dividend for 2015: 4.55 cents per share (2014: 2.50 cents per share)  9,100 4,990
Dividend payment included in the consolidated cash flow statement of €7,513,000 reflects the movement in exchange rates 
from the date of declaration to the date of payment.
Proposed dividend on ordinary shares is subject to approval at the annual general meeting and are not recognised as a liability 
as at 31 December 2015.
The Board has recently become aware of a technical issue with regard to the payment of the interim dividend to shareholders 
in September 2015. The Companies Act 2006 requires that a company must have distributable reserves equal to or greater 
than the amount of any dividend. Whilst the Company held more than enough cash to fund the amount of the interim dividend, 
a portion of the reserves, believed to be distributable at the time the dividend was paid, were technically undistributable and as 
a consequence, the Company had insufficient distributable reserves. The Company is in the process of ensuring that there are 
sufficient distributable reserves at the Company level to cover the payment of that interim dividend and provide sufficient 
headroom for future distributions, including the 2015 final dividend. The Company will ask shareholders to release the current 
and former shareholders and Directors from any claim by the Company for repayment of the interim dividend or any other 
claims in relation to it at the AGM to be held on 17 May 2016.
30. Risk management 
The Group is exposed to a variety of risks such as market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s principal financial 
liabilities are loans and borrowings. The Group also has trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, indirect tax 
payables and cash and cash equivalents that arise directly from operations. This note provides further detail on financial risk 
management and includes quantitative information on the specific risks.
The Group’s senior management oversees the management of these risks, and agrees the policies for managing each of these 
risks. These are summarised below.
Derivative financial instruments
In 2011 the Group entered into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. These  
instruments expired on 30 September 2014. There were no new derivative financial instruments entered into the years  
ended 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014. Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 135
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in 
market prices. The Group’s exposure is primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and 
interest rates. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings.
All interest rate hedges previously held by the Group expired on 30 September 2014. No new derivative arrangements were 
entered into subsequent to this date in 2014 or in the year ending 31 December 2015. All Group borrowings are subject to the 
variable rates based on WIBOR, PRIBOR and EURIBOR, as stated per the HSBC loan facility agreement.
The Group has not entered into any derivatives to hedge foreign currency risk in relation to the HSBC facility. Each facility and 
the resulting cash outflows are denominated in local currency. The cash flows are therefore economically hedged within each 
market. Management have considered the foreign currency risk exposure and consider the risk to be adequately mitigated.
Sensitivity analysis 
The Company recognises that movements in certain risk variables (such as interest rates or foreign exchange rates) might 
affect the amounts recorded in its equity and its profit and loss for the period. Therefore the Company has assessed:
• what would be reasonably possible changes in the risk variables at the end of the reporting period; and
• the effects on profit or loss and equity if such changes in the risk variables were to occur. 
Interest rate risk
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on the Group’s floating rate 
loans and borrowings at which at the end of 31 December 2015 are not hedged. With all other variables being constant the 
Group’s profit before tax is affected through the impact on floating rate borrowings as follows.

The Group cash balances are held in current bank accounts and earn immaterial levels of interest. Management have 
concluded that any changes in the EURIBOR rates will have an immaterial impact on interest income earned on the  
Group cash balances. No interest rate sensitivity has been included in relation to the Group’s cash balances. Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

Foreign currency risk
The following table considers the impact on profit before tax arising from the conversion of non-domestic currency trade 
debtor, trade creditor and cash balances in our Polish, Czech and UK Group entities should there be a change in the spot €/
CZK, €/PLN and €/GBP exchange rates of +/-5%. These currencies are considered to be the most significant non-domestic 
denominations of the Group.

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, 
leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily for trade receivables) and 
from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other 
financial instruments.
Trade receivables
Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Group’s established policy, procedures and control 
relating to customer credit risk management. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored and credit insurance 
is used where applicable. The credit quality of trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired is assessed by reference 
to external credit ratings where available, otherwise historical information relating to counterparty default rates is used. The 
Group continually assesses the recoverability of trade receivables and the level of provisioning required. Refer to note 20 for 
details of the age of accounts receivable which are past due.
The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by an allowance account and the amount of loss is recognised within 
the consolidated income statement. When a receivable balance is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the 
allowance for doubtful accounts. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the consolidated 
income statement. Refer to note 20 for details the movement in allowance for doubtful debts. Management does not believe 
that the Group is subject to any significant credit risk in view of the Group’s large and diversified client base which is located in 
several jurisdictions. Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 137
Other receivables and financial assets
Other receivables and financial assets consist largely of VAT and excise duty receivables and customs deposits. As the 
counterparties are revenue and customs authorities in the various jurisdictions in which the Group operates, credit risk is 
considered to be minimal and therefore no further analysis has been performed. 
Financial instruments and cash deposits
Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed in accordance with the Group’s policy. The Group 
deposits cash with reputable financial institutions, from which management believes loss to be remote. The Group’s maximum 
exposure to credit risk for the components of the statement of financial position at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 
is the carrying amounts as illustrated in notes 23 and 32. The Group’s maximum exposure for financial guarantees are noted in 
either note 24 or in the liquidity table below, respectively.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group manages 
liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual 
cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s undiscounted financial liabilities at 31 December 2015  
and 2014.

30. Risk management continued
Capital risk management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it has the capital required to operate and grow 
the business at a reasonable cost of capital without incurring undue financial risks. The Board periodically reviews its capital 
structure to ensure it meets changing business needs. 
In addition, the Directors consider the management of debt to be an important element in controlling the capital structure 
of the Group. The Group may carry significant levels of long-term structural and subordinated debt to fund investments and 
acquisitions and has arranged debt facilities to allow for fluctuations in working capital requirements. There have been no 
changes to the capital requirements in the current period. 
Management manage capital on an ongoing basis to ensure that covenants requirements on the third party debt are met.
The Group regards its total capital as follows.

Total net debt (57,187) (82,430)
Fair value
Management assessed that the fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables and other current 
liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. As per the table 
below the carrying amounts of the Group’s financial instruments are considered to be a reasonable approximation of their  
fair values.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities 
Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts which approximates fair values of all of the Group’s financial

34. Share-based compensation
Jointly owned equity scheme
The Company and former shareholder (Oaktree) previously entered into a number of Jointly Owned Equity (JOE) Share 
Subscription Agreements with key members of Group management employees. 
Prior to IPO management employees were invited to subscribe for an interest in the growth in value of Class F ordinary shares 
(F shares) in OCM Luxembourg Spirits Holdings S.à.r.l. jointly with Elian Employee Benefit Trustee Limited acting in its capacity 
as trustee of the Stock Spirits Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). The EBT holds the JOE scheme shares and the vested options on 
behalf of the employees.
At IPO the 200 F Shares issued under the JOE scheme were converted into ordinary £0.10 shares of Stock Spirits Group PLC 
(PLC) the new ultimate parent company of the Group at the rate of 1 F share to 17,886 PLC ordinary shares. The conversion 
was accounted for as a replacement under IFRS 2. 
Other equity-settled share-based compensation
Prior to IPO members of the key management team were issued with a total of 207 A-class and A1-class share options over 
shares of OCM Luxembourg Spirits Holdings S.à r.l. Of the A-class and A1-class share options issued 36 options had a 2 year 
vesting period to May 2015. These have been recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
At IPO the A and A1 share options were converted into options over ordinary £0.10 shares in Stock Spirits Group PLC. The 
exercise price of the replacement award was €nil. The 207 A and A1 options were converted into 1,469,365 ordinary £0.10 
PLC share options. The conversion was accounted for as a replacement under IFRS 2. All but 244,792 of the new options 
vested immediately. As above, these remaining options vested in May 2015 and the fair value has been recognised on a 
straight-line basis.
In 2012 one member of key management purchased 28 E-class shares in OCM Luxembourg Spirits Holdings S.à.r.l. At IPO the  
E shares were converted into £0.10 ordinary shares in Stock Spirits Group PLC at the rate of 1 E share to 12,033 ordinary PLC 
shares. The conversion was accounted for as a replacement under IFRS 2. 
Share options issued at IPO
Post IPO awards were valued by reference to the share price at admission to the London Stock Exchange.
The Group EBT holds the shares for all vested share options. At IPO several members of key management were issued a total 
of 1,538,124 £0.10 ordinary share options in Stock Spirits Group PLC. The options vested immediately upon grant.
Included within the terms of the grant the Group has discretion over whether the employees receive their options gross or  
net of a deduction to allow the Group to settle any personal income tax liabilities on behalf of the recipient. Under IFRS 2 this 
results in an element of the award being treated as a cash-settled share-based compensation. The cost of cash-settled 
transactions was originally measured at fair value at the grant date using a binomial model. The cash-settled share-based 
compensation has then been calculated using the applicable income tax rate for each country of the recipients applied to a 
potential gain based upon the market value of the shares of £1.40 as at 31 December 2015 (2014: £2.20). The cash-settled 
share-based compensation is €930,000 (2014: €1,542,000). This is accounted for as a liability on the Group balance sheet.

Performance share plan:
Participation in the PSP is restricted to the Senior Management Team. Awards made under the PSP normally vest provided the 
participant remains in the Group’s employment during the performance period and financial targets based on total shareholder 
return (TSR), versus comparator companies, and earnings per share (EPS) are met at the end of the performance period (2014: 
TSR conditions only). The performance period is the period of 3 financial years beginning with the financial year in which the 
award is granted. The vesting period for grants made under this scheme is 3 years with an exercise period of 7 years. The 
exercise price of PSP options is €nil.
Further information on the PSP is set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 71 to 84.
Awards were granted over 1,481,893 shares in the year (2014: 1,290,480 shares). The compensation expense recognised in 
relation to these awards is based on the fair value of the awards at grant date. The fair value of nil-cost options subject to the 
TSR condition is determined using a Monte-Carlo option pricing model. The fair value of options subject to the EPS condition is 
calculated using the share price at the date of grant, adjusted for dividends not received during the vesting period.
The principal assumptions made in measuring the fair value of PSP awards were as follows:
 2015 2014
Principal assumptions
Fair value at grant date 41.0 pence 192.5 pence
Share price on grant date 196.5 pence 292.3 pence
Expected life of the awards 3 years 3 years
Risk free rate interest rate 0.74% 1.12%
Dividend yield on the Company’s shares 1.52% 1.06%
Volatility of the Company’s shares 23.9% 21.6%
TSR correlation (SSG PLC vs comparators) 20.7% 25.0%
Due to the limited historic data available for SSG PLC expected volatility was based on the historic volatilities of the companies 
in the TSR comparator group.
The movements in the awards outstanding during the year were as follows:

Included within the terms of the grant the Group has discretion over whether the employees receive their options gross or net of  
a deduction to allow the Group to settle any personal income tax liabilities on behalf of the recipient. Under IFRS 2 this results in 
an element of the award being treated as a cash-settled share-based compensation. The cost of cash-settled transactions was 
originally measured at fair value at the grant date using the Monte-Carlo model. The cash-settled share-based compensation has 
then been calculated using the applicable income tax rate for each country of the recipients applied to a potential gain based upon 
the market value of the shares of £1.40 (2014: £2.20) as at 31 December 2015. The cash-settled share-based compensation is 
€354,000 (2014: €127,000). This has been accounted for as a liability on the Group balance sheet.

No deferred shares were granted under the Group Annual Deferred Annual Bonus Plan during the year.

1. General information
These separate financial statements were approved and authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of Stock Spirits  
Group PLC (the Company) on 10 March 2016.
The Company’s registered office is at Solar House, Mercury Park, Wooburn Green, Buckinghamshire, HP10 0HH,  
United Kingdom.
2. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006 (the Act).  
As permitted by the Act, the separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union.
International Financial Reporting Standards are issued by the International Accounting Standard Board (IASB). 
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors believe there are no material 
uncertainties that lead to significant doubt that the entity can continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months 
from the date of approval of the financial statements.
The financial statements are presented in Sterling (£), rounded to the nearest thousand (£000) unless otherwise stated.  
They have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
These financial statements have been prepared for the year ended 31 December 2015.
Exemptions
The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and not 
presented an income statement or a statement of comprehensive income for the Company alone. The loss for the year  
has been disclosed in the statement of changes in equity. 
New/Revised standards and interpretations adopted in 2015
The following amendments to existing standards and interpretations were effective for the year, but either they were not 
applicable to or did not have a material impact on the Company:

The Directors do not expect the adoption of these standards and interpretations to have a material impact on the consolidated 
or company financial statements in the period of initial application. The Directors have completed an initial assessment of the 
potential impact of IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 and don’t believe they will have a material impact on the results of the Company. The 
Directors have not yet completed an assessment of the potential impact of IFRS 16. The Company will continue to monitor any 
potential impact as the new standards become more imminent.
*  The effective dates stated above are those given in the original IASB/IFRIC standards and interpretations. As the Company prepares its financial statements  
in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union (EU), the application of new standards and interpretations will be subject to their having been 
endorsed for use in the EU via the EU Endorsement mechanism. In the majority of cases this will result in an effective date consistent with that given in the 
original standard or interpretation but the need for endorsement restricts the Company’s discretion to early adopt standards. 
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are valued at cost, less accumulated impairment. 
Share-based compensation
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised together with a corresponding increase in other reserves in equity, over 
the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled. The cumulative expense recognised for equity-
settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired 
and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit for the 
period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of the period and is recognised 
in general and administrative expenses.
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as if the 
terms had not been modified, if the original terms of the award are met. An additional expense is recognised for any 
modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the 
employee as measured at the date of modification. Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 149
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet 
recognised for the award is recognised immediately. This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control 
of either the entity or the employee are not met. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and 
designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cost based on the original award terms continues to be 
recognised over the original vesting period and an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for  
the incremental fair value of any modification.
Prior to 2014 the financial effect of awards by the Company of options over its equity shares to employees of subsidiary 
undertakings was recognised by the parent company in its individual financial statements as an increase in its investment  
in subsidiaries with a credit to equity equivalent to the IFRS 2 cost in subsidiary undertaking. The subsidiary, in turn, 
recognised the IFRS 2 cost in its income statement with a credit to equity to reflect the deemed capital contribution  
from the parent company.
From 2014 the financial effect of awards by the Company of options over its equity shares to employees of subsidiary 
undertakings is recognised by the parent company in its individual financial statements as a credit to the share-based payments 
reserve equivalent to the IFRS 2 cost and a corresponding intercompany receivable balance, as the cost will ultimately be 
recharged to the subsidiary on vesting of the options. The subsidiary in turn will recognise the IFRS 2 cost in its income 
statement with a credit to intercompany payables.
Cash-settled transactions
The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured initially at fair value at the grant date using a binomial model, further details 
of which are given in note 34 to the consolidated financial statements. This fair value is expensed over the period until the 
vesting date with recognition of a corresponding liability. The liability is re-measured to fair value at each reporting date up to, 
and including the settlement date, with changes in fair value recognised in employee benefits expense.
Repurchase and reissue of ordinary shares (own shares)
When shares recognised in equity are repurchases, the amount of consideration paid, which includes directly attributable 
costs is recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares are classified as own shares and are presented in the own 
share reserve. When own shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity 
and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented within retained earnings.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. 
These are classified as non-current assets. The Company’s loans and receivables comprise Other receivables and Cash and 
cash equivalents in the balance sheet.
Other receivables
Other receivables are non-interest bearing and are recognised initially at fair value, and subsequently at amortised cost, 
reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and in hand and short-term deposits 
with an original maturity of three months or less.
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest 
rate method.
Cash dividends to equity holders 
The Company recognises a liability to make cash distributions to equity holders when the distribution is authorised and the 
distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company. As per the corporate laws in the United Kingdom, an interim 
distribution is authorised by the Board, whilst a final distribution is authorised when it is approved by the shareholders. Notes to the Parent Company financial statements continued

Merger reserve
On 21 October 2013 129,064,871 shares were issued in exchange for the entire capital of OCM Luxembourg Spirits Holdings 
S.à.r.l. The net book value of OCM Luxembourg Spirits Holdings S.à.r.l. at the time of exchange was £96,743,000, which 
resulted in £83,837,000 being credited to the merger reserve in line with merger relief provided by Section 612 of the 
Company Act 2006. On 25 October 2013 the Company was admitted to the London Stock Exchange and placed 22,127,660 
ordinary £0.10 shares at a premium of £2.25 pence per share. Also included in share premium are capitalised listing costs, 
which have been incurred directly in connection with the registration and distribution of shares.
Own shares reserve
The own share reserve comprises the cost of the Company’s shares, which are held by the Employment Benefit Trust (EBT) on 
behalf of the employees until the options are exercised. At 31 December 2015 the EBT held 5,906,255 of the Company’s 
shares (2014: 6,305,792).
The EBT holds the shares at cost. The shares held prior to 2015 were acquired for the exercise of Jointly Owned Equity (JOE) 
Share Subscription Agreements, as well as Top-Up Option and Substitute Option Agreements. Ownership of the JOE Share 
Subscription Agreements was shared between the EBT and the Executive Directors, and therefore the total cost to the EBT 
was minimal. Top-Up and Substitute Option Agreements were allocated to the EBT on IPO for nil payment. Consequently no 
own shares reserve has been presented prior to 2015. In 2015 shares were acquired at market value for LTIP options, which 
became exercisable in October 2014.
Share-based compensation reserve
Share-based compensation reserve includes the credit to equity for equity-settled share-based payments. Please see  
note 12 for full details. The equity charge for the year ending 31 December 2015 was £908,000 (2014: £84,000). Notes to the Parent Company financial statements continued

Proposed dividends on ordinary shares:  
Final cash dividend for 2015: 4.55 Euro cents (3.5 Sterling pence) per share  
(2014: 2.50 Euro cents (2 Sterling pence)) 7,000 3,593
The Board has recently become aware of a technical issue with regard to the payment of the interim dividend to shareholders 
in September 2015. The Companies Act 2006 requires that a company must have distributable reserves equal to or greater 
than the amount of any dividend. Whilst the Company held more than enough cash to fund the amount of the interim dividend, 
a portion of the reserves, believed to be distributable at the time the dividend was paid, were technically undistributable and as 
a consequence, the Company had insufficient distributable reserves. The Company is in the process of ensuring that there are 
sufficient distributable reserves at the Company level to cover the payment of that interim dividend and provide sufficient 
headroom for future distributions, including the 2015 final dividend. The Company will ask shareholders to release the current 
and former shareholders and Directors from any claim by the Company for repayment of the interim dividend or any other 
claims in relation to it at the AGM to be held on 17 May 2016.
11. Risk management
The Company’s principal financial liabilities are trade and other payables. The Company’s principal financial assets include 
other debtors, prepayments and cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations. 
The Company is exposed to a variety of risks including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company’s senior 
management oversees the management of these risks, and agrees the policies for managing each of these risks. These are 
summarised below.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument, leading to a financial loss. 
The Company is exposed to credit risk from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions.
Financial instruments and cash deposits
Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed in accordance with the Group’s policy (refer to  
note 30 of the consolidated financial statements). The Company deposits cash with reputable financial institutions, from  
which management believes loss to be remote. The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the 
statement of financial position at 31 December 2015 is the carrying amounts as given in note 6. 
Other receivables and prepayments
Other receivables and prepayments consist largely of amounts receivable from subsidiaries. As there are deemed to be no 
going concern issues with any of the individual group entities loss is considered to be remote, and consequently credit risk is 
minimal and no further analysis has been performed.  Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 153

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company 
manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows  
and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Company’s undiscounted financial liabilities.

Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in 
market prices. The Company’s exposure is primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and 
interest rates. Financial instruments affected by market risk are limited to cash and cash equivalents. Notes to the Parent Company financial statements continued
at 31 December 2015

Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 154
11. Risk management continued
Currency risk
The Company engages in foreign currency transactions to a very limited extent. No financial assets or liabilities are held in 
foreign currencies. Due to the Company’s lack of exposure to currency risk, no sensitivity analysis has been performed.
Interest rate risk
The Company has no interest bearing financial liabilities, and its interest bearing financial assets consist of only cash and  
cash equivalents. As such exposure to interest rate risk is limited and no sensitivity analysis has been performed.
Capital risk management
The Board’s objectives and policies for the Company are consistent with those of the Group. Full details are provided in  
note 30 of the consolidated financial statements.
New RCF financing facility
On 18 November 2015 the Group signed a new facilities agreement for a €200,000,000 revolving credit facility (RCF) with a 
banking club consisting of five banks including HSBC who also act as the Agent. See note 23 of the consolidated financial 
statements for further details.
12. Share-based compensation
Jointly owned equity scheme
The Company and former shareholder (Oaktree) previously entered into a number of Jointly Owned Equity (JOE) Share 
Subscription Agreements with key members of Group management employees. 
Prior to IPO management employees were invited to subscribe for an interest in the growth in value of Class F ordinary shares 
(F shares) in OCM Luxembourg Spirits Holdings S.à.r.l. jointly with Elian Employee Benefit Trustee Limited acting in its capacity 
as trustee of the Stock Spirits Employee Benefit Trust (EBT). The EBT holds the JOE scheme shares and the vested options on 
behalf of the employees.
At IPO the 200 F Shares issued under the JOE scheme were converted into ordinary £0.10 shares of Stock Spirits Group PLC 
(PLC) the new ultimate parent company of the Group at the rate of 1 F share to 17,886 PLC ordinary shares. The conversion 
was accounted for as a replacement under IFRS 2. 
Share options issued at IPO and other equity-settled share-based compensation
Post IPO awards were valued by reference to the share price at admission to the London Stock Exchange.
The Group EBT holds the shares for all vested share options. At IPO several members of key management were issued a total 
of 1,538,124 £0.10 ordinary share options in Stock Spirits Group PLC. The options vested immediately upon grant.
Included within the terms of the grant the Group has discretion over whether the employees receive their options gross or  
net of a deduction to allow the Group to settle any personal income tax liabilities on behalf of the recipient. Under IFRS 2  
this results in an element of the award being treated as a cash-settled share-based compensation. The cost of cash-settled 
transactions was originally measured at fair value at the grant date using a binomial model. The cash-settled share-based 
compensation has then been calculated using the applicable income tax rate for each country of the recipients applied to a 
potential gain based upon the market value of the shares of £1.40 as at 31 December 2015 (2014: £2.20). The cash-settled 
share-based compensation is £688,000 (2014: £1,246,000). This is accounted for as a liability on the Company balance sheet. Stock Spirits Group | Annual Report & Accounts 2015 155

Performance share plan
Prior to the admission of the Group to the London Stock Exchange, a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) was operated. In 2014 
LTIP has been replaced with a Performance Share Plan (PSP), with the first scheme becoming effective from 6 May 2014. A 
second scheme began on 22 April 2015. Participation in the PSP is restricted to the Senior Management Team. Awards made 
under the PSP normally vest provided the participant remains in the Group’s employment during the performance period and 
financial targets based on total shareholder return (TSR), versus comparator companies, and earnings per share (EPS) are met 
at the end of the performance period. The performance period is the period of 3 financial years beginning with the financial 
year in which the award is granted. The vesting period for grants made under this scheme is 3 years with an exercise period of  
7 years. The exercise price of PSP options is €nil.
The performance condition applying to the total number of awards granted to members of the Senior Management Team 
during the current period is divided equally between TSR and EPS conditions (2014: TSR conditions only).
Further information on the PSP is set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 71 to 84.
During the year nil-cost awards were granted across the Group over 1,481,893 shares (2014: 1,290,480 shares). The 
compensation expense recognised in relation to these awards is based on the fair value of the awards at grant date. The fair value 
of nil-cost options subject to the TSR condition is determined using a Monte-Carlo option pricing model. The fair value of all other 
options is calculated using the share price at the date of grant, adjusted for dividends not received during the vesting period. Notes to the Parent Company financial statements continued

The principal assumptions made in measuring the fair value of PSP awards were as follows:
Principal assumptions 2015 2014
Fair value at grant date 41.0 pence 192.5 pence
Share price on grant date 196.5 pence 292.3 pence
Expected life of the awards 3 years 3 years
Risk free rate interest rate 0.74% 1.12%
Dividend yield on the Company’s shares 1.52% 1.06%
Volatility of the Company’s shares 23.9% 21.6%
TSR correlation (SSG PLC vs comparators) 20.7% 25.0%
Due to the limited historic data available for SSG PLC expected volatility was based on the historic volatilities of the companies 
in the TSR comparator group.
The movements in the PSP awards granted to employees of Stock Spirits Group PLC during the year were as follows:
 
 2015

£132,000 (2014: £52,000). This will be accounted for as a liability on the Company balance sheet.

No deferred shares were granted under the Group Annual Deferred Annual Bonus Plan during the year.

Shareholder information online
Stock Spirits Group’s registrars are able to notify shareholders 
by email of the availability of an electronic version of 
shareholder information.
Whenever new shareholder information becomes available, 
such as Stock Spirits Group’s interim and full year results, 
Capita will notify you by email and you will be able to access, 
read and print documents at your own convenience. To take 
advantage of this service for future communications, please go  
to https://www.capitashareportal.com where full details of the 
shareholder portfolio service are provided. Firstly you will need 
to search for the Company, but once you have logged in you  
can check your account details, change your address details,  
or review FAQs, one of which will explain how to request a new 
share certificate.
When registering for this service, you will need to have your  
11-character Investor Code (IVC) to hand, which is shown on 
your dividend tax voucher, share certificate or form of proxy. 
You can then select “Send me all communications by email 
(most environmentally friendly)”. Should you change your mind 
at a later date, you may amend your request by entering your 
portfolio online and selecting your preferred method of 
communication to “Send me paper copies of all communications”. 
If you wish to continue receiving shareholder information  
in the current format, there is no need to take any action.

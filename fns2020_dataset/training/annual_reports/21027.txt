Chairman’s statement
The team at Ashmore is committed  
to implementing successfully its strategy 
of developing a global specialist 
emerging markets business, with assets 
of all classes managed both centrally 
and through developing a number  
of local asset management operations  
in the key emerging markets.
I would like to thank all the members  
of the Group for the efforts they continue 
to make towards achieving our goals. 
The opportunities and challenges that 
will be presented in the future will be 
significant as the global economic 
prospects become ever more influenced 
by the emerging markets, where the 
Group has a track record of success, 
built over many years. 
Michael Benson
Chairman
The year to 30 June 2009 was one  
of unprecedented turbulence in the 
global economy, which resulted in  
an extreme reduction in the levels of 
leverage deployed across the world 
and a significant reduction of liquidity 
and increased volatility throughout 
world markets. As the year ended, 
there were some signs of a recovery 
in markets with a more stable set  
of conditions prevailing. Against  
this background, Ashmore Group 
(“Ashmore” or the “Group”) has had a 
broadly satisfactory year, with a profit 
before tax of £159.8 million (year 
ended 30 June 2008: £196.2 million). 
see page 15 for further details
Over the last year the Group has 
concentrated on its core capabilities  
of product innovation, asset raising/
retention, good investment performance 
and excellent client service. At the same 
time, it has continued to strengthen the 
business through the recruitment of 
additional talented individuals within the 
central and local asset management 
businesses and through the introduction 
of enhanced core systems and operating 
processes. The Chief Executive Officer’s 
statement and the Business review 
provide further detail on these activities.
In recognition of the financial performance, 
and our confidence in the Group’s  
future prospects, the Directors are 
recommending a final dividend of  
8.34 pence for the year ended 30 June 
2009 which, subject to shareholder 
approval, will be paid on 4 December 
2009 to all shareholders who are on  
the register on 6 November 2009. This 
makes a total dividend of 12.0 pence  
for the year (2008: 12.0 pence).
During the year ended 30 June 2009, 
the following Board changes occurred. 
In September 2008, Jonathan Asquith 
joined the Group, having been Vice 
Chairman and Chief Financial Officer  
at Schroders plc. Initially he was an 
independent non-executive Director  
and member of the audit committee. 
Subsequently he has become Chairman 
of the remuneration committee. 
Jonathan’s extensive industry 
experience and knowledge have added 
additional strength to the Board and its 
committee structure. At the Group’s 
AGM in October, Jon Moulton retired, 
having been a non-executive Director 
since the Group was established in 
1999. I should like to thank Jon for the 
very considerable contributions he made 
over those 10 years. In June, the Group 
announced the appointment to the 
Board of Melda Donnelly, former  
Chief Executive Officer of Queensland 
Investment Corporation and current 
Deputy Chairperson of the Victoria 
Funds Management Corporation.  
Melda has extensive experience of the 
international pension industry and of 
institutional shareholder best practice.  
I would like to welcome Melda to the 
Board, and she has also become a 
member of the audit committee from 
which I have stepped down.

Whilst all investment themes have seen 
net redemptions across the year, these 
slowed significantly in the second half, 
which also saw a turnaround in markets  
and investment performance. The pace 
of recovery varied by theme, with 
external debt recovering fastest to 
record a 9 per cent increase in AuM  
in H2, while local currency still had  
net redemptions that outweighed its 
positive performance during that period. 
Special situations lagged the listed 
equity markets, as is usual emerging 
from stress events, and as we waited  
for corporate and capital market activity 
– the principal driver of revaluations –  
to pick up. AuM in the theme remained 
broadly flat in the second half of the year.  
Lately there have been some positive 
signs pointing to the re-establishment  
of the global IPO market after an almost 
complete absence of such activity in  
the last year. 
see page 15 for further details
 
The Group achieved net revenue  
for the year of £203.5 million (2008:  
£240.0 million) a reduction of 15 per cent. 
Management fees (net of distribution 
costs) in Sterling terms rose marginally 
to £183.2 million (2008: £182.0 million), 
reflecting the fact that the reduction in 
average levels of AuM was offset by  
the strengthening of the US Dollar and 
the increase in management fee margin. 
Total performance fees for the year were 
£52.5 million (2008: £44.7 million), an 
increase of 17 per cent, including the 
maturity of the first Global Special 
Situations Fund in July 2008, and the 
August 2008 annual performance fees. 
Other income was £6.4 million (2008: 
£10. 1 million), the reduction occurring  
as a result of reduced transaction  
The Group’s overall financial 
performance achieved in the year 
ended 30 June 2009 was broadly 
satisfactory within the context  
of the extraordinary global market 
conditions. In the first half, as a result 
of significant reductions in asset 
valuations and sharply increased 
outflows, assets under management 
(AuM) were reduced by a third and 
after a further small fall in the third 
quarter the final quarter saw an 
increase to close at a level of  
US$24.9 billion. 
The opportunity presented now for 
Ashmore is greater than ever as world 
events over the last year have both 
emphasised and accelerated the 
increase in the significance of the 
emerging markets within the global 
economy. We continue to see 
opportunities going forward across  
the asset classes we operate in, and 
during the last year have further improved 
our operating platform to enable us to 
take full advantage of these opportunities.
assets under management and financial 
performance
The opening AuM at 30 June 2008 stood 
at US$37 .5 billion. Overall during the 
year, net redemptions of US$7 .5 billion 
(H1 US$5.8 billion, H2 US$1.7 billion) 
and negative investment performance  
of US$5. 1 billion (H1 negative US$7 . 1 
billion, H2 positive US$2.0 billion) have 
resulted in final AuM of US$24.9 billion.
activity levels. Foreign exchange  
losses for the full year were £38.6 million, 
comprising £38.3 million realised hedging 
costs related to hedging the US$-
denominated management fee income 
for the period, £4. 1 million unrealised 
hedging loss related to the hedging  
of management fees for future periods, 
and a £3.8 million gain from foreign 
exchange movements on the Group’s 
non-Sterling-denominated net assets. 
After costs of £52.9 million (2008: £58.8 
million) and interest income of £9.2 million 
(2008: £15.0 million) profit before tax was 
£159.8 million, a decrease of 19 per cent 
from the previous year. Basic earnings 
per share for the year were 17 .1 pence 
(2008: 21.0 pence). 
The impact of the credit crisis
The events of the global credit crisis 
have been extensively documented  
over the last year. There is little merit in 
recounting them again, rather in looking 
instead at the impact felt in the emerging 
markets and at our resultant opportunity 
set. It is clear that the crisis did not 
originate in the emerging markets but,  
in a global crisis as severe as that 
experienced over the last year, no 
market or sector could be immune  
from impact.
Chief executive officer’s statement
w orld events over the last year have both 
emphasised and accelerated the increase  
in the significance of the emerging markets.

Secondly, based upon Ashmore’s 
experience in managing across cycles 
through a number of past crises we 
believe we are well positioned for strong 
investment returns in the future. The 
investment process employed managing 
a portfolio during periods of market 
stress is one where the liquidity of  
a portfolio is retained through the 
purchase of highly liquid instruments, 
whilst adding lower liquidity instruments 
with high embedded value such as 
special situations and corporate high 
yield to provide significant alpha over  
the cycle. This active management 
approach is not based on market 
indices and accepts short-term mark- 
to-market declines, often arising simply 
as a result of wider bid-offer spreads  
in distressed markets, to secure 
long-term gains through the acquisition 
of attractive assets which will appreciate 
over the medium to long term. We have, 
as expected, begun to see the start  
of such outperformance, and look  
to realise further upside.
Thirdly, we are confident Ashmore 
remains well positioned to raise more 
AuM in the future through the second 
and third phases of the Group’s strategic 
development – the further diversification 
of developed world capital sources  
and themes and the mobilisation of 
growing emerging market capital pools. 
Developed world capital sources have 
undoubtedly been the most affected by 
the events of the last 18 months with an 
extreme reduction in leverage available 
resulting in an overriding reduction in the 
scale of funds deployed. However, we 
are beginning to receive subscriptions 
from these pools again, as investors 
work out where their capital should best 
Ashmore’s experienced fund 
management team have managed 
funds through significant crises before, 
perhaps most notably in 1994 and 1998. 
On this occasion the global scale of the 
crisis was greater but the emerging 
market impacts have been very different. 
Unlike in the earlier crises the emerging 
markets are now net creditors in global 
terms and as a result there has been  
relatively little increase in the default risk 
in Latin America and Asia and lower 
levels of contagion. The impact in those 
regions has principally been one of 
collateral damage from either reducing 
cross-border flows or a reduction in 
export levels. In Eastern Europe there 
has been a more direct impact, in part 
due to the greater direct investment  
from a concentration of EU countries 
and institutions and also to the greater 
extent to which leverage had been 
employed compared to other emerging 
market regions. 
Following these events the resultant 
position is an opportunity in three ways. 
Firstly, in a macro sense we believe that  
it has accelerated the shift of economic 
weight to, and the bargaining positions 
of, the emerging markets. The G20 
London summit saw emerging markets 
deliverables dominating and indicates 
that the international community 
recognises that emerging markets will  
define globalisation in the future. 
be allocated. At the same time, levels of 
redemptions, which were predominantly 
liquidity-driven rather than asset- 
allocation-based, have reduced 
dramatically from the levels we received 
during the middle of the year ended  
30 June 2009. Capital allocators within 
those largest emerging world sources of 
capital – central banks, governments/
reserve managers and sovereign wealth 
funds – are also seriously assessing 
greater reserve allocations to the 
emerging markets and so diluting the 
historic dominance of the US Dollar in 
this role. Therefore, looking forward, the 
opportunity for greater emerging market 
significance, strong investment returns 
and AuM growth sees Ashmore very 
well positioned. 
see page 11 for further details
 
Operational delivery
At the core of Ashmore lies our central 
investment committee whose 
established investment processes  
focus on the maintenance of long-term 
outperformance. Periods of high market 
stress drive increased volumes of  
inputs to those processes, including 
correspondingly greater analysis to 
enable the best investment decisions  
to be implemented. The investment 
professionals in all themes have been 
tested extensively this year in 
successfully implementing active 
investment management decisions. 
Some of the public funds with broad 
mandates not tied to benchmarks saw 
short-term underperformance for part 
of the year as we added illiquid assets 
and subsequently as the special 
situations valuations lagged more liquid 
investments in the recovery phase.  
Ashmore’s experienced fund management team  
have managed funds through crises before.

  There is a strong strategic case for investing  
in the emerging world across a growing 
number of asset classes, particularly  
at their nascent stages.

The Group’s local asset management 
subsidiaries now operate in Brazil, 
Turkey and India. At the beginning  
of January we launched equity funds 
managed in our Sao Paulo office 
mirroring the onshore and offshore  
fund structures established there last 
year with the local currency funds.  
All these funds have begun to see  
some subscriptions following the 
establishment of good opening track 
records. In Turkey, having established 
the local asset management business  
in Istanbul following regulatory approval 
in August last year, we launched three 
Ashmore mutual funds in May this year. 
In India the period has been a busy  
one for both the locally based special 
situations team and our mid-market 
private equity venture. 
Following the acquisition of a majority 
interest in Dolomite Capital, a New 
York-based emerging market fund  
of third-party funds manager and 
independent advisor, in November we 
completed the acquisition of the balance 
before the year ended to enable us  
to consolidate the team with our existing 
staff and grow our overall Ashmore 
marketing and distribution presence  
in the United States.
People and culture 
Ashmore has been successful over  
the long term because we have 
combined a successful operating model 
with good people and a robust culture. 
At the heart of the culture we believe are 
two overriding principles – alignment with 
our clients and alignment with our 
shareholders. The performance of the 
team at Ashmore over the year to  
30 June 2009 has been one of immense 
effort and significant achievement in 
many areas. Nonetheless, as in past 
years, the financial rewards for the  
team have been reduced, mirroring the 
negative absolute returns delivered by  
Our long-term institutional investor  
base has a good understanding of our 
approach but nevertheless a feature  
of last year was a significant increase  
in the time spent by our marketing and 
client relationship teams in reinforcing  
and enhancing this understanding. 
In the area of new product launches,  
the period has naturally seen somewhat 
reduced levels achieved compared  
with recent periods. The second half 
saw the fifth global special situations 
fund launched with AuM of US$0. 1 billion 
and in May we launched the Global 
Consolidation & Recovery Fund giving 
financial institutions a way of addressing 
some or all of their distressed or other 
emerging market balance sheet 
exposures. In addition to these public 
fund launches, the period saw two new 
segregated mandates funded in external 
debt and corporate high yield. At the 
same time we have been working hard 
on future initiatives to provide our clients 
with further diversification into those 
asset classes where we see significant 
opportunity in the next one to three years. 
see page 14 for further details
 
It has been another very busy year in  
the area of infrastructure projects with  
the implementation of a new portfolio 
management system which, in 
conjunction with the fund accounting 
system implemented last year, provides 
the backbone upon which to execute 
our long-term fund management  
strategy. In addition we have deployed 
new core systems in the human 
resources and company secretarial 
areas and implemented a new general 
ledger system. In all cases these  
provide us with further robust scalable 
applications that can be used across  
the Group.

a number of the Group’s funds, and by 
Ashmore’s shares. This demonstrates 
the long-term nature of our commitment 
to make returns for both our investors 
and our shareholders. Our culture 
doesn’t change. 
see page 35 for further details
 
The organisation has grown as we have 
recruited a significant number of people 
into the Ashmore team during the last 
two years. The experiences we have 
shared in the delivery of investment 
performance, client management, 
support and infrastructure development 
over the last year have been stretching, 
but nevertheless highly enjoyable and 
rewarding. I would like to thank everyone 
for the part they have played over  
the period in providing Ashmore with  
the platform to seize the significant 
opportunities going forward and I  
look forward to us all getting on and 
seizing them.

Performance fees 
Unaudited annual performance fees for 
the funds with performance years ended 
31 August 2009 (including EMLIP and 
LCD) were £5.1 million (August 2008: 
£31.0 million) which will be recognised  
in the financial year ended 30 June 2010.

Outlook statement 
The outlook can be assessed from  
two standpoints, the internal perspective 
of the firm and the external perspective 
of the markets in which we operate. Our 
outlook based on the first of these is as 
positive as at any time I can remember 
as the number of new opportunities, 
projects and initiatives that are being 
worked upon across the firm is 
extensive. New funds, new themes, 
potential clients and strategic initiatives 
are underway which we hope will bring 
significant value over the coming years. 
July and August have seen net inflows 
and positive investment performance, 
AshMOr e gr OuP Pl C / Ar 0 9 / Per FOr MANCe r eview / C hieF eXeCutive OFFiCer ’s st At eMeNt 
following the trend established in  
May and June.
As far as the prospects for emerging 
market investment are concerned we 
believe the reshaping of the emerging 
markets’ role within the global order  
has received a significant boost in the 
last year. We are also optimistic that we  
are seeing investors begin to allocate 
capital again and our challenge remains, 
as always, to persuade them of the 
compelling investment opportunities 
presented in the emerging markets.  
The long-term trend of an increasing 
allocation from investors towards 
emerging markets as these markets 
make up an ever greater proportion  
of world markets, whether measured  
by market capitalisation in debt or  
equity or through alternatives like GDP 
or growth potential, continues to be very 
positive for Ashmore. The largest source 
of capital to manage over the long term 
remains the capital from within the 
emerging markets themselves, and we 
are increasingly focused on this, and  
on the resources required to access it.

Key performance indicator Definition
average net management fee margins (bps)
The average net management fee margin is calculated in US Dollars,  
and is assessed after management fee rebates. The average is 
affected by changes in the product and investor mix. Certain themes 
attract higher gross fee levels, generally where investment return 
opportunities are higher.
operating profit margin 
The operating profit margin measures total operating profits against 
net revenues. Net revenues are calculated after deducting third-party 
distribution costs and any rebates. Included within total operating 
costs are both fixed and variable personnel expenses, and other 
operating expenses. 
Variable compensation (“VC”)/eBVCIT
The Group’s variable compensation represents the majority of the 
overall personnel expenses payable, and is assessed as percentage  
of profit before tax, interest, and variable compensation. The amount 
includes performance-related bonuses, share-based payments and 
associated social security costs. 
Year-end headcount 
The Group analyses its headcount by function (investment vs. support), 
and by geography (central vs. local asset management subsidiaries).
Key performance indicators: the Group’s 
progress towards its strategic objectives.
Business review
The financial and operational highlights previously described are analysed further in the following Financial and Business review, 
providing a detailed account of the Group’s activities and their financial impact in the period.
Year-end assets under management/ 
average assets under management (aum) 
The movement between opening and closing assets under 
management provides a good indication of the overall success  
of the business during the period, both in terms of net subscriptions/
redemptions and investment performance. 
The average AuM balance during the period, along with the  
average margins achieved, determine the level of management  
fee revenues. The AuM and margin trends are lead indicators  
for short-term profitability.

107.0 basis points (bps) 
During the period average net management fee margins increased 
from 103bps in 2007/08, largely driven by the timing of outflows and 
the resultant AuM mix, rather than by a long-term expansion in margin 
levels. However, the maintenance of high revenue margins, reflecting 
the specialist characteristics of many of the themes we manage and  
the active nature of our investment process, remains our aim.
see page 18 for further details
74 per cent 
The Group has maintained a market-leading operating margin position. 
Whilst we have remained focused on growing our platform, we retain  
a significant degree of flexibility in our cost base, restricting fixed costs 
where possible. As we have outlined previously, we do expect this  
to normalise in the mid 60s over the long term.
see pages 18 and 19 for further details
14 per cent 
The VC/EBVCIT percentage was lowered in 2008/09 to 14.0 per cent 
(2007/08: 18.2 per cent). This reflects the reduction in the performance 
of the business, and demonstrates a strong alignment with shareholders 
and fund investors, many of whom have experienced negative 
absolute returns in the period.

us $24.9 billion/us $27.7 billion 
The decline in AuM in the period reflects the difficult and volatile 
market conditions, particularly in the first half, with AuM closing at 
US$24.6 billion at 31 December 2008. Outflows peaked at the end  
of the first and through the second quarter, before slowing in the third 
quarter, and May and June saw modest net inflows – reaching a 
closing level of US$24.9 billion at 30 June 2009.

New funds
The year saw levels of new funds 
launched reduced from earlier years  
in terms of both numbers of funds  
and levels of AuM raised. In the public 
funds category, four funds were 
launched: the Global Special Situations 
Fund 5 (US$0.1 billion); the Global 
Consolidation & Recovery Fund (US$0. 1 
billion); and two Brazilian equity funds 
(one onshore, and an offshore 
equivalent) managed by our Brazilian 
local asset management subsidiary. 
Additionally, three dual-branded  
Turkish mutual funds were launched – 
specialising in Turkish equities, debt,  
and liquidity respectively, managed  
by our Turkish local asset management 
subsidiary; and two new segregated 
mandates won in the period – within  
the external debt and corporate high 
yield themes. The Group also laid the 
foundations in respect of a number of 
other initiatives, which we expect to be a 
success in 2009/10, markets permitting.
ashmore Group result
The Group recorded an operating  
profit before tax for the year ended  
30 June 2009 of £150.6 million  
(2008: £181.2 million), giving rise to an 
operating margin of 74 per cent (2008: 
76 per cent); a profit before tax of  
£159.8 million (2008: £196.2 million); 
and a profit after tax of £1 15.5 million 
(2008: £141.0 million). The financial 
results are analysed further below.
assets under management and fund flows
Global market conditions during the  
first half were extremely challenging, 
particularly with the aggressive falls  
in global markets in the aftermath of 
Lehman’s failure on 15 September 2008. 
The significant fall in valuations, coupled 
with the redemption of assets by clients 
for liquidity reasons, impacted the 
Group’s assets under management. 
Inflows fell away, as those clients  
with liquidity held off from making EM 
allocations in turbulent markets. Despite 
some signs of stabilisation late on,  
all relevant indices were down on the 
opening 1 July position by 31 December 
2008, some significantly. 
As a result, the significant majority of  
the decline in AuM during the financial 
year occurred between September and 
December 2008, with a decline from 
US$37 .5 billion at 30 June 2008 to 
US$24.6 billion by 31 December  
2008, through a combination of net 
redemptions (US$5.8 billion) and 
adverse performance (US$7 . 1 billion). 
The second half of the financial year 
opened with further market falls, which 
again undermined investor confidence 
and erased some gains made in 
December. Outflows continued on from 
the first half, at a much reduced rate, 
and these were concentrated in the  
local currency funds. At the end of the 
third quarter AuM had fallen a further 
US$1.1 billion to US$23.5 billion. 
Since then, AuM has stabilised, 
reflecting the improvement in market 
conditions. AuM rose by US$1.4 billion  
in the fourth quarter to close at US$24.9 
billion on 30 June 2009, US$1.9 billion 
being attributable to performance and 
US$0.5 billion to net outflows, all of 
which arose in April 2009. The quarter 
ended with outflows having stabilised, 
and modest inflows. This resulted  
in an aggregate uplift in AuM during  
the second half of US$0.3 billion, being 
attributable to favourable performance  
of US$2.0 billion, and net outflows  
of US$1.7 billion.

the table below sets out the AuM 
movement on this basis.
to provide visibility around multi-strategy funds 
and new initiatives, we intend to analyse AuM 
by the theme by which we are mandated.  
Further analysis of AuM 
Since becoming listed, AuM has been 
reported on a quarterly basis for each of 
the core investment themes by external 
debt, local currency, special situations, 
and equity. Corporate high yield, the 
most recently launched strategy, is 
included within external debt from  
where the majority of funds invested  
in it were drawn. This has meant that 
multi-strategy funds, where we make  
the asset allocation decision dynamically 
between the themes, have been 
included in the themes rather than  
as an AuM category in their own right. 
The information has been presented  
in this format in the table below for the 
financial year to 30 June 2009.

The change in AuM reporting does  
not invalidate the basis of reporting  
AuM by the theme that assets are 
ultimately invested in. Such analysis  
will demonstrate the impact of the 
allocation of the multi-strategy funds  
and of cross-over investing. Cross-over 
investment refers to the process whereby 
funds in one investment theme, principally 
external debt, are permitted to invest  
a proportion of their value into individual 
assets from other Ashmore themes.  
The charts on this page illustrate  
the impact of moving between the  
“as classified by mandate” and the  
“as invested” analysis as at 30 June 
2009, and the previous year.

Investor profile – type and geography
The Group has a broad range of 
investors in the funds it manages, 
predominantly institutional in type  
(30 June 2009: 91 per cent; 30 June 
2008: 88 per cent), which includes 
banks, insurers, pension providers, 
corporates and government agencies. 
The balance comprises 9 per cent retail/
high net worth individuals (30 June 
2008: 12 per cent). Ashmore does not 
currently access the Retail market 
directly, though some institutional 
business, particularly via banks, is 
intermediated business of this nature.
Within the institutional investor profile, 
the most significant shift during the 
period has been the increase in corporate 
pension plans (from 16 per cent to  
22 per cent) and government investments 
(from 15 per cent to 21 per cent) as a 
percentage relative to 2008. The investor 
proportion attributable to banks has,  
by contrast, fallen (from 16 per cent  
to 10 per cent), which is to be expected 
given the liquidity concerns many banks 
experienced during the financial year.
The geographical profile of the Group’s 
investors remains diversified.

Management fee margins 
The Group’s policy of maintaining high 
and stable management fee margins 
has been continued during the period, 
despite the volatility in markets and 
tough operating environment for asset 
managers. Across the first half average 
net management fee margins actually 
increased relative to 2007/08, as a 
function of the AuM mix, with the timing 
of outflows at different margins having 
an impact, because of the size of 
mandate or asset class invested in. 
However, this re-balanced during the 
second half, such that although the 
average revenue margin for 2008/09 
remained 4 bps higher than the  
103bps experienced during 2007/08, 
average net management fee margins 
for the final quarter returned to the 
2007/08 levels. 
Performance fees
It is the Group’s policy to maintain  
a good balance between those funds 
where the Group is eligible to earn 
performance fees and those that 
generate revenues for the Group solely 
through management fees. At the year 
end the Group was eligible to earn 
performance fees on 67 per cent of  
AuM (2008: 65 per cent), and 61 per 
cent of funds (2008: 60 per cent). Within 
those funds that are eligible to generate 
performance fees, 14 per cent were 
ineligible in the year under review, either 
management fee margins and  
performance fees
As the Group’s AuM is predominantly 
US Dollar-based, the majority of 
management and performance fees are 
also US Dollar-denominated. The table 
below therefore sets out AuM, net 
management fees, and performance 
fees, by theme in US Dollar – as the  
best means of analysing the underlying 
trend of management fees, performance  
fees and margins. 
For the purposes of the income 
statement, these fees are converted  
into Sterling during the year at the 
appropriate exchange rate. For 
management fees the effective average 
exchange rate during the period is 
GBP1:1.62USD. This is weighted by 
reference to the timing and extent of 
management fees as they arose, and 
compares to a GBP1:1.60 average 
monthly rate for the financial year 
(un-weighted). The effective average 
exchange rate during the period for 
performance fees was GBP1:1.84USD, 
reflecting the crystallisation of the 
majority of these fees in the first  
quarter of the year (30 June 2009: 
GBP1:1.60USD; 30 June 2008: 
GBP1:1.99USD).
because such fees are earned at the 
end of the multi-year fund life or because 
they are subject to rebate agreements. 
Total performance fee income for the 
year ended 30 June 2009 was £52.5 
million (2008: £44.7 million).
operating costs and operating margin
The Group maintains a tightly controlled 
cost structure, but has invested 
significantly in infrastructure in recent 
periods to provide a platform for growth 
without the need for further comparable 
support cost expansion. Rather, the 
focus in the coming periods will be  
on extending our distribution reach,  
and on enhancing the Group’s 
investment capabilities where  
suitable opportunities arise. 
Retaining a low proportion of fixed 
personnel expenses relative to variable 
performance-related personnel costs 
remains core to this philosophy, ensuring 
employees are strongly aligned with fund 
investors and shareholders. Salaries 
represent the Group’s biggest category 
of fixed cost, so a strict base salary  
cap is enforced. For the year to 30 June 
2009 fixed personnel costs increased  
by £4. 1 million to £1 1.5 million (2007/08: 
£7 .4 million) of total personnel cost of 
£36.0 million (2007/08: £47 .7 million).

AshMOr e gr OuP Pl C / Ar 09 / Per FOr MANCe review / BusiNess r eview There is a £14.0 million deferred tax 
asset on the Group’s balance sheet  
at 30 June 2009, as a result of timing 
differences in the recognition of  
the accounting expense and actual  
tax deductions in connection with  
share price appreciation on share- 
based awards. 
Dividend
In recognition of the financial performance 
during the period, and our confidence  
in the Group’s future prospects, the 
Directors are recommending a final 
dividend of 8.34 pence per share for  
the year ended 30 June 2009 which, 
subject to shareholder approval, will  
be paid on 4 December 2009 to all 
shareholders who are on the register  
on 6 November 2009. 
An interim dividend for the six-month 
period to 31 December 2008 of 3.66 
pence (2007: 3.66 pence) was paid  
on 24 April 2009. Together, these  
result in a full-year dividend of  
12.0 pence (2008: 12.0 pence).
The Group’s investment in infrastructure 
initiatives to support the development  
of the business have also affected other 
operating costs, which increased by 
£5.8 million (52 per cent) to £16.9 million 
during the period. As reported in last 
year’s Annual Report, an additional  
£1.8 million was incurred in respect  
of full-year charges on the Group’s new 
premises in London and amortisation  
of the deferred acquisition costs (DAC) 
associated with the launch of AGOL  
in December 2007 . In addition, a further 
£1.3 million of the increment on 2007/08 
relates to enhancing information 
technology capabilities across the 
business; £0.8 million to legal and 
professional fees, including corporate 
development and due diligence 
activities; and £0.8 million to higher  
travel costs, reflecting the Group’s 
increased headcount.
As a result, the operating profit margin 
for the year ended 30 June 2009 was  
74 per cent (2008: 76 per cent).
t axation 
The vast majority of the Group’s profit is 
subject to UK taxation and typically the 
Group has a limited number of non-tax-
deductible expenses. Consequently the 
Group’s effective tax rate (27 .8 per cent)
has historically tracked close to the  
UK corporation tax rate (currently  
28.0 per cent).
Variable compensation includes 
performance-related bonuses, share-
based payments and associated  
social security costs. For 2008/09 this 
fell to £24.5 million, 14.0 per cent as a 
percentage of earnings before variable 
compensation, interest, and tax “EBVCIT”, 
(2007/08: £40.3 million, 18.2 per cent), 
reflecting the reduced performance of 
the business and market conditions.
As we highlighted at the time of the 
Interim Results, the Group executed  
a planned headcount increase during 
the first half, growing from 93 to 138 
employees at 31 December 2008. 
Subsequently, the Group has added  
a further four heads, taking the year-end 
headcount to 142, of whom 41 are 
employed in relatively newly established 
local asset management operations. 
The increased headcount has been 
focused on two areas: first, improving 
the Group’s infrastructure; and secondly 
expanding the number of investment 
professionals based in overseas 
jurisdictions, in keeping with the  
Group’s strategy of establishing local  
asset management operations in 
emerging economies.
t he group’s policy of maintaining high 
and stable management fee margins 
has been continued.

first half was £49.8 million, comprising 
£54.2 million relating to hedging activity, 
partially offset by £4.4 million of gains  
on revaluation of other non-Sterling-
denominated assets and liabilities.
During the second half US$165 million  
of these contracts matured, with the 
crystallised losses offsetting gains  
on the translation of the US Dollar 
management fees back into Sterling  
at the prevailing rate, relative to the 
budgeted rate of GBP1:2.00USD. The 
weakening of the US Dollar during the 
second half to close at a 30 June 2009 
rate of GBP1:1.65USD contributed to 
hedging-related losses being reduced 
by £11.8 million to £42.4 million, within  
an overall foreign exchange loss  
for the year of £38.6 million.
The level of foreign exchange hedges  
in place as 30 June 2009 is US$180 
million. This includes the US$120 million 
of forward foreign exchange contracts  
in respect of 2009/10 net management 
fee cash flows, and US$60 million  
of options in respect of 2010/11 net 
management fee cash flows. These 
have been marked-to-market at the 
year-end rate of GBP1:1.65USD. 
The options effectively operate as a 
collar, protecting the Sterling value of 
US$60 million of the Group’s forecast 
management fee revenue cash flows  
for 2010/1 1 from being impacted by 
currency movements outside a range 
from GBP1:1.52-1.70USD. As designated 
hedges the mark-to-market movement 
in the value of the options will be taken 
through reserves, until such time as they 
and the associated hedged revenues 
mature, so long as the hedges are 
assessed as being effective. If assessed 
as ineffective, the mark-to-market of  
the options will be taken through the 
income statement. 
The Group’s cash balances are invested 
with the objective of optimising returns 
within a strict framework which 
emphasises capital preservation, 
security, liquidity and counterparty risk. 
Cash is invested only in institutions with 
approved credit ratings of A or better. 
Typically, during the financial year, 
investments have been in short-term 
cash deposits. Based on the level  
of cash balances at 30 June 2009,  
a 1 per cent change in UK interest  
rates would have a £2.9 million impact 
on the Group’s profit before tax.
Seeding 
The Group supports the creation of new 
business by seeding new funds where 
necessary. As at 30 June 2009 the 
amount invested was £26.6 million (at 
cost), with a market value of £32.2 million, 
and an aggregated annualised return  
for 2008/09 of 13 per cent (including 
foreign exchange). 
Foreign exchange management 
The Group’s long-standing policy is to 
hedge up to two-thirds of the foreign 
exchange exposure in connection with 
its net management fee cash flows, 
using a combination of forward foreign 
exchange contracts and options for up 
to two years forward. 
The period to 30 June 2009 was 
characterised by extreme currency 
volatility, with the GBP/USD exchange 
rate ranging between GBP1.00:1.43-
1.98USD. In the first half there was a 
significant strengthening of the US Dollar 
relative to Sterling, with the exchange 
rate closing on 31 December 2008  
at GBP1:1.46USD. As we set out in our 
Interim Results, this volatility resulted in  
a £41.4 million loss being recognised in 
the first half in respect of the unrealised 
marked-to-market of US$265 million 
open forward foreign exchange contracts. 
The overall foreign exchange loss for the 
p urchase of own shares
In line with authorities granted at the 
AGM in October 2008, the Company 
purchased 5,368,331 shares for an 
aggregate consideration of £6.9 million, 
which are held in treasury.
Balance sheet management and cash flow
It is the Group’s policy to maintain a 
strong balance sheet in order to support 
regulatory capital requirements, to meet 
the commercial demands of current  
and prospective investors, and to fulfil 
the development needs across the 
business. Development needs include 
funding the establishment costs of local 
asset management ventures, seeding 
new funds and other strategic initiatives. 
As at 30 June 2009, total equity 
attributable to shareholders of the parent 
was £308.5 million, as compared to 
£271.8 million at 30 June 2008. There is 
no debt on the Group’s balance sheet.
Cash
The Group’s cash and cash equivalents 
balance increased by £9.2 million in  
the period to £288.4 million. The Group 
continues to generate significant cash 
from operations, totalling £150.9 million 
in the year (year to 30 June 2008: 
£195.5 million), from which it paid the 
following significant items: £81.9 million 
in cash dividends (2007/08: £70. 1 million); 
£47 .7 million of taxation (2007/08:  
£46.5 million); £1 1.6 million for new seed 
investments (2007/08: £15. 1 million); 
£6.9 million for Ashmore Group plc 
shares held in treasury (2007/08: nil); 
£3.7 million to acquire new subsidiaries 
(2007/08: nil); and £2. 1 million to purchase 
property, plant and equipment, largely 
IT-related (2007/08: £3.5 million).

AshMOr e gr OuP Pl C / Ar 0 9 / Per FOr MANCe review / BusiNess r eview r egulatory capital
As a UK listed asset management 
group, Ashmore is subject to regulatory 
supervision by the Financial Services 
Authority (FSA) under the Prudential 
Sourcebook for Banks, Building 
Societies and Investment Firms.  
The Group has one UK-regulated entity, 
Ashmore Investment Management 
Limited (“AIML ”), on behalf of which 
quarterly capital adequacy returns  
are filed. AIML held surplus capital 
resources relative to its requirements  
at all times during the period  
under review. 
Further, with effect from 1 January  
2007 , the Group has been subject  
to consolidated regulatory capital 
requirements, whereby the Board is 
required to assess the degree of risk 
across the business, and hold sufficient 
capital within the Group against them. 
The Board has assessed the amount  
of capital required to cover such risks  
as £28.0 million. Thus, given the 
considerable balance sheet resources 
available to the Group, the Board is 
satisfied that the Group is adequately 
capitalised to continue its operations 
effectively. Further information regarding 
the Group’s capital adequacy status  
can be found in the Group’s Internal 
Capital Adequacy Assessment Process 
(ICAAP) and Pillar III and disclosures, 
which are available on our website  
at www.ashmoregroup.com.
Deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”)
As we indicated last year, Ashmore  
was appointed investment manager of 
Ashmore Global Opportunities Limited 
(“AGOL ”), a newly incorporated publicly 
listed closed-ended investment 
company, on 12 December 2007 . This 
vehicle raised e500 million capital, with 
the purpose of investing in Ashmore’s 
special situations and multi-strategy 
funds. During 2008, the shares of the 
Company have, for the most part, traded 
at a discount to the net asset value of its 
balance sheet, although this discount 
was significantly less than that of many 
of its peer group. Where this discount  
is in excess of 10 per cent for 12 
consecutive months, an EGM is required 
to consider whether AGOL should be 
wound up. Such an EGM was held  
on 5 May 2009, with 80 per cent of the 
voting shareholders voting against the 
resolution. Should the discount continue 
to exceed 10 per cent for a further  
12 consecutive months, an EGM  
would once again be required. 
The Group holds on its balance sheet 
unamortised DAC in respect of the 
launch of AGOL which amounted  
to £1 1.3 million at 30 June 2009. Any 
such future vote would not result in an 
escalation of the recognition of these 
costs, as an early termination of the 
Company triggers full recovery of the  
set-up costs (including the portion 
previously amortised – £2.1 million  
per annum, and £3.3 million cumulative 
to 30 June 2009).
it is the group’s policy to maintain 
a strong balance sheet.

Risk management and control
Risk management and control is one

of internal controls within its corporate 
governance framework – incorporating 
Risk, Compliance and, with effect from 
July 2009, a newly formed Internal  
Audit function. Further details of the

Risk is inherent in all businesses and  
is therefore present within the Group’s 
activities. The Group seeks to effectively 
identify, monitor and manage each  
of its risks and actively promotes  
a risk awareness culture throughout  
the organisation. 
The ultimate responsibility for risk 
management rests with the Board. 
However, from a practical perspective 
some of this activity is delegated.  
The key risks, their mitigants, and their 
delegated owners are set out on the 
facing page for each of the four risk 
categories that Ashmore considers  
most important: strategic and business, 
investment, operational, and treasury – 
with reputational risk being a common 
characteristic across all four categories.
During the year the Group’s risk  
control framework has been enhanced 
to take account of changing business 
and market conditions. There has  
been specific focus on the further 
development of the Group Risk Matrix, 
which seeks to identify the key risks to 
the Group, as well as current mitigants 
and forward-looking action plans. 
During the year the group’s risk control

Directors’ conflicts of interests
Since October 2008, the Companies 
Act 2006 has imposed upon directors a 
new statutory duty to avoid unauthorised 
conflicts of interest with the Company. 
As permitted by the Act, at last year’s 
AGM, the Company adopted revisions 
to its Articles of Association which 
enabled Directors to approve conflicts  
of interest and which also included  
other conflict of interest provisions. The 
Company has implemented processes 
to identify potential and actual conflicts 
of interest. Such conflicts are then 
considered for approval by the Board, 
subject, where necessary, to appropriate 
conditions.

Company’s shares and in options over

aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s 
auditors are unaware, and each Director 
has taken all the steps that they ought

themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of  
that information.
Resolutions will be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting to reappoint 
KPMG Audit Plc as auditors and to 
authorise the Directors to agree their 
remuneration. Note 4 to the financial 
statements sets out details of the

law and by the Company’s Articles.  
As a listed company, the Company must 
also comply with the Listing Rules and 
the Disclosure and Transparency Rules 
issued by the United Kingdom Listing 
Authority (UKLA). Listed companies

of payment and to make payment in 
accordance with those terms subject to 
receipt of satisfactory invoicing. Unless 
otherwise agreed payments to creditors 
are made within 30 days of receipt of

30 days’ average purchases from 
suppliers (2008: 30 days).
power to issue and allot shares
The Directors are generally and 
unconditionally authorised to allot 
unissued shares in the Company  
up to a maximum nominal amount  
of £19, 107 .50.

to the Directors to allot the Company’s 
shares for cash, up to a maximum 
nominal amount of £3,544.62, without 
regard to the pre-emption provisions  
of the Companies Acts. No such shares 
have been issued or allotted under  
these authorities, nor is there any  
current intention to do so, other than  
to satisfy outstanding obligations  
under the employee share schemes 
where necessary.
These authorities are valid until the  
date of the next Annual General Meeting. 
A resolution for the renewal of such 
authorities will be proposed at the  
2009 Annual General Meeting.

with the provisions of the Companies 
Acts by way of a special resolution  
of the Company’s shareholders.
The Notice of AGM contains a  
resolution recommending a number  
of amendments to the Articles to bring 
them into line with recent changes  
in the law and best practice.

This Directors’ report on pages 26 to  
29 inclusive has been drawn up and 
presented in accordance with and  
in reliance on English company law  
and the liabilities of the Directors in 
connection with that report shall be 
subject to the limitations and restrictions 
provided by such law.
After making enquiries, the Directors  
are satisfied that the Company and  
the Group have adequate resources to 
continue to operate for the foreseeable 
future and confirm that the Company 
and the Group are going concerns.  
For this reason they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing 
these financial statements.
t he Ag M will be held on 29 October 2009.
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report, the 
Remuneration report and the financial 
statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
UK company law requires the Directors 
to prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. 
Under that law the Directors have 
prepared the Company and the Group 
financial statements in accordance  
with IFRS. 
In accordance with the FSA’s Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules (DTR 4.1.12)  
the Directors confirm to the best of their 
knowledge that:
(a) the financial statements have  
been prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards,  
and give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position  
and profit or loss of the Company  
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and 
statement of directors’ responsibilities
(b) the Business review includes  
a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with  
a description of the principal risks  
and uncertainties that they face.
In preparing those financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies  
and then apply them consistently;
•  make judgements and estimates  
that are reasonable and prudent;
•    state that the financial statements 
comply with IFRS as adopted by  
the EU; and
•  prepare the financial statements  
on the going concern basis, unless  
it is inappropriate to presume that  
the Company and the Group will 
continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
proper accounting records that disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company 
and the Group and to enable them  
to ensure that the financial statements 
and the Remuneration report comply 
with the Companies Acts and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and the Group 
and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for  
the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in  
the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.

•    interim dividend and recommendation

•    annual budgets and forecast updates;
•    significant capital expenditure; and
•   effectiveness of internal controls. 
The roles of the Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer are separate, clearly 
defined and have been approved by the 
Board. The Chairman is responsible for 
the effective conduct of the Board, while 
the Chief Executive Officer is responsible 
for execution of strategy and for the 
day-to-day management of the Group. 
In considering non-executive director 
independence, the Board has taken into 
consideration the guidance provided by 
the 2006 Code. The Board considers 
Michael Benson, Nick Land, Jonathan 
Asquith and Melda Donnelly to be 
independent. Nick Land is the Senior 
Independent Director.
During the year under review the  
Group did not fully comply with the  
2006 Code requirement that at least  
half of the Board are independent 
directors (excluding the Chairman) until 
the appointment of Jonathan Asquith  
on 1 September 2008 and retirement  
of Jon Moulton on 30 October 2008. 
During the year the Board also instigated 
a formal search process with the 
objective of making an additional 
appointment of an independent director 
with relevant experience in order to bring 
the Company into compliance with other 
aspects of the Code ( as described 
further below), which has resulted in  
the appointment of Melda Donnelly  
on 1 July 2009.
Biographical details of the Directors are 
given on page 25.
During the year under review the  
Board met six times to review financial 
performance and strategy and to follow 
Section 1 of the June 2006 Financial 
Reporting Council (FRC) Combined 
Code on Corporate Governance (“the 
2006 Code”) applies to listed companies 
with reporting years beginning on or 
after 1 November 2006. The Company 
has adopted the principles of the 2006 
Code since its admission to listing  
on the London Stock Exchange  
on 17 October 2006 (“Admission”). 
The Company has been in compliance 
with the 2006 Code since that date, 
except where the Directors consider  
that in particular limited circumstances 
departure is justified. Such departures 
are fully explained below.
This report describes the Company’s 
corporate governance arrangements, 
explaining how it has applied the 
principles of the 2006 Code.
Directors
The Board of Directors comprises  
two executive Directors and four 
non-executive Directors. The two

the Chief Executive Officer, and Graeme 
Dell, the Group Finance Director. The 
non-executive Directors are Michael 
Benson, Chairman, Nick Land, Senior 
Independent Director, Jonathan Asquith 
and Melda Donnelly. 
Michael Benson, Mark Coombs, 
Graeme Dell and Nick Land served  
as Directors throughout the year. 
Jonathan Asquith joined the Board  
on 1 September 2008 as a non-
executive Director and Melda Donnelly 
joined the Board on 1 July 2009,  
also as a non-executive Director. 
The Board has a schedule of matters 
specifically reserved to it for decision 
and approval, which include but are  
not limited to:
•   the Group’s long-term commercial 
objectives and strategy;
•    major acquisitions, disposals and 
investments;
the formal schedule of matters reserved 
for its decision. Comprehensive Board 
papers, comprising an agenda and 
formal reports and briefing papers, are 
sent to Directors in advance of each 
meeting. Throughout their period in 
office, Directors are continually updated 
by means of written and verbal reports 
from senior executives and external 
advisors on the Group’s business,  
and the competitive and regulatory 
environments in which it operates, as 
well as on legal, corporate governance, 
corporate social responsibility and other 
relevant matters.
In addition to its formal business, the 
Board received a number of briefings 
and presentations from executive 
management during the year covering  
a wide range of topics across the  
range of the Group’s business. All 
Directors have access to independent 
professional advice, if required, at the 
Company’s expense as well as to the 
advice and services of the Company 
Secretary. New directors appointed to 
the Board will receive advice as to the 
legal and other duties and obligations 
arising from the role of a director of a  
UK listed company within a full, formal 
and tailored induction programme. The 
Company Secretary, under the direction 
of the Chairman, is responsible for 
maintaining an adequate continuing 
education programme, reminding the 
Directors of their duties and obligations 
on a regular basis, ensuring good 
information flows between the Board,  
its committees and management and 
assisting with Directors’ continuing 
professional development needs. 
The Company’s nominations committee 
considers the appointment and 
replacement of directors subject to the 
rules set out in the Articles, a summary 
of which is set out below.

Board and committee attendance
The table below sets out the number  
of pre-scheduled meetings of the Board 
and its committees and individual 
attendance by the Directors. 
Board committees
The Board has appointed audit, 
remuneration and nominations 
committees to assist in the execution  
of its duties.
All of these committees operate within 
written terms of reference, which are 
reviewed annually and were updated  
by the Board in September 2009.  
The chairman of each committee 
reports regularly to the Board. 
Each of the committees is authorised,  
at the Company’s expense, to obtain 
external legal or other professional 
advice to assist in carrying out its duties. 
Only the members of each committee 
are entitled to attend its meetings but 
others, such as senior management  
and external advisors, may be invited  
to attend as appropriate.
Current membership of the committees 
is shown in the relevant sections below. 
The composition of these committees  
is reviewed annually, taking into 
consideration the recommendations  
of the nominations committee.
Powers of the Directors
Subject to the Company’s memorandum 
of association, the Articles, the 
Companies Acts and any directions 
given by the Company by special 
resolution, the business of the Company 
is managed by the Board, who may 
exercise all powers of the Company, 
whether relating to the management  
of the business of the Company or not.
Annual performance evaluation
The Board has established a formal 
process, led by the Chairman and 
assisted by the Company Secretary, for 
the annual evaluation of the performance 
of the Board, its appointed committees 
and each Director, to ensure that they 
continue to act effectively and efficiently 
and to fulfil their respective duties, and  
to identify any training requirements.  
In doing so the Board has concluded 
that both the Board and its committees 
are functioning effectively.
Meetings were held between the 
Chairman and each individual Director  
in which issues and developments  
over the year were discussed and 
performance was considered by 
reference to the objectives of the Board 
and its committees. The responses  
were collated by the Company Secretary 
and the results and issues raised were 
subsequently discussed by the Board. 
The Board also evaluated the 
Chairman’s performance.
Under the Articles, the minimum  
number of directors shall be two and  
the maximum shall be nine. Directors 
may be appointed by the Company  
by ordinary resolution or by the Board.  
A director appointed by the Board must 
offer themself for election at the next 
Annual General Meeting of the Company 
following their appointment but they are 
not taken into account in determining the 
directors or the number of directors who 
are to retire by rotation at that meeting. 
The directors to retire by rotation must 
be those who held office at the time  
of the two preceding Annual General 
Meetings and did not retire at either  
of them or if they have held office with 
the Company for a continuous period  
of nine years or more at the date of  
the Annual General Meeting. The office 
of director shall be vacated in other 
circumstances, including where (i) that 
director resigns or is asked to resign;  
(ii) they are or have been suffering from 
mental ill health; (iii) they are absent 
without permission of the Board from 
meetings of the Board for six 
consecutive months; (iv) they become 
bankrupt or compounds with their 
creditors generally; or (v) they are 
prohibited by law from being a director.

had and have recent and relevant 
commercial and financial knowledge 
and experience to satisfy the provisions 
of the 2006 Code. Nick Land, Jon

The main features of the Group’s internal 
control system are set out below.
policies
These include:
•  core values and policies, which 
together form the Group’s high-level 
principles and controls, with which  
all staff are expected to comply;
•  policies and procedure manuals, 
applicable to all business units,  
with requirements for reporting 
weaknesses and for monitoring 
corrective action;
•  a code of business conduct, with 
procedures for reporting compliance 
therewith;
•  a defined operational framework  
and organisational structure with 
appropriate delegation of authority 
and accountability; 
•  a planning framework is maintained 
which incorporates a Board approved 
strategic plan, with objectives for each 
business unit.
processes
These include:
•  regular business reviews of the 
Company and its subsidiaries are 
performed by senior management, 
which consider the ongoing effects of 
change and the short-, medium- and 
long-term operational requirements;
•  quarterly senior management systems 
and controls reviews that are 
undertaken by the Group Finance 
Director with the Head of Compliance, 
and in which the Chief Executive 
Officer participates at least annually, 
incorporating the evaluation of the 
potential impact and likelihood of 
identified risks and possible new  
risk areas;
•  a matrix of principal risks identifies key 
business, operational, financial and 
compliance risks, and considers the 
likelihood of those risks crystallising 
and the resultant impact. Within the 
matrix, the inherent risk of each 
business activity has been identified, 
and the adequacy and mitigating 
effect of existing processes assessed, 
to determine a current residual risk 
assessing the impact of the Group’s 
ongoing activities on its regulatory  
and operational exposures. The RCC  
is chaired by the Head of Risk 
Management and Control; the other 
members are the Chief Executive,  
the Group Finance Director, the Head  
of Operations and Client Relationship 
Management, the Head of Compliance, 
the Head of Information Technology,  
the Head of Legal and Transaction 
Management and the Group Financial 
Controller. Responsibility for risk 
identification is shared amongst these 
senior management personnel, with 
each such individual being responsible 
for day-to-day control of risk in their 
business area.
There are established policies and 
procedures to enable the Board, 
through its regular meetings, to monitor 
the effectiveness of the internal control 
system, which covers all significant 
identified internal and external strategic, 
operational, financial, compliance and 
other risks, including the Group’s ability 
to comply with all applicable laws, 
regulations and clients’ requirements. 
The Board has continued to receive 
regular financial and other management 
information related to the control of 
expenditure against budget and the 
making of investments, and for 
monitoring the Group’s business  
and its performance, and regular 
compliance and risk reports. 
Through the audit committee, the  
Board has conducted an annual review 
and assessment of the effectiveness  
of the internal control system, and  
has identified no significant failings  
or weaknesses during this review.  
In conducting this review, the Board has 
considered the periodic reports received 
throughout the year on compliance and 
risk matters, and the Annual Report on 
internal control processes from the RCC. 
The Board is satisfied that appropriate 
planned actions continue to be effective 
in improving controls as the Group 
develops, and its overall assessment  
of the control framework continues to  
be satisfactory. 
Internal control
In accordance with the principles of  
the 2006 Code, the Board is ultimately 
responsible for the Group’s system  
of internal control and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. Such a system and its 
review are designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives, and  
can only provide reasonable and  
not absolute assurance against  
material misstatement or loss. 
Within the Group’s over arching corporate 
governance framework, through which 
the Board aims to maintain full and 
effective control over appropriate strategic, 
financial, operational and compliance 
issues, an internal control framework  
has been established, against which  
the Company is able to assess the 
effectiveness of its system of internal 
controls The Group’s system of internal 
control is embedded within its routine 
operations, and a strong control culture 
is combined with clear management 
responsibility and accountabilities for 
individual control. The internal control 
framework provides an ongoing process 
for identifying, evaluating and managing 
the Group’s significant risks, and has 
been in place for the year under review 
and up to the date of approval of the 
Annual Report and Accounts. The 
process is regularly reviewed by the 
Board, and accords with the guidance  
in the document “Internal Control: 
Revised Guidance for Directors on  
the Combined Code, October 2005” 
(“Turnbull Guidance”) published by  
the Financial Reporting Council.
The executive Directors oversee  
the key risks and controls and the risk 
management process on a day-to-day 
basis, and have put in place an 
organisational structure with clearly 
defined lines of responsibility and 
delegation of authority. 
The Group’s Risk and Compliance 
Committee (RCC), which meets monthly, 
is responsible for maintaining a sound 
internal control environment and for

internal control framework described 
above and by the commissioning of  
the regular SAS 70 reports. Due to the 
continuing development of the Group, 
during the year the audit Ccommittee 
considered the need for an internal  
audit function. This involved whether to 
implement an internal or an outsourced 
function and the nature and scope of the 
work it would undertake, taking account 
of the existing compliance monitoring 
programmes which were already in 
place. The committee concluded that 
the best interests of the Group would  
be served by contracting internal audit 
services through an outsourced model.
Accordingly, with effect from 1 July 
2009, following a recommendation from 
the committee, the Board approved  
the appointment of Ernst & Young to 
undertake this work, reporting to the 
Group Finance Director and to the audit 
committee, and from that date, the 
Group became compliant with the  
2006 Code in that respect. 
Corporate social responsibility 
The Group recognises the importance  
of corporate social responsibility (CSR) 
incorporating transparency, fairness, 
accountability and integrity, and believes 
that these principles are fundamental  
to the Group’s operations. The Group 
continues to monitor developments  
in all relevant areas of CSR, including 
environmental management, employees, 
health and safety, suppliers and the 
community to ensure that it meets best 
practice and sees CSR as a continually 
evolving process. 
investment
The Group believes that its reputation  
as an ethical, trustworthy provider of 
investment services is essential to its 
core purpose of helping its clients to 
build their financial security. Ashmore 
seeks to establish and maintain 
long-term relationships with its clients 
and intermediaries. The Group believes  
this to be a fundamental pre-requisite  
for the growth of the business. 
priced externally is the responsibility  
of the Group’s Pricing Methodology 
Committee (PMC), which meets 
monthly to review the current valuation 
methodology for each of these 
investments and to propose an 
updated valuation methodology  
where appropriate. Valuations of the 
most material assets are outsourced 
to third parties. 
•  an experienced Group compliance 
function, whose responsibility is to 
ensure that the Group meets its 
regulatory obligations at all times,  
and integrates regulatory compliance 
procedures and best practices. 
Compliance undertakes an ongoing 
compliance monitoring programme 
covering all the relevant areas of the 
Group’s operations, to identify any 
breach of compliance with applicable 
legislation and regulation, which 
includes real-time monitoring of  
client mandate requirements. The 
results of the compliance monitoring 
programme are reported to the  
RCC in support of the overall risk 
management framework;
verification
These include:
•  the external auditors who are  
engaged to express an opinion on  
the annual financial statements, and 
also independently and objectively 
review the approach of management 
to reporting operating results and

•  the independent review of annual 
reports by the Group’s external 
auditors, pursuant to the Statement  
of Auditing Standards No. 70,  
type II (SAS 70); 
•  half-yearly updates to the Board, 
through the audit committee, from  
the Group’s external auditors, which 
include any control matters that have 
come to their attention;
The Group did not through the year  
have an internal audit function, given  
the size and nature of the business  
and operational model, with the relevant 
assurances being obtained via the 
level for each such activity. On the 
basis that further mitigants may be 
employed over time, a target residual 
risk for each activity after one to two 
years has been defined;
•  Key Risk Indicator (“KRI”) statistics 
that are reported to and analysed  
by the RCC. The KRIs indicate trends 
in the Group’s risk profile, assist in  
the reduction of errors and potential 
financial losses and seek to prevent

companies where the Group has a 
controlling stake. Through Ashmore’s 
network of local holding companies  
and portfolio of investee companies 
Ashmore influences the livelihoods  
of approximately 40,000 people.
Ashmore aims to avoid investing  
in companies that do not:
•   respect human rights
•   comply with local environmental, 
ethical or social legislation.
Ashmore does not invest in companies 
that manufacture or trade arms.
Ashmore also aims to ensure that any 
investments which it makes comply  
with the relevant industry standards and 
best practice, treat their employees fairly, 
have active community programmes 
and operate with sensitivity to the 
environment. Ashmore has made 
investments in a number of renewable 
energy projects in different countries 
including hydro-electricity, geothermal 
energy and sugar-based ethanol 
production, which reflects its overall 
approach to combining ethical investing 
with sound business practice on behalf 
of clients. 
Additionally, Ashmore funds and 
segregated accounts each have a 
specific investment mandate which sets 
out the parameters for investment which 
may include requirements to screen for 
geographic, sector and stock-specific 
restrictions. Stock-specific restrictions 
may include securities which meet 
clients’ own CSR criteria. 
t he ashmore Foundation
Consistent with the Group’s 
commitment to responsible corporate 
citizenship, the Ashmore Foundation 
was created in 2008 and is funded by 
financial contributions from employees 
of the Group. The Foundation reflects 
Ashmore’s overall philosophy that it can  
make a difference and seeks to provide 
financial grants to worthwhile causes 
Ashmore’s Board of Directors seeks  
to maintain a strong corporate culture 
employing high standards of integrity 
and fair dealing in the conduct of the 
firm’s activities, compliance with both 
the letter and the spirit of relevant laws 
and regulations, and standards of  
good market practice in all jurisdictions 
where the firm’s business is carried out. 
The Board’s aim is to enable Ashmore  
to demonstrate that the firm is fit and 
proper to undertake its business,  
to safeguard the legitimate interests  
of Ashmore clients and protect 
Ashmore’s reputation.
Social, ethical and environmental (SEE) 
criteria tend to be focused primarily on 
equity investing because of the influence 
which shareholder interests are able to 
exert on the management of a particular 
company. Ashmore’s exposure to equity 
investments amounts to less than  
18 per cent of total assets under 
management, whereas the majority of 
assets are invested in either external 
debt (the majority of which is Sovereign) 
or local currency debt. In the case of 
external debt investments, the Group’s 
ability to have an influence is generally 
limited to a decision whether or not  
to invest; however, at a country level 
Ashmore believes that it may be able  
to exert an influence through dialogue 
with governments and central banks. 
Ashmore’s public equities business is a 
small part of its overall business and its 
shareholdings will never be large enough 
to have an influence over the policies  
of management in these companies. 
Ashmore’s Special Situations business 
invariably involves clients taking 
significant controlling stakes in investee 
companies and in such circumstances 
Ashmore is in a position to positively 
engage with the management of these 
companies. In many cases Ashmore 
believes it to be beneficial to its investors 
to be proactive in promoting the

environment
As an investment manager, Ashmore 
has a limited direct impact upon  
the environment and there are few 
environmental risks associated with the 
Group’s activities. Ashmore moved into 
its premises at 61 Aldwych, London in 
May 2008 and occupies a single floor  
of approximately 19,000 square feet  
in a nine-storey multi-tenanted building.
As part of its ongoing commitment to 
the environment, Ashmore throughout 
its operations has adopted policies  
and programmes to promote energy 
conservation and the avoidance of 
waste through a number of initiatives, 
such as the recycling of paper, glass  
and other waste and the use of “green” 
energy. Electricity usage is separately 
monitored by floor with renewable 
energy accounting for a minimum of  
10 per cent of supply. Energy-efficient 
lighting is installed in the building with 
sensors which turn lights off when no 
movement is detected. The building  
has received an Energy Performance 
Certificate with an Asset Rating of 98.
Ashmore endeavours to make 
maximum use of available technology 
such as video conferencing; however,  
its business model as an investor in 
emerging markets inevitably requires 
that its investment professionals and 
other members of staff travel frequently  
to these countries to investigate  
and monitor opportunities.

ashmore Group pLC / ar 09 / Governan Ce / report from the Chairman of the audit Committee
r eport from the Chairman of the audit committee
The committee recommended to  
the Board that a resolution be put to 
shareholders for the re-appointment  
of the auditors, and their remuneration 
and terms of engagement, at the Annual 
General Meeting of the Company.
From time to time during the year the 
non-executives met with the external 
auditors without the executive Directors 
being present.
internal controls 
The committee reviewed and evaluated 
the system of internal controls and  
risk management operated within  
the Company. 
A detailed report on internal control  
can be found on pages 34 and 35.
internal audit
During the year the committee 
considered the Group’s need for an 
internal audit function. This involved 
consideration of whether to implement  
an internal or an outsourced function 
and the nature and scope of the work  
it would undertake, taking account  
of the existing compliance monitoring 
programmes which were already in 
place. The committee concluded that 
the best interests of the Group would  
be served through an outsourced  
model and with effect from 1 July 2009, 
following a recommendation from  
the committee, the Board approved  
the appointment of Ernst & Young to 
undertake this work. Further details  
can be found in the Internal Control 
section of the Corporate governance 
report on pages 34 and 35. 
The composition and summary terms  
of reference of the audit committee  
are set out on page 32.
The principal activities of the audit 
committee through the year were  
as follows:
f inancial statements 
The audit committee reviewed the  
2009 Annual Report, Interim Results, 
Preliminary Results and reports from  
the external auditors, KPMG Audit Plc, 
on the outcome of their reviews and 
audits in 2009.
external auditors 
The committee met with the external 
auditors during the year to review the 
scope of their audit and findings thereon 
for the interim and year-end financial 
statements.
The committee received a 
comprehensive presentation from  
the auditors demonstrating to its 
satisfaction how their independence  
and objectivity is maintained when 
providing non-audit services. 
The committee has agreed the types  
of permitted and non-permitted service 
and those which require explicit prior 
approval. Permitted non-audit services 
include the provision of tax compliance 
services and acting as reporting 
accountant in appropriate circumstances, 
provided there is no element of valuation 
work involved. The provision of tax 
advisory services, due diligence/
transaction services and litigation 
services may be permitted with the 
committee’s prior approval. The 
provision of internal audit services, 
valuation work and any other activity  
that may give rise to any possibility  
of self-review are not permitted  
under any circumstance.
audit committee effectiveness
The members of the committee 
conducted a review of its effectiveness 
and concluded that it was working 
effectively.

Unaudited information
introduction
This report has been prepared on  
behalf of the Board in accordance with 
the Directors’ Remuneration report 
Regulations 2002 under the Companies 
Acts and the Combined Code 2006  
(the 2006 Code). This report sets out  
the Company’s remuneration policy  
and gives details of the compensation  
of Directors for the year ended  
30 June 2009.
r emuneration committee
The remuneration committee  
comprises three non-executive Directors. 
Jon Moulton was Chairman of the 
committee until his retirement from the 
Board on 30 October 2008; Jonathan 
Asquith joined the committee on  
1 July 2009 and was appointed as 
Chairman with Michael Benson and  
Nick Land as members. Michael Benson 
and Nick Land have served on the 
committee throughout the year. 
The remuneration committee meets  
as often as required to discharge its 
duties and met twice during the period 
from 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009. 
Details of attendance at all meetings  
for the financial year under review are 
contained in the table on page 31 of  
the Corporate governance report. The 
Chief Executive Officer, Group Finance 
Director, Company Secretary and  
Head of Human Resources attended  
all or part of the meetings at the invitation 
of the remuneration committee but  
took no part in the determination  
of their own remuneration.
The primary role of the remuneration 
committee is to make recommendations 
to the Board as to the Company’s 
framework or broad policy for the 
remuneration of the Chairman, the 
executive Directors of the Board and  
the Company Secretary, as well as 
decide on total individual remuneration 
packages for these positions. 
r emuneration policy
The key objectives of the Company’s 
remuneration policy are to ensure that:
•  levels of remuneration are relative to 
the Company’s market and sufficient 
to attract and retain executive Directors 
of the quality required to run the 
Company successfully;
•  the executive Directors and the 
Company Secretary receive sufficient 
incentives to motivate enhanced 
performance; 
•  executive Directors and the Company 
Secretary are fairly rewarded for their 
individual contributions to the 
Company’s overall performance; and 
•  effective risk management is promoted 
and encouraged by executive Directors 
and the Company Secretary.
In determining this policy, the 
remuneration committee takes into 
account a broad range of factors 
including the interests of shareholders 
and the financial and commercial  
health of the Company.

Executive remuneration components
The Company rewards exceptional 
performance and so emphasises  
the variable components of the 
remuneration package.
Fixed compensation
Fixed compensation components 
comprise basic salary and benefits  
in kind. Basic salaries are set with  
a cap currently operated at a maximum 
annual salary of £100,000 as it is the 
Company’s policy to maintain its fixed 
cost base at a low level.
Variable compensation
The Company’s discretionary variable 
compensation provides for both an 
annual cash bonus, which is non-
pensionable, and deferred share 
awards. The total variable compensation 
is determined by reference to the 
individual’s performance against agreed 
criteria, the profitability of the Company 
and the external market. Performance 
criteria are established appropriate to 
the individual’s role, to include such 
measures as growth in assets under 
management (AuM) and profitability 
where appropriate and other key areas 
of individual performance.
Executive Directors are permitted  
to serve as non-executive directors  
of other non-Group companies  
where there is no competition to the 
Company’s business activities and 
where these duties do not interfere  
with the individual’s ability to perform  
his duties for the Company. In the 
reporting year neither Mark Coombs  
nor Graeme Dell hold any non-executive 
directorships.
There are no provisions for compensation 
of executive Directors on early 
termination save as described below:
(a) the contracts for Mr Coombs and  
Mr Dell contain provisions entitling the 
Company to terminate employment 
without notice subject to making 12 
monthly payments thereafter equivalent 
to monthly basic pay and benefits; and
(b) all Directors’ contracts entitle the 
Company to give pay in lieu of notice.
Service agreements
Each executive Director has entered into 
a service agreement with the Company. 
The service agreements do not have  
a fixed term but include provisions for 
termination on 12 months’ notice by 
either party. Service agreements contain 
no contractual entitlement to receive 
bonus payments or to participate in the 
Company’s share plans. Participation  
in these arrangements is discretionary 
and subject to approval by the 
remuneration committee.
Non-executive Directors are appointed 
for an initial three-year period. Their 
continued engagement is subject to  
the requirements of the Company’s 
Articles relating to the retirement of 
directors by rotation.
The Company has maintained directors’ 
and officers’ liability insurance cover 
throughout the period.
The table below provides details of the 
Directors’ service agreements/letters of 
appointment for current Directors and 
Directors who served during the year.

l ong-term share award plans
As a business which is completely reliant 
upon the intellectual capital of its people 
the Board considers it essential to have 
in place share incentive arrangements 
which provide a significant element of  
“at risk” compensation and which are 
designed to attract, motivate and retain 
highly qualified executives, investment 
management professionals, and other 
key employees who are critical to our 
long-term success, and to align their 
interests with those of our clients  
and shareholders.
The overall limits operated under the 
plans described below, which were 
established prior to the listing of the 
Company, are designed to fulfil these 
objectives. The number of shares which 
may be issued in aggregate under  
any employee share plan of the 
Company over any ten-year period 
following Admission is limited to 15 per 
cent of the Company’s issued share 
capital at that time. The Company’s 
obligations under the share plans can  
be met by newly issued shares in the 
Company or shares purchased in the 
market by the trustees of an employee 
benefit trust. 
The Company operates three share 
award plans. All employees including 
executive Directors are eligible to receive 
awards under the share award plans. 
For reasons related to Rule 9 of the 
takeover code Mark Coombs has 
chosen to waive any shares offered to 
him as part of his variable remuneration 
as the issuance of further shares  
to him would increase his existing 
shareholdings to an extent that would 
trigger a mandatory bid for all shares. 
The remuneration committee  
believes that Mark Coombs’ existing 
shareholding is more than adequate  
to align his interests fully with the 
long-term performance of the Company.
Mark Coombs’ performance measures 
include targets for EBIT and AuM  
growth as well as the progression of 
strategic opportunities and operational 
development. He has requested that he 
not be considered for a bonus award for 
the year ending 30 June 2009. Similar 
performance measures will be applied in 
the financial year ending 30 June 2010.
Graeme Dell’s performance 
measurements are a basket of 
operational, strategic and compliance-
related targets pertaining to his areas  
of responsibility, including finance, 
technology, compliance, operations  
and investor relations. The committee  
is satisfied that key targets were met in 
the year ended 30 June 2009. Similar 
performance measures will be applied  
to the financial year ending 30 June 2010.
The balance between the fixed and 
variable elements of total compensation 
for each of the executive Directors for  
the year ending 30 June 2009 is shown 
in the table below.
The Company’s intention is to pay  
to members of staff an amount in total  
of up to 25 per cent of profit before tax, 
interest and variable compensation in 
respect of its total variable compensation 
comprising cash bonus, including 
national insurance obligations thereon, 
and share-based payments, including 
fair value and national insurance costs in 
this respect. For the financial year ending 
30 June 2009 the provision for variable 
compensation is at 14 per cent of EBIT 
before variable compensation. In view  
of the stringent salary controls which  
the Group operates the remuneration 
committee does not consider it 
necessary or appropriate to set a cap  
on individual discretionary bonus 
awards, although such awards will be 
made within the overall provision for 
variable compensation as set out above.
The remuneration committee has 
considered the guidance issued by the 
Financial Services Authority (FSA) and  
in particular its emphasis on the need  
to ensure that remuneration plans do  
not incentivise excessive risk-taking  
and short-termism. The committee 
believes that the nature of the variable 
remuneration plans in place meets  
the requirements of the FSA guidelines 
in regard to the proportion of variable 
remuneration of executive Directors and 
senior staff across the business which  
is deferred, the length of the deferral 
period and the performance conditions 
attached to the deferred awards.

t he ashmore First Discretionary share option 
scheme (“option scheme”)
This scheme was established on  
23 October 2000. Subsequent to the 
Company’s Admission in October 2006, 
it is not intended to issue any further 
options under this scheme.
t he approved Company share option plan 
(“Csop”) 
This plan was adopted on 11 October 
2006 and approved by HMRC on  
1 June 2007 . The CSOP provides for  
the granting of options up to a market 
value limit of £30,000 to each individual 
on the date of grant. No awards have 
been made under this plan to date.
During the financial year share awards 
were granted to Graeme Dell from the 
Omnibus Plan on 17 October 2008  
as set forth in the table below and as 
reported in the Remuneration report  
for the year ended 30 June 2008.
No share awards were made to  
Mark Coombs in the financial year.

then restricted and matching share 
awards would vest on a pro-rated  
basis. Bonus share awards will vest  
and be transferred to the award holder 
free of restrictions upon termination  
of employment for any reason  
other than dismissal for cause  
or personal bankruptcy.
The plan also allows the issue of option  
and share awards of different types.  
No options have been issued under  
this plan during the year.
The Omnibus Plan includes individual 
limits in respect of option and share 
awards made to executive Directors in 
any annual period whereby an award  
will be limited and take effect so that  
(a) no participant who is an executive 
Director of the Company is granted 
market value options, discounted 
options or premium cost options in any 
annual period over more than 2,000,000 
ordinary shares of 0.01 pence each, and 
(b) no participant who is an executive 
Director of the Company is granted 
share awards in any annual period over 
more than 1,000,000 ordinary shares of 
0.01 pence each. If there are exceptional 
circumstances that the remuneration 
committee considers justify making 
awards in excess of these limits, the 
remuneration committee may, in respect 
of the relevant participant, apply double 
the limits above. These individual limits 
were amended in 2007 from a multiple 
of base salary to a number of shares  
as the salary cap that the Company 
operates was unduly restrictive on the 
quanta of share awards permissible. 
This change was approved by 
shareholders at the 2007 AGM.
Deferred compensation 
t he Company executive omnibus incentive 
plan (“omnibus plan”) 
This plan was adopted on 11 October 
2006.
Senior employees routinely receive a 
proportion of their remuneration in the 
form of restricted shares, which vest 
after five years but qualify for dividends 
from the date of award. Employees who 
receive an award of restricted shares 
under the Omnibus Plan may also be 
given the opportunity to commute cash 
bonus awarded into bonus shares. 
Should employees take up this option, 
the Company may match the award  
with matching shares. All share awards 
for employees who remain employed  
by the Company cliff-vest at five years.
In the case of executive Directors 
restricted and matching share awards 
will be subject to total shareholder return 
(TSR) performance conditions, but 
bonus share awards will not be subject 
to a TSR performance condition as  
the executive Directors will have waived 
cash bonus in order to receive them.
Awards under the Omnibus Plan  
are subject to good and bad leaver 
provisions. Should an award holder 
leave employment for reasons that 
would categorise them as a bad leaver, 
all restricted and matching share awards 
will be forfeited. Should an award holder 
leave employment for reasons that

Pensions
During the course of the year ending

it with a pension benefit of equivalent

the previously existing scheme was 
transferred to the new Group Personal

between these two points.
TSR is considered appropriate as  
a well-established and recognised 
performance measure which aligns the 
interests of the executive Directors with 
those of the shareholders. In the absence 
of any other dedicated emerging 
markets investment management 
companies, a comparator group  
of 16 companies has been selected  
from global investment management 
companies of a similar size that are 
established and actively trading on  
stock markets. This comparator group 
has reduced by three following the 
suspension from trading or acquisition  
of three of the original comparator  
group companies.

notes
1.  Mark Coombs has requested that he not be considered for a bonus award for the year ending 30 June 2009.
2.  Graeme Dell’s variable compensation is made up of 60 per cent cash bonus and 40 per cent deferred share awards. He may choose to commute up to 50 per cent  
of his cash bonus in favour of an equivalent amount of bonus share awards which will then be matched by the Company with an equivalent value in matching 
share awards. All share awards will be reported in the Directors’ share awards table in the year of grant.
3.  During the year ended 30 June 2008 Graeme Dell chose to commute 50 per cent of his cash bonus thus reducing his cash compensation from £782,576  
to £422,576. 
4. Non-executive Directors do not receive any additional fees for committee memberships.
5. Michael Benson has waived his right to fees over £100,000 and has asked that any additional monies are paid to a charity or charities of his choice.
6.  Mark Coombs’ benefits include payment in lieu of pension equivalent to 7 per cent of basic salary in the “Benefits” column. His benefits also include membership 
of the Company medical scheme.
7 .  Graeme Dell’s benefits include a pension contribution of 7 per cent of basic salary in the “Benefits” column. His benefits also include membership of the Company 
medical scheme.
8. Melda Donnelly was appointed on 1 July 2009 and so received no payments during the year ended 30 June 2009.
9. Jon Moulton served until 30 October 2008. His Director’s fees were waived to a charity nominated by himself.

independent auditors’ report to the members  
of Ashmore g roup plc
We have audited the financial statements 
of Ashmore Group plc for the year ended 
30 June 2009 set out on pages 48 to 84. 
The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the EU and, as regards the parent 
company financial statements, as 
applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the 
Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with sections 495, 496 and 
497 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so  
that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditors’ report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and  
the Company’s members, as a body,  
for our audit work, for this report,  
or for the opinions we have formed.
r espective responsibilities of directors  
and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement set out on 
page 29, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit the financial 
statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
(APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
scope of the audit of the financial statements
A description of the scope of an  
audit of financial statements is  
provided on the APB’s website at  
www.frc.org.uk/apb/scope/UKP . 
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
•  the financial statements give a true 
and fair view of the state of the Group’s 
and of the parent company’s affairs  
as at 30 June 2009 and of the Group’s 
profit for the year then ended;
•  the group financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
•  the parent company financial 
statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs  
as adopted by the EU and as applied 
in accordance with the provisions  
of the Companies Act 2006; and   
•  the financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the group 
financial statements, Article 4 of  
the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
•  the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies  
Act 2006; and
•  the information given in the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year (which 
includes that specific information 
presented in the Business review that 
is cross referred from the Principal 
activity and business review section  
of the Directors’ Report) for which the 
financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report  
by exception
We have nothing to report in respect  
of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we  
are required to report to you if, in  
our opinion:
•  adequate accounting records have 
not been kept by the parent company, 
or returns adequate for our audit  
have not been received from  
branches not visited by us; or
•  the parent company financial 
statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
•  certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are  
not made; or
•  we have not received all the 
information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required 
to review:
•  the Directors’ statement, set out on 
pages 28 and 29, in relation to going 
concern; and
•  the part of the Corporate Governance 
Statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with the nine provisions  
of the June 2008 Combined Code 
specified for our review.

1 significant accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently to all years presented in dealing with items which are considered 
material in relation to the Group and Company financial statements. 
(a) Basis of preparation – Group and Company
The financial information has been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, and applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006. Based on these adopted IFRS, the Directors have selected the accounting policies to be 
applied, which are set out below.
The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value  
of derivative financial instruments and certain financial assets that are held as available-for-sale. 
The Company is taking advantage of the exemption in section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 which allows it not to present  
its individual income statement and related notes.
Certain comparative amounts relating to foreign exchange have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 
None of the changes are significant in nature.
(b) Basis of consolidation 
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly,  
to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential 
voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are 
included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.  
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included in the Consolidated income statement from the effective date  
of acquisition.
(ii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are 
eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
(c) f oreign currency translation 
The Group’s financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling (“Sterling”), which is the Company’s functional and presentation 
currency. Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency).
(i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to Sterling at the foreign exchange rate 
ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary 
assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at  
the date of the transaction. 
(ii) Financial statements of foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated 
to Sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are 
translated to Sterling at rates approximating to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange 
differences arising on translation are recognised directly in a separate component of equity.

1 significant accounting policies (continued)
(d) f inancial instruments
(i) Derivatives
The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts and options to manage its foreign currency exposures. 
Except when hedge accounting is applied, derivatives are initially recognised at cost on the date on which a contract is entered 
into unless fair value at acquisition is different to cost, in which case the fair value is recognised. Subsequently they are measured 
at fair value with gains and losses recognised in the income statement. Transaction costs are recognised immediately in the 
income statement. The fair value of the derivatives is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date. 
All derivatives are carried as current assets when the fair value is positive and as current liabilities when the fair value is negative.
(ii) Financial assets
The Group may, from time to time, invest in funds where an Ashmore Group subsidiary is the investment manager or an advisor 
(“seeding”). Where the holding in such investments is deemed to represent a controlling stake, and is acquired exclusively with a 
view to subsequent disposal through sale or dilution, these seed investments are recognised as non-current assets held-for-sale  
in accordance with IFRS 5: Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. Where control is not deemed to exist,  
and the assets are readily realisable, they are recognised as available-for-sale financial assets. The recognition policy for both  
is set out below:
Financial assets held as non-current assets held-for-sale
Non-current assets held-for-sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell except where 
measurement and re-measurement is outside the scope of IFRS 5. The relevant policy is set out in (d)(i). Where investments that 
have initially been recognised as non-current assets held-for-sale, because the Group has been deemed as holding a controlling 
stake, are subsequently disposed of or diluted such that the Group’s holding is now insufficient to be deemed a controlling stake, 
the investment will subsequently be reclassified as an available-for-sale financial asset. Any such reclassification will crystallise any 
gain or loss previously recognised directly through equity within the income statement. Subsequent movements will be recognised 
in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for the newly adopted classification. 
Financial assets held as available-for-sale
For available-for-sale financial assets, gains and losses arising from changes in their fair value are recognised directly in equity, until 
the security is disposed of or is impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is taken to the 
income statement for the accounting period.
(iii) Trade and other receivables and payables
Trade and other receivables and payables are initially recorded at fair value plus transaction costs. The fair value on acquisition  
is normally the cost. Impairment losses with respect to the estimated irrecoverable amount are recognised through the income 
statement when there is appropriate evidence that trade and other receivables are impaired. However, if a longer term loan or 
receivable carries no interest, the fair value is estimated as the present value of all future cash payments or receipts discounted 
using the prevailing market rates. The resulting adjustment is recognised as interest expense or interest income. Subsequent  
to initial recognition these assets and liabilities are measured at amortised cost less any impairment.
(iv) Hedge accounting
The Group applies cash flow hedge accounting when the transactions meet the specified hedge accounting criteria. To qualify  
the following conditions must be met:
• Formal documentation of the relationship between the hedging instrument(s) and hedged item(s) must exist at inception.
•  The hedged cash flows must be highly probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could  
ultimately affect profitability.
• The effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured.
• The hedge must be highly effective, with effectiveness assessed on an ongoing basis.
For qualifying cash flow hedges, the change in fair value of the effective hedging instrument is initially recognised in equity and  
is released to the income statement in the same period during which the relevant financial asset or liability affects profitability. 
Where highly effective, any ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognised in the income statement. Where the 
instrument ceases to be highly effective as a hedge, or is sold, terminated or exercised, hedge accounting is discontinued.

1 significant accounting policies (continued)
(e) property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment includes leasehold improvements and office equipment, and are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses. 
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an  
item of property, plant and equipment. The useful life of office equipment is estimated to be five years. In respect of leasehold 
improvements depreciation is charged over the remaining life of the lease or over the useful life of the improvements, whichever  
is shorter. The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed at least annually.
(f) intangible assets – goodwill
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. 
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
(g) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three  
months or less. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents  
as defined above.
(h) Deferred acquisition costs
Costs that are directly attributable to securing an investment management contract are deferred if they can be identified separately 
and measured reliably and it is probable that they will be recovered. Deferred acquisition costs represent the contractual right to 
benefit from providing investment management services and are charged as the related revenue is recognised.
(i) impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication 
of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill, the recoverable amount  
is estimated at each balance sheet date. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds  
its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use,  
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely 
independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has 
been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent  
that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation  
or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
(j) Dividends payable
Interim dividends are recognised when paid and final dividends when approved by shareholders.

(k) employee benefits
Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement  
when payable, in accordance with the scheme particulars.
(l) share-based payments 
The Group issues share awards to its employees under share-based compensation plans. The awards have been classified  
as equity-settled under IFRS 2: Share-based Payments.
The fair value of the amounts payable to employees is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.  
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period. The fair value is measured using an appropriate 
valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted. 
(m) own shares
Own shares are held by an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) which acts as an agent for the purpose of the employee share-based 
compensation plans. The holding of the EBT comprises own shares that have not vested unconditionally to employees of the 
Group. In both the Group and Company own shares are recorded at cost and are deducted from retained earnings. 
(n) t reasury shares
Treasury shares are recognised in equity and are measured at cost. Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also 
recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from the sale and original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
(o) r evenue
Revenue comprises management fees, performance fees and other revenue. Revenue is recognised in the income statement  
as and when the related services are provided. Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits 
will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. Specific revenue recognition policies are:
(i) Management fees
Management fees are accrued over the period for which the service is provided. Where management fees are received in advance 
these are recognised over the period of the provision of the asset management service, which is estimated based on experience 
of average holding periods for investments. 
(ii) Performance fees
Performance fees relate to the performance of funds managed during the period and are recognised at the balance sheet date 
when the quantum of the fee can be estimated reliably and it is probable that the fee will crystallise. This is usually at the end  
of the performance period.
(iii) Other revenue
Other revenue includes transaction, structuring and administration fees, and reimbursement by funds of costs incurred by the 
Group. This revenue is recognised when the related services are provided. 
(p) Distribution costs
Distribution costs are cost of sales payable to third parties and are recognised over the period for which the service is provided. 
(q) operating leases 
Payments payable under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
lease. Lease incentives received are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term and are recorded as a reduction in 
premises costs.

(r) interest income 
Interest income is calculated using an effective interest rate method. Interest income comprises interest receivable on the Group’s 
cash and cash equivalents. 
(s) t axation 
(i) Income tax
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
(ii) Current tax
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
(iii) Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following 
differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries  
to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount  
of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which  
the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit  
will be realised.
(t) segment reporting
A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing products or services (business 
segment), or in providing products or services within a particular economic environment (geographical segment), which is subject 
to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments. 
Currently, management consider that the Group’s services comprise one business segment (being provision of investment 
management services) and that its operations are not run on a discrete geographic basis. This is demonstrated by the centralised 
nature of key investment, risk and operating committees.
(u) accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.  
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed  
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying  
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future 
periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of IFRS that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates 
with a significant risk of material adjustment are described in note 27 .

(v) adopted ifrs not yet applied
The following IFRSs endorsed by the EU were available for early application but have not been applied by the Group in these 
consolidated financial statements:
•
 IFRS 1 and IAS 27 (Amended): Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly-Controlled Entity or Associate
•
 IFRS 2 (Amended): Share-based Payment – Vesting Conditions and Cancellations
•
 IFRS 3 (Amended): Business Combinations
•
 IFRS 8: Operating Segments
•
 IAS 1 (Amended): Presentation of Financial Statements
•
 IAS 27 (Amended): Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact  
on the financial statements of the Group.
Company
In addition to the above accounting policies, the following specifically relate to the Company.
investment in subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly,  
to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control,  
potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.
f inancial guarantees
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, 
the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats 
the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make  
a payment under the guarantee or that guarantee expires for any reason. 
2 f oreign exchange

6 earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the financial year attributable to equity holders of the parent  
of £115.0 million (2008: £140.8 million) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated as for basic earnings per share with an adjustment to the weighted average number  
of ordinary shares to reflect the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. There is no difference between the profit for the 
financial year attributable to equity holders of the parent used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.
Reconciliation of the figures used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share:

7 share-based payments
Group and Company share-based compensation plans
The following share-based compensation plans were in operation during the reporting year.
t he ashmore f irst Discretionary share option scheme (“option scheme”)
The Option Scheme was set up in October 2000. Options issued under the Option Scheme typically have a life of 10 years  
and vest after five years from date of grant. The fair value of options at each reporting year end have been accounted for on  
an equity-settled basis. No further options will be issued under the Option Scheme.
t he executive omnibus incentive plan (“omnibus plan”)
The Omnibus Plan was introduced prior to the Company listing in October 2006 and provides for the grant of share awards, 
market value options, premium cost options, discounted options, linked options and/or nil cost options to employees. The Plan  
will also allow bonuses to be deferred in the form of share awards with or without matching shares. These elements can be used 
singly or in combination. 
t he approved Company share option plan (“Csop ”)
The CSOP was also introduced prior to the Company listing in October 2006 and is an option scheme providing for the grant  
of market value options to employees with the aggregate value of outstanding options not exceeding £30,000 per employee.  
The CSOP qualifies as a UK-tax-approved company share option plan and approval thereto has been obtained from HMRC.  
To date there have been no awards made under the CSOP .

The fair values of awards granted under the Omnibus Plan are determined by the average share price for the preceding five 
business days prior to grant.
Where the grant of share awards is linked to the annual bonus process the fair value of the awards is spread over a period 
including the current financial year and the subsequent five years to their release date when the grantee becomes unconditionally 
entitled to the underlying shares. Of the restricted share awards of 14,592,041 as at 30 June 2009 the amount of 10,991,247 were 
granted as part of the Group’s variable compensation process. The fair value of the remaining awards is spread over the period 
from date of grant to the release date.

Dividends are recognised in the accounts in the year in which they are paid, or in the case of a final dividend when approved  
by the shareholders. 
On 15 September 2009 the Board proposed a final dividend of 8.34 pence per share for the year ended 30 June 2009. This has  
not been recognised as a liability of the Group at the year end as it has not yet been approved by shareholders. Based on the  
number of shares in issue at the year end which qualify to receive a dividend, the total amount payable would be £56.7 million 
(2008: £57 .0 million).

An impairment review of goodwill was undertaken at 31 December 2008, in recognition of the extent of market turmoil since  
30 June 2008. In addition the annual impairment review was undertaken at 30 June 2009. No impairment was deemed necessary 
on either occasion.
The recoverable amounts of the business are determined based upon future forecast profitability and cash flow projections.  
The key assumptions on which management has based their projections are the expected fund flows and growth of AuM,  
which determine management and performance fee income. 
The business of the Group is managed as a single unit, with asset allocations, research and other such operational practices 
reflecting the commonality of approach across all fund themes. Therefore, no further split into smaller cash-generating units  
is possible, and the impairment review is conducted for the Group as a whole.
The goodwill balance within the Company at the beginning and end of the year is £4. 1 million and relates to the acquisition of the 
business from ANZ in 1999. Goodwill arising in the Group during the year relates to the acquisition of Dolomite on 3 November 
2008. For further details on this acquisition please refer to note 22.
There has been no gross impairment of goodwill to date either within the Company or the Group.

14 non-current assets and non-current liabilities held-for-sale
Where Group companies inject seed capital into funds operated and controlled by the Group, then the fund is classified as being 
held-for-sale. Typically, if the fund remains under the control of the Group for more than one year from the original investment date  
it will cease to be classified as held-for-sale, and will be consolidated line by line. In determining whether to execute the reclassification, 
the Group will have regard to the proximity of loss of control, and the extent to which consolidation of the fund on a line-by-line 
basis would be material to the presentation of the Group’s financial statements.

The Group’s maximum exposure to credit, liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and price risk in respect of these assets and 
liabilities is represented by their carrying value.
15 f air value of financial instruments
There is no material difference between the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and their 
fair values. 
The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and derivative financial instruments are determined by reference to published 
price quotations.

16 f inancial instrument risk management 
Group
The Group is subject to business and strategy, investment, operational and treasury risk throughout its business as discussed in 
the Business review. Specific areas of financial instrument risk include credit, liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and price risk. 
The effectiveness of the Group’s risk management process is, therefore, critical to its soundness and profitability and considerable 
resources are dedicated to this area.
Risk management is the direct responsibility of the Group’s senior management. The Ashmore Group Risk Management and 
Control department and the Group’s Risk and Compliance Committee (RCC) are responsible for monitoring the overall risk 
environment. The Group has established a control environment that ensures risks are reviewed regularly and that all risk controls 
operating throughout the Group are in accordance with regulatory requirements. In addition as a regulated business the Group  
is responsible for maintaining appropriate capital and performing regular calculations of capital requirements, including the 
development of an internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP), based upon the Financial Services Authority’s 
methodologies under the Capital Requirements Directive. Pillar III disclosures in connection with the ICAAP can be found  
on our website at www.ashmoregroup.com. 
Credit risk
The Group has exposure to credit risk from its normal activities where the risk is that a counterparty will be unable to pay in full 
amounts when due. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of its financial assets.
Financial assets subject to credit risk at are as follows:

Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. 
t rade and other receivables at amortised cost
Financial assets at amortised cost principally comprise fee debtors, which are all less than 90 days old.
Fee debtors arise principally within the Group’s investment management business and amounts are monitored regularly. 
Historically, default levels have been insignificant, and, unless a client has withdrawn funds, there is an ongoing relationship 
between the Group and the client. There is no significant concentration of credit risk in respect of fees owing from clients.
available-for-sale financial assets
Such assets comprise cash and cash equivalents, and debt and equity instruments in seeded funds.
The Group’s cash and cash equivalents are liquid short-term deposits with banks which have credit ratings ranging from 
A to A+ as at 30 June 2009 (2008: AA- to A1+). 
f inancial assets and liabilities held at fair value
Such assets comprise derivative financial instruments with positive and negative fair values.

interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes  
in market interest rates.
The principal interest rate risk is the risk that the Group will sustain a reduction in interest revenue through adverse movements  
in interest rates. This relates to bank deposits held in the ordinary course of business. 
At 30 June 2009, if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher/lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit  
for the year would have been £2.3 million higher/lower (2008: £1.8 million higher/lower), mainly as a result of higher/lower interest 
on average cash balances.

The Group’s revenue is almost entirely denominated in US Dollars, while the Group’s cost base is largely Sterling-based. 
Consequently, the Group has an exposure to movements in the US$/£ exchange rate.
The Group’s policy is to hedge this net foreign exchange exposure by using a combination of forward foreign exchange contracts 
and options for up to two years forward. The Group also sells US Dollars at spot rates when opportunities arise. 
At 30 June 2009, if the US Dollar had strengthened/weakened by 10 cents against Sterling with all other variables held constant, 
profit before tax for the year would have increased/decreased by £15.1 million/£10.8 million respectively (2008: £6.9 million/ 
£6.2 million).
The Group also holds a small number of seed capital investments, as shown on the balance sheet, which are denominated in 
Brazilian Real or US Dollars. Any such seed investments give rise to foreign exchange risk. At 30 June 2009, if the Brazilian Real 
and US Dollar had, in aggregate, strengthened/weakened by 1 per cent against Sterling with all other variables held constant,  
net assets and net revenue for the year would have increased/decreased by £0.3 million/£0.3 million (2008: £0.1 million/£0.2 million). 
price risk
Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of market changes.
The Group’s direct exposure to price risk is in respect of the seed capital investments it holds on its balance sheet. These can  
be either debt or equity instruments, where the Group’s exposure is restricted to the carrying value of the assets or liabilities.  
At 30 June 2009, a 5 per cent movement in the fair value of these investments would have had a £2.0 million (2008: £0.8 million)  
impact on net assets/net revenue.
There is also indirect price risk in connection with the Group’s AuM and its associated management and performance fees. These 
are diversified across a range of investment themes and not correlated to any single market indices in emerging markets. Based  
on the year-end assets under management of U$$24.9 billion, and a sensible medium-term average net management fee rate  
of 1 per cent, a 5 per cent movement in assets under management would have a US$12.5 million impact in management fee 
revenues. However, the profitability impact is likely to be less than this, as cost mitigation actions would apply, including the 
reduction in the variable compensation paid to employees. Performance fee revenues could be reduced to nil in severe market 
conditions, though as with management fees there would also be an associated positive impact on costs.

hedging activities
Included within the realised and unrealised hedging losses of £42.4 million recognised at 30 June 2009 are:
•	 a £4.5 million loss in respect of the unrealised mark-to-market loss on open forward foreign exchange contracts covering  
net management fee income for the financial year ending 30 June 2010;
•	 a £0.4 million gain in respect of foreign exchange options covering net management fee income for the financial year ending  
30 June 201 1; and 
•	 a £38.3 million loss in respect of crystallised forward foreign exchange contracts.
Financial year ending 30 June 2010 forward foreign exchange contracts
These were not designated as hedges at inception, and as such have been valued at the year-end rate of GBP1:1.6458USD with 
the mark-to-market impact already having been recognised in the Consolidated income statement. This loss will be offset by either 
gains on management fees as they crystallise, or hedge contracts as they mature, during the next financial year. The maturity 
profile and the associated loss recognised at 30 June 2009 is shown below:

The options have been assessed as effective cash flow hedges at 30 June 2009. A net unrealised gain arising on these contracts 
of £0.4 million (2008: nil) has been recognised in the Consolidated income statement for the year ended 30 June 2009, being  
the movement in the time value of the options between the date that they were entered into and the year end. The intrinsic value  
of the options will be recognised directly in equity as long as the hedges are assessed as being highly effective, and recognised  
in the income statement as the corresponding hedged cash flows crystallise.

Capital management
Equity as referred to in the Group’s balance sheet is the capital for the business. There are no other assets managed which are 
considered capital of the Group. As referred to above, the Group monitors its regulatory capital in order to meet the financial 
resources requirement of the Financial Services Authority.

interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in 
market interest rates.
The principal interest rate risk is the risk that the Company will sustain a reduction in interest revenue through adverse movements 
in interest rates. This relates to bank deposits held in the ordinary course of business. 
At 30 June 2009, if interest rates had been 200 basis points higher/lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit  
for the year would have been £2.8 million higher/lower (2008: £2.2 million higher/lower), mainly as a result of higher/lower interest 
on cash balances.
The assumption that the fair values of assets and liabilities will not be affected by a change in interest rates was used in the model 
to calculate the effect on post-tax profits.

22 acquisitions 
On 3 November 2008, the Group acquired a 75 per cent stake in Dolomite Capital Management (“Dolomite”). Dolomite is an 
emerging markets focused fund-of-funds manager and independent advisor on emerging market investments based in New York 
and had approximately US$0.1 billion of assets under management at 30 June 2009. In the eight months to 30 June 2009 the 
subsidiary contributed net revenue of £0.4 million. Its profit before tax contribution for the same period was negligible. Had the 
acquisition occurred on 1 July 2008, the impact on the Group’s net revenue for the full period would have been £0.6 million 
accretive, with no impact on the profit before tax.
In addition to the consideration at the time of acquisition, set out below, further provisions existed within the shareholders’ agreement 
for the Group to be able to acquire the remaining equity of Dolomite Capital Limited, using call and put options. The value of both 
types of options was capped and was based on the performance of the underlying business.
The Group restructured its US operations in June 2009, to enable us to consolidate the team with our existing staff and grow  
our overall Ashmore marketing and distribution presence in the United States. As part of this restructure Dolomite became  
a wholly-owned subsidiary, for no additional consideration, resulting in the cancellation of the put and call options. 
Effect of acquisition
The acquisition had the following effect on the Group’s assets and liabilities.

There are no post-balance sheet events for the year ended 30 June 2009.
27 accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements used in preparing the financial statements are continually evaluated and are based upon 
management’s assessment of current and future events. The principal estimates and judgements that have a significant effect  
on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are discussed below:
•  The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment. The recoverable amount is determined based upon value-in-use calculations 
prepared on the basis of management’s assumptions and estimates.
•  The Group assesses the recognition of performance fees to determine whether receipt of the fees is considered probable and  
the amount reliable. The assessment is made using management’s judgement of the circumstances relevant to each 
performance fee entitlement.
•  The calculation of fair value in respect of options requires a number of estimates to derive the fair value, further details of which  
are provided in note 7 above.

Notifying the Company of a change

You should notify Equiniti Registrars  
in writing. 
If you hold shares in joint names, the 
notification to change address must be 
signed by the first-named shareholder. 
You may choose to do this online,  
by logging on to www.shareview.co.uk. 
You will need your shareholder reference

Notifying the Company of a change

You should notify Equiniti Registrars in 
writing of your new name and previous 
name. You should attach a copy of your 
marriage certificate or your change of 
name deed, together with your share 
certificates and any un-cashed dividend 
cheques in your old name, so that the 
Registrar can reissue them.
Dividend payments directly into bank  
or building society accounts
We recommend that all dividend 
payments are made directly into a bank 
or building society account. Dividends are 
paid via BACS, providing tighter security 
and access to funds more quickly. To 
apply for a dividend mandate form, 
contact the Registrar, or you can find one 
by logging on to www.shareview.co.uk 
(under Frequently Asked Questions) or  
by calling the helpline on 0871 384 2030.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
The world around us
Many Western economies are in recession and the stability of the
Eurozone, in particular, is under threat. As a result, 2011 was a year of
depressed financial markets and challenging access to capital.
Politically, dramatic changes are taking place, notably in North Africa.
The magnitude of these changes, in difficult economic circumstances,
presents significant challenges. Against this background, the energy
sector continues to prosper with strength in commodity prices driven by
Asian growth and resilient demand elsewhere. Finding and extracting
large hydrocarbon accumulations, particularly oil, in mature areas is by
definition becoming more challenging. However, with technological
change and through accessing unconventional resources, exemplified
by the shale revolution in North America, the industry is continuing to
respond to consistently strong demand for energy on a global basis.
Premier’s performance
Premier’s achievements in 2011 demonstrate that there is a role for
companies of our size. The successful completion of our two operated
development projects in Asia – commercialising over 100 million barrels
of oil and gas, investing some US$1.6 billion on behalf of ourselves and
our partners and employing at peak over 3,500 staff and contractors –
was a world-class achievement. We will look to maintain and build on
those skills within Premier as we move forward with new operated
development projects.
The new projects in Asia contributed to meeting successfully our 2011
year-end production target of 60 thousand barrels of oil equivalent 
per day (kboepd). Average production for 2011 was 40.4 kboepd (2010:
42.8 kboepd). In common with many other operators in the North Sea,
this was adversely affected by unplanned downtime in a number of our
UK North Sea fields in the early part of the year. I am pleased to report
that UK production recovered well in the second half of the year,
continuing into the early months of 2012. It remains a top priority for our
operations team in Aberdeen not just to maintain production levels, but
to ensure the integrity of our production infrastructure as many fields in
the North Sea move towards the end of their natural life.
Alongside proven operating and development skills, it has never been
more important to maintain the balance sheet strength and liquidity to
finance such projects. Our strong financial position enabled us to deliver
on five acquisitions during the year, adding some 60 million barrels of
reserves and resources and building on our existing presence, particularly
in the North Sea. Our financial performance continues to improve and
the outlook for strong growth in cash flows is robust, even at much
lower oil prices than today. We continue to have good access to capital,
from both the bank and bond markets, to fund future growth.
A letter from Mike Welton
Delivering our Vision… Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  07
In exploration, we are consistently adding reserves and resources on an
annual basis at an average after-tax cost of around US$5 per barrel (bbl).
We are more than replacing our production. In the Natuna Sea in South
East Asia and in the Central North Sea in the UK we have leading
positions which, given our data and knowledge bases, we believe will
translate into further successes. We are constantly reviewing new licence
opportunities in existing areas and in analogous geological plays in new
countries. These will be the source of future growth and potential
upside for our investors.
Governance and the Board
As the group expands, the need for good corporate governance
processes and keen attention to risk management becomes ever more
critical. Consistent with external recommendations, the Board and its
committees pay close attention not just to the future strategy of the
company but also to Board composition and the risk identification and
mitigation process, as well as performance and remuneration policies.
I am grateful for the excellent advice and support received from my
fellow directors during the year on all these matters.
As in previous years, particular attention at Board level has been given
to health, safety and environmental management. The company’s
management systems have been successfully re-certified to OHSAS
18001 and ISO 14001 standards and key performance indicators for
recordable injury frequency and high potential incidents were improved
against the prior year. Nevertheless, we are constantly reminded of the
need for strong processes, continuous vigilance and determination to
learn lessons for the future.
Shareholder returns
Premier’s share price dropped by 26 per cent during 2011 in a poor year
for all equity markets. Following completion of the EnCore acquisition in
January 2012, we have seen a significant recovery. Over the three year
period to 31 December 2011, the shares have seen a growth of 80 per
cent, significantly outperforming the FTSE All Share Oil and Gas
Producers Index.
This outperformance is due to the hard work and skills of our employees,
partners and suppliers. I would like to pay tribute to all of them as we
look forward together to continued growth and success.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Q // What is Premier’s business model and growth strategy?
A // Premier seeks to offer both our investors and our
employees above average growth opportunities within business
units that are themselves good quality businesses. This will be
reflected in a rising production profile from our operations and
development activities. We will continue to set ourselves targets –
75,000 boepd by the end of 2012 and 100,000 boepd in the
medium-term – which are challenging but achievable. We expect
to source further growth from a combination of acquisitions and
organic exploration success. We expect to play a growing role in
the places in which we choose to do business, which in itself will
generate a stream of future opportunities. Over time, we have
greatly widened our access to different sources of capital so that
our financial strength has become a real asset to the business.
Q // What were the highlights of 2011?
A // In 2011, Premier continued to grow through acquisition,
development and our own exploration activities. We have taken our
skills as a development operator in South East Asia, proved them on
new projects and are building up a comparable skill set in the North
Sea. Our exploration programme is focused on areas where we have
a spread of acreage and a deep understanding of the geology. We
are better placed than ever to achieve material resource additions
from our planned programmes.
Key milestones in achieving our growth in 2011 came from our
project teams in Indonesia and Vietnam who achieved excellent
results in bringing two major operated projects on-stream on a
timely basis and in line with original cost projections. This was a big
step forward for our Asian business. Less visibly, but just as valuable
for the future, I believe we have made great strides in a number of
other areas. Our geologists and geophysicists enhanced their
understanding of the petroleum systems in both the Natuna Sea
and the UK Central North Sea, adjacent to existing Premier
discoveries, and this will be reflected in the drilling programmes
established for 2012 and beyond. Our commercial teams in London
and Aberdeen have made great progress on the shape, structure
and schedules for new projects, especially in the North Sea. Our
operations staff have worked tirelessly to ensure that asset integrity,
safety and the environment are at the top of our priority list. All such
efforts are critical to the overall success of the company.

Continued Growth… Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  09
Q // How and where will you expand geographically?
A // The group is well established in the North Sea and in South East Asia. We expect that the majority
of our resources, both personnel and financial, will continue to be directed at these core businesses. We
have the ambition over time to develop a third geographic area of expertise, though only when the right
opportunities emerge and when the skills we already have in subsurface and engineering can be successfully
applied. Leading the way are our new venture teams who are already taking us into new geographies, albeit
in ways which seek to address the challenges of new country entry. In 2011, for example, we obtained two
new exploration licences in offshore Kenya and significantly expanded our acreage portfolio in the Norwegian
sector of the North Sea. Other geographies are under review for 2012.
Q // In 2011, you made a number of acquisitions. Are you looking for future acquisitions?
A // We continually look at potential acquisitions as a way of building up our knowledge of assets in
our core areas, though we are in the fortunate position that our internal growth profile is already strong.
Completed acquisition transactions have typically happened in times of market dislocation, which creates
new opportunities. In 2009, at a low point in the oil price cycle, we completed major acquisitions in the UK
and in Vietnam. In 2011, the commodity markets held up well but the capital markets, especially for smaller
companies, were weak and development finance scarce. Our recent five completed acquisitions, all in the
North Sea, reflected for the most part this opportunity and we are pleased to have added around 60 million
barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe) of reserves and resources to the portfolio at a cost of less than US$8/bbl.
We expect 2012 to be another active year in the acquisition markets as the challenging conditions,
especially in the bank sector, seem destined to continue.
Q // What are the biggest challenges facing Premier going forward?
A // We operate in a highly competitive world where both good quality human and natural resources
are scarce. We have been successful in retaining our people and in building up teams to execute new projects.
Our headcount has doubled from 300 to over 600 in the last four years. Our share-based incentive package
offers good upside to employees if the company performs well but also ties in our employees for up to six years
before this upside is realised. In my experience people enjoy the challenges offered by a growth programme.
On the asset side, continuing access to good quality acreage is critical to the long-term growth of the
company. We constantly review new opportunities around the world which come to us via licensing rounds,
knowledge of our partners’ and competitors’ strategies and through strong government relationships in the
areas in which we operate.
Q // Can Premier continue to build on its successes in the future?
A // I believe that our combination of technical skills and financial strength positions us well for the
future. Our operations in the Natuna Sea and in the UK Central North Sea are very well established and
continue to offer opportunities for further growth. We can see a path to production of 100,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day (boepd) from existing projects in the medium-term. Our portfolio is already positioned
for success beyond that with ongoing developments and an active exploration programme. 10 /  Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements

Chim Sáo
An organic growth asset
Location / Vietnam
PREMIER BROUGHT CHIM SÁO ON-STREAM SAFELY AND ON BUDGET
IN OCTOBER 2011. THE FIELD, WHICH IS THE FIRST OIL FIELD IN THE
NAM CON SON BASIN TO BE DELIVERED, IS PERFORMING AHEAD OF
EXPECTATIONS WITH ADDITIONAL UPSIDE OPPORTUNITIES.
Profile   /  Premier discovered the Chim Sáo oil field in November 2006. The subsequent
drilling programme prompted Premier to proceed rapidly to development, final approval for
which was achieved in November 2008. Rising steel prices caused Premier to opt for a single
central platform with long reach drilling. This resulted in a gross cost saving of US$112 million
against alternative development concepts. The platform jacket and topsides were installed
during 2010 and the conversion of the FPSO was completed in June 2011. The field was brought
on-stream in October 2011, only six years after the initial discovery, and gas exports commenced
in December 2011. Deliverability of Chim Sáo is ahead of expectations and its cargoes are being
sold at a premium to average Dated Brent. To date 12 wells (nine producers and three water
injectors) have been drilled and total drilling cost is expected to come in below budget.
Outlook  /
• Additional upside remains and reserves increasing
– Optimise development of Chim Sáo
– Better reservoir qualities than prognosed
– Successful appraisal of the Oligocene (Cau) at deeper levels
• Chim Sáo North West
– Additional gross resource estimate 13-20 million barrels with further potential upside to
be appraised
– Chim Sáo North West to be tied in to existing facilities
• Tie in of the nearby Dua field to the Chim Sáo facilities by 2014 Phil MacLaurin
Country Manager
The successful and safe
delivery of Chim Sáo
demonstrates our ability
to operate to the highest
standards throughout the
cycle. We now look to
recreate this achievement
with Dua, a tie-back to
Chim Sáo, which achieved
project sanction in
December 2011. We will
also appraise the new
accumulation at Chim
Sáo North West as a near
field tie-back opportunity
in 2012.”

Gajah Baru
Meeting increasing Singapore demand
Location / Indonesia
FIRST GAS PRODUCTION FROM GAJAH BARU WAS ACHIEVED WITHIN
BUDGET IN OCTOBER 2011. VOLUMES FROM THE FIELD CONTINUE TO
INCREASE WITH CURRENT PRODUCTION RATES AVERAGING ~60-90 BBTUD.
THIS MARKS THE SECOND PHASE OF GAS INTO SINGAPORE FROM THE
PREMIER-OPERATED NATUNA SEA BLOCK A.
Profile  /  Premier discovered and successfully appraised the Gajah Baru gas field in 2000 and
2004, respectively. In 2008, we negotiated three further GSAs enabling Gajah Baru gas to be
sold into the Singaporean and Indonesian domestic markets. The development plan was
approved in 2008 and a second tender for the EPCI contract was completed in March 2009
(gross cost saving of US$100 million). 2011 saw the CPP connected to the WHP on schedule and
on budget and the gas export equipment tied into the WNTS pipeline. The five development
well programme was completed in February 2011 and provided in excess of 200 BBtud of gas
deliverability. Gas exports from Gajah Baru commenced in October 2011. Volumes continue to
ramp up towards 90 BBtud. On completion of a Gas Swap, an additional 40 BBtud will be
delivered from Gajah Baru at Indonesian domestic prices.
Outlook  /
• Next phase of development projects being worked on:
– Anoa Phase 4 sanctioned and EPCI contract awarded
– Project sanction for Pelikan and Naga expected imminently
• Returned to exploration on block:
– Anoa Deep, which spudded in February 2012, was successful, testing gas with a flow rate
of 17 mmscfd 
– Biawak Besar is currently drilling with results expected in April 2012
• Total sales capacity from Block A will increase to 400 BBtud over time  Roberto Lorato
President Premier Indonesia
Gajah Baru has the plant
capacity to produce in
excess of 200 BBtud,
significantly more than
contracted quantities.
This, along with our
pipeline of future projects
on Natuna Sea Block A,
will put us in a strong
position to benefit from
rising demand from
Singapore and Indonesia.”

Catcher
One of the largest North Sea discoveries in recent years
Location / North Sea
PREMIER HAS INCREASED ITS STAKE IN THE IMPORTANT CATCHER
PROJECT TO 50 PER CENT AND HAS TAKEN OVER OPERATORSHIP .
DEVELOPMENT STUDIES ARE WELL ADVANCED AND A DECISION ON THE
CONCEPTUAL DESIGN IS EXPECTED DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2012.
Profile  /  Premier acquired an interest in the Catcher area as a result of its 2009 Oilexco
acquisition. The Catcher discovery in 2010 pointed to the presence of much lighter oil than
anticipated and proved that hydrocarbons could migrate to the outer margins of the Central
North Sea. Follow up wells, 28/9-2, 3 and 4, were drilled between January 2011 and March 2011
discovering the Varadero and Burgman fields and appraising Catcher North. The six penetrations
drilled to date have estimated discovered reserves in the order of 80 million barrels. In October
2011, Premier made a recommended acquisition of EnCore for cash with a share alternative. The
acquisition completed in January 2012 with shareholders representing 93.5 per cent of EnCore
shares electing to take Premier shares. Operatorship of Catcher was transferred to Premier and
Premier’s working interest increased from 35 per cent to 50 per cent.
Outlook  /
• Formal concept selection, which is expected in the first half of 2012, will be followed by further
engineering studies on the chosen concept ahead of development approval by year-end
• Additional upside remains on the block with further exploration planned:
– Carnaby will be drilled in April 2012 with results expected in May 2012
– The Coaster prospect on the adjoining block to Catcher
– Additional prospects on the Catcher Block include Bonneville, Cougar, Rapide and Rocket
• Premier plans to pursue the knowledge it has acquired from its activities in the Catcher area
to other margin plays in the UK Central North Sea Neil Hawkings
Operations Director
We have made
significant progress
on the engineering
and screening studies
and concept selection
is expected imminently.
As operator, we are
now in a much stronger
position to advance
the development of
the Catcher area’s
discovered resources.”

Wytch Farm
Increased stake in one of our long-term assets
Location / UK
IN DECEMBER 2011, PREMIER ACQUIRED AN ADDITIONAL 17.7 PER CENT
STAKE IN THE PRODUCING WYTCH FARM FIELD AND ITS UNDEVELOPED
BEACON SATELLITE. THE TRANSACTION HAS ADDED APPROXIMATELY
2,500 BOEPD NET PRODUCTION WITH RESERVES UPSIDE IN BOTH WYTCH
FARM AND BEACON.
Profile  /  In 1984, Premier purchased a 12.38 per cent interest in the onshore oilfield at Wytch
Farm in Dorset. This acquisition had a significant impact on Premier’s reserve base and cash flow.
In December 2011, Premier completed its acquisition of an additional 17.7 per cent interest in
the Wytch Farm and Beacon fields, taking its interest in these assets to 30.1 per cent. Perenco
also acquired operatorship of Wytch Farm in December 2011. Drilling activity was suspended
by the previous operator BP in 2009 but has recently restarted under Perenco’s operatorship.
Premier believes that sufficient reserves-adding opportunities exist to sustain an active rig
programme to 2017 and beyond. Drilling activity will target infill locations in the producing areas
as well as undeveloped satellite accumulations.
Outlook  /
• Acquisition adds approximately 12 mmboe of net reserves and 2,500 boepd of net
production in 2012
• Active drilling programme
– Infill drilling in producing reservoirs to accelerate production and optimise recovery
– Bringing into production of satellite discoveries onshore
– Development planning for the significant Beacon satellite field offshore
• Long-term production and reserves upside through optimised waterflood management in
producing fields Nigel Wilson

Review
Q // What does Corporate Social Responsibility mean
to Premier?
A // It is about doing the right thing as well as managing
risk and protecting our reputation. It’s about investing
in the community and people. IT IS OUR POLICY TO SUPPORT SOCIAL INVESTMENT THAT CONTRIBUTES
TO THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS OF THE COMMUNITIES
AND COUNTRIES WHERE WE OPERATE. This means working in partnership with
professional social development organisations, government agencies and local NGOs to ensure
our investment addresses relevant and material issues in a rigorous manner with positive impacts
on society. Our investment is increasingly focused on the development of local capacity and
educational initiatives that deliver social and economic returns for both local communities and
host governments. We also contribute to local infrastructures and disaster relief initiatives.
Recent examples include:
• Indonesia: Premier has now built a total of six kindergartens that enrol around 400 children in
six remote villages in the Anambas regency. Premier has also developed several infrastructure
projects at the request of the Anambas local government, including construction of public
health centres, libraries and school classrooms. Two of the multi-functional buildings we
supported in 2010 were completed and handed over to local government in 2011.
• UK: In 2011, Premier partnered with the Cyrenians, a charity providing a range of services for
homeless people, to refurbish its training suite and kitchen facilities in Aberdeen. The centre
is used for residential courses to help reintegrate homeless individuals into society. The
centre offers computer training and access for those looking to develop their resumes, use
e-mail facilities and apply for jobs.
• Vietnam: Our community investment programme continues to be guided by the national
socio-economic plan, with goals and programmes related to economic growth, poverty
reduction, job creation, education and vocational skills development. In 2011, for the
second year in a row, Premier Oil Vietnam received the Saigon Times Top 40s Award for
environmental excellence and CSR programmes. We also formalised our commitment to
provide adolescents with enhanced vocational/employment opportunities by researching
and publishing a directory of vocational training institutions in Ho Chi Minh City that offer
free or subsidised training and guidance on career choices to disadvantaged young people.
Premier Oil Vietnam has a long-term partnership with Friends for Street Children (FFSC) in
Ho Chi Minh City. In 2011, in celebration of first oil from the Chim Sáo field, we announced
our intention to fund the FFSC Binh Tho Development Centre for the life of the Chim Sáo
field. The centre provides education, vocational training and healthcare to 145 disadvantaged
children from poor families, and focuses mainly on equipping younger children to integrate
into junior public high schools. FFSC also supports older children to find meaningful and
respectful employment in roles such as accounting, photography, sales and skilled factory
and office work. Paul Dennis

OPERATIONS REVIEW
Production, development and reserves
Average working interest production for the full-year was 40.4 kboepd
(2010: 42.8 kboepd). Our North Sea business faced challenging
conditions due to extended unplanned downtime on key producing
assets at the Balmoral, Scott and Wytch Farm fields. However, the year-
end target of 60 kboepd was achieved following the return to full
production at the UK fields and the start-up of new Asian projects
during the fourth quarter. Production in other areas remained steady,
with strong gas demand and good production performance in both
Pakistan and our existing fields in Indonesia.

Major milestones were achieved on our operated development
projects. The Chim Sáo development in Vietnam was completed and
first oil production was achieved safely and on budget through the
Lewek EMAS floating production, storage and offtake vessel (FPSO),
with reservoir and well performance exceeding expectations. In
Indonesia, the Gajah Baru development was completed with successful
installation of a new central processing platform on schedule and
budget. The gas export equipment was tied into the existing subsea
West Natuna Transportation System pipeline to deliver gas to
Singapore. On the same block the Anoa Phase 4 project, to upgrade
compression facilities and increase production capacity, has been
sanctioned. The project will be completed in 2013 accessing a further
200 billion cubic feet (bcf) of reserves for export.
Development activities continued on the Huntington field in the UK with
the completion of Phase 1 of the subsea installation and drilling of one
injection and three production wells. The upgrade of the Voyageur
FPSO is now being progressed and the operator is expecting first oil in
the fourth quarter of 2012. The East and West Rochelle subsea fields in
the UK North Sea were unitised (Premier equity 15 per cent) in order to
facilitate a fast track development programme via the Scott platform
host production facility. The field achieved final project sanction with the
Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) approving the field
development plan in the second half of 2011. Subsea facilities fabrication
and offshore construction on the host Scott platform is progressing to
schedule with first gas and condensate anticipated in the fourth quarter
of 2012.

As at 31 December 2011 proven and probable (2P) reserves, on a working interest basis,
were 284 mmboe (2010: 261 mmboe). On a proforma basis the EnCore acquisition,
completed in early January 2012, increased reserves to 296 mmboe, giving a reserve
replacement ratio of 333 per cent.

Upon completion of the EnCore acquisition, the percentage of liquids in total reserves
increased from 35 per cent at the end of 2010 to 51 per cent. The equivalent volume of 2P
reserves on an entitlement basis amounted to 263.8 mmboe (2010: 222.0 mmboe) based on
a price assumption equal to the Dated Brent forward curve in 2012 and 2013 and US$75/bbl
in ‘real’ terms thereafter (2010: fixed price of US$75/bbl).
Booked reserve additions were mainly due to the acquisition of EnCore (additional 15 per
cent equity in Catcher area), progress with the Solan field and the additional equity acquired
in Wytch Farm. Other reserves additions included exploration successes at Burgman in the
UK and at Kadanwari in Pakistan. Proforma contingent resources at year-end were increased
to 231 mmboe (2010: 227 mmboe).
Asia
Premier successfully completed the Chim Sáo and Gajah Baru projects achieving first oil
and gas in the fourth quarter, driving the company’s year-end production run-rate to
60 kboepd. In Indonesia, we continue to develop our gas positions and are accelerating
development of the Pelikan and Naga projects set to achieve sanction in the first half of
2012. In Vietnam, significant progress has been achieved in plans to develop the Dua field
which is also expected to be sanctioned in the first half of 2012. 22 /  Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements
OPERATIONS REVIEW (continued)
Indonesia
During 2011, the Premier-operated Natuna Sea Block A sold an overall gross average of
161 billion British thermal units per day (BBtud) (2010: 160 BBtud), including rates in excess
of 200 BBtud as Gajah Baru came on-stream. The Anoa facility delivered 5 per cent over its
contractual market share at nearly 42 per cent. The non-operated Kakap field contributed a
further 42 BBtud (gross) (2010: 54 BBtud). Gross liquids production from the Block A Anoa
field increased by over a third to an average 2,400 barrels of oil per day (bopd) (2010: 1,758
bopd) with a further 3,400 bopd (2010: 2,993 bopd) from Kakap. Overall, net production from
Indonesia amounted to 11,450 boepd (2010: 11,650 boepd).
The Gajah Baru development involved the successful installation in 2011 of a new central
processing platform connected to a new wellhead platform on schedule and budget. The
gas export equipment was tied into the existing subsea West Natuna Transportation System
pipeline to deliver additional gas to Singapore. During the year, five development wells were
successfully completed, providing in excess of 200 BBtud of gas deliverability from this new
facility.
Volumes from the Gajah Baru field are being supplied in accordance with the second Gas
Sales Agreement (GSA2). Good progress has also been made on a swap agreement (GSA5)
under which additional volumes of Gajah Baru gas supplied to Singapore will be swapped
with existing supplies from Sumatra to Singapore. These Sumatra volumes will be re-directed
to the Indonesian domestic gas market. The relevant agreements are expected to be
completed shortly and physical supplies of up to 40 BBtud (gross) should commence in the
second quarter of this year. GSA5 will replace gas previously contracted to be supplied to
Batam Island, Indonesia, under GSA3 and GSA4 until at least December 2013, when GSA3
and GSA4 contracts are expected to commence.
On the Anoa field, workovers were performed on the A7 and A11 wells. These workovers
added a further 30 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd) of gas deliverability. A new
oil well (A22) was successfully completed which added around 1,500 bopd of incremental oil
production. A three-well drilling campaign on the Anoa field’s West Lobe platform has
progressed well and included the discovery of new reserves in the deeper Lama reservoir
below Anoa.
In order to upgrade the compression facilities and to increase production capacity on the
producing Anoa field, a major ‘brown-field’ development project has been sanctioned,
extending the assumed field plateau and developing some 200 bcf of gross field reserves.
This project, known as Anoa Phase 4, will be completed in 2013.
Elsewhere on the block, tendering commenced for the engineering, procurement,
construction and installation (EPCI) contract for two wellhead platforms and connecting
pipelines for the development of the Pelikan and Naga fields. Final project sanction and
contract award is expected in mid-2012, to provide future supply to existing Singapore and
Indonesia sales contracts.
On the non-operated Block A in Aceh a fully termed production sharing contract (PSC),
extending the licence term for 20 years, became effective from 1 September 2011. Work
continued on the gas development project in support of two firm GSAs. However, the EPCI
contract for the facilities will be re-tendered and first gas is now scheduled for 2015. Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  23
Vietnam
First oil production from the Chim Sáo oil field was achieved safely and on budget in October,
followed by the commencement of gas export in early December. By year-end, close to
2 million barrels had already been produced from six production wells. A further three
production wells will be available to come on-stream in early 2012 when the four well water
injection system will also commence. Further valuable opportunities have been identified in
the Chim Sáo area. A well deepened into the Oligocene directly beneath the main field
proved an estimated 17 metres of net hydrocarbon-bearing pay, and an additional well to be
drilled in early 2012 will accelerate production from a shallow reservoir which has larger
reserves than initially evaluated.
The CS-N2P well, a development production well for the Chim Sáo project, intersected the
shallow part of a previously undrilled fault terrace to the north west of the Chim Sáo field.
The well encountered a 20 metre oil column in an independent closure within good quality
Upper Dua sandstones. The plan is to further appraise this new accumulation in 2012 as a
near-field tie-back opportunity.
In December the Government of Vietnam approved the outline development plan for the
Dua field and orders were placed for the equipment required to develop Dua as a tie-back
to Chim Sáo. We are targeting full production from Dua in early 2014.
North Sea
Our North Sea business unit continued to grow with the acquisition of EnCore Oil plc
(which held an additional 15 per cent in the Catcher area) and the purchase of an additional
17.7 per cent equity in Wytch Farm. The development portfolio has moved forward
significantly with the Huntington field targeting first oil and the Rochelle area achieving
project sanction for first gas during 2012. Significant concept engineering work was
completed on newly acquired projects, with the Solan project achieving Premier Board
sanction in March 2012.
Production performance in the first half of 2011 was hampered by downtime on key
producing assets. These maintenance issues have been resolved and Premier is now seeing
a stronger production performance from existing fields in 2012. 24 /  Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements
OPERATIONS REVIEW (continued)
UK
2011 production net to Premier was 10,300 boepd (2010: 15,500 boepd). Production was
negatively affected by extended unplanned downtime on key producing assets. The Balmoral
area fields were shut-in in the first quarter due to topside integrity issues and in mid-year due
to a subsea leak. The non-operated Wytch Farm field was shut-in during January due to a
flow line leak which occurred late in 2010 giving rise to a full pipeline integrity study. Production
from the non-operated Scott field was restricted in the first quarter due to a fracture in the
gas export line which required restricted production from high gas/oil ratio wells to comply
with the gas flare consent. Production from the Balmoral area improved in the second half of
2011 as the immediate issues that affected our production performance in the first half of the
year were resolved. The December 2011 B-Block production rate was significantly better at
around 7,500 boepd (net to Premier) compared to the 2011 full-year average of 3,750 boepd.
The non-operated Kyle field contributed strong production until gale force winds in
December damaged the mooring system of the host Banff FPSO production facility, forcing
it 270 metres off location and causing damage to the Banff field subsea risers, umbilicals and
possibly the FPSO turret. The damage is currently being assessed by the operator of Banff
but it is likely that the Kyle field will be shut-in until mid-2013. Premier is currently processing
insurance claims under its business interruption and property damage policies. 
Several significant acquisitions were negotiated in 2011, the most significant of which being
the purchase of EnCore Oil plc which included 15 per cent equity and operatorship of the
Catcher area. Premier now owns 50 per cent of the Catcher area and is therefore in a strong
position to progress the development of the area’s discovered resources towards first oil in
2015. Development studies are well under way and a decision on the conceptual design is
targeted for the first half of 2012. In addition to Catcher, Premier acquired additional licences
via the EnCore acquisition, including the Cladhan discovery and the Coaster prospect. Premier
agreed to sell its newly acquired 16.6 per cent equity interest in Cladhan for US$54 million
and farm down 50 per cent of the acquired 100 per cent equity in the Coaster prospect on a
promoted basis. The sale of Cladhan was completed in March 2012.
Acquisition of an additional 17.7 per cent equity in the Wytch Farm producing asset was
completed in late December at a final cost of US$90 million, increasing Premier’s equity to
30.1 per cent of remaining reserves and adding approximately 2,500 boepd of net production
in 2012.
A new pre-development asset was acquired by the purchase of a 60 per cent equity in the
Solan field (P164, Block 205/26a) which is located west of Shetland. Premier was appointed
as development operator in January 2012. The upfront acquisition cost was US$10 million,
with Premier providing a carry and financing package to the prior owner during the
development phase. The Solan project received internal Premier approval in March 2012 and
is expected to receive DECC development sanction approvals shortly. The field is expected
to produce around 42 million barrels following first oil in 2014 with capital expenditure of
around US$850 million.
Premier also exercised an option to become the operator of the Fyne field with a 39.9 per
cent equity stake, in return for providing a carry through ongoing exploration and appraisal
work. The results of the nearby Erne discovery well, drilled in the fourth quarter of 2011, and
the East Fyne appraisal well, completed in 2012, are currently being evaluated by the joint
venture partners. However, at this stage, potential developments in the Greater Fyne area do
not meet the company’s economic thresholds.
Significant progress was achieved on other development assets. The Phase 1 subsea
installation for the Huntington field has been successfully completed and one injection and
three production wells have been drilled with production rates testing at over 10,000 bopd
per well. Earlier schedule slippage on the Voyageur FPSO was addressed by a change in
ownership of the vessel. The FPSO upgrade is now progressing in Norway and the operator
is expecting first oil during the fourth quarter. Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  25
The East and West Rochelle subsea fields were unitised (Premier equity 15 per cent) to
facilitate the fast track Rochelle development programme via the Scott platform host
production facility. A processing tariff was agreed with the Scott owners and initial Rochelle
modifications were made to the Scott topside facility during the year. The development
programme has made good progress towards first gas from Rochelle in November 2012.
The subsea fabrication work is on schedule and drilling rigs have been contracted to drill the
Rochelle development wells this summer.
The Caledonia field redevelopment project, close to the Balmoral area, made progress
during 2011 and is now part of a project to bring fuel gas to Balmoral. Project sanction is
expected later in 2012 for first oil and gas in 2014.
Norway
Progress has been made on the Bream development during 2011. After engineering
evaluation of a number of different alternatives, the selected development concept is an
FPSO and subsea wells with artificial lift. A specific FPSO has been identified and front end
engineering studies are being conducted for both this vessel and the associated subsea
systems and wells. A project sanction decision will be taken after the engineering studies and
FPSO contract negotiations are completed in the second quarter of 2012. A licence extension
until February 2013 has been granted. The first oil date for the field would be late 2015.
The Frøy project made a technical concept selection in the first quarter of 2011. However, the
operator decided not to continue the project in its current form for strategic reasons. Further
work has been completed during the year on a potential area development, which would take
resources from a number of fields within a 10-20km distance to a central processing hub.
Middle East, Africa and Pakistan
Natural decline in gas production in Pakistan was more than offset by ongoing infield
development, exploration successes and compression upgrades. Oil production in Mauritania
also remained stable. While the focus has been on enhancing the value of our Pakistan
producing assets, we continue to build our exploration portfolio elsewhere in the region. 26 /  Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements
Pakistan
Average net to Premier production in Pakistan during 2011 was 15,100 boepd, marginally
higher than in 2010 (14,900 boepd).
Net to Premier, the Qadirpur field averaged 3,750 boepd (2010: 3,550 boepd). The increased
production was the result of the wellhead compression project coming on-stream at the end
of 2010. Work is in progress for the installation of two front end compressors by September
2012 in order to maintain production levels. The development extended reach wells (ERW)
QP-42 and QP-43 have been successfully drilled, completed and tied in to production during
2011, while drilling of QP-44 (also ERW) is in progress. Two centrifugal compressors for the
compression and re-cycling of permeate gas (a side stream) were commissioned in July and
October 2011. This has minimised the flaring of permeate gas and resulted in a corresponding
increase of sales gas (25-30 mmscfd, gross).
Average production net to Premier from the Kadanwari field was 2,050 boepd (2010: 
1,750 boepd) and included increased contributions from successful exploration and
development wells. 
The Zamzama field averaged 5,800 boepd net to Premier (2010: 6,050 boepd). The decrease
in production was primarily due to natural decline. Front end compression was commissioned
in July. Subsurface studies were conducted during the year, following which two infill wells
(Zam-8 and Zam-9) are now planned to be drilled in the second half of 2012, while an
additional infill well (Zam-10) is under consideration for drilling in the first quarter of 2013.
The Bhit/Badhra fields produced 3,500 boepd net to Premier (2010: 3,550 boepd). The slight
decrease in production was because the field’s annual maintenance programme, originally
scheduled to be carried out in the second half of 2010, was deferred to April 2011. The Bhit-
13 development well was successfully drilled and completed in the second half of 2011 and
was tied in to facilities in January 2012. The installation and commissioning of a wellhead
compressor at the Badhra gas field was successfully completed at the end of 2011.
Mauritania
In Mauritania, 2011 working interest production from the Chinguetti field averaged 650 bopd
(2010: 700 bopd) with the decline rate continuing to be lower than expected.
Negotiations between the government and the joint venture partners have been completed
for extensions to PSC A and PSC B. Their respective exploration areas have been merged
into a new PSC, C-10, in which Premier holds a 6.23 per cent working interest. The
undeveloped discoveries (Banda, Tiof and Tevet) in PSC A and PSC B will continue to be
held by joint venture partners for up to 18 months while development studies are
undertaken. Potential gas sales arrangements for Banda are currently under discussion.
OPERATIONS REVIEW (continued) Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  27
EXPLORATION REVIEW
The near-term goal for exploration within Premier is to add 200 mmboe
of net 2P reserves by 2015. This is being achieved by focusing on
geographies and geological themes in which Premier has demonstrable
knowledge, skills and expertise namely in rift basins of South East Asia,
the North Sea and Africa, together with frontal fold belt provinces as
exemplified by our asset base in Pakistan. Since the goal was set in 2009,
70 mmboe of reserves and resources have been added which, with
further evaluation and appraisal, could rise to over 100 mmboe. The
programme is therefore on track to meet its target.
In 2011, Premier participated in 21 exploration and appraisal wells, of
which 12 were successful, an overall success rate of 57 per cent. The
most notable successes were in the UK Central North Sea and the Nam
Con Son Basin in Vietnam. In Vietnam, the 2009 Cá Rˆ o `ng – Do
?
discovery
in Block 07/03 was successfully appraised with oil, gas and condensate
being encountered. The gas and condensate was found in a deeper
reservoir sequence than the oil and this opens up a new play fairway
within Premier’s acreage in the Nam Con Son Basin. In the UK Central
North Sea the discovery at Burgman continued the successful
exploration drilling on the Catcher licence, UK Block 28/9.
Premier also explores for near-field resources capable of being tied
back to its existing infrastructure. In Pakistan, three near-field
exploration wells encountered gas in untested fault block compartments
within the Kadanwari field area and, in Vietnam, oil was discovered in a
previously untested trap immediately north west of the Chim Sáo field
on Block 12W.
Premier continues to apply the most advanced seismic interpretation
techniques in maturing its lead and prospect inventory to drillable status
and, in 2011, acquired new 3D seismic data in the Catcher licence and
surrounding acreage. On non-operated acreage, a new 3D survey was
acquired in Norway in the Blåbaer licence, and 2D and 3D seismic data
was acquired in Kenya.
2011 was a significant year for new acreage capture with a total of 25
licences being secured by year-end, amounting to a net acreage gain of
3,885km
2
. A total of 12 licences were acquired in the UK Central North
Sea and two in Ireland, in the Celtic Sea, via the EnCore acquisition. In
addition, four new blocks were offered for award through EnCore as
part of the deferred 26th Round awards in early January 2012 – three of
these are in the Central North Sea and one is in the Solent.
In Norway, Premier acquired two new blocks in February 2011 as a result
of the 2010 APA awards. In the latter half of 2011, three licences in the
Norwegian portion of the Central North Sea were acquired from Nexen
for a cost of US$5.5 million. Early in 2012, Premier was also awarded
equity in four new licences via the 2011 APA Licence Round, three
licences in the North Sea and one offshore mid-Norway. All acreage
awards in Norway were acquired on a drill or drop option basis and the
target is to deliver prospects from this new portfolio for drilling in the
2013/2014 time frame.

EXPLORATION REVIEW (continued)
In Mauritania, the exploration PSC extension was signed and ratified in 2011, resulting in a
new PSC. The new PSC, in which Premier holds a 6.23 per cent equity interest, has a gross
area of 10,725km
2
. The plan is to drill the first of two exploration wells on this new PSC in the
latter half of 2012.
Additional acreage was secured in East Africa via Premier’s entry into two new PSCs, offshore
Kenya. Offshore East Africa was an industry focus in 2011 with the discovery of significant
resources offshore Mozambique and Tanzania. Premier’s acreage offers the potential to
extend these successful plays northwards into offshore Kenya.
Premier plans to drill between 15 and 20 exploration and appraisal wells in 2012, including a
further exploration well on the UK Catcher Block and two wells, Coaster and Spaniards, on
acreage acquired through the EnCore acquisition. In Norway, the Luno II well is planned for
the fourth quarter and, in Asia, the appraisal of the north west Chim Sáo discovery will take
place, as well as four exploration wells in Indonesia. 
Asia
Indonesia
On the Premier-operated Tuna PSC, exploration wells Gajah Laut Utara and Belut Laut were
drilled to test the Miocene and Oligocene potential of two prospects on the block. Gajah
Laut Utara spudded in May 2011 and was followed by Belut Laut which spudded in July. Both
wells encountered good oil and gas shows in the Oligocene section, proving the existence
of a working petroleum system in both of these previously undrilled sub-basins. Post-well
studies will continue into 2012 with further drilling in the Nam Con Son Basin planned after
integration of the 2011 results.
On Natuna Sea Block A, a block-wide prospect inventory review was carried out to
characterise the remaining exploration potential on the block. Two exploration wells, Anoa
Deep (WL-5X) and Biawak Besar, were scheduled for drilling in early 2012. In February 2012,
it was announced that the Anoa Deep well had successfully encountered some 300 feet of
fractured Lama Formation sandstone, which tested gas at a rate of 17 mmscfd from a 112
feet interval.
In North Sumatra, preparations are at an advanced stage for the drilling of the Matang-1
exploration well during 2012 on Block A Aceh.
Planning and preparation has continued on the non-operated Buton Block, for the drilling of
the Benteng-1 exploration well, which is now scheduled to drill in the first half of 2012.
Vietnam
Following the exploration discovery at Cá Rˆ o `ng – Do
?
(CRD) in Block 07/03, Premier drilled and
tested the CRD-2X appraisal well into the Oligocene sands that had not been tested by the
discovery well. Drill stem tests of the hydrocarbon bearing sands in the Oligocene section
flowed gas and condensate at potentially commercial rates, and the well was then side-
tracked to provide further data on the distribution of hydrocarbons in the Miocene sands.
Evaluation of the CRD discovery and the surrounding exploration acreage continued
throughout the year.
The high risk Qua Mit Vang well, drilled in Block 104-109/05, was plugged and abandoned
after flowing gas with 99 per cent carbon dioxide from fractured basement rock, with well
costs substantially carried via a farminee.
In Block 12W, two development wells drilled into a fault terrace to the north west of the Chim
Sáo field proved the presence of oil in this previously undrilled area, encountering columns of
15 and 89 metres of oil bearing sands within good quality Upper Dua sandstones. A dedicated
appraisal well will be drilled into this discovery in 2012. Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  29

Premier continued its success in the Catcher area licence P1430, Block 28/9 with discoveries
at Burgman and Catcher North in 2011, both of which will contribute to a Catcher area
development plan. The joint venture also acquired 455km
2
3D seismic data across Block 28/9
and 190km
2
3D data on the surrounding open acreage.
Premier became operator of Central Fyne in May 2011 with a 39.9 per cent equity interest by
exercising a farm-in option to drill the East Fyne well in licence P077, Block 21/28a. Premier
also agreed to participate in the Erne exploration well in nearby licence P1875, Block 21/29d.
The Erne well was drilled in December and was suspended as a potential tie-back to any
future developments in the Greater Fyne area. Subsequent to year-end, the East Fyne
appraisal well was also drilled. Despite encountering oil and gas-bearing sands, the well was
plugged and abandoned. The results of the wells are currently being incorporated into the
plans for the Greater Fyne area by the partnership group.
The Bluebell prospect on P1466, Block 15/24c, was farmed down from a Premier 100 per
cent equity position to a farminee who funded 67.67 per cent of the well cost in return for a
40 per cent interest. Post year-end, it was announced that the Palaeocene target
encountered excellent sand quality but was water wet.
Norway
During the year, two wells were drilled on the PL378 licence which contains the 2009
Grosbeak discovery. The first well, an exploration well on the Gnatcatcher prospect, was dry.
The second well, an appraisal on the Grosbeak discovery, delivered mixed results. The
primary bore was on prognosis and confirmed the oil water contact seen in the discovery
well. The subsequent side-track came in deep with the target sands penetrated below the
contact. The partnership is now focusing on commercialising Grosbeak, together with other
discoveries in the nearby area.
Premier drilled an operated exploration well on the southern segment of the Gardrofa
prospect in licence PL406 in the third quarter of 2011. The well was plugged and abandoned
as a dry hole.
Premier made good progress in building its portfolio in 2011, with significant new acreage
awards and acquisitions. Premier was awarded two licences early in the year from the 2010
APA Licence Round: one, operated in the Central North Sea (PL567), on which the work
programme comprises seismic reprocessing; and the second, PL378B, as protection acreage
to the PL378 Grosbeak licence. Further additions were captured in the third quarter when a
transaction to acquire three operated exploration blocks in the North Sea was agreed with
Nexen. Two of these blocks, PL539 and PL566S are close to PL567.
An application was submitted for four blocks in the 2011 APA Licence Round and, in January
2012, the Ministry notified that this had been successful, with four new licences being offered
for award. Three of these licences are in the Central North Sea and one is in mid-Norway. 30 /  Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements
Middle East, Africa and Pakistan
Pakistan
Three exploration wells (K-25 Dir-A, K-27, and K-28) were drilled in 2011 in the Kadanwari
Lease. The Kadanwari K-25 Dir-A well tested 4 mmscfd but, due to tight reservoir conditions,
the decision on whether to tie-in this well for production is still pending. However, both K-27
and K-28 exploration wells tested at high flow rates (up to 50 mmscfd in K-27 and
approximately 30 mmscfd in K-28). The K-27 well was tied in to the system in early March
2012 and is expected to add around 8 bcf of reserves, net to Premier. The K-28 well, together
with the K-30 well, which was successfully drilled in early 2012, will be tied in by mid-year
2012 to produce at maximum available plant capacity.
Egypt
The award of the South Darag Block in the Gulf of Suez is awaiting formal government
ratification having been delayed by the Egyptian parliamentary election process.
Premier farmed into the non-operated North Red Sea Block 1 in December 2010, taking a
20 per cent interest. The NRS-2 (Cherry) exploration well was drilled to a target depth of
5,200 metres. The well encountered hydrocarbon shows whilst drilling, but failed to intersect
reservoir quality sandstones. Geological studies are continuing to assess further prospectivity
on the block.
Kenya
In May 2011, Premier made an entry into Kenya with the signing of two PSCs for offshore
exploration blocks L10A and L10B. A 3D seismic data acquisition programme was completed
ahead of schedule at year-end and a 2D programme was completed on 15 January 2012.
Processing and interpretation will take place in 2012 with exploration drilling provisionally
scheduled for 2013.
SADR
Premier’s exploration rights in the Daora, Haouza, Mahbes and Mijek blocks in the Saharawi
Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) remain under force majeure while awaiting resolution of
sovereignty under a United Nations mandated process. Premier extended its acreage
position in the SADR by gaining the Laguara Block as part of the EnCore acquisition.
EXPLORATION REVIEW (continued) Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  31
FINANCIAL REVIEW
Economic and business background
Oil prices further strengthened during 2011 due to supply concerns and
the volatile political situation in the Middle East. Brent crude prices
averaged US$111.3/bbl for the year, against US$79.5/bbl in 2010.
Premier’s portfolio of crudes sells at an average of US$1.5/bbl premium
to Brent. Given the timing of our crude oil liftings, average actual
realisations (pre-hedge) for the year were US$111.9/bbl (2010:
US$79.7/bbl). After taking into account the effect of long-term hedging
contracts, the average oil price realised for 2011 was US$89.6/bbl (2010:
US$78.3/bbl).
In Indonesia, 2011 has seen continuing good production performance
from Natuna Sea Block A coupled with strong demand for gas from
Singapore. Under the first Gas Sales Agreement (GSA1), out of a total
Singapore demand of 364 BBtud (2010: 355 BBtud), gross sales from the
Anoa field for the year averaged 152 BBtud, a share of approximately
42 per cent of deliveries against a contractual share of 36.9 per cent.
In October, gas production commenced from the Gajah Baru field.
Under the second Gas Sales Agreement (GSA2), volumes at Gajah Baru
are continuing to increase with current production rates of around
60-90 BBtud (gross). 
In Vietnam, first oil from the Chim Sáo field was achieved in October
2011 with gas exports commencing in December. Reservoir and well
performance has exceeded expectations, though some topside and
marine system facility issues remain to be resolved. Excellent pricing
has been achieved for oil cargoes sold in 2011, averaging in excess
of US$5.50/bbl over Brent prices.
In the UK, production from the Balmoral area improved in the second
half of 2011, as the immediate issues that affected our production
performance in the first half of the year were resolved. A good
production result was achieved from the Scott area and Kyle fields.
In Pakistan, natural gas is a critical component of the country’s energy
needs, meeting around 47 per cent of total energy requirements. Total
domestic gas production has remained at around 4 bcf per day, with
demand continuing to grow at around 10 per cent per annum due to
population growth and usage of natural gas as vehicle fuel. This has
created an increased shortfall of gas resulting in supply shortages in the
country. With significant gas reserves remaining, we are well placed to
maintain or increase production through front end compression projects
and new development drilling. 
Income statement
Production in 2011, on a working interest basis, averaged 40.4 kboepd
(2010: 42.8 kboepd). On an entitlement basis, which under the terms
of our PSCs allows for additional government take at higher oil prices,
production was 37.7 kboepd (2010: 38.3 kboepd). Working interest gas
production averaged 153 mmscfd (2010: 156 mmscfd) during the year,
or approximately 65 per cent of total production. Average gas prices
for the group were US$8.51 per thousand standard cubic feet (mscf)
By Tony Durrant Finance Director 32 /  Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements
(2010: US$6.26/mscf). Gas prices in Singapore, which are linked to High Sulphur Fuel Oil
(HSFO) pricing, in turn closely linked to crude oil pricing, averaged US$19.5/mscf (2010:
US$13.9/mscf) for the year. Average gas prices for Pakistan were US$3.8/mscf (2010:
US$3.5/mscf).
Total sales revenue from all operations reached a new record level of US$826.8 million
(2010: US$763.6 million) driven by higher commodity prices. Cost of sales was lower by
US$115.6 million at US$414.9 million (2010: US$530.5 million) mainly reflecting a US$25.9 million
impairment reversal against a US$65.3 million charge in 2010, due principally to the sustained
high oil price environment, which necessitated an increase in the base price assumption
used for the valuation of future cash flows. Unit operating costs were US$15.9 per barrel of oil
equivalent (boe) (2010: US$13.9/boe) reflecting higher unit costs in the UK, as production
levels declined, and the inclusion of Vietnam operating costs in the last quarter.
Underlying unit amortisation (excluding impairment) rose to US$13.8/boe (2010: US$12.6/boe)
largely as a result of the addition of Chim Sáo field production in Vietnam.
Exploration expense and pre-licence exploration costs amounted to US$187.5 million (2010:
US$68.2 million) and US$23.0 million (2010: US$18.9 million) respectively. This includes the
write-off of the following exploration wells: Gardrofa and Gnatcatcher in Norway; Cherry in
Egypt; Qua Mit Vang in Vietnam; and Gajah Laut Utara and Belut Laut in Indonesia. The
decision was also taken to write-off US$31.7 million of costs in relation to the Fyne area, since
at this stage potential developments in the Greater Fyne area do not meet the company’s
project development metrics.
Net administrative costs were US$25.8 million (2010: US$18.3 million), with the increase
mainly due to transaction costs incurred to acquire EnCore Oil plc.
Operating profits were US$175.6 million (2010: US$127.7 million). Finance costs and other
charges, net of interest revenue and other gains, were US$68.1 million (2010: US$65.5 million),
reflecting lower levels of interest income and increased gross debt levels offset by higher
capitalisation of borrowing costs for our development projects in Asia and the UK. The
charge arising due to the unwinding of the discounted decommissioning provision increased
to US$28.3 million (2010: US$16.2 million) reflecting increased provisions and a higher
discount rate.
Pre-tax profits of US$141.5 million (2010: US$100.8 million) also reflect a positive adjustment
of US$34.0 million in respect of the group’ s commodity hedge portfolio (2010: US$38.6 million).
This was driven by the unwinding of prior year provisions in respect of our oil and gas hedges.
The current tax charge for 2011 is US$77.3 million, an effective tax rate of 44 per cent of
operating profits. Additionally, US$72.1 million has been provided for potential additional tax
charges in Indonesia and Pakistan over fiscal disputes relating to prior years. These disputes
are subject to clarification between the host governments and the oil and gas industry. These
charges are offset by a deferred tax credit of US$177.0 million, resulting in a net tax credit of
US$29.7 million (2010: US$29.0 million). The deferred tax credit arises mainly in the UK and
includes the impact of a 12 per cent increase in supplementary corporation tax for the
industry and the availability of Ring Fence Expenditure Supplement (RFES) allowances. In
addition, a deferred tax asset of US$87.0 million was recognised. This relates to US$140.0 million
of previously unbooked UK corporation tax allowances which, following the group’ s acquisition
of additional fields in the UK, are now expected to be fully utilised. At year-end the group
had an estimated US$1.36 billion of carried forward UK corporation tax allowances which will
be utilised against UK ring fence profits over time.
Profit after tax is a record US$171.2 million (2010: US$129.8 million) resulting in basic earnings
per share of 36.6 cents (2010 restated: 28.0 cents).

Cash flow
Cash flow from operating activities was US$485.9 million (2010: US$436.0 million) after
accounting for tax payments of US$44.0 million (2010: US$67.9 million).
Capital expenditure in 2011 totalled US$660.5 million (2010: US$514.1 million).

The principal fields and development projects were Chim Sáo, Gajah Baru, Huntington and
Rochelle, together with drilling and compression projects in Pakistan.
Exploration and evaluation spend includes costs relating to the Solan, Fyne and Nexen
Norway assets which were categorised as pre-development assets at the time of acquisition.
Acquisitions
In December, Premier completed the acquisition of an additional 17.715 per cent interest
in Wytch Farm for an adjusted consideration of US$89.9 million, taking its total interest to
30.1 per cent.
The acquisition of EnCore Oil plc was approved by its shareholders in December and
subsequently sanctioned by the court in January 2012. Shareholders representing 93.5 per cent
of EnCore’s shares elected to take new Premier shares, which began trading in January 2012.
Total consideration of US$407.6 million was therefore satisfied by the issuance of 60.9 million
new Premier shares and the payment of £14.1 million (US$21.6 million) in cash. As a result of
the acquisition, Premier has increased its stake in the Catcher project from 35 per cent to 50
per cent and has assumed operatorship. This acquisition will be accounted for in the group’s
2012 financial statements.
Balance sheet position
Net debt at 31 December 2011 amounted to US$744.0 million (2010: US$405.7 million), with
cash resources of US$309.1 million (2010: US$299.7 million).

US$1.296:€ spot rate. However these will be redeemed at US$1.423:€ due to a cross currency swap arrangement.
In June 2011, the company issued seven and 10 year senior notes of US$244.0 million and
€75.0 million in the private placement market. Total debt facilities therefore increased to
US$2,184.9 million (2010: US$1,572.0 million). As at year-end, drawn borrowings were
US$1,053.1 million and issued letters of credit were US$324.7 million. Undrawn facilities were
therefore US$807.1 million, which, together with cash in hand, provided available cash
funding and letter of credit capacity of US$1,116.2 million.
Subsequent to year-end, additional bank facilities of US$350.0 million were negotiated and
a second issue of senior notes was completed. This second issue, with maturities of seven,
10 and 12 years, amounted to US$202.0 million and €25.0 million. A US$175.0 million term loan
has been repaid during March 2012, leaving cash and undrawn facilities of approximately
US$1.4 billion.

Financial risk management
Commodity prices
The Board’s commodity pricing and hedging policy continues to be to lock in oil and gas
price floors for a proportion of expected future production at a level which ensures that
investment programmes for sanctioned projects are adequately funded. Floors are
purchased for cash or via collars, funded by selling caps at a ceiling price. This policy has
provided sensible downside protection for the company over the period since 2008 and
going forward into 2012, during which time over US$1 billion will have been invested in new
development projects. The requirement for future hedging for 2013 and beyond will be
considered as new projects are sanctioned, taking into account expected future operating
cash flows of the group and the size of the relevant investment programme.
At year-end, a total of 1.8 million barrels of Dated Brent oil were hedged via collars for the
period to end 2012 with an average floor price of US$40.0/bbl and an average cap of
US$100.0/bbl. In addition 2.1 million barrels of Dated Brent oil were hedged through forward
sales for 2012 at an average price of US$105.3/bbl. This volume represents approximately
32 per cent of the group’s expected liquids working interest production over the period.
162,000 metric tonnes (mt) of HSFO, which drives our gas contract pricing in Singapore, was
subject to collars covering the period to mid-2013 with a cap of US$500.0/mt (equivalent to
around US$85.0/bbl). An additional 132,000 mt have been sold under monthly forward sales
contracts for 2012 at an average price of US$622.0/mt. These two hedges cover approximately
28 per cent of our expected Indonesian gas working interest production for 2012.
During 2011, embedded oil price collars for 3.2 million barrels and fuel oil collars for 120,000
mt expired at a cost of US$119.1 million (2010: US$8.1 million, including forward sales cost)
which has been offset against sales revenue.
Oil hedge collars are incorporated within the pricing terms of physical offtake agreements,
avoiding the requirement to revalue them. A credit of US$28.0 million (2010: US$18.2 million)
arises in respect of past mark to market provisions for oil hedges which have now expired.
Gas price hedging is still required to be marked to market as the hedges are held by
counterparties independent of physical product sales. A credit of US$6.0 million (2010:
US$20.4 million) arises in respect of such mark to market movements, resulting in a total
credit to the income statement of US$34.0 million in respect of commodity contracts (2010:
US$38.6 million).
Foreign exchange
Premier’s functional and reporting currency is US dollars. Exchange rate exposures relate
only to local currency receipts and expenditures within individual business units. Local
currency needs are acquired on a short-term basis. During the year, the group recorded a
loss of US$0.4 million on such short-term hedging (2010: US$0.4 million). In 2011, the group
also issued €75.0 million long-term senior loan notes which have been hedged under a cross
currency swap in US dollars at a fixed rate of US$1.423:€.

Interest rates
Although the group’s borrowing facilities are defined in floating rate terms, substantially all
current drawings have effectively been converted to fixed interest rates using the interest
rate swap markets. On average, therefore, the cost of drawn bank funds for the year was 
5.2 per cent. Mark to market movements on these interest rate swaps amounted to 
US$6.4 million (2010: US$12.1 million), which was charged to other comprehensive income.
Cash balances are invested in short-term bank deposits and AAA rated liquidity funds,
subject to Board approved limits and with a view to spreading counterparty risks.
Insurance
The group undertakes a significant insurance programme to reduce the potential impact of
the physical risks associated with its exploration, development and production activities. In
addition, business interruption cover is purchased for a proportion of the cash flow from
producing fields for a maximum period of 18 months. Due to exceptionally bad weather in
December, the Banff FPSO – which handles Kyle production – lost its anchors and the risers
were damaged severely. As a result, the Banff FPSO has been removed from its location
while repairs are assessed. It is currently unlikely that production from the Kyle field will
recommence in 2012 and a claim for business interruption insurance is being processed.
Going concern
The group monitors its capital position and its liquidity risk regularly throughout the year to
ensure that it has sufficient funds to meet forecast cash requirements. Sensitivities are run to
reflect latest expectations of expenditures, forecast oil and gas prices and other negative
economic scenarios in order to manage the risk of funds shortfalls or covenant breaches and
to ensure the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Despite economic volatility, the directors consider that the expected operating cash flows
of the group and the headroom provided by the available borrowing facilities give them
confidence that the group has adequate resources to continue as a going concern. As a
result, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 2011 Annual Report
and Financial Statements.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Premier measures its performance in line with strategic objectives of continuous growth and
creating significant value for shareholders. Key performance indicators (KPIs) are the primary
measures used to track progress against set targets in the areas of safe, responsible and
sustainable operations; growth through exploration, development, production and acquisitions;
and maintaining financial strength. There are a series of detailed KPIs around all of these areas
which link to senior management’s remuneration.
Operating safely, responsibly and sustainably
Premier is committed to operating responsibly in every part of the business. Success in these
areas inherently protects our assets, our revenue streams and our reputation.
Health and Safety performance is measured using total recordable injury frequency (TRIF)
per million man-hours and near miss high potential incidents (HIPOs). Safety performance
data includes both Premier employees and contractors.
TRIF performance, whilst improved on 2010, was short of the 2.0 target. Premier is working
to improve performance by reinforcing procedures and standards and through continued
training and ongoing communication. Premier’s TRIF target for 2012 remains at less than
2.0 injuries per million man-hours.
As part of its safety performance management process, Premier tracks HIPOs, which include
any event that might lead to significant injury, environmental damage, property damage or
security breaches. Premier ensures that key lessons are learned and disseminated for all
HIPOs and company-wide safety alerts are issued, citing key causes and preventative actions
required. In 2011, there was a continued improvement in performance with six HIPOs, a
frequency rate of 0.83 per million man-hours and below the 2.0 target. The target for 2012 is
a HIPO frequency of below 2.0 per million man-hours.
Building the strong production base
Part of Premier’s strategy is to build on the existing production base in order to sustain and
continue to deliver growth. This is measured using daily average production and the number
of development projects being brought through to sanction.
While average production was slightly lower in 2011 due to reported maintenance activity, the
successful delivery of Chim Sáo and Gajah Baru increased the year-end run-rate to 60 kboepd.
Premier is targeting a 2012 year-end exit rate of 75 kboepd and 100 kboepd in the medium-term.
Premier’s production goal is underpinned by the pipeline of development projects being
progressed across the portfolio, and the ability to commercialise these projects is key to the
company’s success.

Delivering growth
Premier looks to create future growth through exploration in
focused geologies and value-led acquisitions in core areas.
Progress towards this growth ambition is measured by reserves
replacement, risked prospective resource added and finding costs.
Premier also undertakes acquisitions to access additional
resources. The company delivered on five acquisitions in 2011,
which were EnCore Oil plc, increased equity in Wytch Farm,
Nexen Norway’s exploration acreage and equities in the Solan
and Fyne pre-development assets.
Proforma reserves and resources increased to 527 mmboe giving
the company a reserve replacement ratio of 333 per cent,
demonstrating Premier’s ability to replace production and
deliver future growth.
Premier added reserves and resources through exploration at an
average cost of around US$5.0/bbl and through acquisitions at
an average cost of US$8.0/bbl.

Maintaining financial strength
One of Premier’s strategic objectives is to maintain financial
strength in order to invest in the future of the business and deliver
significant returns to shareholders. 2011 was another strong year
with record profit after tax of US$171.2 million, an increase of
32 per cent, and operating cash flow of US$485.9 million, an
increase of 11 per cent.
Premier’ s portfolio of crudes was sold at an average of US$1.5/bbl
premium to Brent and realised oil prices (pre-hedge) were 40 per
cent higher in 2011. Realised average gas prices, a significant
portion of which tracks oil price movement, were 36 per cent
higher in 2011.
Operating costs increased in 2011 to US$15.9/boe, reflecting
higher unit costs in the UK as production levels declined and the
inclusion of Vietnam operating costs in the last quarter.
Rising cash flows, along with successful bank and bond market
transactions, provide Premier with the funding required for
future growth. Ability to add new capital and sufficient covenant
headroom are measured to ensure the company has the funds
to meet forecast cash requirements and maintain liquidity
throughout the cycle.

SOCIAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW
Premier is committed to applying the high ethical standards necessary to maintain our
reputation as a world-class operator in oil and gas. Our reputation for doing the right thing
enables us to access new licences, enter new countries, build lasting relationships with local
communities and ultimately secure the licence to operate. We have policies and procedures
in place to ensure that our investment and operational decisions take appropriate account of
the impacts that might arise from our activities.
Premier carries out independent audits of its policies to ensure compliance with the
requirements of the following bodies: the Global Reporting Initiative; the International
Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA) Oil and Gas Industry
Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability Reporting 2010; the Carbon Disclosure Project;
FTSE4Good; and the United Nations Global Compact (of which Premier is a signatory).
Our last report identified areas for improvement relating to the continued improvement of our
social investment programmes, implementation of an employee engagement survey and the
roll-out of our code of conduct training. It also highlighted the need for additional process
safety procedures and disclosures as well as more structured reporting on greenhouse gas
emissions. Steps were taken in 2011 to address each of these areas and to further strengthen
our underlying management systems in line with emerging global standards. Disclosure of our
performance in this area and for all of the commitments made in 2011 is presented in our
Social Performance Report 2011.
We report below on how we have evolved, applied and delivered on our stated policies in 2011,
and we explain any areas where we have not complied.
Further details on our policies and procedures are available on our website (www.premier-oil.com).
Social responsibility
Social responsibility is primarily about how we engage, assess and manage our community
and societal issues and risks. Our corporate social responsibility and human rights policies
are applicable to all Premier-operated entities and may be adapted to address local
priorities. Our code of conduct and employment policy are managed through the legal and
human resources functions respectively. All policies are compliant with relevant legislation
and take due account of appropriate initiatives and standards, industry guidance and
relevant best practice.
Corporate social responsibility policy
We recognise that we have responsibilities to a diverse group of stakeholders including
shareholders, customers, employees, business partners, local communities and society at
large, including special interest groups that represent public interest concerns. Our investment
decisions take account of economic, environmental and social impacts and their management.
In all its operations, Premier will always comply with local laws and regulatory requirements as
a minimum, and make representations to the relevant authorities if we believe that policies
and practices of host governments undermine our policies. We complete environmental and
social impact assessments prior to undertaking any new investment and evaluate these
impacts regularly to ensure that they are responsibly managed on an ongoing basis. We
expect our contractors, suppliers, joint venture and alliance partners to respect our policies.
Their concurrence with the principles upheld by our policies is an important factor in our
decision to form or remain in a relationship with them.
It is our policy to support social investment that contributes to the sustainable development
goals of the communities and countries where we operate. This means working in
partnership with professional social development organisations, government agencies and
local non-governmental organisations, to ensure our investment addresses relevant and
material issues in a rigorous manner with positive impacts on society.
There were no reported non-compliances with this policy in the review period. Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  39
Human rights policy
Our human rights policy is based on the fundamental rights pronounced in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and is guided by those rights enshrined in the core labour
conventions of the International Labour Organisation. These rights are to be protected and
promoted throughout Premier’s business operations and in our relations with both business
and local community partners. The scope of our policy includes the rights of our employees
– and their health and safety as well as their security arrangements and working conditions –
and the development rights of our external stakeholders, in particular local communities.
Where appropriate, we will also use our legitimate influence to promote the protection of
human rights outside of our areas of operation.
There were no reported violations of this policy in the review period.
Employment policy and social justice in the work place
Premier is committed to the principle of equal opportunity in employment and to the
establishment of a fair and non-discriminatory work environment. When recruiting, developing
and dealing with employees and service providers people will be treated fairly, equally and
without prejudice. Our equal employment opportunities policy applies to all permanent,
contractual and temporary staff as well as all job applicants.
Equal employment opportunity means having a commitment to equality of opportunity in all
employment practices, policies and procedures. No employee or potential employee is
treated less favourably due to their race, creed, colour, nationality, ethnic origin, age, religion
or belief, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, gender re-assignment status or disability.
Any employee who has a concern regarding the application of this policy is able to make use
of the company’s grievance policy.
All employees must:
• co-operate with any measures introduced to ensure equal opportunity;
• report any suspected discriminatory acts or practices;
• not induce or attempt to induce others to practice unlawful discrimination;
• not victimise anyone as a result of them having reported or provided evidence of
discrimination;
• not harass, abuse or intimidate others on account of their race, creed, colour etc.; and
• not canvass job applicants in an attempt to discourage them from applying or taking up
a post.
Where there has been a clear breach of the equal employment opportunities policy,
disciplinary procedures will follow. Serious offences will be dealt with as gross misconduct.
There were no reported violations of our employment policy in 2011. There were also no
reported incidents of discrimination or formal grievance procedures reported in 2011.
Our global code of conduct
Integrity, honesty and fairness are fundamental to the way we conduct our business. We are
committed to transparency in all our dealings. As part of this commitment, we will not
engage in any activities that undermine the legitimate business environment, including
bribery or corruption in any form. 40 /  Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements
SOCIAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW (continued)
Premier has developed and implemented a global code of conduct. The new code of
conduct is informed by and compliant with the Bribery Act 2010 and its evolving guidance
in the United Kingdom. It applies to all employees at every level in the business and all those
associated with Premier, all of whom are required to behave ethically and with personal
integrity. This includes adhering to laws in the countries where we operate, performing our
duties in accordance with the code of conduct and disclosing all potential and actual
conflicts between personal interests and those of Premier.
The code of conduct covers the following key issue areas:
• anti-bribery; 
• gifts and hospitality;
• charitable and political donations;
• intermediaries; and
• facilitation payments.
Premier prohibits bribery and corruption in any form by all employees and by those working
for and/or connected with the business. This includes facilitation payments. Premier avoids
accepting hospitality or gifts that might place it under an obligation. All business transactions
must be properly recorded and accounted for. We expect the same ethical standards to be
applied in all our business relationships in all areas of operation and we promote our code
of conduct and associated anti-bribery policy with all our business associates. Employees
are expected to report bribery or attempted bribery to their line managers, even if only
suspected or attempted.
Premier encourages employees, contractors and agency workers to voice their concerns to
line managers if they feel the company or anyone working on behalf of the company has not
acted in accordance with our code of conduct and associated policies. Premier provides a
confidential third party reporting hotline for employees that feel unable to raise concerns in
the normal way. This hotline is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. No reports were
made through this service in 2011 or at any point over the last three years. 
No incidents of corruption or non-compliance with these policies were identified in 2011.
Health, safety and environment policy
Premier is committed to operating responsibly and will never knowingly compromise our
health, safety or environmental standards to meet our operational objectives. 
Our goals are to ensure the safety of everyone involved with our operations and to protect
the environment.
To achieve this we will:
• encourage open and honest communication; 
• seek ways to continually improve our performance; 
• assess and manage risks;
• provide appropriate resources; 
• maintain clean, safe and healthy workplaces;
• investigate and learn from any incidents;
• plan and prepare for potential emergencies;
• maintain high-quality documented systems and processes;
• seek external certification of key management systems; and
• meet or surpass statutory requirements.
In 2011, Premier implemented and communicated a set of Golden Rules on health and
safety. The Golden Rules reinforce our existing health, safety and environment (HSE) policy,
procedures and standards and have been established to help prevent the most common
causes of serious incidents in our industry. Every employee is accountable and has a shared
personal responsibility for HSE. Employees are also expected to ‘stop the job’ if they see or
believe something is unsafe or can be better controlled. Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  41
Occupational health and safety performance
In 2011, we worked 7.2 million man-hours (2010: 8.8 million man-hours). This represents an
18.2 per cent decrease on the previous year mainly due to the completion of construction at
our Gajah Baru and Chim Sáo facilities in Indonesia and Vietnam respectively. Most of these
man-hours (5.9 million vs. 7.7 million in 2010) were worked by contractors on our operations.
There was, however, a significant increase in development drilling. In 2011, we drilled more
than 20 wells making it our busiest year ever.

Note: All safety statistics include both Premier employees and contractors.
Total recordable injuries
Our overall TRIF performance improved significantly from 2.84 in 2010 to 2.36 in 2011, but
did not meet our 2.0 target. TRIF performance at our drilling operations was exceptional at
0.00, excellent in construction at 1.80, but poor in our production operations at 6.10. The
overall higher than anticipated TRIF score was attributed to mostly minor accidents including
slips, falls and finger injuries in our production operations. Many of these occurred at our
Balmoral operation in the North Sea (with a frequency of 9.42) where performance is subject
to new site-specific safety initiatives. Facilities in Asia performed much better with a TRIF
score of 1.48. The continued roll-out of our Golden Rules programme, that re-enforces
personal responsibility and the ability to stop the job if employees feel unsafe or that work
can be better controlled, is anticipated to help reduce similar future incidents.
This last year also saw one very unfortunate and unrelated diving fatality at Balmoral in the
North Sea. At the date of signing this report, the incident was still under investigation by
Premier/diving contractor, the police and the Health and Safety Executive.
Premier has been certified to OHSAS 18001 and ISO 14001 since 2004 for global drilling and
since 2006 for our Indonesian production operations. In 2011, we completed a number of
OHSAS 18001 and ISO 14001 surveillance audits on our production and drilling operations.
Drilling, Anoa and Balmoral production retained their certifications. Our new production
operations in Vietnam (Chim Sáo) and Indonesia (Gajah Baru) are working towards OHSAS
18001 and ISO 14001 certification. Gajah Baru has now completed its stage one audit and is
on track to achieve certification in 2012.
Process safety performance
Process safety focuses on the design and engineering of facilities to prevent fires, explosions
or accidental chemical releases, as well as maintenance and operation. This includes the
prevention, detection, control and mitigation of hydrocarbon and other leaks, oil spills,
equipment malfunction, over-pressures, over-temperatures, corrosion, metal fatigue and
similar conditions. Managing these risks requires a robust planning process, effective safety
cases and the ongoing monitoring and management of asset integrity.
Premier has integrated process safety protocols into the project safety reviews (PSRs) of all its
projects. These reviews provide assurance that material HSE issues have been identified and
are being effectively managed throughout the project lifecycle. A typical project lifecycle will
require six strategic reviews as a project moves from concept to construction and then to
operation. These PSRs align closely with our project approval gates, at which time strategic
decisions are made to either progress a project further towards the operations stage or to
delay or divest. In 2011, we implemented a structured PSR procedure to ensure consistent
and clear application of these gates at all operations. 42 /  Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements
SOCIAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW (continued)
Safety cases are in place at all of our operated installations. This safety case regime is aligned
with the regulated standards in the United Kingdom. We believe this represents best
practice and are committed to implementing such cases at all of our operated production
facilities worldwide, even when not required by the local regulatory regime. Safety cases are
developed during the project and become more detailed as a project nears the operation
stage. Safety cases must be in place before production commences. Premier is also
developing an asset integrity and maintenance management process based on the asset
integrity toolkit standard produced by Oil & Gas UK. The process will apply to all of our
installations and is intended to ensure the requirements set out in our performance standard
for safety critical elements are met and maintained.
High potential incidents
This last year saw a significant reduction in HIPOs per million man-hours from 1.59 in 2010 to
0.83 in 2011. This was largely due to exceptional performance at our drilling and construction
operations with annual frequencies of 0.00 and 0.36 respectively. Our production operations
achieved an annual frequency of 2.44. T ogether, this overall reduction in frequency allowed
the achievement of our 2.0 target. Our HIPO frequency target for 2012 is also 2.0.
Loss of primary containment
During 2011, there were no reported loss of primary containment (LOPC) events of ‘greater
consequence’ (as defined in IPIECA 2011). Such incidents are characterised as unintended
process safety events with severe consequences. These can include multiple fatalities,
widespread environmental impact and/or significant property damage. There was one Tier 1
event and 35 LOPC events of ‘lesser consequence’ reported (2010: 18 events). This includes
a single crude oil spill in the pump room (classified as Tier 1), 15 gas leaks or contained spills
that did not reach the environment (2010: five gas leaks) and 20 minor spills (2010: 13 minor
spills) outlined below and in our Social Performance Review 2011.
Environmental performance
Environmental assessment, management and reporting forms a major part of Premier’s HSE
risk management process. We conduct baseline surveys and environmental and social
impact assessments for each new operated activity. This involves an assessment of the
physical, socio-economic and biological environments, including biodiversity. We measure
and review each impact in turn and gauge both its significance and how it can be reduced to
as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP) by adopting best available techniques, in line with
our internal environmental ALARP process. Potential actions to improve environmental
performance are screened based on cost, duration and impact to determine which are
feasible for implementation. We periodically review these environmental impacts and actions
for our existing facilities to ensure we comply with our policy of continuous improvement.
Environmental indicators and targets
We report our environmental performance in line with the IPIECA Oil and Gas Industry
Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability Reporting 2010. We then benchmark our performance
by contributing our data to an industry database compiled and published by the
International Association of Oil and Gas Producers. As an oil company with production
facilities in the North Sea, we also comply with the European Union Emissions Trading
Scheme and submit an annual, externally verified report on our emissions profile to the
Department of Energy and Climate Change. We also participate in the Carbon Disclosure
Project where we achieved a carbon disclosure score of 66 in 2011 (2010: 74).

Climate change and greenhouse gas emissions
Greenhouse gas emissions associated with hydrocarbon combustion at our operated assets
amounted to 615,000 tonnes in 2011 (2010: 350,000 tonnes). This increase in absolute
emissions from 2010 was largely due to a significant increase in development drilling activity
and associated diesel consumption, as well as the start-up of our Gajah Baru and Chim Sáo
operations in Asia. A number of technical challenges at Chim Sáo during an extended
commissioning required us to implement a longer period of gas flaring that was beyond our
initial expectations. 
Our operated emissions intensity also increased from 185 tonnes per thousand tonnes of
production to 305 tonnes per thousand tonnes of production in 2011. This is mainly due to
the above additional development drilling activity as well as a series of unexpected events.
The latter included flaring at Chim Sáo due to prolonged commissioning issues as well as
three months of no production at our Balmoral facility in the North Sea. When excluding this
development work and unexpected events, our underlying steady-state emissions intensity
figure is 163 tonnes per thousand tonnes of production.
We calculate our greenhouse gas (CO
2
equivalent) emissions both for operated assets and
on an equity basis for production across our global portfolio. Greenhouse gas emissions
from flaring and fuel gas combustion associated with our full equity portfolio amounted to
172 tonnes per thousand tonnes of production (2010: 155 tonnes per thousand tonnes of
production).
Spills and discharges
The total volume of produced water discharged from our operations in 2011 amounted to
2,055,878 tonnes (2010: 2,922,707 tonnes). This decrease was largely due to the shut-down of
our North Sea operations for three months of the calendar year. The average oil in produced
water increased slightly from 11 ppm-wt in 2010 to 14 ppm-wt in 2011. This increase in the oil
concentration of produced water was mainly due to a slight increase at Balmoral that
averaged 14 ppm-wt (2010: 10.4 ppm-wt). The average concentration of oil in produced water,
discharged by our Anoa facility, reduced significantly to 13 ppm-wt (2010: 17.7 ppm-wt).
In 2011, there were 20 spills to the environment (2010: 13 spills). 16 of these were hydrocarbon
spills (2010: seven spills). Four of these hydrocarbon spills were greater than one barrel with
the remainder being minor in nature. The largest of these was 5.4 barrels. The total volume
amounted to 2.7 tonnes (2010: 1.3 tonnes). About 90 per cent (2.4 tonnes) of this total was
associated with the 13 spills at our production operations, and 0.3 tonnes with the three
hydrocarbon spills at our drilling activities. We maintain oil spill contingency plans for each
of our operations and have ongoing contracts with oil spill response specialists to provide
support in the unlikely event of a major incident. Four other chemical spills occurred at our
production operations in 2011 (2010: six chemical spills) totalling 1.3 tonnes (2010: 6.9 tonnes). 44 /  Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements

Directors’ Report: Governance 46 /  Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
The company is required to make certain statements relating to the way it is governed as laid down in the UK Corporate
Governance Code (the Code). This report describes the manner in which the company has applied the main principles of
governance set out in Section 1 of the Code and complied with the detailed Code provisions. It is the Board’s view that the
company has fully complied with the Code throughout 2011, except where reported below. While the Board supports the value
of the Code, it does not believe that good governance can be defined merely in terms of compliance with a set of rules.
The Board is committed to high standards of governance at the board and aims to create a culture which demands the same
commitment and performance in all our business activities. This is enshrined in our Code of Conduct which was updated and
rolled out to our employees in 2011.
The Board
The role of the Board
One major purpose of the Board is to ensure that the company’s strategic objectives are properly pursued and that the major
business risks are actively monitored and managed. This goes beyond regulatory compliance and puts the interests of our
shareholders as the Board’s primary focus.
The Board is responsible for overall group strategy, acquisition and divestment policy, approval of major capital expenditures,
the overall group debt and equity structure and consideration of significant financing matters. The Board has continued to focus
its efforts in 2011 on strategic issues which will create shareholder value, monitoring performance against agreed objectives and
planning future business opportunities.
Board composition
The Board of Directors comprises the Chairman, Chief Executive, four other executive directors and five independent non-
executive directors. Biographical details of each, including membership of Board committees are set out in the Board of
Directors section of the Annual Report and Financial Statements. Details of the executive directors’ service contracts and the
non-executive directors’ letters of appointment are laid out in the Remuneration Report.
Chairman and Chief Executive
The Chairman’ s role is part-time and he is a non-executive director. His key responsibility is the leadership of the Board, ensuring
its effectiveness on all aspects of its role and setting its agenda. Between Board meetings the Chairman is responsible for ensuring
the integrity and effectiveness of the Board/Executive relationship. This is effected through meetings, as well as contact with other
Board members, shareholders, joint venture partners and host governments. The Chief Executive’ s role is the operational
management of the business, developing strategy in consultation with the Board and then implementing such strategy.
Non-executive directors
The non-executive directors bring independent judgement to bear on issues of strategy and resources, including key appointments
and standards of conduct. The non-executive directors have a particular responsibility to challenge independently and
constructively the performance of the executive management and to monitor the performance of the management team in the
delivery of the agreed objectives and targets. In meeting this responsibility, the Chairman and the non-executive directors meet
periodically without the executive directors present, and the non-executive directors meet once a year without the Chairman.
We require that our non-executive directors are free from any relationship or circumstances that could materially interfere with
the exercise of their independent judgement. The Board considers each of the non-executive directors to be independent in
character and judgement.
Non-executive directors are appointed for a specified time of three years subject to annual re-election and to Companies Act
provisions relating to the removal of a director. The terms and conditions of their appointment are made available for inspection.
Letters of appointment do not specifically set out expected time commitment as this may vary considerably. However, all non-
executive directors undertake that they will have sufficient time to meet what is expected of them and any significant commitments
are disclosed to the Board prior to appointment. Changes to such commitments are disclosed to the Board on an ongoing basis.

The Board (continued)
Senior independent director
Mr Joe Darby is the company’s senior independent non-executive director. He is available to shareholders who have concerns
that cannot be resolved through discussion with the Chairman or Chief Executive.
Appointments and development
Premier is an international business which has to manage a variety of political, technical and commercial risks. It is therefore
important that the Board contains the appropriate mix of skills and experience to meet these challenges. To this end, the
Nomination Committee reviews the structure, size and composition of the Board and makes recommendations to the Board with
regard to any adjustments that are deemed necessary. In selecting new directors, the Nomination Committee prepares a
description of the role and capabilities required for a particular appointment.
How the Board operates
The Board meets at least eight times each year and, in addition, a regular update conference call takes place in the months when
no formal meeting is scheduled. The agenda for each Board meeting is set by the Chairman in consultation with the Chief
Executive and the Company Secretary. Board members receive a monthly report of the company’s activities which incorporates
an update on progress against objectives and the management of business risks.
The Board has a formal schedule of Matters Reserved for the Board, a copy of which can be found on the company’ s website
(www.premier-oil.com). The schedule is reviewed by the Board regularly. Key matters reserved are the consideration and approval of:
Corporate strategy • Overall direction and strategy of the business
• New country and/or business entry
• Acquisition or disposal of interests
Finance • Group debt and equity structure
• Budget
Expenditure • Major capital expenditure and budgets
• Development plans and projects

There were five scheduled meetings of the Remuneration Committee during the year. The remaining meeting (only attended by Ms I J Hinkley and
Mr J R W Orange) was called to approve the detail of arrangements approved in principle by a prior scheduled meeting of the Remuneration Committee.
2
Mr J R W Orange resigned from the Board and the Audit and Risk, Nomination and Remuneration Committees on 20 May 2011.
Executive Committee and management structure
The Board has delegated the day-to-day running of the group to the Chief Executive who has established an Executive
Committee to assist him in this role. The Executive Committee is made up of each of the executive directors and the Company
Secretary. Each executive director has been given responsibility for specific aspects of the group’s affairs. The Executive
Committee is chaired by the Chief Executive and normally meets weekly.
The responsibilities of the Executive Committee include the development of group strategy for approval by the Board, portfolio
management and the delivery of performance against the targets set by the Board. At its meetings it reviews health, safety,
environmental and security performance and operational business performance reports.
Three regional business units – North Sea, Asia and Middle East, Africa and Pakistan – manage the geographical spread of
business in the group. Each business unit is headed by a regional business unit manager who delivers against specific strategies
and performance targets set by the Executive Committee.
Delegation of authority
Responsibility levels are communicated throughout the group as part of corporate accounting and through an authorisation
manual which sets out, inter alia, delegated authority levels, segregation of duties and other control procedures.
Board performance evaluation
The Board believes that there is benefit in the periodic involvement of an independent external facilitator in the annual Board
evaluation process, as this brings independent perspective to the process. It is the Board’s current practice to engage such an
external facilitator every two years. During 2010, the Board worked with an external facilitator to conduct the annual evaluation
review.
During 2011, the Board and committee evaluations were facilitated by the Chairman. The evaluation comprised a written
questionnaire and a series of one-to-one interviews by the Chairman with all directors. The questionnaire and interviews covered
a number of key areas including strategy, succession planning, Board size and composition, the roles and responsibilities of the
Board and its committees, risk management and the relationship between the Board and management. The results of the
reviews were considered by the Chairman and the committee chairmen and were then discussed with the relevant committees
and collectively by the Board as a whole.
The performance of individual non-executive directors was evaluated by the Chairman, with input from the committee chairmen
and the other directors. The performance of the Chief Executive and other executive directors was evaluated by the Chairman
and non-executive directors.
No major issues arose from the evaluation process and the directors have concluded that the Board and its committees operate
effectively. Recommendations were made to further enhance the performance and effectiveness of the Board and a process of
continuous improvement is now being led by the Chairman. Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  49
Induction, information and support
New directors receive a full induction to the company. This consists of information covering the operations of the Board as well
as meetings with the Board, Chief Executive and other executive directors. All non-executives have direct contact with the
company’s senior management between Board meetings and also visit the company’s operations in order to familiarise
themselves with its activities and to meet and engage with staff. Shareholders are given the opportunity to meet with new
directors upon request or at the next Annual General Meeting (AGM) following their appointment. The company has directors’
and officers’ liability insurance in place, and details of the policy are given to new directors on appointment. Formal procedures
are in place to enable individual Board members to take independent advice where appropriate.
Conflicts of interest
A director has a duty to avoid a situation in which he or she has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly
may conflict, with the interests of the company. Formal procedures are in place to ensure the Board’s powers of authorisation of
conflicts or potential conflicts of interest of directors are operated effectively. The Board determined that during 2011 these
procedures were enforced and adhered to appropriately.
Risk management and internal controls
The corporate governance process in Premier is designed to determine the nature and level of risk that the company is willing to
take in pursuit of its strategy and that any risks taken are soundly managed and that the system of internal controls is effective.
Any system of internal control can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that material financial irregularities will
be detected or that the risk of failure to achieve business objectives is eliminated.
Business management system
Internal controls within Premier are governed by the business management system (BMS). This system is composed of the
policies, standards, procedures, processes and guidelines for every function required to carry out Premier’s business including
risk, HSES, corporate social responsibility, operations, exploration, business development, finance and other business support
services. Corporate group functional management systems are complemented by local management systems within the
business units which are designed to supplement corporate policies, standards, procedures, processes and guidelines with those
specifically required in order to operate and manage the business under local conditions and in compliance with local laws and
regulations.
The BMS is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to meet our business objectives. The effectiveness of the
BMS is a function of both the adequacy of the system and compliance with the system. Premier’s audit and review programme
includes specific scope to review adequacy of and compliance by component business unit and functional management systems
at appropriate regular intervals.
The annual cycle of monitoring in Premier culminates in the completion of declarations by business unit and functional
management confirming compliance with the group’s BMS, as well as identifying enhancements as part of a continuous process
for improvement of the effectiveness of management systems.
Risk management
Premier believes that risk management is just part of good management which leads to quality decision making and
achievement of targets for growth of the business. The risk management process is central to Premier’s BMS.
Since the appointment of a Group Audit and Risk Manager in 2010, Premier’s risk management system has been further
developed in accordance with the risk management principles and guidelines of ISO 31000 (Risk Management – Principles and
Guidelines). The processes developed by the company cover all key elements of ISO 31000:

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT (continued)
Risk management and internal controls (continued)
In early 2012, Det Norske Veritas (DNV) carried out an assessment of the extent to which Premier’s risk management system is
aligned with ISO 31000 and found that Premier had a well structured system of risk management that was strongly aligned.
The core process for risk management lies at the heart of the system framework:
This core process is used to manage the spectrum of risks which Premier face from strategic, geopolitical and other external risks
to operational, financial and organisational risk.
The context for risk management is established by development and communication of strategy, growth targets, team
performance deliverables and key performance indicators (KPIs).
A systematic process for identification and assessment of risk is undertaken across the company business units and functions.
Regular workshops are undertaken with input from independent consultants with specialist knowledge and from dialogue with
our partners to assist with risk identification and assessment and risks are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that new risks or
exposures as a result of changes in the business or the business environment are captured.
A standard matrix of impact versus likelihood is used to assess risks at all levels in the organisation. Appropriate consideration is
given to risk dependency and amalgamation of similar specific risks across the organisation. Risks are categorised according to a
scale of major, medium, minor and escalated to the appropriate level.
Risk treatment includes risk acceptance or tolerance and active risk reduction measures. Risk appetite objectives are defined
and action plans are implemented. Particular attention is given to safety and environmental factors to ensure that residual risks
are at a level that is as low as reasonably practicable.
The status of risks and progress with risk treatment plans are monitored continuously and reviewed periodically via performance
reviews, workshops, audits and risk assessments.
The architecture of the organisation provides the framework for defining the accountability and responsibility for risk
identification and management and links the Board and Audit and Risk Committee to the Executive Committee and functional
and business unit management structure and enables risks to be escalated and managed at the appropriate level. The Group
Audit and Risk Manager is responsible for the risk management system and the overall running of the process.
The risk protocols are the policy, procedures and processes documented as part of the risk management system and key tools
used in the process. The corporate risk register is the primary tool for risk management in Premier. The register is a web-based
tool which is updated at regular intervals. The register facilitates recording of functional and business unit risks, together with
their assessment, definition of existing and new treatment plans for control and mitigation and assignment of responsibility at
the appropriate level in the organisation.
A cycle of continuous improvement to the risk management system within the organisation is adopted and regularly reviewed
with both the Executive Committee, via regional and functional performance reviews, and the Audit and Risk Committee.
As already noted, Premier’s risk management process has been developed significantly over the past two years in accordance
with the risk management principles and guidelines of ISO 31000. Initiatives are in hand to further embed risk management in
the group’s culture and business processes.

Risk management and internal controls (continued)
Audit and review
The effective operation of internal control procedures is reviewed by planned audits. An annual programme of audit and review
is agreed between functional and business unit management and approved by the Audit and Risk Committee. The programme
adopts a risk based focus and includes audit of management system effectiveness and control as well as targeting key
operational, financial and organisational delivery milestones.
A process of business control reviews has been developed and implemented across the group. This process is designed, inter
alia, to provide assurance to the Board that Premier is embedding effective risk management into its operations. Significant
findings from each review are presented to the Audit and Risk Committee. A rolling three-year plan to cover all operations is
in place.
In addition, where we are the operator, audits of joint venture operations are carried out by our joint venture partners. Where one
of our partners is the operator, we participate in audits of these joint venture partners.
The business management system, risk management processes and programme of audits and reviews provide the Board with
reasonable assurance that appropriate controls are in place to provide effective management of business risks and to safeguard
the group’s assets from inappropriate use or from loss and fraud.
Communication with shareholders
Communication with shareholders is given significant attention. Extensive information about the group’s activities is provided in
the Annual Report and Financial Statements, the Half-Yearly Report, Trading Updates and Interim Management Statements, all
of which are available to shareholders. There is regular dialogue with institutional investors through meetings, presentations and
conferences, general presentations to analysts and investors for the full-year and half-yearly results (which are broadcast live via
the company’s website) as well as other ad hoc investor events. The Chairman, Chief Executive and Finance Director, who are the
directors responsible for dealing with shareholders, ensure that other members of the Board receive full reports of these
discussions. The company’s website (www.premier-oil.com) also provides detailed information on the group’s activities.
In accordance with current regulations, the company uses its website as its default method of publication for statutory
documents to reduce printing costs and help benefit the environment. All shareholders are offered the choice of receiving
shareholder documentation, including the Annual Report, electronically or in paper format, as well as the choice of submitting
proxy votes either electronically or by post. All new shareholders receive hard copies of statutory documents until they elect, or
are deemed to have elected, otherwise.
The company promotes the use of online shareholder services at www.premier-oil-shares.com. On this website, shareholders are
able to access their shareholding and to update their address or submit queries on their account directly to the company’s
registrars. Shareholders also have the ability to vote online prior to the 2012 AGM. The share portal also encourages
shareholders to register to receive communications by e-mail, rather than by post, thus further reducing the number of
documents printed and distributed. Shareholders who have registered receive an e-mail notifying them when the company has
added a statutory document to its website. For each new registration processed, the company will donate £1 to PURE the Clean
Planet Trust, a UK charity dedicated to combating climate change.
The company has posted guidelines on its website, advising shareholders of how to deal with potential share scams, where
shareholders may have received unsolicited phone calls offering to buy Premier shares at a higher price than their market value,
or concerning alternative investment matters, where callers may have stated they work for a subsidiary of, or on behalf of, the
company. The company does not retain the services of any such business for these purposes, and shareholders are advised to be
extremely wary of any unsolicited advice or offers.
Enquiries from individuals on matters relating to their shareholding and the business of the group are welcomed and are dealt
with in a timely manner. All shareholders are encouraged to attend the AGM to discuss the progress of the group.
By order of the Board
S C Huddle
Company Secretary
21 March 2012 The Committee is comprised solely of non-executive directors. Its members are David
Lindsell (Chairman), Joe Darby and Michel Romieu. John Orange retired from the Board
in May 2011 and was a member of the Committee until his retirement.
The Board has determined that David Lindsell, a chartered accountant with expertise in
accounting and auditing, has recent and relevant financial experience as required by the
UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code).
All members of the Committee are deemed to be independent and the Committee has
concluded that its membership meets the requirements of the Code.
The meetings of the Committee are normally attended by the Finance Director, the
Group Financial Controller, the Group Audit and Risk Manager and representatives of the
external auditors. Stephen Huddle, the Company Secretary, acts as secretary to the
Committee. Other executive directors or senior managers are required to attend when
significant risk management or control issues relating to their area of responsibility are
considered by the Committee.
Role of the Committee
Committee’s main responsibilities 
• monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the company and formal announcements relating to the company’s
financial performance and reviewing any significant financial reporting judgements contained therein
• reviewing the company’s internal financial and operational control and risk management systems, including the results of
management system reviews
• overseeing the company’s relationship with its external auditor, including making recommendations as to the appointment or
reappointment of the external auditor, reviewing the terms of their engagement, monitoring their independence and developing
and implementing policy governing any engagement of the external auditor to supply non-audit services
• reviewing the effectiveness of the company’s code of conduct, with particular reference to systems and controls for the
prevention of bribery and the prevention and detection of fraud, and receiving reports on any non-compliance
The Committee is required to report its findings to the Board, identifying any matters on which it considers that action or
improvement is needed, and make recommendations on the steps to be taken.
The Committee may engage the services of external advisers as it deems necessary in the furtherance of its duties, at the
company’s expense. No external advisers materially assisted the Committee during the year. The Committee’s terms of
reference, which can be found on the company’s website (www.premier-oil.com), include all matters indicated by the Disclosure
and Transparency Rule 7.1 and the Code.
Meetings
The Committee is required to meet at least three times per year and has an agenda linked to events in the company’s financial
calendar.
Activities during the year
The Committee met four times in 2011 and has met twice in 2012 to date.
Its January and March 2011 meetings focused primarily on the status of the 2010 risk management and internal control reviews,
the 2011 plan for such reviews, and the 2010 full-year results and Annual Report and Financial Statements, together with the
Committee’s annual assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls. At its July meeting the Committee considered the
results of the group internal control reviews carried out in the first half of the year, together with accounting and reporting issues
relating to the half-year results and in August, it reviewed the half-year results. In January 2012, it considered accounting and
reporting issues relating to the full-year results, reviewed the status of the 2011 risk management and internal control reviews,
focusing on the significant findings and actions, and reviewed and approved the 2012 audit plan for such reviews. In March it
reviewed the 2011 full-year results, the Annual Report and Financial Statements and its annual assessment of the effectiveness
of internal controls to enable the Board to make its statement on internal control in the Corporate Governance Report.

AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT
David Lindsell
Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  53
Activities during the year (continued)
More specifically, the responsibilities of the Committee were discharged as follows:
• the Committee reviewed the risk management process designed to identify the key risks facing the group and how these risks
were being managed. In this regard, following the creation of the role of Group Audit and Risk Manager in 2010, the risk
management process has been further developed in accordance with the principles and guidelines on risk management set
out in ISO 31000. The risk management process was reviewed during the year by Det Norske Veritas with satisfactory overall
results and some suggestions for improvements, which are in hand;
• the risk register is the principal record of information about identified risks and the controls in place to mitigate them, at both
business unit and corporate function level. The further development of the risk register in 2010 and 2011 has enabled the
programme of financial and operating controls reviews to be prioritised based on the areas of greater risk as reflected in the
risk register. The Committee reviewed the process for maintaining and updating the risk register, approved the programme
of financial and operating controls reviews for the year, and reviewed the findings from the reviews together with progress in
implementing any required improvements;
– in reviewing the findings from financial and operating reviews during 2011, the Committee noted that the company
continued to use both Premier staff with the necessary expertise and third-party specialists to carry out the programme of
reviews and that in addition, the company obtains independent confirmation of the effectiveness of internal controls from
a variety of external sources, including joint venture and governmental financial and operational audits. For example, in
relation to the effectiveness of internal financial control, the Vietnam business became a producing operation in 2011 and
was therefore an area of focus, with Deloitte’s London audit team visiting Vietnam to oversee the extended external audit
scope there and PetroVietnam carrying out reviews of the company’s relevant systems and controls. In addition, external
assurance regarding a number of operational controls was received and these included independent certification of our
occupational health and safety management systems for our Indonesia and North Sea operations and our global drilling
function and an independently inspected UK well examination scheme.
• the Committee reviewed the 2011 half-year and full-year financial results announcements and draft 2011 Annual Report and
Financial Statements with the Finance Director and Group Financial Controller and considered the findings from the external
auditor’s review of the interim results and their audit of the 2011 financial statements. The Committee considered in particular
the significant assumptions, estimates and forecasts used in measuring items in the financial statements, including future oil
and gas price assumptions, estimates of oil and gas reserves and decommissioning cost estimates, together with the financial
statement items directly or indirectly affected by them such as the recoverability of development and production and
exploration and evaluation assets, amortisation and depreciation charges, and the recognition of deferred tax assets arising
from tax losses. The Committee noted that no significant deficiencies in the financial reporting system were identified by the
external auditor in the course of the audit;
• the fee proposals for the external audit and half-yearly review were considered and agreed, and the Committee reviewed the
scope and fees for non-audit assignments awarded to the external auditor to satisfy itself that the assignments concerned did
not give rise to threats to the auditor’s independence and objectivity;
• the performance and effectiveness of the Committee was reviewed as part of the Board performance evaluation process. The
Committee was considered to be operating effectively and in accordance with the Financial Reporting Council Guidance on
Audit Committees. Recommendations to streamline attendance at Committee meetings and thus improve its effectiveness
were adopted during the year; and
• the Committee met once in the absence of management with the external auditor in March and no matters of significance
were drawn to the Committee’s attention at this meeting.
Internal audit
It has been the company’s policy for several years to carry out a programme of financial and operating controls reviews, using
both internal and external resources. However, as there was no dedicated internal audit or risk management function, the
Committee has in previous years reviewed the need for such a function, and concluded that in view of the scope and scale of the
controls review activity and the extent of the independent confirmation obtained through this activity regarding the effectiveness
of the company’s system of internal control, there was no need for a dedicated internal audit resource.
The growth in the size and complexity of the company in recent years has led to a re-consideration and in 2010 it was decided to
create the role of Group Audit and Risk Manager and to appoint a senior manager to fill that role. As a result of this and related
developments such as the prioritisation of financial and operating controls reviews based on the risk register, the Committee
believes that the company now has a function that is substantially equivalent to internal audit and that is expected to become
fully equivalent as the function develops further. 54 /  Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements
AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT (continued)
External auditor
Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) was initially appointed external auditor of the company in 2004.
The Committee regularly reviews the issue of the independence of the external auditor. This review considers the overall
relationship between the auditor and the company, based on feedback from the company’s finance team and from the auditor,
and the nature and extent of non-audit services provided by the auditor, and takes account of the safeguards established by the
auditor against loss of audit independence, including rotation of the audit partner and other key members of the audit team.
The Committee believes that in certain limited circumstances non-audit work may be carried out by the external auditor. The
allocation of non-audit work is considered by reference to the company’s policy on the provision of non-audit services by the
auditor. This policy is aimed at ensuring continued independence. The use of the external auditor for services relating to accounting
systems or financial statements is not permitted, nor are various other services that could give rise to conflicts of interest or other
threats to the auditor’s objectivity that cannot be reduced to an acceptable level by applying safeguards. The Committee
believes that there is non-audit work such as certain assurance and advisory services that may be best performed by the audit
team as a result of their unique knowledge of the company. Any material non-audit work of this nature requires approval by the
Committee. The policy and overall fees paid to our auditor are also reviewed on an annual basis by the Committee.
Deloitte are required to confirm to the Committee that they have both the appropriate independence and objectivity to allow
them to continue to serve the members of the company. The Committee also requires the external auditors to confirm that in
providing non-audit services, they comply with the Ethical Standards for auditors issued by the UK Auditing Practices Board. This
confirmation was received for 2011.
In accordance with the Ethical Standards for Auditors, the audit engagement partner rotates at least every five years. The current
audit engagement partner is Matthew Donaldson who has been in the role since 2009.
The Committee reviews the expertise, performance and effectiveness of the auditor. On the basis of the reviews carried out, the
Committee recommended to the Board that it should propose the reappointment of Deloitte as the external auditor of the
company.

COMPANY RISK FACTORS
Premier’s business may be impacted by various risks leading to failure to achieve strategic targets for growth, loss of financial
standing, cash flow and earnings, and reputation. Not all of these risks are wholly within the company’s control and the company
may be affected by risks which are not yet manifest or reasonably foreseeable.
Effective risk management is critical to achieving our strategic objectives and protecting our assets, personnel and reputation
and therefore Premier has a comprehensive approach to risk management as set out in more detail in the Corporate
Governance Report.
A critical part of the risk management process is to assess the impact and likelihood of risks occurring so that appropriate
mitigation plans can be developed and implemented. Risk severity matrices are developed across Premier’s business to facilitate
assessment of risk. The specific risks identified by departments, project teams, corporate functions and business units are
consolidated and amalgamated to provide an oversight of key risk factors at each level from operations through business unit
management to Executive Committee and Board level.
For all the known risks facing the business, Premier attempts to minimise the likelihood and mitigate the impact. According to
the nature of the risk, Premier may elect to tolerate risk, treat risk with controls and mitigating actions, transfer risk to third parties
or terminate risk by ceasing particular activities or operations. Premier has a zero tolerance to financial fraud or ethics non-
compliance, and ensures that HSES risks are managed to levels that are as low as reasonably practicable, whilst managing
exploration and development risks on a portfolio basis.
The key risk factors identified from this approach are represented in the matrix below and the accompanying table summarises
their potential impacts and our approach to managing them. The assessment of the impact and likelihood takes into account the
risk mitigation measures currently applied.

COMPANY RISK FACTORS (continued)
Key risk factor Risk detail How is it managed?
Health, safety,
environment and
security (HSES)
Major process safety incident or operational
accident, natural disasters, pandemics,
social unrest, civil war.
Consequences may include accidents
resulting in loss of life, injury and/or
significant pollution of the local
environment, destruction of facilities and
disruption to business activities. 
Comprehensive HSES and operations
management systems including emergency
response and oil spill response capability and
asset integrity.
Active security monitoring and management and
regular testing of business continuity plans.
Learning from company and third-party incidents.
Production and
development delivery
Uncertain geology and reservoir
performance leading to lower production
and reserves recovery. Availability of
services including FPSOs and rigs,
availability of technology and engineering
capacity, availability of skilled resources,
maintaining project schedules and costs as
well as fiscal, regulatory, political and other
conditions leading to operational problems
and production loss or development delay.
Consequences may include lower
production and/or recovery of reserves,
production delays, cost overruns and/or
failure to fulfil contractual commitments. 
Geoscience and reservoir engineering
management systems, including rigorous
production forecasting and independent reserves
auditing processes.
Operations, development and project execution
management systems and cost controls together
with capable project teams.
Long-term development planning to ensure
timely access to FPSOs, rigs and other essential
services. 
Exploration success
and reserves addition
Failure to identify and capture acreage and
resource opportunities to provide a
portfolio of drillable exploration prospects
and sufficient development projects to
achieve reserves addition targets.
Consequences may be that specific
exploration programmes may fail to add
reserves and hence value. Failure to
negotiate access rights or close transactions
could slow growth of reserves and
production and lead to loss of competitive
advantage.
Strong portfolio management and alignment with
strategic growth targets. Appropriate balance
between growth by exploration and acquisition.
Exploration management systems including
comprehensive peer review with focus on
geologies in core areas we know well and in
which we can build a competitive advantage.
Focused M&A effort focusing on geographical
and technical areas aligned with our strategy.
Diligence in acquisition process and post-
acquisition integration to ensure targeted returns.
Host government –
political and fiscal
risks
Premier operates in some countries where
political, economic and social transition is
taking place. Developments in politics, laws
and regulations can affect our operations
and earnings.
Consequences may include forced
divestment of assets; limits on production
or cost recovery; import and export
restrictions; international conflicts, including
war, civil unrest and local security concerns
that threaten the safe operation of
company facilities; price controls, tax
increases and other retroactive tax claims;
expropriation of property; cancellation of
contract rights; and increase in regulatory
burden. It is difficult to predict the timing or
severity of these occurrences or their
potential impact.
Premier’s portfolio includes operations in both
low and higher risk environments. Premier
actively monitors the local situation and has
business continuity plans in each area which can
be activated depending on predefined levels
of alert.
Premier strives to be a good corporate citizen
globally, and fosters reputation by strong and
positive relationships with government and
communities where we do business. Premier
engages in respectful industry-wide lobby and
sustainable CSR programmes. Rigorous
adherence to Premier’s business ethics policy and
code of conduct.
Continuous monitoring of the external
environment for emerging risks to the business. Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  57
Key risk factor Risk detail How is it managed?
Commodity price
volatility
Oil and gas prices are affected by global
supply and demand and price can be subject
to significant fluctuations. Factors that
influence these include operational issues,
natural disasters, weather, political instability,
or conflicts and economic conditions or
actions by major oil-exporting countries.
Price fluctuations can affect our business
assumptions and can effect investment
decisions and financial capability. 
Oil and gas hedging programmes to underpin
our financial strength and capacity to fund our
future developments and operations.
Premier investment guidelines ensure that our
development programmes are robust to
downside sensitivity price scenarios.
Organisational
capability
Risk that the capability of the organisation is
not adequate to deliver plans for growth.
The capability of the organisation is a
function of both the strength of its human
resources and its business management
systems. Inadequate systems or lack of
compliance may lead to loss of value and
failure to achieve growth targets. Loss of
personnel to competitors or inability to
attract and retain quality human resources
could affect our operational performance
and delivery of growth strategy.
Premier has created a competitive remuneration
and retention package including bonus and long-
term incentive plans to incentivise loyalty and
good performance from the existing, highly
skilled workforce.
Premier is continuing to strengthen its
organisational capability to achieve strategic
objectives. This includes resource planning,
competency development, training and
development programmes, succession planning
including leadership development.
Continuous strengthening of business
management systems and controls as appropriate
to the size and market position of the company.
Joint venture partner
alignment
Global operations in the oil and gas
industry are conducted in a joint venture
environment. There is a risk that joint
venture partners are not aligned in their
objectives and drivers and this may lead to
inefficiencies and/or delays. Many of our
major projects are operated by our joint
venture partners and our ability to influence
our partners is sometimes limited due to
our small shares in such ventures.
Continuous and regular engagement with
partners in joint ventures in both operated and
non-operated projects. Premier takes strategic
acquisition opportunities where appropriate to
gain a greater degree of influence and control.
Financial discipline
and governance
Risk that sufficient funds are not available to
finance the business. Risk of financial fraud.
Strong financial discipline and balance sheet.
Premier has an established financial management
system to ensure that it is able to maintain an
appropriate level of liquidity and financial
capacity and to manage the level of assessed risk
associated with the financial instruments. Premier
maintains access to capital markets through the
cycle. The management system includes policies
and a delegation of authority manual to
reasonably protect against risk of financial fraud
in the group.
An insurance programme is put in place to
reduce the potential impact of the physical risks
associated with exploration and production
activities. In addition, business interruption cover
is purchased for a proportion of the cash flow
from producing fields. Cash balances are invested
in short-term deposits with minimum A credit
rating banks, AAA managed liquidity funds and
A1/P1 commercial paper, subject to Board
approved limits. 58 /  Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements
NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT
The Nomination Committee presents its report in relation to the financial year ended
31 December 2011.
Composition and role of the Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee meets as and when required and comprises Mike Welton
(Chairman), Joe Darby, Jane Hinkley, David Lindsell, Simon Lockett, Michel Romieu and
Professor David Roberts. The Board considers the membership of the Nomination
Committee to be in compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The Committee met twice in 2011. Formal meetings are held to consider standing items
of business; there is also a significant level of ad hoc discussion between members of the
Committee, particularly when a recruitment exercise is taking place.
The role of the Committee includes:
• reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Board and making recommendations to the Board with regard to any
adjustments that are deemed necessary. This requires an ongoing assessment of the appropriate skills-mix required at Board
level in light of the strategy of the company in the medium-term;
• responsibility for identifying and nominating candidates, subject to Board approval, to fill Board vacancies as and when they
arise and to prepare a description of the role and capabilities required for a particular appointment; and
• reviewing the development and leadership potential of senior executives below Board level and ensuring that appropriate
succession plans are in place for both Board and senior positions.
During 2011, the main focus of the Committee has been on management succession and development. The objectives of this
process are to:
• ensure that the succession pipeline for senior executive and business critical roles in the organisation is adequate;
• ensure the succession is managed smoothly and effectively;
• ensure that talented individuals can maximise their potential;
• identify potential successors and manage succession activity;
• provide a structured approach to developing and preparing possible successors;
• identify ‘at risk’ posts; and
• support the delivery of our diversity agenda.
The meeting in May focused on the senior leadership roles and the meeting in December reported on the work that had been
done to look at the whole population of middle-management positions in the group.
The Committee discussed the results of the succession work carried out and noted that senior and middle-management
throughout the organisation is now being encouraged to discuss the issue of succession, and individual managers now have
performance targets which include a requirement to develop their successors.
The focus of the Committee in this area will now be on ensuring that the group is introducing appropriate training and
development for the next generation of senior management.

REMUNERATION REPORT
Dear fellow shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the 2011 Directors’ Remuneration Report,
for which we are seeking approval from shareholders at our Annual General Meeting.
2011 has been a strong year for Premier, as detailed in the reports of Mike Welton and
Simon Lockett. The results are a consequence of high calibre executive leadership and
the commitment of our employees despite an economic environment that continues to
provide many challenges.
John Orange, the former Chairman of the Committee, stepped down during the year
following his retirement from the Board and I would like to extend my thanks to him for his
considerable contribution to the Committee. The Committee currently comprises Joe Darby,
David Lindsell, Professor David Roberts and me. Whilst the background of our Committee
members is varied, all have many years of Board experience and many also have strong
knowledge of the oil and gas sector. None of the members of the Committee currently hold
a position as an executive director.
Following my appointment as Chairman of the Committee in May 2011, I took the opportunity to meet with our largest shareholders
in December to understand their views in relation to our current remuneration framework, particularly in light of the fact that the
shareholder vote at the last AGM was lower than we had hoped for. Most of the shareholders that we spoke to welcomed our
meeting to help build their trust in the governance of pay at Premier and we certainly found it useful to understand the reasons for
any concerns more fully. In particular, many shareholders appreciated increased clarity in relation to the annual bonus determination
and, in respect of the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), the criteria used for assessing the underlying company performance that
the Committee must be satisfied are fairly reflected in the outcome of the LTIP before awards are paid out under the scheme.
We have addressed some of these concerns in this report and we are currently undertaking a complete review of our remuneration
framework, which will continue into 2012, to ensure it remains effective and appropriate. The Committee’s key challenge in
relation to future policy is to balance the incentivisation of the management team to create further shareholder value against the
need to ensure that this does not put at risk the value created to date and the overall stability and sustainability of the business.
The Remuneration Committee at Premier continues to strive to ensure that our remuneration policy serves shareholder interests
and closely reflects the group’s business strategy, whilst also being mindful of the external focus on executive remuneration.
While our principal role is to recommend to the Board the framework and policy for the remuneration of the company’ s Chairman
and the executive directors, the Committee is sensitive to the levels of the remuneration packages of all our employees across the
group. We have a diverse workforce operating in six countries so our employee remuneration packages must meet local needs,
while respecting our culture and values and reflecting our overall remuneration philosophy. Premier thus operates a similar
philosophy to pay throughout the organisation and all employees will receive awards under the same schemes as those used to
make awards to executive directors. This ensures alignment throughout the organisation and a focus on common business goals.
Reward in the oil and gas sector remains intensely competitive and our pay must reflect the increase in the size and complexity
of our business, particularly in light of recent acquisitions such as the successful purchase of EnCore Oil plc. Our remuneration
policy is designed to provide remuneration packages that will retain and motivate our high performing team and attract new
talent as required. The Committee’s expectation is that the greater part of executive directors’ remuneration will be variable.
Given the long-term nature of our business, executive director remuneration packages are weighted towards long-term
incentives with time horizons of three to six years, and which pay out only if share price performance is strong and the
Committee is satisfied with the company’s underlying performance.
The Committee ensures alignment between senior management and shareholders by encouraging share ownership through formal
shareholding guidelines. The Committee believes that the focus on long-term incentives, long-term performance measures such as
TSR and executive share ownership reinforces effective risk management, encourages focus on shareholder returns, thus aligning
executive interests with the interests of long-term shareholders. This approach is underlined by the requirement that all members
of the senior management team are required to defer half of their LTIP awards into a matching scheme for a further three years.
2011 marks the end of the first full cycle of the LTIP approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2009. £100 invested in Premier at
the start of 2009 was worth £181 by the end of 2011, compared with only £135 if invested in the FTSE All Share Oil & Gas
Producers Index over the same period. In addition, the company’s performance has been in the top quarter of its comparator
group in this period. Premier’s 22 per cent annualised return since 2009 includes the performance for 2011 where the company’s
market value fell by 25 per cent against a background of economic uncertainty. All Premier’s employees, led by the executive
directors, contributed to this long-term performance and will receive share awards under the LTIP scheme. As is detailed later in
the report, the Committee considered other factors in assessing whether the underlying performance of the company was
reflective of these achievements and concluded that it was.
The following sections explain our remuneration policy for executive directors and senior management and sets out individual
payments made to executive directors in relation to the year under review as well as the reasons for this Committee’s decisions.
Yours sincerely
Jane Hinkley
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee

Compliance
This report has been prepared in accordance with schedule 8 of the Companies Act 2006 and the Large and Medium-Sized
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. The company complied with the provisions of the UK
Corporate Governance Code (the Code) regarding best practice on the design of performance-related remuneration. The report
has been divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited information. Part A of the report is not subject to audit. Part B
contains information which has been audited.
In line with the Association of British Insurers’ Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee ensures that the
company’s remuneration policy will not raise environmental, operational, social or governance risks by inadvertently motivating
irresponsible behaviour (e.g. one of the important factors in determining annual bonus performance is the achievement of
specific HSES targets).
Remuneration Committee
The former Committee Chairman, Mr J R W Orange, stepped down from the Committee during the year and Ms I J Hinkley was
appointed Committee Chairman from May 2011. The Committee currently comprises four non-executive directors and met five
times during the year. The members of the Committee and their attendance are summarised below:

REMUNERATION REPORT (continued)
Part A: The information in this section of the report is not audited
Remuneration policy
Executive directors are eligible to receive base salary, annual bonus, benefits, awards under the company’s long-term incentive
schemes (in which all employees participate) and pension provision. The package is structured such that the greater part of total
remuneration is delivered through performance-related incentives and, in particular, long-term share-based incentives. These
incentive schemes are designed to align the interests of senior management with those of shareholders and establish a clear link
between pay and performance. The key elements of the remuneration packages for executive directors are set out below.
Summary of executive director remuneration policy and structure
Component Objective(s) Details
Salary • Support recruitment and retention • Adjustments are effective 1 January
• Aim to position around the median of the relevant
market
Pension and benefits • Provide competitive benefit and • Executive directors receive a final salary pension or

assessment of underlying performance
• Performance is measured over a total of up to six years
Share ownership guidelines • Provides alignment with shareholders • Executive directors are required to acquire a
shareholding worth at least 100 per cent of base salary
(200 per cent for the CEO) through the retention of
deferred bonus and LTIP shares
The company’s remuneration policy for executive directors is to provide remuneration packages which reward employees fairly
and responsibly for their contributions and which deliver superior remuneration for superior performance. Remuneration
packages are intended to be sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate individuals of the quality required to achieve
the group’s objectives and thereby enhance shareholder value. The Committee takes account of the level of remuneration paid
in respect of comparable positions in similar companies and also pay and conditions throughout the remainder of the group.
Remuneration for senior management is significantly geared towards performance-oriented pay. For example, at ‘median’
performance (see chart for assumptions) approximately 61 per cent of the CEO’s remuneration package is delivered through
variable components, rising to approximately 93 per cent at ‘stretch’ performance.

Performance Share and Matching Awards vest in full with
share price growth of 20 per cent per annum compound.
The value of all long-term incentives is their net present value. Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  65
Base salary
Base salaries are reviewed annually from 1 January. Whilst aiming to position base salaries around the median of comparable
companies, the Committee also considers whether the overall remuneration package (including incentives) is competitive for
positions in similar companies within the oil and gas industry as well as other broadly similar sized companies across other
industries, taking into account performance.
Whilst the Committee does not slavishly follow the market mid-point for salaries, it does review market data as a point of
reference and it has been aware for several years that base salaries for both the CEO and for other executive directors are well
below industry average levels for comparable roles (between 13 per cent and 24 per cent), partly because of the company’s
policy to focus remuneration towards long-term incentives and partly because of the company’s recent rapid growth.
Hence, last year, the Committee Chairman wrote to shareholders detailing the salary increases for 2011, which went some of the
way towards correcting this positioning. Having taken into account salary increases both in the external market and within the
group as well as the performance of the executive team at Premier, the Committee has decided to increase executive director
salaries by approximately 6 per cent from January 2012. In making this decision, the Committee was particularly mindful of the
climate and pressures surrounding executive remuneration but was keen to ensure that the salaries we offer do not put us at a
greater competitive disadvantage in the future. The salary increases for 2012, which are in line with those made to our UK
employees, will continue to bring salaries towards market median, but despite this, executive director salaries remain below this
target when compared to both companies in the same sector and companies of a similar size across all sectors. The Committee
will continue to review salaries annually to ensure they remain appropriate, particularly given the current highly competitive talent
market in this sector and the fact that it is critical to our future success that we retain our key talent.
The salaries of the executive directors are as follows:
Salary from Salary from 
1 January 2011 1 January 2012 Percentage increase
Director Position (£) (£) (%)
S C Lockett Chief Executive 500,000 530,000 6.0
R A Allan Director – Asia 310,000 330,000 6.5
A R C Durrant Finance Director 340,000 360,000 5.9
N Hawkings Operations Director 310,000 330,000 6.5
A G Lodge Exploration Director 310,000 330,000 6.5
The company’s policy for all other employees is to target salaries at the upper quartile of comparable positions within the
industry. The Committee believes that this positioning is appropriate given the competitive market that exists within the industry
in which Premier operates.
Annual bonus scheme
Executive directors are eligible to participate in non-pensionable discretionary bonus arrangements subject to the achievement
of challenging corporate one-year targets and Committee discretion relating to overall company performance. The achievement
of these targets and overall company performance is carefully assessed each year by the Committee. Bonuses for executive
directors are subject to a maximum of 100 per cent of base salary. No major revisions to the annual bonus plan structure are
proposed for 2012.
The Committee sets targets on the basis of a balanced scorecard comprising KPIs and other corporate objectives. The main
elements of the scorecard for 2012 are HSES, production and development, exploration and exploration new ventures, finance
and business development.
Payout is determined with reference to the balanced scorecard, subject to the Committee’s discretion based on a broader
assessment of overall company performance. In assessing 2011 performance, the Committee has reviewed performance in
multiple aspects of the five categories below against specific targets. Targets were set at the beginning of 2011 and designed to
be stretching but achievable. We do not disclose the exact targets themselves for reasons of commercial sensitivity, however
performance in relation to threshold, base and stretch levels is detailed below: 66 /  Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements

• Continue to develop Premier’s people and
the process/system within which they work 3
In addition to the achievement of specific targets, the Committee considered the wider overall company performance and
awarded annual bonuses of 55 per cent of salary to the executive directors. Awards are therefore as follows:

Executive director Cash (£) Deferred shares (£) Total (£)
S C Lockett 250,000 25,000 275,000
R A Allan 155,000 15,500 170,500

N Hawkings 155,000 15,500 170,500
A G Lodge 155,000 15,500 170,500
Significant bonuses are subject to partial deferral in shares. The Committee’s policy for executive directors and other senior
management is that any annual bonus earned above 50 per cent of salary is deferred in shares for three years. Deferred bonus
shares remain subject to a ‘bad leaver’ provision such that shares would lapse in the event that an executive director was to leave
to join a competitor. Annual bonus awards are subject to a clawback provision in the event of a material misstatement of the
company’s financial results, gross misconduct or error in the calculation of performance conditions. Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  67
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Executive directors are eligible to participate in the LTIP , the company’s primary long-term incentive plan in which all employees
are eligible to participate, thereby encouraging throughout the company a focus on longer-term performance and alignment
with shareholders. The executive directors are also eligible to participate in a Share Incentive Plan and a Save As You Earn Scheme.
The LTIP , approved by shareholders at the 2009 AGM, is structured to reinforce the delivery of strong share price growth and
relative stock market out-performance over the long-term. Under this share-based plan, performance is assessed over a
minimum of three years, and over six years once the matching scheme is included. Vesting is based on a combination of the
absolute change in the company’s equity value per share and the company’s relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR = share price
plus dividends) performance against peers and only starts for performance above median. The Committee considers that these
two criteria are an appropriate performance measure for the LTIP because the first captures the absolute return delivered to
shareholders and the second measures performance on a relative basis, thereby negating the impact of short-term volatility such
as oil price movements.
To optimise the link between reward and performance, the plan has certain safeguards: LTIP awards vest only if the Committee is
satisfied that the recorded TSR is reflective of the underlying performance of the company, the amount that participants may
receive is subject to a cap at the discretion of the Committee, and LTIP awards are subject to clawback in the event of a material
misstatement of the company’s financial results, gross misconduct or error in the calculation of the performance conditions. In
assessing the underlying performance of the company the Committee takes into account, amongst other factors, the company’s:
• return on invested capital;
• reserve replacement;
• cash flow;
• earnings per share growth; and
• health and safety record.
Awards under the LTIP comprise three elements: Equity Pool Awards and Performance Share Awards that each vest after a three-
year performance period, and Matching Awards that vest after a further three-year performance period:
• Equity Pool Awards vest after three years and are based on a share of a pool which is subject to annualised growth in the
company’s equity value per share – 50 per cent of the vested award is deferred for a further three years;
• Performance Share Awards vest after three years based on the company’s TSR relative to a comparator group of international
oil and gas companies – 50 per cent of the vested award is deferred for a further three years; and
• Deferred Equity Pool Awards and Performance Share Awards are eligible for a Matching Award of up to 2.5x the number of
shares deferred, vesting after a further three years based on the company’s TSR relative to a comparator group of international
oil and gas companies.
The illustration below helps to explain the operation of a single cycle under the LTIP:
Each component is described in more detail below. No revisions are planned to the LTIP structure in 2012. We will undertake a review
of our long-term incentives in 2012 to ensure they remain appropriate. Any changes will relate to awards made in 2013 onwards.

Equity Pool Awards
At the start of each three-year performance period executive directors are allocated an entitlement to an Equity Pool. In 2011 the
Chief Executive was granted an entitlement to 6 per cent of the LTIP Equity Pool, with other executive directors each granted an
entitlement to 4.25 per cent. The value of the entitlement is then calculated at the end of the performance period based on the
final value of the LTIP Equity Pool and is delivered in shares. 50 per cent of the shares are released at the end of the performance
period, with the balance deferred for a further three years and eligible for a match under the LTIP Matching Award. For
participants below senior management, the deferral period is restricted to six months, unless the employee elects to extend the
deferral period to three years in return for a grant of an LTIP Matching Award.
The value of the LTIP Equity Pool is based on the growth in the company’s equity value per share over the performance period.
If the company’s compound annualised growth is equal to 10 per cent per annum, 1 per cent of the growth will be credited to
the LTIP Equity Pool. For growth of 20 per cent per annum or more, 2.5 per cent of the gain will be credited. All employees are
eligible to participate in the LTIP Equity Pool. As of 31 December 2011, only 48 per cent of the 2011 LTIP Equity Pool had
been allocated.
Equity Pool funding schedule
At the end of the performance period, the Committee has the discretion to scale back the size of the LTIP Equity Pool if it is not
satisfied that the growth in equity value per share is reflective of underlying financial and operational performance. Furthermore,
an individual’s entitlement is capped at 100 per cent of salary, subject to the Committee’s discretion to exceed the cap,
potentially up to the full value warranted by the formulaic funding schedule, provided the Committee is satisfied that there has
been a long-term underlying improvement in the performance of the company, taking into account the five criteria detailed on
page 67. In particular, the Committee may:
• increase the cap to 200 per cent of salary for growth in equity value per share of up to 15 per cent per annum, if the formulaic
allocation warrants payment above the 100 per cent salary cap; and
• for growth in equity value per share of more than 15 per cent per annum, permit the full value of the individual entitlement
(i.e. as if no cap applied) if the formulaic allocation warrants payment.
Performance Share Award
Each year, executive directors are granted conditional awards of LTIP Performance Shares of up to 125 per cent of salary (150 per
cent for the CEO). Awards vest subject to the company’s three-year TSR performance relative to a comparator group of oil and
gas companies. No awards vest if the company’s TSR is below median, 25 per cent vest at median and full vesting is at upper
quartile. The oil sector comparators have been selected on the basis of their similarity to Premier with regard to several factors
including business mix and geographic location. At the end of the performance period, the Committee has the discretion to
scale back the vesting of LTIP Performance Shares if it is not satisfied that the company’s TSR performance is reflective of
underlying financial and operational performance, taking into account the five criteria detailed on page 67.

Matching Award
For executive directors and senior management, 50 per cent of the shares vesting from the LTIP Equity Pool Award and LTIP
Performance Share Award are subject to compulsory deferral over three years and are eligible for a potential match of up to
2.5:1 dependent on the TSR performance of the company against the same comparator group used for coterminous LTIP
Performance Share Awards. However, full vesting will occur only if the company’s TSR is at or above the upper decile with 25 per

Remuneration in 2011 (continued)
The 2011 executive director remuneration package comprises several elements, some of which are paid during the year (salary
and benefits), some of which are earned for the year but paid in the next year (annual bonus), some of which are granted during
the year but not released until three years later (LTIP Performance Shares, LTIP Equity Pool awards and LTIP Matching Shares) and
some of which are earned for the year but will not benefit the director until retirement (pension). Whilst there is no perfect
approach to summarising the value of such a multi-faceted pay package, the summary above is considered by the Committee to
be the simplest and most consistent approach for assessing the value of the Premier package.
Shareholding guidelines
Formal shareholding guidelines exist which encourage the executive directors and other members of the Executive Committee to
retain no less than 50 per cent of the net value of shares vesting under the company’ s deferred bonus and long-term incentive
arrangements, until such time as they have achieved a holding worth 100 per cent of salary (200 per cent for the CEO). As the graph
below shows, all the executive directors hold shares with a value substantially higher than these threshold shareholding requirements.
Shareholdings at 31 December 2011 against share ownership guidelines
Note:
Includes value of Deferred Awards under the annual bonus and Asset and Equity Plan (where performance conditions have been achieved and such awards
are subject to a holding period). The value of shareholdings is based on the closing price of a Premier share on 31 December 2011 (£3.63).
TSR performance
The chart below compares the value of £100 invested in Premier shares, including re-invested dividends, on 31 December 2006
compared to the equivalent investment in the FTSE All Share Oil & Gas Producers Index, over the last five financial years. The
FTSE All Share Oil & Gas Producers Index has been chosen as it comprises companies who are exposed to broadly similar risks
and opportunities as Premier.
Five-year TSR performance
This graph looks at the value, by 31 December 2011, of £100 invested in Premier Oil plc five years earlier on 31 December 2006 compared with £100 invested
in the FTSE All Share Oil & Gas Producers Index (share price growth plus dividends reinvested on ex-div date).

Sourcing of shares and dilution limits
Awards under all the company’s share schemes may be met using a combination of market purchases, financed by the company
through the Premier Oil plc Employee Benefit Trust, and newly-issued shares. The company complies with the Association of
British Insurers’ recommended guidelines on shareholder dilution through employee share schemes: awards under the group’s
discretionary schemes which may be satisfied by new issue shares must not exceed 5 per cent of the company’s issued share
capital in any rolling 10-year period, and the total of all awards satisfied via new issue shares under all plans must not exceed
10 per cent of the company’s issued share capital in any rolling 10-year period.
As of 31 December 2011, 1,973,998 shares were held by the Employee Benefit Trust (2010: 6,887,880
1
) and the commitments to
issue new shares are summarised below:

Share numbers have been adjusted to reflect the 4:1 share split which took place in May 2011.
Executive directors’ contracts of service
Details of the service contracts of the executive directors of the company are as follows:
Unexpired term Potential
Director Contract date Notice period of contract termination payment
S C Lockett 09.12.03 12 months Rolling contract 12 months’ salary and benefits
R A Allan 09.12.03 12 months Rolling contract 12 months’ salary and benefits
A R C Durrant 01.07.05 12 months Rolling contract 12 months’ salary and benefits
N Hawkings 23.03.06 12 months Rolling contract 12 months’ salary and benefits
A G Lodge 20.04.09 12 months Rolling contract 12 months’ salary and benefits
The service contract of each executive director may be terminated on 12 months’ notice in writing by either party, in accordance
with current market practice. In such an event, the compensation commitments in respect of their contracts could amount to one
year’s remuneration based on base salary and benefits in kind and pension rights during the notice period. In line with normal
market practice, an individual may receive an annual bonus for the proportion of a financial year worked before cessation of
employment but there will be no right to any bonus for any period of notice not worked. There are provisions for termination
with less than 12 months’ notice by the company in certain circumstances. If such circumstances were to arise, the executive
director concerned would have no claim against the company for damages or any other remedy in respect of the termination.
The Committee would apply general principles of mitigation to any payment made to a departing executive director and would
consider each case on an individual basis.
External appointments
Executive directors are entitled to accept non-executive appointments outside the company providing that the Board’s approval
is sought. As a result of the acquisition of EnCore Oil plc, the company has a 30 per cent interest in Egdon Resources plc (Egdon)
and is entitled to board representation. Mr Lodge was appointed to the board of Egdon as a non-executive director on 9 March
2012 and will be donating all fees retained to charity.
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors have letters of appointment, which are all effective for a period of three years (subject to annual
reappointment by the members in General Meeting), all of which have a notice period of three months.

Non-executive directors (continued)
The company’s Articles of Association provide that the remuneration paid to non-executive directors is to be determined by the
Board within the limits set by the shareholders. Fees for non-executives are reviewed at least every two years, having regard to
the size of the company and the time commitments of the non-executives. Fees paid to non-executive directors for the year
under review were as follows:

Mr R A Allan sacrificed £4,650 of his salary into his pension scheme. He was paid a non-bonusable salary supplement of £7,900, and a target funding
payment of £39,500 as part of his pension arrangements. Mr Allan received £196,000 of expatriate benefits during the year and was also paid a non-
pensionable and non-bonusable overseas premium of £77,500, relating to his position in Singapore. The company deducts a hypothetical tax equivalent
to UK tax rates on Mr Allan’s salary, annual bonus and long-term incentive payments. This is offset against local Singapore tax due. As the maximum tax
rate in Singapore is lower than in the UK, the difference is retained by the company.

Pension schemes
The company operates a group personal pension plan in the UK together with a funded, registered, defined benefit pension
scheme, the Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan (the Scheme) which was closed to new members in 1997. The
Scheme provides a pension on broadly a fiftieths accrual basis of up to two-thirds salary at the normal pension age of 60.
Benefits are actuarially reduced on early retirement before age 60 and pensions in payment increase in line with the lower of
inflation, or 5 per cent per annum.
The company has operated its own cap on pensionable earnings since April 2006, when the external cap was removed. In the
Scheme, the cap is determined at 1 January each year and, for the year to 31 December 2011, this was set at £123,600, and will
increase to £129,600 for the year to 31 December 2012.
The company has agreed to provide Messrs S C Lockett, R A Allan, A R C Durrant, N Hawkings and A G Lodge with a pension
substantially as if they were contributing members of the Scheme and, in regard to service completed subsequent to their
appointment as directors, not subject to the cap. The value of this target pension provision is made available at each director’s
option in the form of an enhanced level of pension contributions and/or a non-pensionable salary supplement. Regular reviews
are carried out to assess the extent to which the payments already made to each director are projected to be sufficient to
provide the accrued component of their target pension; where such reviews indicate a shortfall, the company provides an
additional, non-pensionable target funding payment.
In respect of 2011, Mr A R C Durrant elected to receive a salary supplement, Mr A G Lodge elected to receive pension
contributions whilst Messrs S C Lockett, R A Allan and N Hawkings elected for a combination of the two.
Messrs R A Allan, N Hawkings and A G Lodge are members of the company’s group personal pension plan whilst Mr S C Lockett
is a member of the Scheme and also has a personal pension policy. Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  75

Notes:
– The amounts of accrued pension under (a) and (c) represent the accrued pension entitlements of the director as at the stated dates.
– The transfer values under (b), (d) and (f) have been calculated in line with the Occupational Pension Schemes (Transfer Values) (Amendment) Regulations
2008 (SI 2008/1050).
– The increases under (e) are principally due to the additional pension accrued over the year.
– The amounts under (f) represent the increase in value of the directors’ benefits in terms of the value, on the transfer value basis in force at the end of the
year, of the excess of the end-year accrued benefits over the start-year accrued benefits (as revalued by price inflation) less contributions by the directors.
– The values stated above correspond with the target level of final salary pension provision; in practice, the pension benefits for these directors are
principally established through individual money purchase arrangements and salary supplements.
– In addition to the current provision noted above, Mr R A Allan is entitled to a deferred pension under the Scheme in respect of a prior service period with
the company between September 1986 and November 1999.
– Members of the Scheme have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions; none of the directors have elected to do so.

Notes:
* On 29 March 2010, these awards were changed from conditional awards of shares to restricted shares. Some of the shares were sold to pay income tax
and National Insurance contributions payable by Messrs S C Lockett, A R C Durrant and A G Lodge upon the accelerated vesting of the awards, but the
amounts received from the sale remain subject to clawback in the event of the participant leaving Premier other than as a ‘good leaver’. In the case of
Mr R A Allan, who as an expatriate is not subject to UK tax, a percentage of the shares were withheld equal to the percentage tax rate that would have
applied had he been subject to UK income tax. These shares reverted to the Employee Benefit Trust and the company will pay any overseas duties
payable by Mr Allan as a result of the vesting of his shares, but the amount paid remains subject to clawback if Mr Allan leaves Premier other than as a
‘good leaver’. The remaining shares are held in a nominee account within the Employee Benefit Trust until the end of the original deferral period, and are
forfeitable if the director leaves other than as a ‘good leaver’.

The first LTIP Equity Pool cycle (the 2009 cycle) completed its performance period on 31 December 2011. As stated within
the rules of the LTIP , the base valuation for the 2009 cycle was averaged over the eight-month period from 1 October 2008 to
31 May 2009 (with adjustment for the rights issue in May 2009). The terminal valuation was averaged over the three-month period
from 1 October 2011 to 31 December 2011. Over the performance period, the company’ s market value increased from £871 million
to £1,703 million, equivalent to growth of 29.6 per cent per annum, generating an aggregate LTIP Equity Pool valued at
£20.8 million. The Committee considered the long-term underlying improvement in the performance of the company and were
satisfied that the LTIP performance was reflective of the performance of the company for the same period. As a result, the Equity
Pool vested in January 2012, and £20.8 million will be distributed between all LTIP participants, with 50 per cent released in
shares and 50 per cent in deferred shares.

Shares vested on 19 January 2012. The mid-market closing price on the date of vesting was 425.4p.
The first LTIP Performance Share Award cycle (the 2009 cycle) completed its performance period on 31 December 2011. Over the
period, the company’s TSR relative to its peers was in the upper quartile. Having taken into consideration the underlying financial
and operational performance of the company, including the company’s return on invested capital, reserve replacement, cash
flow, earnings per share growth and health and safety record, the Committee was satisfied that the results warranted a vesting of
100 per cent of the Performance Share Awards. 50 per cent of the vested shares were released in January 2012 with the
remaining 50 per cent deferred. Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  79
Outstanding awards under previous long-term incentive arrangements
Asset and Equity Plan (AEP)
The AEP preceded the LTIP as the company’s main long-term incentive and expired in 2009. The AEP has two elements: the
Asset Pool and the Equity Pool. The value of the Asset Pool is based on the increase in the net asset value per share of the
company over a three-year period and the value of the Equity Pool is based on the increase in equity value per share of the
company over a three-year period. In both cases, no pool is created for growth (in asset value or share price) of less than 10 per
cent per annum. At growth of 10 per cent per annum, the pools are funded by 1 per cent of the growth. The funding of the pools
is capped at 2.5 per cent of the growth at growth of 20 per cent per annum. The funding rate of the pools increases on a straight-
line basis between these two points. In addition, the vesting of awards is subject to the Committee being satisfied that there has
been satisfactory improvement in the performance of the company.
The pools are allocated to eligible employees based on their pro rata entitlement. 50 per cent of vested AEP awards are
released in shares at the end of the performance period. The remaining 50 per cent is deferred in shares over three years and are
eligible for a Matching Award which vests subject to the company’s three-year TSR relative to a comparator group of oil and gas
companies (i.e. on the same basis as LTIP Matching Awards).
The last AEP award (the 2008 cycle) covered the three-year performance period 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2010. 50 per
cent of the vested 2008 AEP awards were released in shares during 2011 and 50 per cent were deferred. Matching Awards were
granted during the year equal to 2.5x the Deferred Awards. The details of the awards to the executive directors are as follows:

Notes:
* On 29 March 2010, these awards were changed from conditional awards of shares to restricted shares. Some of the shares were sold to pay income tax
and National Insurance contributions payable by Messrs S C Lockett, A R C Durrant, N Hawkings and A G Lodge upon the accelerated vesting of the
awards, but the amounts received from the sale remain subject to clawback in the event of the participant leaving Premier other than as a ‘good leaver’.
In the case of Mr R A Allan, who as an expatriate is not subject to UK tax, a percentage of the shares were withheld equal to the percentage tax rate that
would have applied had he been subject to UK income tax. These shares reverted to the Trust and the company will pay any overseas duties payable by
Mr Allan as a result of the vesting of his shares, but the amount paid remains subject to clawback if Mr Allan leaves Premier other than as a ‘good leaver’.
The remaining shares are held in a nominee account within the Employee Benefit Trust until the end of the original deferral period, and are forfeitable if
the director leaves other than as a ‘good leaver’.

Shares released net from the Employee Benefit Trust on 13 January 2011.

The number of Deferred Shares and Matching Award shares awarded under the Asset and Equity Plan were adjusted to reflect the 4:1 share split which
took place in May 2011. The adjusted numbers are quoted in the table above.
2
There are no performance criteria for the Deferred Shares.
3
Matching Awards granted are the maximum award possible under the Matching Award scheme, subject to performance criteria based on TSR against a
comparator group of approximately 33 listed companies in the oil and gas sector. Full vesting requires upper decile performance.

Awards vested 19 January 2012 and were released net from the Employee Benefit Trust.
5
Awards vested 19 January 2012. The mid-market closing price on the date of vesting was 425.4p.
Conditional Share Awards
Mr A G Lodge was awarded a Conditional Share Award equivalent in value to the shares he forfeited at his employer when he
left to join the company. This award was considered essential to induce Mr Lodge to join the company. Vesting of the awards is
contingent on Mr Lodge remaining in employment at the vesting date, but is not dependent on any further performance-related
measures. Details of the Conditional Share Award are set out below:

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and
regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors are
required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as
adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent company financial
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting
Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period.
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will
continue in business.
In preparing the group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 – ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’
requires that directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and
understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial
performance; and
• make an assessment of the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the
company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the
company’s website (www.premier-oil.com). Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation
taken as a whole; and
• the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ Report, includes a fair review of the development and
performance of the business and the position of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a
whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
General information
Premier Oil plc is a limited company incorporated in Scotland and listed on the London Stock Exchange. The address of the registered
office is Premier Oil plc, 4th Floor, Saltire Court, 20 Castle T errace, Edinburgh, EH1 2EN. The principal activities of the company and its
subsidiaries (the group) are oil and gas exploration and production in the North Sea, Asia and Middle East, Africa and Pakistan.
These financial statements are presented in US dollars since that is the currency in which the majority of the group’s transactions
are denominated.
Adoption of new and revised standards
There are no new or amended standards or interpretations adopted with effect from 1 January 2011 that have a material impact
on the group’s annual results.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been
applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the
European Union):
• IFRS 1 (amended) – ‘Severe Hyperinflation and Removal of Fixed Dates for First-Time Adopters’
• IFRS 7 (amended) – ‘Disclosures – Transfers of Financial Assets’
• IFRS 9 – ‘Financial Instruments’
• IFRS 10 – ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’
• IFRS 11 – ‘Joint Arrangements’
• IFRS 12 – ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’
• IFRS 13 – ‘Fair Value Measurement’
• IAS 1 (amended) – ‘Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income’
• IAS 12 (amended) – ‘Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets’
• IAS 19 (revised) – ‘Employee Benefits’
• IAS 27 (revised) – ‘Separate Financial Statements’
• IAS 28 (revised) – ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’
• IFRIC 20 – ‘Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine’
IFRS 9 – ‘Financial Instruments’ is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015, rather than 1 January 2013
as originally intended, with transitional arrangements depending upon the date of initial application. The group has not yet
decided the date of its initial application and has not yet completed its evaluation of the effect of adoption. The new standard
has not yet been adopted by the European Union.
Other than to expand certain disclosures within the financial statements, the directors do not expect that the adoption of the other
standards and interpretations listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the group in future periods.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted
by the European Union.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention except for the revaluation of financial instruments and
certain oil and gas properties at the transition date to IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. Further information relating to the going concern
assumption is provided in the Financial Review.
During the year, management responsibility for the group’s activities in Africa was transferred from the former North Sea and
West Africa business unit to the Middle East-Pakistan business unit. The segmental information for the comparative year
contained within these financial statements has been re-presented to reflect this change.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and entities controlled by the
company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the company has the power to govern
the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of
acquisition. Any excess/deficiency of the cost of acquisition over/below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is
recognised as goodwill/excess of fair value over cost.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the income statement from the effective date
of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  85
Basis of consolidation (continued)
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line
with those used by other members of the group.
All significant inter-company transactions and balances between group entities are eliminated on consolidation.
Interest in joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject
to joint control.
Where a group company undertakes its activities under joint venture arrangements directly, the group’s shares of jointly
controlled assets and any liabilities incurred jointly with other venturers are recognised in the financial statements of the relevant
company and classified according to their nature.
Liabilities and expenses incurred directly in respect of interests in jointly controlled assets are accounted for on an accrual basis.
Income from the sale or use of the group’s share of the output of jointly controlled assets, and its share of joint venture expenses,
are recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transactions will flow to/from the group and
their amount can be measured reliably.
Joint venture arrangements which involve the establishment of a separate entity in which each venturer has an interest are
referred to as jointly controlled entities. The group reports its interests in jointly controlled entities using proportionate
consolidation – the group’s share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of jointly controlled entities are combined with
the equivalent items in the consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis.
Where the group transacts with its jointly controlled entities, unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the
group’s interest in the joint venture.
Sales revenue and other income
Sales of petroleum production are recognised when goods are delivered or the title has passed to the customer.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Oil and gas assets
The company applies the successful efforts method of accounting for exploration and evaluation (E&E) costs, having regard to
the requirements of IFRS 6 –’Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources’.
(a) Exploration and evaluation assets
Under the successful efforts method of accounting, all licence acquisition, exploration and appraisal costs are initially
capitalised in well, field or specific exploration cost centres as appropriate, pending determination. Expenditure incurred
during the various exploration and appraisal phases is then written off unless commercial reserves have been established or
the determination process has not been completed.
Pre-licence costs
Costs incurred prior to having obtained the legal rights to explore an area are expensed directly to the income statement as
they are incurred.
Exploration and evaluation costs
Costs of E&E are initially capitalised as E&E assets. Payments to acquire the legal right to explore, costs of technical services
and studies, seismic acquisition, exploratory drilling and testing are capitalised as intangible E&E assets.
Tangible assets used in E&E activities (such as the group’s vehicles, drilling rigs, seismic equipment and other property, plant
and equipment used by the company’s exploration function) are classified as property, plant and equipment. However, to the
extent that such a tangible asset is consumed in developing an intangible E&E asset, the amount reflecting that
consumption is recorded as part of the cost of the intangible asset. Such intangible costs include directly attributable
overhead, including the depreciation of property, plant and equipment utilised in E&E activities, together with the cost of
other materials consumed during the exploration and evaluation phases.
E&E costs are not amortised prior to the conclusion of appraisal activities.
Treatment of E&E assets at conclusion of appraisal activities
Intangible E&E assets related to each exploration licence/prospect are carried forward, until the existence (or otherwise) of
commercial reserves has been determined subject to certain limitations including review for indications of impairment. If
commercial reserves have been discovered, the carrying value, after any impairment loss, of the relevant E&E assets, is then
reclassified as development and production assets. If, however, commercial reserves have not been found, the capitalised
costs are charged to expense after conclusion of appraisal activities. 86 /  Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Oil and gas assets (continued)
(b) Development and production assets
Development and production assets are accumulated generally on a field-by-field basis and represent the cost of
developing the commercial reserves discovered and bringing them into production, together with the E&E expenditures
incurred in finding commercial reserves transferred from intangible E&E assets, as outlined in accounting policy (a) above.
The cost of development and production assets also includes the cost of acquisitions and purchases of such assets, directly
attributable overheads, finance costs capitalised, and the cost of recognising provisions for future restoration and
decommissioning.
Depreciation of producing assets
The net book values of producing assets are depreciated generally on a field-by-field basis using the unit-of-production
method by reference to the ratio of production in the year and the related commercial reserves of the field, taking into
account future development expenditures necessary to bring those reserves into production.
Producing assets are generally grouped with other assets that are dedicated to serving the same reserves for depreciation
purposes, but are depreciated separately from producing assets that serve other reserves.
Pipelines are depreciated on a unit-of-throughput basis.
(c) Impairment of development and production assets
An impairment test is performed whenever events and circumstances, arising during the development or production phase,
indicate that the carrying value of a development or production asset may exceed its recoverable amount.
The carrying value is compared against the expected recoverable amount of the asset, generally by reference to the present
value of the future net cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves. The cash generating unit
applied for impairment test purposes is generally the field, except that a number of field interests may be grouped as a
single cash generating unit where the cash flows of each field are interdependent.
Any impairment identified is charged to the income statement as additional depreciation. Where conditions giving rise to
impairment subsequently reverse, the effect of the impairment charge is also reversed as a credit to the income statement,
net of any depreciation that would have been charged since the impairment.
(d) Acquisitions, asset purchases and disposals
Acquisitions of oil and gas properties are accounted for under the acquisition method when the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed constitute a business.
Transactions involving the purchase of an individual field interest, or a group of field interests, that do not constitute a
business, are treated as asset purchases irrespective of whether the specific transactions involve the transfer of the field
interests directly or the transfer of an incorporated entity. Accordingly, no goodwill and no deferred tax gross up arises, and
the consideration is allocated to the assets and liabilities purchased on an appropriate basis.
Proceeds on disposal are applied to the carrying amount of the specific intangible asset or development and production
assets disposed of and any surplus is recorded as a gain on disposal in the income statement.
(e) Decommissioning
Provision for decommissioning is recognised in full when the related facilities are installed. The amount recognised is the
present value of the estimated future expenditure. A corresponding amount equivalent to the provision is also recognised as
part of the cost of the related oil and gas property. This is subsequently depreciated as part of the capital costs of the
production facilities. Any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure is dealt with prospectively as an
adjustment to the provision and the oil and gas property. The unwinding of the discount is included as a finance cost.
Inventories
Inventories, except for petroleum products, are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Petroleum products and
under and overlifts of crude oil are recorded at net realisable value, under inventories and other debtors or creditors respectively. Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  87
Tax
The tax expense/credit represents the sum of the tax currently payable/recoverable and deferred tax movements during the year.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes
items that are never taxable or deductible. The group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted
for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences
and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which
deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises
from goodwill/excess of fair value over cost or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets
and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates,
and interests in joint ventures, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is
probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. The group reassesses its
unrecognised deferred tax asset each year taking into account changes in oil and gas prices, the group’s proven and probable
reserve profile and forecast capital and operating expenditures.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is
realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in
the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the
deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current
tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the group intends to settle its current tax
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Translation of foreign currencies
In the accounts of individual companies, transactions denominated in foreign currencies, being currencies other than the
functional currency, are recorded in the local currency at actual exchange rates as of the dates of the transactions. Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange
prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign
currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Any gain or loss arising from a
change in exchange rate subsequent to the dates of the transactions is included as an exchange gain or loss in the income
statement. Non-monetary assets held at historic cost are translated at the date of purchase and are not retranslated.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the
balance sheet date. Income and expense items are generally translated at the average exchange rates for the year. Exchange
differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences
are recognised as income or as expenses in the year in which the operation is disposed of.
Group retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to state-
managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution plans where the group’s obligations
under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit plan.
The group operates a defined benefit pension scheme, which requires contributions to be made to a separately administered
fund. The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried
out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive
income. Past service cost is also recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is
amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation
as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of plan assets. Any asset resulting from this
calculation is limited to unrecognised past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future
contributions to the plan. 88 /  Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Royalties
Royalties are charged as production costs to the income statement in the year in which the related production is recognised as
income.
Leasing
Rentals payable for assets under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the group’s balance sheet when the group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges,
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis to the
income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that
they are not settled in the year in which they arise.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly relating to the construction or production of a qualifying capital project under construction are
capitalised and added to the project cost during construction until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their
intended use, i.e. when they are capable of commercial production. Where the funds used to finance a project form part of
general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general
borrowings of the group during the period. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in
which they are incurred.
Trade payables
Trade payables are stated at their nominal value.
Derivative financial instruments
The group uses derivative financial instruments (derivatives) to manage its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange
rates, interest rates and oil price fluctuations.
All derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at cost, including transaction costs. Derivatives are subsequently carried
at fair value. Apart from those derivatives designated as qualifying cash flow hedging instruments, all changes in fair value are
recorded as financial income or expense in the year in which they arise.
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedging relationships may be of three types: fair value hedges are hedges of particular
risks that may change the fair value of a recognised asset or liability; cash flow hedges are hedges of particular risks that may
change the amount or timing of future cash flows; and hedges of net investment in a foreign entity are hedges of particular risks
that may change the carrying value of the net assets of a foreign entity. Currently the group only has cash flow hedge
relationships.
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict conditions on documentation, probability of
occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement. If these conditions are not met, then the relationship does not
qualify for hedge accounting. In this case the hedging instrument and the hedged item are reported independently as if there
were no hedging relationship. In particular any derivatives are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value included in
financial income or expense.
For qualifying cash flow hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. The portion of any change in fair value that is
an effective hedge is included in equity, and any remaining ineffective portion is reported in financial income. If the hedging
relationship is the hedge of a firm commitment or highly probable forecasted transaction, the cumulative changes of fair value of
the hedging instrument that have been recorded in equity are included in the initial carrying value of the asset or liability at the
time it is recognised. For all other qualifying cash flow hedges, the cumulative changes of fair value of the hedging instrument
that have been recorded in equity are included in financial income at the time when the forecasted transaction affects net income.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or non-derivative host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when
their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value
with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement. Embedded derivatives which are closely related to host
contracts, including in particular price caps and floors within the group’s oil sales contracts, are not separated and are not carried
at fair value. Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  89
Derivative financial instruments (continued)
Fair value is the amount for which a financial asset, liability or instrument could be exchanged between knowledgeable and
willing parties in an arm’s length transaction. It is determined by reference to quoted market prices adjusted for estimated
transaction costs that would be incurred in an actual transaction, or by the use of established estimation techniques such as
option pricing models and estimated discounted values of cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash in hand and short-term deposits, less overdrafts.
Cash equivalents comprise funds held in term deposit accounts with an original maturity not exceeding three months.
Share-based payments
The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are
measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value
determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting
period, based on the group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting
conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of a Monte Carlo simulation. The main assumptions are provided in note 19.
Convertible bonds
The net proceeds received from the issue of convertible bonds are split between a liability element and an equity component
at the date of issue. The fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar
non-convertible debt. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bonds and the fair value assigned to the
liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the group, is included in equity and
is not re-measured. The liability component is carried at amortised cost.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds based on their relative
carrying amounts at the date of issue. The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate, at the time of issue,
for similar non-convertible debt to the liability component of the instrument. The difference between this amount and the
interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the convertible bonds.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Details of the group’s significant accounting judgements and critical accounting estimates are set out in these financial
statements and include:
• carrying value of intangible exploration and evaluation assets (note 8);
• carrying value of property, plant and equipment (note 9);
• proved and probable reserves estimates (note 9);
• decommissioning costs (note 16);
• derivative financial instruments (note 17);
• tax and recognition of deferred tax assets (note 18);
• share-based payments (note 19); and
• pensions (note 23). 90 /  Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF PREMIER OIL PLC
We have audited the group financial statements of Premier Oil plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 which comprise the
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the related notes 1 to 25. The
financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for
the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the
group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an
opinion on the group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

7. Earnings per share
The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit after tax and on the weighted average number of Ordinary
Shares in issue during the year.
In May 2011, the company conducted a 4:1 share split. In accordance with IAS 33 – ‘Earnings per Share’ the comparatives
have been restated accordingly.
Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated as follows:
Weighted average
Profit after tax number of shares Earnings per share
2010 2010
2011 2010 2011 (restated) 2011 (restated)

Contingently issuable shares – – 75.8 39.6 * *
Diluted 171.2 129.8 543.2 503.6 31.5 25.8
* The inclusion of the contingently issuable shares in the 2011 and 2010 calculations produces diluted earnings per share. The contingently issuable
shares include any expected additional share issues due to future share-based payments and for the acquisition of EnCore Oil plc, as detailed in
note 25 to the consolidated financial statements. At 31 December 2011 37,349,360 (2010 restated: 37,349,360) potential Ordinary Shares in the
company that are underlying the company’s convertible bonds and that may dilute earnings per share in the future have not been included in the
calculation of diluted earnings per share because they are anti-dilutive for the year (2010: anti-dilutive). If the contingently issuable shares for the
acquisition of EnCore Oil plc were excluded, diluted earnings per share would increase to 35.5 cents.

process is not completed and there are no indications of impairment. The outcome of ongoing exploration, and therefore
whether the carrying value of E&E assets will ultimately be recovered, is inherently uncertain. Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  101

* Finance costs that have been capitalised within oil and gas properties during the year total US$26.3 million (2010: US$16.9 million), at a weighted
average interest rate of 5.44 per cent (2010: 6.34 per cent).
** Acquisitions in the current year relate to the purchase of the additional equity interest in the Wytch Farm field. The group has assessed this
transaction and concluded that it does not constitute a ‘business’ under IFRS 3 – ‘Business Combinations’.
Other fixed assets include items such as leasehold improvements, motor vehicles and office equipment.
Amortisation and depreciation of oil and gas properties is calculated on a unit-of-production basis, using the ratio of oil and
gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of proved and probable reserves on an entitlement basis at the
end of the period plus production in the period, on a field-by-field basis. Proved and probable reserve estimates are based
on a number of underlying assumptions including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir
performance, which are inherently uncertain. Management uses established industry techniques to generate its estimates
and regularly references its estimates against those of joint venture partners or external consultants. However, the amount of
reserves that will ultimately be recovered from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the field’s life.
During the year, a net reversal of previous impairments of producing oil and gas properties was recognised. The main
elements were credits of US$33.5 million and US$6.5 million for reversal of previously recorded impairments in respect of the
Scott and Chinguetti fields, offset by impairment charges of US$7.3 million and US$6.8 million in respect of the Balmoral
and Brenda fields. The reversals resulted from an increased estimate of the quantities of hydrocarbons recoverable from the
Scott field coupled with a positive change in the estimates used to determine the assets’ recoverable amount since the
impairment losses were recognised, most notably an increase in base price assumption for hydrocarbons due to the
sustained high oil price environment. The impairment charges arose mainly as a result of reduced estimates of the quantities
of hydrocarbons recoverable from the Balmoral and Brenda fields. 102 /  Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2011
9. Property, plant and equipment (continued)
The impairment charges and reversals were calculated by comparing the future discounted cash flows expected to be
derived from production of commercial reserves (the value-in-use) against the carrying value of the asset. The future cash
flows were estimated using an oil price assumption equal to the Dated Brent forward curve in 2012 and 2013 and US$75/bbl
in ‘real’ terms thereafter (2010: fixed price of US$75/bbl) and were discounted using a discount rate of 10 per cent (2010:
10 per cent). Assumptions involved in impairment measurement include estimates of commercial reserves and production
volumes, future oil and gas prices and the level and timing of expenditures, all of which are inherently uncertain.

A maturity analysis showing the ageing profile of the total borrowings is shown in note 17.
During the year, the group undertook a private placement of senior loan notes of US$244.0 million and €75.0 million. At the
year-end date, the group’s principal credit facilities comprised a US$175.0 million term loan and a NOK 150.0 million
(US$25.1 million) exploration financing facility, both maturing in 2012, and a US$300.0 million term loan, a US$456.8 million
revolving credit facility and a £394.7 million (US$611.8 million) letter of credit facility, all maturing in 2015.
Convertible bonds
In June 2007, the group issued bonds at a par value of US$250.0 million which are convertible into Ordinary Shares of the
company at any time from 6 August 2007 until six days before their maturity date of 27 June 2014.
At the initial conversion price of £15.82 per share there were 8,003,434 Ordinary Shares of the company underlying the
bonds. In April 2009, the conversion price was adjusted from £15.82 per share to £13.56 per share, as a result of the
company’s four for nine rights issue of new Ordinary Shares. At the adjusted conversion price of £13.56 per share there were
9,337,340 Ordinary Shares of the company underlying the bonds. In May 2011, the conversion price was adjusted from
£13.56 per share, as a result of the company’s 4:1 share split. At the adjusted conversion price of £3.39 per share there are
37,349,360 Ordinary Shares of the company underlying the bonds.
If the bonds have not been previously purchased and cancelled, redeemed or converted, they will be redeemed at par
value on 27 June 2014. Interest of 2.875 per cent per annum will be paid semi-annually in arrears up to that date. 104 /  Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements

14. Borrowings (continued)
The net proceeds received from the issue of the convertible bonds were split between a liability element and an equity
component at the date of issue. The fair value of the liability component was estimated using the prevailing market interest
rate for similar non-convertible debt. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bonds and the fair
value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the
group, was included in equity reserves.
Issue costs were apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds based on their relative
carrying amounts at the date of issue. The portion relating to the equity component was charged directly against equity.

Interest charged 15.6 15.2
Interest paid (7.2) (7.2)
Total liability component at 31 December 226.5 218.1
The total interest charged for the year has been calculated by applying an effective annual interest rate of 6.73 per cent
(2010: 6.73 per cent) to the liability component for the period since the bonds were issued. The non-cash accrual of interest
will increase the liability component (as the cash interest is only paid at 2.875 per cent) to US$250.0 million at maturity.
There is no material difference between the carrying amount of the liability component of the convertible bonds and its fair
value. This fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at the market rate.
Capital management
The primary objective of the group’s capital management policy is to ensure that it maintains healthy capital ratios in order
to support its business and increase shareholder value. The group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it
in light of changes in economic conditions. No changes were made to the objectives, policies or processes during the years
ended 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010.
The group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by net assets plus net debt. The group’s policy is
to keep the long-term gearing ratio below 50 per cent. Net debt comprises interest-bearing bank loans, senior loan notes
and convertible bonds, less cash and short-term deposits.

Reclassification of short-term provisions to current liabilities (35.1) (23.7)
Long-term provisions at 31 December 565.4 473.2
The decommissioning provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs relating to oil and gas interests in
the UK, Indonesia, Vietnam, Pakistan and Mauritania which are expected to be incurred up to 2038. These provisions have
been created based on the group’s internal estimates and, where available, operator’s estimates. Based on the current
economic environment, assumptions have been made which the management believe are a reasonable basis upon which
to estimate the future liability. These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the
assumptions. However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary
decommissioning works required, which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time. Furthermore, the timing of
decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates. This in turn will
depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.
New provisions and changes in estimates result from an increase in decommissioning estimates for non-operated fields in
the UK and further provisions for fields in development in the UK, Indonesia and Vietnam, offset by an increase in the
discount rate used to 5.20 per cent (2010: 3.25 per cent). The change in discount rate used in 2011 increased the unwinding
of discount charge by US$10.6 million.
17. Financial instruments
Financial risk management objectives and policies
The group’s principal financial liabilities, other than derivative financial instruments (derivatives), comprise accounts payable,
bank loans, convertible bonds and senior loan notes. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage short-
term cash flow and to raise finance for the group’s capital expenditure programme. The group has various financial assets
such as accounts receivable and cash and short-term deposits, which arise directly from its operations.
It is group policy that all transactions involving derivatives must be directly related to the underlying business of the group.
The group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative exposures.
The main risks that could adversely affect the group’s financial assets, liabilities or future cash flows are commodity price risk,
cash flow interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The group uses derivative financial
instruments to hedge certain of these risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the group’s policies and
approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments
The group uses derivatives to manage its exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations and to changes in interest rates and
foreign currency.
Oil and gas hedging is undertaken with collar options, reverse collars, swaps and hedges embedded in long-term crude
offtake agreements. Oil is hedged using Dated Brent oil price options. Indonesian gas is hedged using HSFO Singapore
180cst which is the variable component of the gas price.
The group’s exposure to interest rates is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix of both fixed and floating interest rate
borrowings within its debt portfolio. However, given the very low level of fixed interest rates available relative to historical
rates, substantially all of the current drawings have been converted to fixed interest rates using the interest rate swap markets.
As the group reports in US dollars, since that is the currency in which the majority of the group’s transactions are
denominated, significant exchange rate exposures currently relate only to certain local currency receipts and expenditures
within individual business units. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward
foreign exchange contracts. 106 /  Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements

Fair value hierarchy
In line with IAS 39 – ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ the group uses the following hierarchy for
determining the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either
directly or indirectly; and
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded value that are not based on observable
market data.
As at 31 December 2011, the group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value (excluding any primary
financial instruments such as cash and bank loans):

Commodity price risk
Oil
At 31 December 2011, the group had 1.8 million barrels of Dated Brent oil hedged with collars at an average floor price of
US$40.0/bbl and an average cap of US$100.0/bbl, all of which are embedded through offtake agreements to the end of 2012.
The group also has oil collars with banks which are marked to market through profit or loss. Additionally, the group has
executed reverse collars with certain oil trading companies at strike prices identical to the bank collars. Similar to the bank
collars, these reverse collars are derivatives that must be marked to market through profit or loss. They effectively offset each
other, resulting in no net impact on the income statement or balance sheet. The hedges embedded in long-term crude
offtake agreements are not fair valued as they qualify for ‘own-use’ exemption under IAS 39.
In addition, 2.1 million barrels of Dated Brent oil were hedged through forward sales for 2012 at an average price of
US$105.3/bbl.
During the year, embedded oil price collars for 3.24 million barrels matured generating a net cost of US$101.3 million
(2010: US$8.0 million). This cost has been offset against sales revenues.
Indonesian gas
At the year-end date, 162,000 metric tonnes (mt) of Singapore 180 HSFO, which underlies the pricing mechanism for
Indonesian gas sold into the Singapore market, was subject to collars covering the period to mid-year 2013, with a floor of
US$250.0/mt and a cap of US$500.0/mt. An additional 132,000 mt have been sold under monthly forward sales contracts for
2012 at an average price of US$622.0/mt.
During the year, Singapore 180 HSFO contracts for 120,000 mt matured generating a cash cost of US$17.8 million (2010:
US$0.1 million) which have been offset against sales revenues. All of these contracts have been designated as cash flow
hedges and were assessed to be effective. In the current year, US$6.0 million of the movement in the fair value of these
contracts was credited to the income statement (2010: credit of US$20.4 million), as this movement related to the time-value
portion of hedges under IAS 39. The remaining movement, being a charge of US$6.3 million (2010: charge of US$12.0 million),
related to the intrinsic value of such instruments and was recognised directly in retained earnings.

Interest rate risk
At 31 December 2011, US$450.0 million of the group’s long-term bank borrowings have been swapped from floating rate to
fixed rate. Under these interest rate swap contracts, the group has agreed to exchange the difference between fixed and
floating interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the
risk of changing interest rates and the cash flow exposure on the issued variable rate debt held.
These contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and were assessed to be effective. The fair value of interest rate
swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the forward curves at this date. The
movement in fair values is shown in the table below:

Foreign currency exchange risk
During the year, the group issued €75.0 million long-term senior loan notes which have been hedged under a cross currency
swap in US dollars at a fixed rate of US$1.423:€. The fair value of this cross currency swap at the reporting date is shown
below:

To cover sterling exposures an amount of £182.0 million was purchased with forward contracts during the year (2010: £198.0
million). Premier’s activities are largely conducted in US dollars. The majority of borrowings at year-end were denominated in
US dollars to match the currency of the assets.
The impact of variations in foreign exchange rates on the group’s results would be immaterial.
Other financial instruments
Credit risk
The group’s credit risk is attributable to its trade receivables and its bank deposits. The amount of receivables presented in
the balance sheet is net of allowances for doubtful receivables, which were immaterial in 2011 and 2010. The group does not
require collateral or other security to support receivables from customers or related parties. The credit risk on liquid funds
and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with at least single A credit ratings
assigned by international credit rating agencies.
An indication of the concentration of credit risk is shown in note 1, whereby the revenue from four customers each
exceeded 10 per cent of the group’s consolidated revenue in 2011 and 2010.

Liquidity risk
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate
liquidity risk management framework for the management of the group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity
management requirements. The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and
borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial
assets and liabilities and future capital and operating commitments. 110 /  Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements

The UK deferred petroleum revenue tax relates mainly to temporary differences associated with decommissioning provisions.

The overseas deferred tax relates mainly to temporary differences associated with fixed asset balances.
The group’s unutilised tax losses and allowances at 31 December 2011 are recognised to the extent that taxable profits are
expected to arise in the future against which the tax losses and allowances can be utilised. In accordance with paragraph 37
of IAS 12 – ‘Income Taxes’ the group re-assessed its unrecognised deferred tax assets at 31 December 2011 with respect to
ring fence tax losses and allowances. The corporate model used to assess whether additional deferred tax assets should be
recognised was re-run, taking into account additional equity acquired in the Wytch Farm and Catcher areas and the
inclusion of other additional UK fields, using an oil price assumption equal to the Dated Brent forward curve in 2012 and
2013 and US$75/bbl in ‘real’ terms thereafter. As a result, the remaining unrecognised deferred tax assets of US$70.2 million
have been recognised in 2011. At 31 December 2011, the group UK ring fence deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses
and allowances have been recognised in full. Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  113
18. Deferred tax (continued)
In addition to the above, there are non-ring fence UK tax losses of approximately US$181.2 million (2010: US$171.3 million)
and current year non-UK tax losses of approximately US$69.4 million for which a deferred tax asset has not been recognised.
None of the UK tax losses (ring fence and non-ring fence) have a fixed expiry date for tax purposes.
No deferred tax has been provided on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, following a change in UK tax legislation
in 2009 which exempted foreign dividends from the scope of UK corporation tax, where certain conditions are satisfied.

Ordinary Shares
At the Annual General Meeting on 20 May 2011, shareholders authorised the company to sub-divide each of the company’s
Ordinary Shares of 50 pence each into four Ordinary Shares of 12.5 pence each, such shares having the rights and being
subject to the restrictions set out in the Articles of Association of the company. The sub-division took effect at 08:00am on
23 May 2011.
In April 2011, prior to the 4:1 share split, the company issued 600,000 Ordinary Shares of 50 pence each with a nominal value of
£300,000 (US$484,770) to the Premier Oil plc Employee Benefit Trust to be used to satisfy future awards under the company’ s
share incentive plans (2010: 1,700,000 Ordinary Shares of 50 pence each with a nominal value of £850,000 (US$1,327,955)).
The rights and restrictions attached to the Ordinary Shares are as follows:
Dividend rights: the rights of the holders of Ordinary Shares shall rank pari passu in all respects with each other in relation to
dividends.
Winding up or reduction of capital: on a return of capital on a winding up or otherwise (other than on conversion,
redemption or purchase of shares) the rights of the holders of Ordinary Shares to participate in the distribution of the assets
of the company available for distribution shall rank pari passu in all respects with each other.
Voting rights: the holders of Ordinary Shares shall be entitled to receive notice of, attend, vote and speak at any General
Meeting of the company.
Share-based payments and share incentive plans
The group currently operates a Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for all employees and a Share Incentive Plan and a Save As
You Earn Scheme for UK-based and expatriate employees only.
For the year ended 31 December 2011, the total cost recognised by the group for equity-settled share-based payment
transactions was US$34.6 million. A credit of US$34.6 million has been recorded in retained earnings (2010: US$52.7 million)
for all equity-settled payments of the group. Like other elements of remuneration, this charge is processed through the
time-writing system which allocates cost, based on time spent by individuals, to various entities within the Premier Oil plc
group. Part of this cost is therefore capitalised as directly attributable to capital projects and part is charged to the income
statement as operating costs, pre-licence exploration costs or general and administration costs. 114 /  Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2011
19. Share capital (continued)
Details of the different share incentive plans currently in operation are set out below:
(i) Long Term Incentive Plan
The Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) was introduced in 2009 to provide a long-term all employee scheme which motivates all
employees and provides a longer-term perspective to the total remuneration package. Awards under the LTIP comprise
three elements: Equity Pool Awards and Performance Share Awards that vest after the expiry of a three-year performance
period, and a potential Matching Award that vests at the expiry of a further three-year performance period, commencing at
the end of the three-year performance period for Equity Pool and Performance Share Awards.
Full details about this plan have been provided in the Remuneration Report.
The company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the value of the Equity bonus pool of the plan and of the
Performance Share Awards. The main assumptions used for the calculations are as follows:
Volatility: 40.0% to 41.0%
Risk free rate of interest: 2.9% to 3.7%
Correlation factor with comparator group: 0.29 to 0.32
(ii) Share Incentive Plan
Under the Share Incentive Plan employees are invited to make contributions to buy Partnership Shares. If an employee
agrees to buy Partnership Shares the company currently matches the number of Partnership Shares bought with an award of
shares (Matching Shares), on a one-for-one basis.
(iii) Savings Related Share Option Scheme
Under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, eligible employees with six months or more continuous service can join
the scheme. Employees can save to a maximum of £250 per month through payroll deductions for a period of three or five
years, after which time they can acquire shares at up to a 20 per cent discount.

23. Group pension schemes (continued)
Funded pensions
The group operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK – The Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan
(the Scheme). The Scheme was closed to new members (aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits) in
1997 and a new scheme, providing benefits on a defined contribution basis, was started. Both schemes are funded by the
payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
The disclosures set out below are based on calculations carried out as at 31 December 2011 by a qualified independent
actuary. The figures have been prepared in compliance with IAS 19 – ‘Employee Benefits’.
The Scheme’s assets are held in a separate trustee-administered fund to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and
present employees. The Trustee of the Scheme is required to act in the best interest of the Scheme’s beneficiaries. The
appointment of members of the Trustee Board is determined by the trust documentation.
The liabilities of the defined benefit Scheme are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid
out of the Scheme using the projected unit credit method. This amount is reflected in the deficit in the balance sheet. The
projected unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the Scheme liabilities make allowance for the
projected earnings.
The liabilities set out in this note have been calculated using membership data current as at 31 December 2011. The results
of the calculations and the assumptions adopted are shown below.
As at 31 December 2011, contributions are payable to the Scheme by the group at the rates set out in the schedule of
contributions dated 26 September 2008. Under this schedule, the company contributes on a monthly basis at the rate of
25 per cent of the aggregate of members’ pensionable salaries.

Projected components of pension expense for year to 31 December 2012:
The significant volatility in investment markets means that it is difficult to project forward the IAS 19 figures for the next year
with confidence. The following projections should therefore be treated with caution. Assumptions implicit in the following
projections are:
• the return on assets from 31 December 2011 is 5.0 per cent per annum;
• contributions to the Scheme will continue throughout 2012 in accordance with the current schedule of contributions in
place at the date of signing this report; and
• there will be no changes to the terms of the Scheme.

Unfunded pensions
In Indonesia, the group operates a Service, Severance and Compensation pay scheme under a Collective Labour
Agreement with the local workforce. This is an unfunded post-employment defined benefit scheme in nature.
In addition, the group is paying an unfunded pension to a former director in regard to which annual increases and a
reversionary spouse’s pension apply on the same basis as to pensions paid under the Scheme. On the same actuarial basis
as used to assess the Scheme’s pension costs, the present value as at 31 December 2011 of the future payments projected
to be made in respect of UK unfunded pensions is US$0.9 million (2010: US$0.9 million).
Defined contribution benefit scheme
The group operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme. The only obligation of the group with respect to the
retirement benefit scheme is to make specified contributions. Payments to the defined contribution scheme are charged as
an expense as they fall due. The total cost charged to income of US$3.5 million (2010: US$2.6 million) represents contributions
payable to these schemes by the group at rates specified in the rules of the scheme. 120 /  Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements

Acquisition
Subsequent to year-end, the company completed the acquisition of the entire issued share capital of EnCore Oil plc (EnCore).
EnCore was an AIM listed oil and gas exploration and production company focused on the offshore UK Continental Shelf
where its portfolio of assets included interests in the Catcher and Cladhan discoveries, exploration acreage and a 30 per
cent holding in Egdon Resources plc, an AIM listed exploration and production company focused on onshore assets with
interests in the UK and Europe.
Under the terms of the agreement announced on 5 October 2011, shareholders in EnCore were offered a consideration of
70 pence in cash for each EnCore share held. Alternatively, EnCore shareholders could elect to receive 0.2067 new shares in
the company for each EnCore share held instead of part or all of the cash consideration.
On completion, shareholders representing 93.5 per cent of EnCore’s shares elected to take new Premier shares, resulting in
the company paying a total of £14.1 million (US$21.6 million) in cash to EnCore shareholders and issuing 60,931,514 new
Ordinary Shares to those who chose the share alternative. The new shares began trading on 17 January 2012.
As a result of the acquisition, the group increased its stake in the Catcher project from 35 to 50 per cent and became
operator of the development.
Prior to completion of the EnCore transaction, the company reached an agreement with TAQA Bratani Ltd (TAQA) to on-sell
the 16.6 per cent interest in the Cladhan area which it indirectly acquired from the EnCore acquisition for a consideration of
US$54.0 million. TAQA also agreed to farm in to a 50 per cent interest in EnCore’s wholly-owned Block 28/10a on a
promoted basis whereby it will pay 80 per cent of certain well costs and 50 per cent of back costs on the Coaster prospect,
planned to be drilled as part of the company’s 2012 drilling programme. The on-sale of these assets was completed in
March 2012.
The transaction will be accounted for by the purchase method of accounting with an effective date of 16 January 2012,
being the date on which the group gained control of EnCore. Information in respect of assets acquired is still being
assessed and the fair value allocation to the EnCore assets is provisional in nature and will be reviewed in accordance with
the provisions of IFRS 3 – ‘Business Combinations’. Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  121

By the year-end date, acquisition-related expenses of US$4.2 million had been incurred by the group and were included
within general and administration costs.
Re-financing
The company, together with certain subsidiary undertakings, jointly guarantees the group’s borrowing facilities.
Subsequent to year-end, the group successfully negotiated a new US$350.0 million revolving credit facility to replace the
US$175.0 million term loan. This new facility matures in 2017. In addition, the group completed a private placement of
senior notes of US$202.0 million and €25.0 million with maturities between 2019 and 2024. 122 /  Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements

We have audited the parent company financial statements of Premier Oil plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 which
comprise the Company Balance Sheet, the Company Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses, and the related notes 1
to12. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for
the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent
company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express
an opinion on the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’ s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors;
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the
annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 31 December 2011;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent
with the parent company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in
our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the
accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter

Basis of accounting
The separate financial statements of the company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. They have been
prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards
and law. The results relate entirely to continuing operations.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. Further information relating to the going concern
assumption is provided in the Financial Review.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and
the preceding year.
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Pension costs
The company operates a defined benefit pension scheme, which requires contributions to be made to a separately
administered fund. The scheme was closed to new members (aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits)
in 1997. The company accounts for pension costs in line with Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 17 – ‘Retirement Benefits’.
The amounts charged to operating profit regarding the defined benefit scheme are the current service costs and gains and
losses on settlements and curtailments. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account if the
benefits have vested. If the benefits do not vest immediately, the costs are recognised over the period until vesting occurs.
The interest costs and the expected return on the assets are shown as a net amount of other financial costs or credits
adjacent to interest. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of total recognised gains and
losses.
Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value and liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit
credit method, and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high-quality corporate bond of
equivalent currency and term to the scheme liabilities.
The actuarial valuations are obtained at least triennially and are updated at each balance sheet date. The resulting defined
benefit asset or liability, net of related deferred tax, is presented separately after other net assets on the face of the balance
sheet.
Foreign exchange
The local currency of the company is US dollars. All transactions denominated in foreign currencies, being currencies other
than the local currency, are recorded in the local currency at actual exchange rates as of the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year-end are reported at the rates of exchange
prevailing at the year-end. Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rate subsequent to the dates of the
transactions is included as an exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss account.
Cash flow statement
No cash flow statement is prepared for the company under FRS 1 – ‘Cash Flow Statements’ as the cash flows of the
company have been included in the group cash flow statement of Premier Oil plc.
Related party transactions
The company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 8 – ‘Related Party Disclosures’ with regard to the
non-disclosure of transactions between group companies.
Share-based payments
The company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are
measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based
payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the company’s estimate of shares that will
eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Monte Carlo simulation. The main assumptions are provided in note 8.
Tax
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using
the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 31 December 2011
124 /  Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements 1. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet
date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay
less or to receive more tax. The exception to this is that deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the
directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the
underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing
differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
2. Profit for the year
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the company has elected not to present its own profit and loss
account for the year. The company reported a profit for the financial year ended 31 December 2011 of US$8.0 million (2010:
profit of US$7.4 million).

Funded pensions
The company operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK – The Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits
Plan (the Scheme). The Scheme was closed to new members (aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits)
in 1997 and a new scheme, providing benefits on a defined contribution basis, was started. Both schemes are funded by the
payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
The disclosures set out below are based on calculations carried out as at 31 December 2011 by a qualified independent
actuary. The figures have been prepared in compliance with FRS 17 – ‘Retirement Benefits’ (incorporating the amendment
announced in December 2006).
The Scheme’s assets are held in a separate trustee-administered fund to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and
present employees. The Trustee of the Scheme is required to act in the best interest of the Scheme’s beneficiaries. The
appointment of members of the Trustee Board is determined by the trust documentation.
The liabilities of the defined benefit Scheme are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid
out of the Scheme using the projected unit credit method. This amount is reflected in the deficit in the balance sheet. The
projected unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the Scheme liabilities make allowance for the
projected earnings.
The liabilities set out in this note have been calculated using membership data current as at 31 December 2011. The results
of the calculations and the assumptions adopted are shown below.
As at 31 December 2011, contributions are payable to the Scheme by the company at the rates set out in the schedule of
contributions dated 26 September 2008. Under this schedule, the company contributes on a monthly basis at the rate of
25 per cent of the aggregate of the members’ pensionable salaries. Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  127

Projected profit/loss recognition to 31 December 2012:
The significant volatility in investment markets means that it is difficult to project forward the FRS 17 figures for the next year
with confidence. The following projections should therefore be treated with caution. Assumptions implicit in the following
projections are:
• the return on assets from 31 December 2011 is 5.0 per cent per annum;
• contributions to the Scheme will continue throughout 2012 in accordance with the current schedule of contributions in
place at the date of signing this report; and
• there will be no changes to the terms of the Scheme.
The amounts recognised in the profit and loss account are:

Current service cost 0.2
Interest on obligation 1.4
Expected return on Scheme assets (1.4)
Total 0.2 Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  129
6. Pension liability (continued)
Sensitivity and risk
The results of the calculations are sensitive to the assumptions used. The balance sheet position revealed by FRS 17
calculations must be expected to be volatile, principally because the market value of assets (with a significant exposure to
equities) is being compared with a liability assessment derived from corporate bond yields.
At 31 December 2011, a one percentage point change in this assumption would have had the following effects on the
closing defined benefit obligation:
Discount rate: 
4.6% pa Discount rate: Discount rate:
(as used for report) 3.6% pa 5.6% pa
$ million $ million $ million
Defined benefit obligation 31.3 37.6 26.1
The key risks which could significantly impact the balance sheet, and to a lesser extent the profit and loss account, are as follows:
• falls in asset values which are not offset by a rise in the discount rate used to value liabilities;
• a reduction in the discount rate, which will increase the value placed on the Scheme’s liabilities;
• an increase in price inflation and/or salary inflation; and
• improving life expectancy (lower mortality rates) resulting in benefits being paid for longer.
Unfunded pensions
The company is paying an unfunded pension to a former director in regard to which annual increases and a reversionary
spouse’s pension apply on the same basis as to pensions paid under the Scheme. On the same actuarial basis as used to
assess the Scheme’s pension costs, the present value as at 31 December 2011 of the future payments projected to be made
in respect of UK unfunded pensions is US$0.9 million (2010: US$0.9 million).
7. Commitments and guarantees
At the year-end date the company, together with certain subsidiary undertakings, had jointly guaranteed the group’s
borrowing facilities which consist of a US$175.0 million term loan and a NOK 150.0 million (US$25.1 million) exploration
financing facility, both maturing in 2012, a US$300.0 million term loan, a US$456.8 million revolving credit facility and a
£394.7 million (US$611.8 million) letter of credit facility, all maturing in 2015, and the private placement of senior notes of
US$244.0 million and €75.0 million which mature between 2018 and 2021.

of the company available for distribution shall rank pari passu in all respects with each other.
Voting rights: the holders of Ordinary Shares shall be entitled to receive notice of, attend, vote and speak at any General
Meeting of the company.
Share-based payments and share incentive plans
The group currently operates a Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for all employees and a Share Incentive Plan and a Save As
You Earn Scheme for UK-based and expatriate employees only.
For the year ended 31 December 2011, the total cost recognised by the company for equity-settled share-based payment
transactions was US$15.5 million (2010: US$18.0 million). A credit of US$34.6 million has been recorded in the profit and loss
reserve (2010: US$52.7 million) for all equity-settled payments of the group. Like other elements of remuneration, this charge
is processed through the time-writing system which allocates cost, based on time spent by individuals, to various entities
within the Premier Oil plc group. Part of this cost is therefore capitalised as directly attributable to capital projects and part is
charged to the profit and loss account as operating costs, pre-licence exploration costs or general and administration costs.
Details of the different share incentive plans currently in operation are set out below:
(i) Long Term Incentive Plan
The Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) was introduced in 2009 to provide a long-term all employee scheme which motivates all
employees and provides a longer-term perspective to the total remuneration package. Awards under the LTIP comprise
three elements: Equity Pool Awards and Performance Share Awards that vest after the expiry of a three-year performance
period, and a potential Matching Award that vests at the expiry of a further three-year performance period, commencing at
the end of the three-year performance period for Equity Pool and Performance Share Awards.
Full details about this plan have been provided in the Remuneration Report.
The company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the value of the Equity bonus pool of the plan and of the
Performance Share Awards. The main assumptions used for the calculations are as follows:
Volatility: 40.0% to 41.0%
Risk free rate of interest: 2.9% to 3.7%
Correlation factor with comparator group: 0.29 to 0.32
(ii) Share Incentive Plan
Under the Share Incentive Plan employees are invited to make contributions to buy Partnership Shares. If an employee
agrees to buy Partnership Shares the company currently matches the number of Partnership Shares bought with an award of
shares (Matching Shares), on a one-for-one basis. Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  131
8. Share capital (continued)
(iii) Savings Related Share Option Scheme
Under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, eligible employees with six months or more continuous service can join
the scheme. Employees can save to a maximum of £250 per month through payroll deductions for a period of three or five
years, after which time they can acquire shares at up to a 20 per cent discount.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2011
9. Share capital and reserves (continued)
In June 2007, Premier Oil Finance (Jersey) Ltd, a 100 per cent subsidiary of the company, issued convertible bonds at a par
value of US$250.0 million. These bonds are convertible into Ordinary Shares of the company at any time from 6 August 2007
until six days before their maturity date of 27 June 2014.
At the initial conversion price of £15.82 per share there were 8,003,434 Ordinary Shares of the company underlying the
bonds. In April 2009, the conversion price was adjusted from £15.82 per share to £13.56 per share, as a result of the
company’s four for nine rights issue of new Ordinary Shares. At the adjusted conversion price of £13.56 per share there were
9,337,340 Ordinary Shares of the company underlying the bonds. In May 2011, the conversion price was adjusted from
£13.56 per share, as a result of the company’s 4:1 share split. At the adjusted conversion price of £3.39 per share there are
37,349,360 Ordinary Shares of the company underlying the bonds.
If the bonds have not been previously purchased and cancelled, redeemed or converted, they will be redeemed at par
value on 27 June 2014. Interest of 2.875 per cent per annum will be paid semi-annually in arrears up to that date.

The own shares reserve represents the net cost of shares in Premier Oil plc purchased in the market or issued by the
company into the Premier Oil plc Employee Benefit Trust. This ESOP Trust holds shares to satisfy awards under the group’s
share incentive plans. At 31 December 2011, the number of Ordinary Shares of 12.5 pence each held by the Trust was
1,973,998 (2010: 1,721,970 Ordinary Shares of 50 pence each). Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements /  133
12. Subsequent events
Acquisition
Subsequent to year-end, the company completed the acquisition of the entire issued share capital of EnCore Oil plc (EnCore).
EnCore was an AIM listed oil and gas exploration and production company focused on the offshore UK Continental Shelf
where its portfolio of assets included interests in the Catcher and Cladhan discoveries, exploration acreage and a 30 per
cent holding in Egdon Resources plc, an AIM listed exploration and production company focused on onshore assets with
interests in the UK and Europe.
Under the terms of the agreement announced on 5 October 2011, shareholders in EnCore were offered a consideration of
70 pence in cash for each EnCore share held. Alternatively, EnCore shareholders could elect to receive 0.2067 new shares in
the company for each EnCore share held instead of part or all of the cash consideration.
On completion, shareholders representing 93.5 per cent of EnCore’s shares elected to take new Premier shares, resulting in
the company paying a total of £14.1 million (US$21.6 million) in cash to EnCore shareholders and issuing 60,931,514 new
Ordinary Shares to those who chose the share alternative. The new shares began trading on 17 January 2012.
As a result of the acquisition, the group increased its stake in the Catcher project from 35 to 50 per cent and became
operator of the development.
Prior to completion of the EnCore transaction, the company reached an agreement with TAQA Bratani Ltd (TAQA) to on-sell
the 16.6 per cent interest in the Cladhan area which it indirectly acquired from the EnCore acquisition for a consideration of
US$54.0 million. TAQA also agreed to farm in to a 50 per cent interest in EnCore’s wholly-owned Block 28/10a on a
promoted basis whereby it will pay 80 per cent of certain well costs and 50 per cent of back costs on the Coaster prospect,
planned to be drilled as part of the company’s 2012 drilling programme. The on-sale of these assets was completed in
March 2012.
Further details are provided in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements.
Re-financing
The company, together with certain subsidiary undertakings, jointly guarantees the group’s borrowing facilities.
Subsequent to year-end, the group successfully negotiated a new US$350.0 million revolving credit facility to replace the
US$175.0 million term loan. This new facility matures in 2017. In addition, the group completed a private placement of
senior notes of US$202.0 million and €25.0 million, with maturities between 2019 and 2024. 134 /  Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements

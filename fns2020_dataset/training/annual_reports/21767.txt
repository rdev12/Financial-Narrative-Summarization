Business line overview
Lending
Lending manages the development and manufacture
of lending products, primarily mortgages.
All our lending is secured on property, giving us a
low risk profile. As well as managing the book of
residential mortgages, we are driving growth in
specialist areas such as buy-to-let and commercial
lending. Mortgage Express gives us a channel to sell
specialist mortgages through intermediaries.
Savings Savings
Savings manages the development and manufacture
of the Group’s savings products.
We offer convenience and value savings 
products to consumers through our Retail
network.This is closely managed with the
Distribution business.
Distribution Distribution
Our Retail network includes high street bank and
estate agency branches, as well as telephone and
online channels.
Through this network we distribute financial
services, our own savings products and property
related services. Financial services, including
mortgage and insurance broking and investment
and protection products, are distributed through
our Independent Financial Advisers.

retired as 
in Octobe
It is now over two years since Bradford &
Bingley converted from mutual to plc status
and floated on the London Stock Exchange.
In that period the Group has seen continuing
growth in revenues and profits.
The Group has also made significant progress
in developing its distinctive strategy - namely
to concentrate on profitable segments of
mortgage and property lending, whilst moving
increasingly into a range of fee-earning property
related and personal financial services.
Results
Profits before tax and exceptionals rose 8%
to a record £273 million; profit attributable
to shareholders rose 5% to a record 
£172 million; before exceptional costs,
earnings per share rose 13% from 26.0 pence
to 29.3 pence and return on equity rose from
14.2% to 15.8%.
Dividend
The Board is pleased to propose a final 
dividend of 9.9 pence per share for payment 
on 9 May 2003 to shareholders on the
register as at 28 March 2003.This will result 
in a full year dividend of 14.8 pence,
a 14% increase on 2001.
Trading
The Group’s policy is to lend selectively to
those segments of the residential and
commercial property markets which meet our
careful underwriting criteria and in which we
believe we can make a good return over the
full lending cycle.
Our lending balances have increased, with
rapid growth in our selective lending business,
particularly in the buy-to-let market, more
than offsetting the redemptions in our
traditional book.
We are pleased to report that new lending
rose to a record £5.8 billion in the year
compared to £3.4 billion last year. Our
managed lending balances exceeded
£20 billion for the first time. Arrears and
defaults have continued to decline.
Overall savings balances have stabilised after
the substantial outflow of ‘carpetbagger’
deposits following the flotation.There has
been a continued shift from convenience
savings to lower margin value savings.
In total, outflows post-conversion are
estimated to have reduced Lending & Savings
profits by some £40 million.This resulted
from the anticipated reduction in balances
driven by account closures following flotation.
This was offset positively by some £19 million
by the Group changing the amortisation
period for mortgage incentives bringing it
into line with the industry standard.
We continue to manage our capital actively
and repurchased £88 million of our own
shares during the year. In the course of the
year we completed two substantial capital
market transactions which supported our
lending growth.
The contribution from our Distribution
business, which comprises Mortgage Broking,
Estate Agency, Insurance Broking and
Independent Financial Advice continued to
grow rapidly. Pre-tax profits doubled,
advancing from £14 million to £28 million,
despite the difficult equity markets and further
investment spend.We reached our target of
1,000 advisers in mid 2002, ahead of schedule.
We have delivered on the £30 million cost
reduction target we set ourselves in 2001,
with costs falling by £5 million in 2002,
before exceptionals.

Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2002
Exceptional costs totalled £33 million, including
£15 million relating to our decision to end our
mortgage systems and processing joint venture
with ALLTEL Information Systems.
Pensions
Because of the rapid decline in world stock
markets during the year, we have reviewed our
pension liabilities in advance of our triennial
valuation, due 30 June 2003.While pension
funding is essentially a long-term consideration
we considered it prudent to transfer an
additional £50 million to our pension fund.
As at the end of 2002, our Minimum Funding
Requirement ratio was estimated to be 125%.
We believe this indicates that we are
adequately funded to meet our existing
liabilities.We will adjust corporate and individual
contributions as needed to meet future
increases in liabilities.
People
Our achievements in 2002, in increasingly
challenging markets, have been the direct result
of the hard work and dedication of staff
throughout the Group.We have placed increasing
emphasis on improving productivity and are now
delivering record revenues with fewer people.
The Board would like to thank all our colleagues
for the positive way in which they have adapted
to continued change in the business.
Board
I would like to take this opportunity to pay 
a particular tribute to Lindsay Mackinlay, who
retired as Chairman of Bradford & Bingley plc
in October 2002.
It is rare for a Chairman to be required to
lead companies through changes as radical as
those Lindsay experienced at Bradford &
Bingley. Lindsay joined the Board in 1990, and
when he became Chairman in 1995 Bradford
& Bingley was still a medium-sized building
society. He leaves us, seven years on, as a
FTSE 100 company, with a clear, distinctive and
successful strategy.The Board will miss his wise
counsel and stewardship, and we all wish him
every success and happiness in his retirement.
I would also like to thank Keith Greenough,
who retired from the Board and from his
position of Managing Director for Lending &
Savings at the end of December 2002. Keith
has made a significant contribution to the
business since joining us in 1997 when we
acquired Mortgage Express and has played a
pivotal role in developing our successful
specialist lending strategy.We wish him well 
in his retirement.
Share price
Bradford & Bingley’s shares continued to
perform resiliently last year in a difficult market
and as a result we joined the FTSE 100 index in
July. By the end of 2002, our second full year of
trading on the London Stock Exchange, our
share price was 19% ahead of our flotation
price and 2% ahead of our end of 2001 price. In
comparison, the UK Banks index fell by 22% and
the FTSE 100 index fell by 25% during 2002.
Outlook
The outlook for the UK financial services
and property markets is uncertain.
Economic and political uncertainty is likely to
lead to continued low interest rates which
can be expected to underpin the property
market and mortgage repayments.We expect
house prices to grow more slowly in 2003
and even to fall in those areas that have seen
exceptional growth in the last 12 to 18
months. It will take some time for consumers
to regain confidence in the stock market but
the need to save for the future remains and is
underscored by uncertainty over pensions.
Our focus remains on achieving further
improvements in our operating performance
while looking for acquisitions that complement
our strategy.
At the same time we will need to digest the
implications of the extensive regulatory changes
that the Financial Services Authority proposes to
make to the mortgage and regulated products
markets.The Board remains confident that our
selective lending strategy and our focus on
financial services and property retailing are right
for the Group and will allow it to carve out a
distinctive position in the markets it serves.

Group Chief Executive’s review
Overview
In 2002, we continued to make good progress
against our twin strategic goals of becoming
the UK’s leading specialist lender and an
innovative retailer of property and financial
services.
During the year we lent a record £5.8 billion.
This was all secured against residential or
commercial property while The MarketPlace
and Charcol, our two retail financial services
brands, both experienced substantial growth
as record numbers of consumers decided
they preferred product choice and
independent advice when buying 
financial services.
A number of customers closed their savings
or mortgage accounts during 2001 having
received their free shares when we floated.
2002 was the first year in which we felt the
full financial impact of their departure.
Fortunately, our new lending growth coupled
with significant additions to balances in our
value savings products and our decision to
change the period over which we spread
lending incentives went a long way to offset
this and total interest income fell by only 
£1 million to £441 million.
We continued to invest in our advice brands
in 2002, confident that, in times of uncertainty,
the value of expert help becomes ever more
evident to consumers seeking to “weather
the storm”. Research shows 
that our new TV advertising campaign for 
The MarketPlace was particularly successful 
in communicating the fact that we offer
consumer choice and we continued to 
use Charcol’s successful existing press
campaign to drive sales to new record levels.
Lending
37% of Group revenues
We have maintained the momentum in our
Lending business with balances up 9% 
year-on-year to £20.5 billion. Divisional profit
before tax increased 13% to £210 million.
This increase reflected the growth in lending
balances, a flat cost base and a growth in
lending interest margins from 1.27% to 1.37%.

The interest margin increase included the
impact of our decision to spread lending
incentive costs over the early redemption
clawback period instead of the first twelve
months of the loan.This change aligned us with
the market and added £19 million to our
profits in the year, relative to the previous basis.
Our policy of lending selectively did not hamper
our growth. New residential lending grew from
£2.4 billion to £4.6 billion.This included the
purchase of a 6,000 customer, £650 million loan
book from General Motors Acceptance
Corporation in September 2002.
By the end of the year, our residential loan
book had grown by £800 million to 
£16.8 billion, as the high level of remortgaging
evident across the market offset our significant
growth in new lending.
Our commercial and housing association
lending businesses both had good years adding
nearly £1 billion to the book which reached
£3.7 billion by year-end.The commercial lending
team continued to be successful, originating
their own secured property lending and were
able to take advantage of their growing
reputation in the loan syndication market to
make £0.9 billion of loans during the year. By
year-end, commercial lending balances had
grown 41% to £2.2 billion. Our housing
association team built on their position as a
major lender in the market to grow their
balances by 30% to £1.5 billion.
Credit quality remains good, with arrears levels
continuing to decline both in absolute terms
and in proportion to the book. Our book is
well diversified with 23% of our loans being
buy-to-let, 59% are other residential mortgages
and 18% commercial and housing association
loans. All our lending is secured on property and
our buy-to-let lending, which accounts for only
a quarter of our book, has an average loan-to-
value ratio of 59% and arrears levels of less than
one third of the overall UK residential average.
During the year we increased bad debt
provisions on our Balance Sheet and in our
securitisation vehicles by £12 million to almost 
£56 million, in view of current economic
uncertainty. We continue to believe that we are
well provided for, given our residential lending
arrears experience; the low average 42%
loan-to-value of our residential loan portfolio;
the quality of our commercial and housing
association books; and the fact that we have no
unsecured lending to individuals or companies.
In December, we announced that the European
mortgage processing and outsourcing joint
venture with ALLTEL, which commenced in
2000, was to be discontinued. Both partners
believed that further investment in the joint
venture could not be justified given the current
uncertainty created by changes in mortgage
regulation in the UK and Continental Europe,
and the slower than expected development in
the European mortgage outsourcing market.
We have made an exceptional write-off of
£15 million in our 2002 results in respect
of our share of the system development and
associated costs.
Our mortgage customers have not been
affected by these changes and our mortgage
processing costs will not increase.

Savings
16% of Group revenues
In 2002, we stabilised our savings business
after experiencing significant ‘carpetbagger’
outflows in the prior year. During the year
balances grew £300 million to £13 billion.
This has been achieved by the continued
success of innovative products such as
Premier Saver, and by the launch of other 
new products that build the relationship
between retail deposits and regulated
investments by introducing new customers 
to our financial advisers.
The interest margin on savings was £1 18 million
in 2002, a decrease of £24 million on 2001.
This reflects the full and final impact of
‘carpetbagger’ outflows, combined with
reduced deposit spreads in a lower interest
rate environment. T ogether these meant that
the savings interest margin fell from 1.1% to
0.9% during the year.
Distribution
36% of Group revenues
The Distribution business doubled profit
before tax to £28 million in 2002. Income
from financial services grew by 5% to 
£144 million while property services income
grew 7% to £115 million. By contrast
operating expenses were flat at £231 million.
This reflects a real reduction in underlying
costs offset by continued investment
in growing both the business and our
adviser base.
Financial services 
Our position as a diversified distributor of
financial services helps us offset short-term
declines in demand in any one product
area with sales growth in other areas.This
resilience is evident in our 2002 results which
reflect the quite different market conditions
experienced in various parts of our business.
In a strong mortgage market, our mortgage
broking related revenues grew by over
30% year-on-year. By contrast, demand for
equity-related investments fell significantly
as a result of the falling stock market.We
introduced a variety of new protected
investment products during the year.While
margins on these products are lower, our
growing sales force and increased adviser
productivity enabled us to limit the fall in
investment related revenues to 8% in a
market which fell 25%.
Because so many of our historic home and
contents insurance sales had been linked to
mortgages we had manufactured, our general
insurance business continued to be impacted
by high levels of mortgage redemption
experienced throughout the industry in these
times of very low interest rates.This decline
in mortgage-linked insurance revenues was
partly offset by our move to insurance
broking. As a result total insurance revenues
fell by just 6%.We will pay particular attention
to growing our insurance broking revenues
during 2003.
In mid 2002 we achieved our target of having
1,000 financial advisers eighteen months 
ahead of schedule and by the year-end had
1,061 advisers of whom 130 were in training.
We have now set our sights on reaching
1,300 advisers by the end of 2004. Having
said that, we have slowed wealth adviser
recruitment temporarily, until market
conditions improve.
Property services
Estate Agency revenue increased by 4%
in 2002 but, following our closure of
underperforming outlets in 2001, these
revenues were achieved through a retail
network that is approximately 10% smaller.
On a like-for-like basis, the current network
improved revenue per outlet by 8% and
outlet contribution by 14%.

and
Our surveying business had a particularly
good year with revenues growing by 26% and
profit by 50%. Over 85% of our surveyors’
income comes from other companies and
we finished the year by acquiring the 67
employee surveying business of Countrywide
Commercial bringing the total number of
BBG Surveyors fee earners to 272.
Costs
In 2002 Group pre-exceptional costs were
£446 million, £5 million less than in 2001. Our
cost income ratio fell from 63.3% to 61.3%.
This was the result of a number of actions.We
expanded our outsourcing relationship with
IBM and restructured some of our internal
service utilities, of which the most significant
was the creation of a single Human Resource
service centre.
Our staffing levels have continued to fall in
2002, despite the increase in our adviser
population to over 1,000. In 2002 our average
full time equivalent workforce was 6,680, a
reduction of 190 (3%) on the previous year.
By the end of the year we had achieved our
targeted £30 million reduction in costs
compared on a like-for-like basis with year-end
2000.We have also continued investment
in the business and our brands and a growth
in our adviser base from 936 to 1,061 during
the period.
We will continue to seek ways to improve our
cost income ratio in the future although this
will be offset by the growth of our distribution
businesses, which have a relatively high cost
income ratio compared to our lending
business.The attraction of distribution is that it
requires relatively little capital, so growing this
area improves Group return on equity.
Capital and Balance Sheet
The Group’s total assets grew to £25.4 billion
by the end of 2002, an 8% increase on 2001.
This asset growth occurred primarily as a
result of the increase in specialist lending
balances during the year. It has been financed
principally by two medium-term note issues
which attracted new investors to the Group.
During the year we actively managed our
capital base.We began a £150 million equity
buy-back programme in February and, by the
end of 2002, had purchased over £88 million
worth of shares. During the year we also
raised £150 million innovative Tier 1 capital
and issued £200 million of subordinated debt,
further improving the mix of our capital
and reflecting our confidence in our future
growth prospects.
The year ahead 
We have started the year well, but we live in
uncertain times.We will continue to drive for
improved operating performance in our
chosen markets and will be particularly
focused on taking advantage of the many
regulatory changes that have been proposed
by the Financial Services Authority.
We will also carefully evaluate the increasing
number of acquisition opportunities that
are emerging at this stage of the economic
cycle.We are potential acquirers of businesses
that offer us greater scale or complementary
skills in the markets in which we have chosen
to operate.
Christopher Rodrigues
Group Chief Executive

Although the outlook for the
UK financial services and
property markets is uncertain,
the current year has started well.
We believe that the diversity of
our revenues positions us well for
these uncertain market conditions.

Group pre-tax profit in 2002, excluding
exceptional costs, has increased by 8% to
£273.2m, driven by non-interest income
growth, good underlying lending performance
and strong cost control.The Group’s post-tax
return on equity, excluding exceptionals,
increased to 15.8% from 14.2%.
The Group’s net interest income remained
almost flat in 2002, with lending growth and
the change in amortisation period for lending
incentives offsetting the full year effect of
post-conversion outflows.
Non-interest income has grown by 6% driven
principally by property services and mortgage
broking related income growth.
Excluding exceptionals, costs were managed
to below 2001 levels, despite continued
investment in the development of the
Distribution business.This reflects continued
strong cost control in all areas of the
business, most notably the full year effect of
the reductions made to the size of the retail
network in 2001 and downward pressure on 
Group Services costs.

Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2002
The business continues to take a prudent
approach to bad debt provisions.The
economic environment in the residential
and commercial property lending sectors
has been encouraging with historically low
interest rates, coupled with strong house
price inflation.This is reflected in the £11m
reduction in total specific provisions. Additional
general bad debt provisions have been made
reflecting a cautious approach in light of
current economic conditions.
Exceptional costs amounted to £32.6m 
(2001: £18.7m) relating to two main items;
firstly, costs associated with the disengagement
from the mortgage software development 
and processing joint venture with ALLTEL
Information Services, and secondly, further
actions taken to reduce the Group’s future
cost base relating principally to outsourcing of
Information Technology (IT) operations to IBM.
Profit after tax and exceptional costs
increased to a record £177.4m with earnings
per share, excluding exceptionals, increasing
from 26.0 pence to 29.3 pence.
Net interest income
In 2002, the Group’s interest income fell by
£1.4m.Three main factors contributed to
this. Firstly, underlying trading performance
has improved by over £20m driven by 
strong growth in lending volumes. Secondly,
the Group suffered the full-year effect of 
post-flotation outflows as former building
society members closed their accounts.The
impact of conversion outflows on the Group’s
2002 interest margin is estimated at £40m.
Thirdly, the Group has changed the period
over which lending incentives are amortised,
aligning more closely with our peer group.
The effect of this change is to spread the
cost of these incentives over the period
during which an early redemption charge is
payable.This is typically three years rather 
than the first twelve months as previously
accounted.This increased the 2002 interest
margin by £19.2m relative to the figure
that would have been reported on the
previous basis.

Average interest-earning assets grew by

growth during the year.The gross yield on
these assets fell in line with the decline in
average market interest rates, which were 1%
below 2001 levels. Relative yields increased
as a result of the continued positive impact
of our specialist lending strategy.
The cost of interest-bearing liabilities fell in a
lower interest rate environment, but
increased relative to bank base rate,
reflecting a mix change towards a greater
proportion of wholesale funding.
The decline from 0.22% to 0.20% in the
contribution of interest-free liabilities to the
overall interest margin reflects the lower
interest rate environment.

Total non-interest income grew by £16m
relative to 2001. Property services income
grew 7%, notwithstanding the closure
of 68 estate agency outlets in 2001, reflecting
higher transaction values. On a like-for-like
basis, estate agency income grew over 8%
from 2001. Survey income grew strongly,
reflecting both the strength of the market
and our ability to capture new business
in 2002.
Investment related income declined by
7% in 2002 reflecting the continuing difficult
environment for wealth business.
Mortgage broking related income has seen
continued strong growth of over 30%
reflecting the success of this activity in both
Charcol and The MarketPlace.
General insurance income fell by 6% in
2002 reflecting the continued high level of
redemptions in the residential lending book
to which these revenues are linked.
Lending related income fell slightly
in 2002, reflecting a significant increase in
fees payable to third party mortgage
distributors in line with volume growth,
despite continued strong performance
in commercial lending income.

Total expenses fell during 2002, excluding
exceptional costs. Underlying costs have been
well contained, although investment continues
to be made in the implementation of our
independent retailing strategy. Cost reduction
has been supported during 2002 by the full
year effect of the closure of a number of
underperforming retail outlets in 2001 and a
continued reduction in the level of costs of
Group Service functions. Our target cost
savings of £30m have been delivered.
Staff related costs have decreased by 4%
with headcount decreases resulting from cost
reduction actions taken in 2001 and 2002
more than offsetting wage inflation. Average
headcount fell from 6,870 to 6,680.
Premises costs fell by 6% reflecting outlet
closures undertaken in 2001.The Group’s
exposure to the cost of empty properties has
also been substantially reduced as a result of
the transfer of 180 properties to London &
Cambridge Properties Ltd. Marketing spend
fell by 10% despite continued advertising
support for the Charcol,The MarketPlace and
Mortgage Express brands.
The number of endowment enquiries rose
at the end of 2002 as the general public
became aware of the potential impact of falling
equity prices on endowment maturity values.
Our policy is to handle all customer enquiries
and complaints as they arise, charging any
compensation to the Group Profit and Loss
Account.
Exceptional costs of £32.6m have been
incurred in the year.These relate to costs
associated with the disengagement from the
relationship with ALLTEL, outsourcing and
further restructuring costs.
Bad debt provision
An amount of £6.2m has been charged to the
Profit and Loss Account in 2002 in relation to
bad debts. Additionally, £4.5m of provisions
(2001: £4.7m) were charged to the Profit and
Loss Accounts of the Group’s securitised
lending portfolios.
T otal bad debt provisions, expressed relative to
the managed book, have increased relative to
2001 levels. In the light of the uncertain
economic environment, the Group has
increased its level of general provisions from
£27.2m to £49.3m.

The 2002 tax charge equates to an effective
rate of 26.3% (2001: 30.4%).The reduction in
the effective rate below the standard rate is
explained as follows:

Dividends
A final dividend of 9.9 pence per share has
been proposed for payment on 9 May 2003
which, together with the interim dividend of
4.9 pence per share, gives a total dividend 
for the year of 14.8 pence per share 
(2001: 13.0 pence per share).This reflects the
Board’s desire to continue to maintain cover
in line with comparable companies in the UK
retail banking sector.

The lending business reported a £23.9m
increase in profit in 2002.The underlying
improvement in lending earnings was driven
by very strong specialist lending growth with
new advances increasing by almost 120%,
coupled with over £1.2bn of commercial
advances.This growth was offset by £3.8bn
of residential redemptions (2001: £4.2bn)
with the Group experiencing redemption
levels in line with the market.
2002 earnings includes the effect of a change
in the period over which mortgage incentives
are amortised. Under the previous approach
lending incentives were charged to income
over the first twelve months following
completion.The current approach, which has
brought us into line with our peer group, has
the effect of amortising incentives over
a period of around three years, being the
average period over which an early
redemption charge would apply.

Reported income in 2002 is materially higher
than the previous approach since only one
third of the incentives incurred during the
year is being charged to income. In 2003,
two thirds of a full year’s lending incentives
will be charged. By 2004 reporting under the
new basis will be materially consistent with
the old basis as the equivalent of a full year’s
incentives will be once again charged in
the year.
Excluding the effect of the change in the
amortisation period for incentives, the
lending interest margin remained constant
at 1.27%.
Non-interest income fell slightly, primarily due
to the increase in mortgage procuration
costs arising from the higher proportion of
specialist mortgage business, which is largely
sourced through intermediaries. Commercial
fee income continued to grow in line with
lending volume increases.
Lending costs grew by less than 1% in 2002,
despite the rapid expansion in new advances,
which increased by over 70% in the year.
The Group holds funds in its offshore captive
operation generated by charging customers
for high loan-to-value advances.These
amounts total £27.3m (2001: £33.7m) and
are being released to income over the life
of the mortgage.

The number of cases in arrears and
possession has continued to reduce during
2002, a reflection of low interest rates and a
strong housing market.
The value of cases in arrears and possession
has also declined, relative to the total book,
mirroring the decline in the number of cases.
Notwithstanding this experience, the bad
debt provision charge has been maintained in
2002, as the Group is taking a cautious view
of the current economic environment.
The losses incurred in the Joint Venture
reflect the Group’s share of trading
performance in 2002. Costs related to the
disengagement from this Joint Venture are

outflows occurred predominantly from our

General insurance income fell 6% in 2002
with reduced renewal income driven by
the continuing high level of mortgage
redemptions, partly offset by income from

services income grew by 7% in 2002, driven
principally by higher average house prices.The
Surveying business performed strongly with
income up by 26%.
Distribution costs were held flat year-on-year,
reflecting strong cost control, in particular the
full year effect of outlet closures undertaken in
2001. Further cost control in 2002 has
enabled continued investment in the
development of the business both in growing
the number of advisers and in investing in the
Distribution brands.The MarketPlace brand

oversee its interest and foreign currency risk.
Funds are made available to the rest of the
Group at transfer pricing rates which have been
determined in order to transfer the Group’s
interest rate risk to Treasury.

Interest earnings relate principally to
investment of the Group’s free reserves,
together with earnings on liquid asset balances
and intra-group funds, net of the cost of
external wholesale funding and debt capital.
T otal wholesale funding was increased by
£800m during the year in support of lending
growth. New sources of funding were
developed through medium term notes issued
in both euros ( 750m) and US dollars
($500m). Interest income declined by 4% in
2002 with the lower interest rate environment
more than offsetting growth in the Group’s
reserves.

The Group’s total assets have increased by
8% during the year, principally as a result of
the growth in lending assets. Liquid assets
decreased by 4%, reflecting a reduction in
lower yielding treasury assets. Commercial
lending has increased in line with our focus 
on more specialist areas of lending.
Additional funding has been delivered,
principally through two medium term note
issues increasing the level of the Group’s
wholesale funding.

The Group has taken a number of steps in
2002 to implement its capital management
strategy.T o reduce the level of surplus capital,
a share buy-back programme has been
initiated resulting in the acquisition of 28.2m
shares at a cost of £88.2m. In order to
manage the total level and appropriate mix of
capital instruments the Group issued £150m
of innovative Tier 1 capital in May followed
by a £200m subordinated debt issue in
December. £100m of subordinated debt 
was repaid in June in advance of a coupon 
re-set date.
As a result, the total capital ratios have
improved despite a 14% increase in
risk weighted assets. Our capital ratios are well
positioned for the further lending growth
planned for 2003.
Further actions will be taken as appropriate to
continue to ensure efficient capital utilisation
whilst ensuring that the Group is appropriately
placed to manage the impact of the proposed
Basel II new capital requirements.
As at 31 December 2002 the Group’s market
capitalisation was £1.9bn.

Risk management and control
In the ordinary course of business, the Group
is exposed to, and manages a variety of risks,
with operational, credit, market and liquidity
risk being of particular significance.The
management of risk is fundamental to the
Group, with the Board having responsibility
for the overall system of internal control and
for reviewing its effectiveness.
The Board has delegated specific risk
monitoring and control responsibilities to the
Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee, the
Group Risk Committee, the Asset & Liability
Management Committee (ALCO), and the
Credit Risk Committee.
Each business area within the Group is
responsible for the identification and
assessment of their particular risk exposures,
and implementing risk management policies,
limits and procedures as approved by
the Board.
Operational risk 
The potential risk of financial loss or
impairment to reputation resulting from
inadequate or failed internal processes and
systems, from the actions of people or from
external events.The Group’s business units
manage this risk through appropriate controls
and loss mitigation actions, including
insurance.These actions include a balance
of policies, appropriate procedures and
internal controls to ensure compliance with
laws and regulations. In addition, specialist
support functions provide expertise in
operational risk areas such as information
security, financial services compliance,
fraud management, security and business
continuity management.
Credit risk 
The potential risk of financial loss if
counterparties are not able to meet their
obligations as they fall due.The Group is
firmly committed to the management of this
risk in both its lending and wholesale money
market activities.
In its core lending activities, the Group
employs sophisticated credit scoring,
underwriting and fraud detection techniques
to support sound decision making and
minimise losses. A proactive approach to the
identification and control of bad and doubtful
debts is maintained in the Credit Risk
Management areas.
Lending policies are agreed by the Board,
with the attendant processes defined and
managed centrally.The Credit Risk
Committee ensures that any exposure to
risk, significant changes in policy or expansion
into new areas of business remain within
overall exposure risk levels agreed by the
Board. Authorised limits for a counterparty
reflect the size of the counterparty’s capital
base and, where published, credit ratings
assigned by the major credit rating agencies.
All credit policies covering lending and
counterparty exposures limits are reviewed
and approved annually by the Board.
Market risk 
The potential adverse change in Group
income or Group net worth arising from
movements in interest rates, exchange rates or
other market prices. Market risk exists to some
extent in all of the Group’s businesses. Effective
management of market risk is essential in
maintaining stable net interest income.
Interest rate risk is the most significant form
of market risk to which the Group is
exposed. It arises from mismatches between
the re-pricing dates of the interest-bearing
assets and liabilities on the Group’s balance
sheet, and from the investment profile of
the Group’s free reserves.Treasury is
responsible for managing this exposure
within the operational limits set out in
the Group’s policies.
The Group’s exposure to market risk is
governed by the Balance Sheet Management
Policy as approved by the Board.This policy
sets out the nature of the risk that may be
taken along with aggregate risk limits, and
stipulates the procedures, instruments and
controls to be used in managing market risk.
The Board has delegated responsibility for
managing the Group’s exposure to market
risk to ALCO. It is ALCO’s responsibility to
approve strategies for managing market risk
exposures and ensuring that Treasury
implements the strategies so that the
exposures are maintained within the Group’s
policies and operational limits. ALCO meets
at least monthly and reviews reports and
other analyses showing the Group’s exposure
to market risks.

exposure
Foreign exchange risk
This arises from activity undertaken by the
Group in order to manage borrowing costs
and investment returns.The Group raises and
invests funds in currencies other than sterling.
As with interest rate risk,Treasury is
responsible for managing this exposure within
the limits as set out in the Group’s policies.
Foreign exchange risk is managed primarily
through the use of currency swaps and
forward foreign exchange contracts.This risk
is also managed, when appropriate, by foreign
currency denominated liabilities being
matched with assets denominated in the
same foreign currency.
Liquidity risk 
It is Group policy to ensure that funds are
available at all times to meet the Group’s
obligations, including the withdrawal of
customer deposits, the drawdown of
customer facilities and growth in the balance
sheet.The development and implementation
of policy is the responsibility of ALCO.
The day-to-day management of liquidity is
the responsibility of Treasury, which provides
funding to, and takes surplus funds from, each
of the Group’s businesses as required.
Liquidity policy is approved by the Board and
agreed within a framework established by the
Financial Services Authority. Regulatory
guidelines and potential outflows of funds
drive the scope and nature of the Group’s
holdings of readily realisable liquid assets.
Derivatives
The Board, through the Balance Sheet
Management Policy, has authorised the use of
certain derivative instruments for the purposes
of supporting the strategic and operational
business activities of the Group and for
managing the risk of loss arising from adverse
changes in interest rates and foreign 
exchange rates.
Detailed disclosures on interest rate risk,
foreign exchange risk, and the use of
derivatives are set out in Note 31 to the
Financial Statements in accordance with
Financial Reporting Standard No.13
‘Derivatives and other financial instruments’.

Full details of the authorised and issued share
capital are provided in note 28 to the Financial
Statements.
The shareholders authorised the Company
to purchase up to 68.2 million of the
Company’s Ordinary shares at the AGM

commenced in February 2002 and at the
year-end 28.2 million shares had been
purchased for cancellation at a cost of 
£88.2 million.The number of shares in 
issue fell as a result from 682 million to 
653.8 million.
The authority to purchase shares remains 
valid until the AGM in 2003 or, if earlier,
22 October 2003. A resolution will be put 
to shareholders to renew the authority 
at the forthcoming AGM.
At the date of this report Legal & General
Group plc had notified (in accordance with
sections 198 to 208 of the Companies Act
1985) that it had a disclosable interest of 3.1%
in the issued share capital of the Company.

together its policies in relation to corporate
social responsibility and issues such as
community involvement, the fair and equal
treatment of staff, employment of disabled
persons, employee participation, health &
safety, commitment to diversity and the
environment. All these matters are detailed in
the section on corporate social responsibility
on pages 31 to 33.
Creditor payment policy
It is the general policy of the Company to
pay creditor invoices 30 days following the

£1 million to its programme of community

organisations of £389,202. Details of the
projects supported are given in the

conducting our business in a socially
responsible manner in respect of the
environment, our employees, our customers,
our shareholders, the local communities and
other stakeholders.
In 2002, we adopted the FORGE Group
framework for CSR Management and
Reporting for the Financial Services Sector.
The framework is recommended by the
British Bankers Association for the financial
services industries.This report follows
their guidelines.
We also recognise the importance of sharing
success and best practice, and we are
members of the London Benchmarking Group
(LBG), which measures our community
investment programme, and Business in
the Community.
Through our membership of the LBG, we are
one of 72 leading companies from the UK,
US and Europe using a consistent model to
measure and report on our community
investment.The LBG model helps us to
improve the management, measurement
and reporting of our programmes.
Steven Crawshaw has been identified as 
the Director responsible for overseeing our
CSR activities.
Community investment
In 2002, Bradford & Bingley invested over 
£1 million directly into the community for the
third consecutive year.We aim to support
those local communities in which we live and
work. Our programme has been ranked as
45th in the FTSE 100 by the 2002 Guardian
Giving List.
As well as financial support, we also offer the
use of our business facilities, such as leasing
out surplus office space to charities, and by
offering collection account facilities in our
branches giving charities access to a national
network for fundraising.
In addition, we encourage our staff to get
involved.We support staff fundraising by
matching the first £250 of funds raised per
employee.We also match staff donations
through our payroll-giving programme, Give
As Y ou Earn. In 2002, charities have received
an extra £74,000 through this matching
scheme.We also support staff who are
involved in local schools by running
programmes for school governors and for
reading volunteers. In 2003 we will be
entering a team of 100 Bradford & Bingley
runners in the Flora London Marathon,
running for Shelter, the official charity of the
2003 London Marathon.
Our community investment covers four main
areas linked to our business:
• Preventing and alleviating the causes
of homelessness
As a board member of Business Action on
Homelessness, Bradford & Bingley is
committed to the support of projects
eradicating the causes of homelessness,
believing that prevention is the best way to
tackle the social injustice of homelessness.
Our largest ever community partnership,
consisting of an initial £500,000 mix of
sponsorship and donation over three years,
saw Bradford & Bingley become the title
sponsors of Shelterline, the 24 hour
national freephone helpline run by Shelter.
In line with our aim of preventing
homelessness, we are working with Shelter
to explore ways of promoting Shelterline as
a preventative, rather than as just an
emergency helpline. In 2002, we funded a
direct mail exercise to target 100,000
households to increase awareness of
Shelterline’s services.
• Personal finance and numeracy education
in schools
By working with Education Extra, the 
out-of- school hours learning charity, we
have set up after-school maths clubs in four
Local Education Authorities in Y orkshire.This
partnership, between business, charity, local
government and schools, is helping to
improve numeracy standards and is having a
positive impact on the general attainment
levels of pupils involved in the clubs.

• Disability access to financial services
As well as being committed to making our
products and services easily available to as
many people as possible, we are also
committed to supporting access to financial
services in general. In 2002, we produced a
braille version of Money Matters in
association with the Royal National Institute
for the Blind, giving general financial advice
and information.
We provide customers with literature in
alternative formats, such as braille, audio
and large print, and in conjunction with
Royal National Institute for the Deaf
(RNID) we provide sign language and
manual interpreting services.We also offer
Typetalk services through our partnership
with RNID.
• Social regeneration through our work
with Housing Associations
Bradford & Bingley is a leading lender to
Housing Associations.We work with over
100 Housing Associations who manage over
75,000 rented homes.T ogether we identify
areas that would benefit from partnership
regeneration projects, such as community
buildings or new playground facilities.
Environment
In 2002, Bradford & Bingley entered the
Business in the Environment Index for the first
time. Although we were ranked 169th out of
an index of 192, the Index has helped us
identify the structure needed to improve our
environmental management procedures, and
we expect to improve in the 2003 Index.
We also consider environmental issues in our
community investment programme:
• Investing in sustainable housebuilding
techniques
In partnership with Berwickshire Housing
Association, we have created the ‘Bradford
& Bingley House’ in Ayton, Berwickshire.The
design of this house explores and utilises
many new environmentally sustainable
housing techniques, including an internal
solar water-heating panel, the first of its kind
in the UK.
• Energy, water, solid waste & recycling
As part of our ongoing environmental
management process, we have targeted a
reduction in our energy consumption and
impact. In 2002, we achieved a 28%
reduction in energy consumption across
the Group.Water consumption fell by 8%,
but our solid waste increased by 11%.We
continue to implement measures to reduce
energy and water consumption, and we
aim to introduce formal environmental
management systems to reduce waste
and paper usage.
• Transport
We have continued to explore
environmentally friendly travel policies,
and in 2002 we introduced a trial lunchtime
bus service for staff from our main office
in Crossflatts,Y orkshire to the surrounding
communities.
Workplace
Bradford & Bingley employs people across the
whole of the UK and is committed to equality
across all aspects of working life.We recognise
the importance of sharing best practice
and success, and so we are members of
Opportunity Now and Race for Opportunity.
Both of these organisations look at ways to
promote gender and race equality within the
workplace.We support the 30 Articles of the
United Nations Universal Declaration of
Human Rights as applied to the workplace.
Women occupy 35% of management roles,
and over time we have increased the number
of female senior managers.We have two
female Directors on the Board, our Group
Finance Director, Rosemary Thorne and 
Non-executive Director, Diana Courtney.

We have worked with Quest for Economic
Development, an organisation supporting the
South Asian community within the UK, to hold
‘Influencers’Visits’ at our major locations.These
visits help raise the awareness of careers at
Bradford & Bingley and support material is
given to influencers to provide information to
the Asian communities.
A programme of community awareness has
been piloted to senior executives and is being
rolled out to middle management.
Since 1995 we have held the ‘Two Ticks’
symbol awarded by the Employment Service,
demonstrating our commitment to best
practice in employing disabled people and
our commitment to developing the full
potential of disabled employees on an equal
basis with others.We are also a member
of the Employers’ Forum on Disability.
The Group has demonstrated its commitment
to staff training and development with a full
range of training and accreditation
programmes in both technical and general
management areas, doubling the average
spend per employee on training in 2002.
We recognise that all staff have a voice in our
organisation, and feedback is encouraged and
valued. As well as an annual opinion survey
amongst all staff, we carry out monthly
surveys, ensuring every staff member is given
the opportunity to take part in at least one
monthly survey each year.We also encourage
feedback via our intranet and communicate
issues that are raised across the Group.
3,428 staff (54%) have chosen to participate
in the Sharesave Scheme, enabling employees
to save to buy Bradford & Bingley shares.
During 2002, we have developed a formal
Occupational Safety & Health Management
System that will be used to form the basis of
future evaluation of our occupational health &
safety profile.
Our Human Risk policy statement has been
updated for 2002 and Steven Crawshaw has
been identified as the Board Director
responsible for championing good Health &
Safety policies throughout the Group.
The external marketplace 
• Products
During 2002, we introduced an increasing
range of ethical investment products to our
customers. As Independent Financial
Advisers, we are able to search the market
to find the best products for our customers.
Our Housing Finance teams have continued
to lend to Housing Associations, enabling
the regeneration of housing stock to take
place across the UK.

Corporate governance
The Directors confirm that for the year
ended 31 December 2002 the Company
complied with the provisions of the
Combined Code (the “Code”) as issued by
the UK Listing Authority.The Code contains
both general principles of good governance
and detailed requirements.The purpose of
this Corporate Governance section together
with the Directors’ Remuneration Report is
to explain how the Company has applied the
governance principles set out in the Code.
The Board
The Directors apply principles of good
governance by adopting the following
procedures and policies:
• The Board meets a minimum of ten times
per year to review operational performance
against plans and budgets and to consider
possible new developments.This includes
one meeting devoted entirely to strategic
matters. The Board has adopted a structure
of mandates, granted to individuals and
committees, throughout the Group, whilst
retaining specified matters for its exclusive
decision;
• The roles of Chairman and Group Chief
Executive are distinct and the offices are
held by different people;
• The Board consists of six non-executive and
three executive Directors. It is the opinion
of the Board that all the non-executive
Directors are independent and bring wide
experience from varied backgrounds to the
working of the Board.Trevor Lewis is the
senior independent non-executive Director;
• The Board reviews its constitution at
appropriate intervals and each Director is
subject to re-election every three years in
line with the Articles of Association;
• For new Directors an appropriate training
programme is established to ensure that
they are fully conversant with their
responsibilities as a Director and with the
business of Bradford & Bingley.Throughout
their period in office, they are updated on
Bradford & Bingley business, the competitive
and regulatory environment in which it
operates and other changes as they occur;
• All Directors have access to the advice
and services of the Company Secretary,
who is responsible for ensuring that Board
procedures and applicable rules and
regulations are observed.The Directors
are able to take independent professional
advice at the Company’s expense.
Principal Board committees
The Directors manage the Group by means
of meetings of the Board and a number of
committees, each of which has detailed terms
of reference.The principal Board committees
are the Audit, Risk & Compliance, the
Nominations and the Remuneration
Committees.The Audit, Risk & Compliance
and the Remuneration Committees comprise
only independent non-executive Directors.
The members of these committees are
identified on pages 26 and 27.
The role of the Audit, Risk & Compliance
Committee is to monitor the effectiveness of
the Group's risk management process and its
financial and other internal control systems
(including effective internal audit, risk
management and compliance functions) and
to review the Group's accounting policies,
Financial Statements and external reporting
responsibilities. Its role also extends to
meeting the external auditors and receiving all
reports by them addressed to the Group and
to undertaking corporate governance and
other duties as required by the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 and applicable
regulations made under it.
During 2002, the Audit, Risk and Compliance
Committee considered issues concerning
auditors and their conflicts of interest.
The business recognises the importance of
internal and external auditors’ independence
and has adopted principles, as follows, to
safeguard this:
• the business will continue, where
appropriate, to use the internal and external
auditors for non-audit work;
• the business recognises the need for
transparency around the services being
provided and for a central independent
overview;
• there is appropriate approval for non-audit
work to ensure the auditors’ independence
is not conflicted; and
• the Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee
monitors audit and non-audit fees paid.
The Nominations Committee is responsible
for reviewing the composition of the Board,
recommending new appointments to the
Board and reviewing re-elections when they
become due.
The Remuneration Committee reviews the
remuneration and contractual arrangements
of the executive Directors and senior
executives, and also the operation of share
plans and options schemes established by
the Company.
Bradford & Bingley is committed to high
standards of corporate governance 
in its business

Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2002
Shareholder relations
The Company is committed to on-going
communication across the shareholder base,
whether to institutional investors, private or
employee shareholders.The Summary
Financial Statement, which summarises
key facts about the Group’s performance,
is distributed to the majority of private
shareholders. All announcements,
presentations and press releases are
available on the website at www.bbg.co.uk
The Company engages in effective two-way
communication with institutional investors,
fund managers and analysts to discuss
publicly available information on its strategy,
performance and policies.
At each Annual General Meeting (AGM) there
is a review of the Company's performance
in the preceding year and the Directors
welcome the opportunity to gather the views
of shareholders who can ask questions of 
the Board.
In connection with the AGM, the Company
complies with the Combined Code as it
relates to the disclosure of proxy voting, the
separation of resolutions and the attendance
of committee chairmen. In addition, the
Notice of the AGM is sent out to arrive at
least 20 business days before the Meeting to
ensure that shareholders have sufficient time
in which to consider the items of business.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s
system of internal control and for reviewing its
effectiveness.The system of internal control is
designed to ensure effective and efficient
operations and compliance with relevant laws
and regulations. Such a system can only
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss, as it is
designed to manage rather than eliminate the
risk of failure to achieve business objectives.
Throughout the year ended 31 December
2002 the Group has operated a system of
internal control, which includes an on-going risk
management process for identifying, evaluating
and managing the significant risks faced by the
Group. During the year the Board has
continued to review and, where necessary,
update the risk management process and the
policies and procedures by which these
significant risks are managed.The Board has
also performed an annual assessment of the
effectiveness of internal controls. Changes in
financial regulation continue within the
industry, and the Group’s risk management
processes are designed to operate to ensure
that the Group responds appropriately both
to actual and proposed regulatory changes.
The Group’s management operates a risk
management process producing a Group-wide
risk profile that identifies the Group’s
significant risks, the probability of those risks
occurring and their impact should they occur,
and has the prime responsibility for the design
and operation of suitable controls and
mitigating actions. This is complemented by
a formalised reporting and escalation process
for control issues. Internal audit has a key role
in maintaining the control environment by
providing independent assurance on the
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control
systems. The Group Risk Committee oversees
the risk management process, considers the
Group-wide risk profile on a monthly basis
and receives monitoring reports to update
them on progress. Further information on
risk management and control is set out on
pages 22 and 23.
The Group is committed to developing and
maintaining an appropriate risk management
culture in all areas. This is achieved through an
organisational structure with clear reporting
lines and governed by appropriate business
monitoring mechanisms, codes of conduct and
policy statements.
The Board reviews the effectiveness of the
system of internal control. The system has
been in place throughout 2002 and up to the
date of approval of the Annual Report &
Accounts. It accords with the Turnbull
Committee guidance.
In reviewing the effectiveness of the system of
internal control the Board takes into account
the work of the Audit, Risk & Compliance
Committee which receives reports from the
Group Risk Committee on the Group’s
significant risks and how these are being
managed, with any significant risk issues
referred to the Board for consideration. It
also considers reports from internal audit,
external audit, compliance and management
on the system of internal control, adherence
to regulatory requirements, any material
control weaknesses, and actions taken to
address problem areas identified. The
Chairman of the Audit, Risk & Compliance
Committee reports on the outcome of each
meeting to the Board, and the Board also
receives minutes of each Audit, Risk &
Compliance Committee meeting.
Going concern
The Directors confirm that they are satisfied
that the Company has sufficient resources
to continue in operation for the foreseeable
future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt
the going concern basis in preparing the
Financial Statements.

Directors’ remuneration report
The following report has been approved by
the Board for agreement with shareholders.
Remuneration Committee
The objective of the Remuneration
Committee (the "Committee") is to develop
remuneration strategies that drive
performance and provide levels of reward that
reflect that performance, both for the
executive Directors and other key executives.
It is also responsible for reviewing the overall
remuneration policy for all employees.
The Committee is composed entirely of
non-executive Directors. It’s members are
Mark Smith (Chairman), Rod Kent (from
26 November 2002),Trevor Lewis and
George Cox. Lindsay Mackinlay was a member
until his retirement on 31 October 2002.
The Committee receives advice from a number
of sources.The Monks Partnership is the
Committee's appointed independent adviser
and provides no other services to the Group.
T owers Perrin provides external advice to the
Board and the Committee on executive
compensation levels, structure and design.
T owers Perrin also provides services to the
Group on employee rewards, retirement and
administration. Mercer Human Resource
Consulting are appointed as the Company’s
pension scheme actuaries and provide advice to
the Company on its pension arrangements.The
Group Chief Executive, Christopher Rodrigues,
and the Managing Director Lending, Steven
Crawshaw, in his capacity as HR Director, are
invited to attend the Committee meetings for
those items other than their own arrangements.
Remuneration policy
Over the last three years the Committee has
developed a coherent set of reward policies
to incentivise performance and balance short
and longer-term goals.
The resulting remuneration package comprises
base salary, benefits, one short-term incentive
(bonus) and two long-term incentives (share
options and performance shares).The package
is structured so that high rewards are paid
only when shareholders benefit from high
returns. In cases of superior performance,
when the options and performance shares
vest in full, around three-quarters of the
remuneration package is dependent on
performance (with reasonable assumptions on
annual share price growth), with the balance
received as fixed pay. For "on target"
performance, the fixed pay element is around
two-thirds of the total package.
The Committee believes that these
remuneration policies meet today's demands
and proposes to make no major changes for the
time being. However, the policies are constantly
under review and shareholders will be kept
informed of any changes in future reports.
The Committee recognises that all employees
must be motivated to align their interests with
those of the shareholders.Wide share
ownership within the Company is therefore
encouraged through the use of a savings
related share option scheme and through
the award of restricted shares to key, high
performing individuals. Over 3,400 employees,
including executive Directors, are currently
members of the savings related share option
scheme, and over 250 employees are shortly
to be awarded restricted shares under a new
scheme, introduced during 2002, which is not
available to executive Directors.
In addition, the Company operates a Group
Profit Share for all employees, subject to
scheme rules.The Group Profit Share only
pays out for Group performance at or above
target. On-target performance delivers 3% of
salary, and the maximum payment is 6%, for
performance which significantly exceeds the
annual pre-tax profit targets.The Group Profit
Share payments for executive Directors are
included in their short-term incentive plan.
Base salary
Base salaries for executive Directors are set
at market levels, aligned to the median of
companies in the financial services sector,
taking into account individual job
responsibilities and personal performance
against pre-set objectives. Salaries are
reviewed annually in April.
Benefits
In line with other companies, benefits are
provided in the form of a company car (or
cash allowance), private medical insurance and
permanent disability and accident insurance.
None of the above benefits is pensionable.
Executive Directors are members of
the Company’s non-contributory pension
plan.This provides an accrued pension
at retirement based on one-fortieth
(one-thirtieth from 1 January 2001) of the
base salary paid over the prior twelve months
("final salary") for each year of pensionable
service, and including pension benefits from
previous employment.
The pension scheme provides a lump sum
death in service benefit of the higher of four
times basic salary or four times earnings in the
previous tax year, together with spouse and
dependents' pensions.
Keith Greenough (who retired on
31 December 2002) was entitled to a
two-thirds final salary pension after twenty
years service, with no actuarial reduction
for early payment, by virtue of an
arrangement inherited on the acquisition
of Mortgage Express.
Rewards are clearly linked to performance
BBS00031P_Inners2  25/2/03  4:40 pm  Page 36 37 Bradford & Bingley plc
Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2002
Contracts
In line with Group policy, all executive
Directors have service contracts that expire 
at normal retirement age (60), but the
Company has the right to give twelve months’
notice of termination (or payment in lieu) and
the Director may give six months’ notice.
During 2002 the terms of these contracts
have been reviewed and a prior requirement
to make additional payments on termination
has been removed.
With effect from 1 January 2003, the
executive Directors will receive a maximum of
twelve months’ basic salary and other benefits
in the event of the Company terminating the
contract without notice for any reason other
than gross misconduct (when there will be no
compensation). The date of each service
contract and the age of each current
executive Director (as at 31 December 2002)
is as follows:
Christopher Rodrigues (53) 3 June 1996
Rosemary Thorne (50) 29 November 1999
Steven Crawshaw (41) 6 April 1999
Keith Greenough 13 October 1998 
(retired 31 December 2002)
Kevin McGuinness 17 March 1997
(retired as a Director 28 February 2002
and retired from the Group 30 June 2002)
Short-term incentive
Along with around 200 other employees,
executive Directors participate in a short-term
incentive plan. The performance measures
(for 2002; group profit, business unit
performance and individual key objectives) 
are designed to deliver year-on-year
improvements in performance. The
Committee expects to continue with similar
measures for 2003. For the achievement of
pre-set stretching targets a bonus of 40% of
basic salary is payable to executive Directors.
However, they can earn up to 80% of salary
for superior performance.
Long-term incentives
Under the long-term incentives, approved by
shareholders as part of the flotation process,
share options are granted to around 80
executives, including executive Directors, to
encourage sustained share price and profit
growth. T o reflect this, and in line with market
practice, the Company’s earnings per share
growth must have been at least 3% per annum
above inflation over a minimum of three years
since grant before the share options can be
exercised. If the performance condition has
not been achieved at the end of three years
the test may be repeated on three further
consecutive occasions, otherwise the options
lapse. In 2002 executive Directors received
option grants to the face value of their basic
salary. The level of the grant up to the
maximum of 100% of base salary is reviewed
on an annual basis.
A Performance Share Plan ("PSP") replaced
the 1998 LTIP on flotation. In order to
incentivise participants, of whom there are 
18 including the executive Directors,
to out-perform the competition over the
longer-term, the performance measure is
comparative T otal Shareholder Return (TSR),
which measures the growth in share price and
re-invested dividends. The group of companies
chosen for comparison is determined for each
PSP award. The current group is composed
of similar financial services companies
(the "comparator group"), and is:
Abbey National Legal & General
Alliance & Leicester Lloyds TSB
Aviva Northern Rock
Barclays Old Mutual
Countrywide Prudential
Egg Royal & Sun Alliance
Royal Bank of Scotland HBOS
At the commencement of each (three-year)
performance period participants are awarded
a "standard" award up to a maximum of one
times basic salary. Executive Directors may
receive a “stretch” award of up to a further
one times basic salary. The level of both the
standard and the stretch award, up to a
combined maximum of twice salary, is reviewed
on an annual basis. Shares are released to
participants depending on the level of the
Company’s TSR relative to the comparator
group at the end of three years. There are
different release criteria for the standard and
stretch awards as set out in the vesting
schedule (see fig.1).
For achievement of relative three-year TSR
between median and the upper threshold,
vesting is on a pro-rata basis. Notwithstanding
the comparative TSR performance, the
Committee must also be satisfied that the
underlying financial performance of the
Company warrants vesting.
This vesting schedule has been adopted to
reward only out-performance against
comparator group and help to ensure that
there is a direct link between the level of the
award and the difficulty of the performance
conditions. If the performance condition is
not achieved at the end of three years, the
award lapses.

Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2002
Directors’ remuneration report
Non-executive Directors
Market level fees for the non-executive
Directors are determined by the Board,
following recommendations from the 
Non-executive Remuneration Committee,
consisting entirely of the executive Directors.
T owers Perrin provides independent advice 
on best practice and market fee levels,
taking into account the responsibilities and
time commitment of each non-executive
Director.
It is the policy of the Board, which we do
not intend to change, that non-executive
Directors do not participate in any incentive
arrangements and none of them has a
service contract.
Trevor Lewis joined the Board in 1990 and is
entitled to participate in the Company’s
private medical insurance arrangements and
the pension plan.This provides for a pension
based on his final basic fee (including that
received as Chairman of Bradford & Bingley
Pensions Limited) at an accrual rate of 
one-thirtieth for each year of pensionable
service subject to the Inland Revenue earnings
cap. He contributes 5% of his fee to the plan.
Lindsay Mackinlay (who also joined the Board
in 1990 and retired on 31 October 2002) had
a similar entitlement, but the accrual rate of
the pension was one-sixtieth.
These pension arrangements do not apply to
any non-executive Director who joined the
Board after 1990.
Performance graph
In accordance with the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (“the
Regulations”), fig. 2 shows Bradford & Bingley’s
TSR compared with the companies comprising
the FTSE 100 for the period from flotation 
on 4 December 2000 to 31 December 2002.
Whilst the FTSE 100 Return Index (of which
Bradford & Bingley is a constituent member)
has been selected for the purposes of the
Regulations to assist shareholders with 
inter-company comparison, the Board
considers the comparator group used for the
PSP (described on page 36) to be a more
appropriate competitive performance measure
for determining the remuneration of the
executive population and has therefore
included an additional graph (fig. 3).
Compliance
This report describes the design and structure
of our remuneration policies and the tables
following show how these have been applied
to each individual Director in the year under
review. These tables have been audited in
compliance with the Directors’ Remuneration
Report Regulations 2002.
We also confirm that the Company complies
with the Combined Code (“the Code”)
appended to the Listing Rules of the UK
Listing Authority and with section 1B of the
Code’s provisions on Directors’ remuneration
and Schedule B to the Code in respect of the
content of the Remuneration Report. This
year’s report also incorporates the additional
information required under the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.

was 353p to 279p.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The following statement, which should be read
in conjunction with the statement of the
Auditor’s responsibilities on page 44, is made
by the Directors to explain their
responsibilities.
The Directors are required by the Companies
Act 1985 to prepare Financial Statements for
each financial year which give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the Company
and the Group as at the end of the financial
year and of the profit or loss for the financial
year.The Directors are required to prepare
the Financial Statements on the going concern
basis unless it is not appropriate.
The Directors consider that, in preparing 
the Financial Statements on pages 45 to 81,
they have used appropriate accounting
policies, consistently applied and supported 
by reasonable and prudent judgements 
and estimates and that all accounting 
standards which they consider applicable 
have been followed.
The Directors have responsibility for 
ensuring that the Company keeps accounting
records which disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position
of the Company and which enable them to
ensure that the Financial Statements comply
with the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors have general responsibility 
for taking such steps as are reasonably open 
to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Group to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.

Annual Report & Accounts

Independent auditor’s report
to the shareholders of Bradford & Bingley plc
We have audited the Financial Statements
on pages 45 to 81.We have also audited the
information in the Directors’ Remuneration
Report on pages 39 to 42.
This report is made solely to the Company’s
shareholders, as a body, in accordance with
section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our
audit work has been undertaken so that we
might state to the Company’s shareholders
those matters we are required to state to
them in an auditor’s report and for no other
purpose.T o the fullest extent permitted by
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility
to anyone other than the Company and the
company’s shareholders as a body, for our
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions
we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors 
and auditors 
The Directors are responsible for preparing
the Annual Report & Accounts. As described
on page 43, this includes responsibility for
preparing the Financial Statements in
accordance with applicable United Kingdom
law and accounting standards. Our
responsibilities, as independent auditors, are
established in the United Kingdom by statute,
the Auditing Practices Board, the Listing Rules
of the Financial Services Authority, and by our
profession’s ethical guidance.
We report to you our opinion as to whether
the Financial Statements give a true and fair
view and are properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985.We also report
to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report
is not consistent with the Financial Statements,
if the Company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received all
the information and explanations we require
for our audit, or if information specified by law
regarding Directors’ remuneration and
transactions with the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the statement on page
34 reflects the Company’s compliance with
the seven provisions of the Combined Code
specified for our review by the Listing Rules,
and we report if it does not.We are not
required to consider whether the Board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks
and controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and 
control procedures.
We read the other information contained in
the Annual Report & Accounts, including the
corporate governance statement and the
unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report, and consider whether it is consistent
with the audited Financial Statements.We
consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements
or material inconsistencies with the Financial
Statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with
Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence
relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
Financial Statements. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and
judgements made by the Directors in the
preparation of the Financial Statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to
obtain all the information and explanations
which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give
reasonable assurance that the Financial
Statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited are free
from material misstatement, whether caused
by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the Financial Statements and
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the Financial Statements give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the Company
and the Group as at 31 December 2002
and of the profit of the Group for the year
then ended; and
• the Financial Statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2002
Notes to the financial statements
1. Principal accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been
applied consistently, with the exception of
Financial Reporting Standard No.19 ‘Deferred
Tax’ referred to in note (a) below, in dealing
with items which are considered material in
relation to the Group and Company
accounts.
(a) Basis of preparation 
The accounts have been prepared in
accordance with applicable Accounting
Standards and published decisions of the
Urgent Issues Task Force under the historical
cost accounting rules. In addition the accounts
have been prepared in accordance with the
special provisions of the Companies Act 1985
applicable to banking companies and banking
groups and in accordance with the
Statements of Recommended Practice
(SORP) issued by the British Bankers’
Association.
Financial Reporting Standard No. 17
‘Retirement Benefits’ has been adopted by 
the Group in respect of its transitional
disclosures. Financial Reporting Standard 
No. 19 ‘Deferred Tax’ has been fully adopted.
Neither of these new accounting standards
has had any significant impact on the results
for the year or net assets of the Group.
(b) Basis of consolidation 
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts
of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings,
and other companies which are considered
by the Directors to be quasi-subsidiaries as
defined in Financial Reporting Standard No. 5
‘Reporting the Substance of Transactions’, all of
which have co-terminous accounting periods.
In addition the accounts comprise the
appropriate share of profits and losses of its
associates and joint ventures.Where
subsidiaries have been acquired during a
period, their results have been consolidated in
the Financial Statements from the date of
acquisition.
(c) Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of
subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures
represents the difference between the fair
value of the consideration and the aggregate
of the fair values of the separate net assets
acquired. Goodwill is included within
intangible fixed assets or investments in joint
ventures and is amortised over a period
appropriate to each acquisition.
Any unamortised goodwill on disposal of a
subsidiary undertaking or joint venture is
charged against the sale proceeds.
Impairment reviews are conducted at the end
of the first full year after the year of
acquisition in accordance with accounting
standards or when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value
of goodwill may not be fully recoverable or
the amortisation period may have reduced.
Any shortfalls are added to the amortisation
of goodwill in the year of the impairment
review.
(d) Taxation 
The charge for taxation is based on the profit
for the year and takes into account taxation
deferred because of timing differences
between the treatment of certain items for
taxation and accounting purposes. Full
provision is made for deferred taxation in
accordance with Financial Reporting Standard
No.19 ‘Deferred Tax’.
(e) Fixed assets and depreciation 
The cost of additions and major alterations to
land and buildings, equipment, fixtures and
motor vehicles is capitalised.
Depreciation is provided so as to write off the
cost, less the estimated residual value, of
tangible fixed assets over their useful
economic lives.
Depreciation is provided as follows:
• freehold and long leasehold buildings at 2%
per annum on a straight-line basis;
• short leasehold properties are amortised
over the remainder of the lease up to 50
years;
• fixtures and fittings at 20% per annum on a
straight-line basis;
• motor vehicles at 25% per annum on a
reducing balance basis;
• computer equipment at rates ranging from
20% to 33% per annum on a straight-line
basis;
• software licences of an enduring nature at
33% per annum on a straight-line basis;
• internet development costs for transactional
based websites at 50% per annum on a
straight-line basis; and
• other equipment and major alterations to
buildings at 10% per annum on a straight-line
basis.
Any impairment in the value of freehold and
long leasehold land and buildings is dealt with
through the Profit and Loss Account as it
arises.
(f) Leasing 
Rentals under operating leases are charged to
administrative expenses in the year in which
the expenditure is incurred.
Assets acquired under finance leases are
capitalised at fair value at the start of the
lease, with the corresponding obligations being
included in other liabilities.The finance lease
costs charged to the Profit and Loss Account
are based on a constant periodic rate as
applied to the outstanding liabilities.

Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2002
Notes to the financial statements
(g) Debt securities 
Debt securities intended for use on a
continuing basis in the Group’s activities are
classified as investment securities and are
stated at cost as adjusted for the amortisation
of any premiums or discounts arising on
acquisition, which are amortised over the
period to redemption on a level yield basis.
Any such amortisation is included in interest
receivable. Provision is made for any
impairment in value.
Each investment in a structured investment
vehicle (‘SIV’) is individually reviewed to ensure
the accounting treatment is appropriate.
Where the SIV is considered to have minimal
management discretion, the Group recognises
its share of the SIV’s underlying assets and
liabilities. In other cases they are treated as
debt securities. Interest on these vehicles
includes a margin above the coupon rate to
reflect profits earned by the underlying
investment.
(h) Pension and post retirement benefits 
The Group charges pension and other post
retirement costs against profits in accordance
with Statement of Standard Accounting
Practice 24 ‘Accounting for Pension Costs’ using
an actuarial method and assumptions 
designed to provide for the anticipated costs
over the remaining service lives of the
employees in the scheme.This method
ensures that the regular costs represent a
relatively equal proportion of the current and
expected future pensionable payroll in the
light of current actuarial assumptions. Any
SSAP 24 prepayment or liability is included in
prepayments and accrued income or other
liabilities as appropriate with all charges to
the Profit and Loss Account, including interest,
in administrative expenses.
Variations from regular cost are spread over
the remaining service lives of current
employees in the scheme.
(i) Provisions for bad and doubtful debts
Provisions for losses on residential loans and
advances to customers are made throughout
the year and at the year-end.The basis for
determining the level of provisions is to
provide for all reasonably foreseeable losses
that exist in the portfolio at the date of
calculation.
Specific provisions for residential lending are
created for cases with arrears to debt ratios
of 2.5% or greater.The potential shortfall is
calculated from the outstanding mortgage
debt plus costs of re-possession less the
estimated property value with a discount
valuation factor for forced sale.The potential
shortfall for each case is adjusted to reflect
the probability of loss.This adjustment reflects
historic performance except for specialist
lending where, because this area of lending
is not yet mature, probabilities of loss are
predicted by reference to the credit
scoring system.
The specific provision for properties in
possession is based on the contracted/agreed
sale price or sale valuation with adjustment
for expenses of sale and income from
insurance policies.
Specific provisions for the commercial
portfolio are calculated on all cases three or
more months in arrears. A probability of loss,
dependent on the severity of the arrears, is
applied on a case-by-case basis.
General provisions are raised to cover losses
which are judged to be present in loans and
advances at the balance sheet date, but which
have not been specifically identified as such.
The general provision also takes into account
the economic climate in the market and the
level of security held.
General provisions are made in respect of the
commercial portfolio to reflect loans that may
be impaired but which are not currently
identified by the specific provisioning
methodology.
Loans and advances are written off where
there is no realistic prospect of recovery.
Interest charged to all residential and
commercial loans which are in arrears or in
possession, and where the interest is expected
to be irrecoverable, is suspended from other
interest receivable and similar income.
(j) Debt and capital instrument issue costs 
These are amortised over the period to the
instruments’ maturity at a constant rate and
included in interest payable.The unamortised
amounts are deducted from the relevant
liability.
In the event of early repayment the
unamortised issue cost is charged to interest
payable.
(k) Interests in joint ventures 
Joint ventures are undertakings in which the
Group holds an interest on a long-term basis
and are jointly controlled by the Group and
one or more other venturers under a
contractual agreement.
The Group’s share of profits less losses from
joint ventures is included in the Profit and
Loss Account using the gross equity method.
The holding value of joint ventures in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet is calculated by
reference to the Group’s share of the gross
assets, including Group loans to the joint
venture and any related unamortised goodwill,
less its share of the gross liabilities, as shown
by the most recent accounts available.
(l) Foreign currencies 
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currency that have been hedged by means of
matching foreign currency contracts, have been
translated at the exchange rate inherent in
those contracts.Where assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currency have not
been hedged, they have been translated at the
rate of exchange at the balance sheet date.
Any gains or losses are included in interest
receivable or payable depending on the
underlying instrument being an asset or liability.
BBS00031P_Inners2  25/2/03  3:56 pm  Page 50 51 Bradford & Bingley plc
Annual Report & Accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2002
(m) Mortgage indemnity insurance 
Charges to borrowers in respect of high
loan-to-value advances are paid to a wholly
owned captive insurance company. In the
Group accounts these charges are treated
as deferred income and deducted from
loans and advances to customers.The
income deferred is released to interest
receivable on a level yield basis over the
life of the mortgage.
(n) Incentives to customers 
Cashbacks, interest discounts and other
incentives to customers are amortised against
interest receivable and similar income or
interest payable over the early redemption
clawback period of these products
commencing from the date of completion.
The period over which incentives are
amortised was amended in 2002 from twelve
months to the early redemption clawback
period.The provision for interest discounts is
shown within other liabilities. Unamortised
cashbacks and other incentives are held within
prepayments and accrued income.
(o) Acquisition of mortgage portfolios
Premiums paid on the acquisition of mortgage
portfolios are held within other assets and
amortised over the estimated economic life of
the underlying asset.Where such mortgage
portfolios are acquired as part of a company
purchase, the resulting charge is included
within administrative expenses.Where such
mortgage portfolios are acquired as a result
of a specific asset purchase, the resulting
charge is deducted from interest receivable.
(p) Loans and advances to customers subject
to non-recourse funding 
Loans and advances to customers subject to
non-recourse funding are included in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet using the linked
presentation method. Such balances are stated
at book value.The profit on ordinary activities
before taxation is included within other
operating income in the Consolidated Profit
and Loss Account.
The same provisioning policies as stated in
note (i) above apply to these loans.
(q) Off-balance sheet financial instruments 
Off-balance sheet financial instruments are
entered into by the Group for hedging
purposes to reduce the risks arising on
transactions entered into in the normal course
of business.This hedging is reviewed on a
regular basis.
The income or expense arising from off-balance
sheet financial instruments entered into for
hedging purposes is recognised in the
accounts in accordance with the accounting
treatment of the underlying transaction or
transactions being hedged.
Where off-balance sheet instruments are
terminated prior to the underlying hedged
transaction terminating, any profits or losses
realised upon early termination are deferred
and matched against the income or
expenditure arising from the underlying
hedged transaction over the remaining period
of the hedging instrument. If the underlying
hedged transaction is extinguished or
terminated, the remaining unamortised gains
or losses on the hedge are recognised in the
Profit and Loss Account immediately.
The Group does not undertake transactions
for trading or speculative purposes and
consequently all off-balance sheet financial
instruments are classified as hedging contracts.
(r) Income recognition 
• Interest income is recognised in the Profit
and Loss Account as it accrues except
where interest is suspended as set out in
accounting policy note(i).
• Commercial lending fees charged in lieu of
interest are recognised in the Profit and Loss
Account as interest receivable on a level
yield basis over the discount period of the
interest foregone.
• Residential lending fees and commissions
receivable are recognised in the Profit and
Loss Account on receipt within Fees and
Commission Receivable.
• Commission receivable from Regulated
Financial Services products is recognised as
income within Fees and Commissions
Receivable when the policy goes ‘On Risk’
net of any provision for repayment in the
event of termination by the customer.
• Procurement Fees from sale of mortgages
are recognised when the house sale
completes and the mortgage becomes
active.
• Client Fees are recognised on the exchange
of contract for the relevant property.
• Estate Agency fees on sales of new and
second hand homes sales are recognised on
exchange of contracts.
(s) Fees payable 
Fees payable to brokers and agents in respect
of the sale of Bradford & Bingley mortgages
are fully expensed as incurred.

(b) Quasi-subsidiaries 
Advances secured on residential property subject to non-recourse funding
A quasi-subsidiary of the Group, Aire Valley Finance plc, has a portfolio of residential mortgage assets.The portfolio was funded by the issue of
£989m of bonds, serviceable only from the cash flows generated by the mortgage portfolio, together with £36.0m of subordinated finance from
the Group. At 31 December 2002, bonds including accrued interest and the aforementioned subordinated finance to the value of £45.3m were
held by the Group.
A second quasi-subsidiary of the Group, Aire Valley Trustees (No. 2) Ltd, also has a portfolio of residential mortgage assets.The beneficial interest
in this portfolio was subsequently transferred to a third quasi-subsidiary of the Group, Aire Valley Finance (No. 2) plc. Aire Valley Finance (No. 2)
plc was funded by the issue of £1bn of bonds, serviceable only from the cash flows generated by the mortgage portfolio, together with £22.9m of
subordinated finance from the Group. At 31 December 2002 the subordinated finance from the Group, including accrued interest, was £23.1m.
Aire Valley Trustees (No. 2) Ltd has entered into interest rate swaps (‘swaps’) with Bradford & Bingley plc as the swap counterparty to manage
the interest rate basis risk payable on the loan notes issued by Aire Valley Finance (No. 2) plc. Mortgage income received by Aire Valley Trustees
(No. 2) Ltd from the securitised mortgage portfolio is passed to Bradford & Bingley plc which then pays a floating rate of interest to Aire Valley
Trustees (No. 2) Ltd to enable payment of interest on the loan notes.There are two swaps, a fixed rate swap with a capped notional volume of
£600m and maximum term of ten years, and a floating rate swap with a capped notional volume of £650m and a maximum term of two years.
The Group is not obliged to support any losses in respect of these mortgages, other than to the extent of its subordinated funding, nor does it
intend to do so.This is clearly stated in the agreements with the bond holders.
The controlling interests of Aire Valley Finance plc, Aire Valley Finance (No. 2) plc and Aire Valley Trustees (No. 2) Ltd are held by a discretionary
trustee.The Group receives an administration fee for servicing the mortgage portfolios of both Aire Valley Finance plc and Aire Valley Finance
(No.2) plc, together with any residual income arising after the claims of the bond holders are met.

The net book value of land and buildings comprises:
Freehold 77.1 94.2 72.4 89.5 
Long leasehold (50 or more years unexpired) 6.4 6.9 5.9 6.3

88.2 104.8 83.0 98.2 
Net book value of property occupied for own activities 82.7 88.9 77.5 82.3 
The Group’s policy is to value approximately one third of land and buildings each year, although no adjustment is made to the asset values as
shown in the Balance Sheets. On the basis of the latest valuation in each case, the total market value at 31 December 2002 was £105.7m
compared with a net book value of £88.2m.
The value attributed has been arrived at by the Directors on an open market valuation, with the exception of the Group’s principal administration
centres at Crossflatts and Bingley.These properties are regarded as specialised properties which have a long term benefit to the Group and
are valued on the basis of depreciated replacement cost.These valuations have been carried out by members of the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors.

The Company was formed and shares issued in accordance with the Building Societies Act 1986. Under these statutory provisions the former
Bradford & Bingley Building Society subscribed for 682m ordinary shares of 25p each in the Company.The former Society distributed these shares
on conversion in December 2000. The issued share capital has reduced as a result of a share buy-back programme, approved by shareholders at
the Annual General Meetings in 2001 and 2002, which commenced in February 2002. During 2002, 28.2m shares were purchased for cancellation
at a cost of £88.2m (excluding commissions and stamp duty).
The Group and Company holds on their Balance Sheet own shares of £20.8m (2001: £11.3m) which represent shares held by share trusts for the
purpose of executive and employee share awards/savings schemes. Own shares are carried at cost less any provision for a permanent diminution
in value.
Bradford & Bingley Profit Sharing Scheme
At conversion, qualifying employees received an allocation of 250 shares each and had the opportunity to hold these shares in the Bradford &
Bingley Profit Sharing Scheme.This scheme operates a trust fund, known as the Bradford & Bingley Share Ownership Trust, which is under the
control of independent trustees, Computershare Trustees Limited. By leaving the shares in the Bradford & Bingley Share Ownership Trust for three
years employees will not have to pay income tax and national insurance contributions on receipt of those shares.
In March 2001 and March 2002, employees entitled to the Group bonus could elect to receive shares under the rules of the Bradford & Bingley
Profit Sharing Scheme.These shares are also held in the Bradford & Bingley Share Ownership Trust.
At 31 December 2002 the trustees of the Bradford & Bingley Share Ownership Trust held 2,422,919 shares (2001: 1,665,933) on behalf of 4,607
employees (2001: 4,208).
Bradford & Bingley Employees’ Share Trust
On 3 October 2000 the Company established an offshore employee share trust, the Bradford & Bingley Employees’ Share Trust, for the purpose of
receiving monies and acquiring shares to be used in conjunction with any employee share schemes established by the Company. At 31 December
2002 the trustee of this trust, Mourant & Co.Trustees Limited, held 4,265,769 (2001: 2,165,308) shares to satisfy share awards and options which
have been made or are to be made in accordance with the rules of the employee share schemes established by the Company.The market value
of shares held at 31 December 2002 was £12,370,730 (2001: £6,171,128). During 2002 the Company provided £7.4m (2001: £1.2m) for share
purchases.This trust currently holds shares relating to the Long Term Incentive Plan, Executive Share Option Scheme, Performance Share Plan and
the Employees' Restricted Share Bonus Plan which are detailed below.
Long T erm Incentive Plan
Under the rules of the 1998 Long T erm Incentive Plan it was possible for the participants to elect to take share options rather than the cash
entitlements. Awards were made under this plan on 12 December 2000 and 50 participants elected to take options over 353,744 shares exercisable
at the same time as the cash payments (40% immediately and two further equal tranches on the first and second anniversaries).The options over
shares remain exercisable during the first five years following the award date. At year end, 149,218 (2001: 278,893) shares remained under option.
Executive Share Option Scheme
Grants of approved and unapproved share options were made under the rules of the Bradford & Bingley 2000 Share Option Scheme as detailed
below.The shares are exercisable subject to the achievement of a performance target linked to an increase in the Company’s earnings per share.
The options over shares are exercisable over the period of three to ten years after the date of the grant.

31. Derivatives and other financial instruments
(a) Financial instruments and risk management
The Group’s core business is to provide its customers with financial products appropriate to their needs, from mortgages and savings accounts to
long-term investment products and insurance products. The Group uses wholesale financial instruments to invest in liquid assets and to raise
funds from wholesale money markets in support of its retail savings and mortgage operations. These instruments also allow it to manage the risks
arising from these business activities.
The Group has a well established formal structure for managing risks which includes formal risk policies, risk limits, reporting structures, mandates
and control procedures. The Group’s approach to risk management and control is set out within the Financial Review on pages 22 and 23. The
Board delegates the management of all aspects of market and liquidity risk to the Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO).
Financial instruments used by the Group for risk management purposes include off-balance sheet or derivative instruments. Such instruments are
only used to limit the extent to which the Group will be affected by changes in interest rates and exchange rates. As part of its responsibilities,
ALCO approves the use of specified off-balance sheet instruments within approved limits and business activities.

(a) Financial instruments and risk management – continued
The Group does not undertake transactions for trading or speculative purposes and consequently all off-balance sheet financial instruments are
classified as hedging contracts.The principal off-balance sheet instruments used by the Group in managing its balance sheet risk exposures are
interest rate swaps, interest rate options, cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts. These are used to protect the Group
from exposures arising principally from fixed and capped rate mortgage lending, fixed rate savings products, deposit funding and investment
activities. The duration of off-balance sheet contracts is generally short to medium-term and their maturity profile reflects the nature of exposures
arising from underlying business activities.
At the year-end the Group had no material exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations or changes in foreign currency interest rates.

A positive interest rate sensitivity gap exists when more assets than liabilities re-price during a given period. Although net interest income tends
to benefit from a positive gap when interest rates are rising (and a negative gap when rates are falling), the actual effect will depend upon a
number of factors, including the extent to which repayments are made earlier or later than the next reset or maturity date.

Set out below is a comparison of carrying values and fair values of certain of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities at 31 December
2002. The Group does not undertake transactions for trading or speculative purposes. The table excludes certain financial assets and financial
liabilities which are not listed or publicly traded, or for which a liquid and active market does not exist. It therefore excludes items such as
mortgages, customer accounts and deposits with banks.

Where a market exists, market values have been used to determine the fair value of debt securities issued and held. Where no market exists,
discounted cash flow techniques have been used to determine the fair value using market interest rates for the relevant assets.The fair values of
off-balance sheet ﬁnancial instruments have been determined using market interest rates in discounted cash flow techniques. Fair values of interest
rate caps and collars have been calculated using option-pricing models.

Deferred balances relating to settled derivatives and other financial transaction provisions, used as hedges, will be released to the Profit and Loss
Account in the same periods as the income and expenditure flows from the underlying hedged transactions. The above table shows the gains and
losses on off-balance sheet derivative instruments used for hedging by the Group. The gains and losses therefore do not represent absolute gains
and losses expected by the Group as they will be substantially offset by corresponding losses or gains from on-balance sheet instruments.

33. Retirement benefits
(a) Pension schemes
The Company operates two funded defined benefit staff pension schemes, administered by trustees, both of which are closed schemes. The funds
are independent from those of the Company. The normal pension age of employees in the schemes is 60 years. Pension costs in the principal
scheme are assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary using the projected unit method and the second, smaller scheme, uses the
aggregate method. The most recent actuarial valuation of the schemes was at 30 June 2000. The aggregate actuarial value of the schemes’ assets
was sufficient to cover 110% of the aggregate benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The aggregate market value of the schemes’ assets at 30 June 2000 was £343.3m.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and
the rates of increase in salaries and pensions. The rate of return on investments has been assumed to exceed the rate of salary increases by 2.0%
per annum and present and future pensions by 2.0% per annum.
The pension charge takes account of the surpluses disclosed, which are amortised over a period of 15 years, being the estimated average
remaining service lives of pension scheme members.
The Group also operates two further schemes, one defined contribution and one defined benefit which are not material.
The total pension cost for the Group was £10.7m (2001: £11.9m) and included £0.2m (2001: £0.1m) in respect of pensions to former Directors
which was charged to ‘other administrative expenses’.
Because of the rapid decline in world stock markets during the year, we reviewed our liabilities within the principal scheme in advance of our
triennial valuation, due in June 2003.This review revealed a deficit within the fund and, whilst pension funding is essentially a long-term consideration,
we considered it prudent to transfer an additional £50m to our pension fund.
(b) Other post-retirement benefits
The Company provides concessionary rate mortgages and health care benefits to some of its pensioners. The cost of health care benefits is
recognised in accordance with the stated accounting policy. The cost of concessionary rate mortgages is not significant and is recognised in the
Profit and Loss Account as it is incurred.
(c) Financial Reporting Standard No.17 ‘Retirement Benefits’
Whilst the company continues to account for pension costs in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 ‘Accounting for
Pension Costs’, under FRS 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’ the following transitional disclosures are required:
The SSAP 24 valuation at 30 June 2000 has been updated by the actuary on an FRS 17 basis at 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2001. The
major assumptions used in this valuation were:

The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale
covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The fair value of the schemes’ assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short-term and may be subject to significant change before they
are realised and the present value of the schemes’ liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and thus inherently
uncertain, were:

Notes
(a) In order to analyse net interest by business segment it is necessary to apply a transfer price to the internal funding or liquidity requirement of
each segment. Interest rates used for transfer pricing have been determined to retain the interest rate risk within Treasury. Costs have been
assigned to each segment based on resources consumed. Transfer pricing in respect of mortgage origination by the Distribution segment has
been determined on the basis of market rates for such activity.
(b) Exceptionals have not been allocated across business segments since they are the consequence of Group-level decisions.
(c) For the purposes of segmental information net assets have been allocated to Lending, Savings and Distribution on the basis of the regulatory
capital framework. The segments are not allocated capital during the normal course of business, therefore segmental profits do not relate to
these net assets.
(d) The Group operates entirely within the retail financial services sector and accordingly no segmental analysis of turnover has been presented.
Please refer to the Financial Review for more information on segmental performance.

ShareGift scheme
Many investors find themselves owning parcels
of shares in quantities so small that it would
cost more to sell them than they are worth.
They may therefore be too small to do
anything with, but may still bring a tax liability
on any dividends paid and unwanted annual
reports and other documents.
Bradford & Bingley plc supports the ShareGift
scheme, which is administered by The Orr
Mackintosh Foundation (registered charity
number 1052686).
Any shares that you donate to the ShareGift
scheme will be transferred into the name of
The Orr Mackintosh Foundation, who will
aggregate them, sell them when possible, and
donate the proceeds to a growing list
of charities. Since ShareGift was started over
£3,000,000 has been given to more than
400 different charities.
If you would like to participate in the
ShareGift scheme, or receive more
information about the scheme, they can be
contacted by visiting their website at
www.sharegift.org.uk, by calling 0207 337 0501,
or by writing to The Orr Mackintosh
Foundation, 46 Grosvenor Street,
London W1K 3HN.

Dividends will be paid to you by cheque to
the address held by the Registrar or they can
be credited to a suitable bank or building
society account.

The Group has delivered a 21% increase in headline profits as a result of 
strong growth in Huntsworth Health, Citigate Dewe Rogerson and Red, 
together with favourable movements in exchange rates. While Grayling 
declined, the restructuring is now complete and as a result the division is 
well-placed to return to profitability in 2017 .
The Group is now positioned for continued growth, led by Huntsworth 
Health and supported by favourable exchange rates.

In last year’s annual report I stated that 
the key operational objective for 2016 
was to return the Group to revenue 
and profit growth. I’m pleased to say 
that we have achieved that with like-
for-like revenue growth of 1% and 
strong growth in headline profit of 
21%. This progress represents a good 
start to Huntsworth’s recovery.
After several changes in the previous 
two years, the Board has enjoyed 
some welcome stability this year, with 
all members now fully embedded into 
the business. The Board did see the 
departure of Terry Graunke, a Non-
Executive Director, in May 2016, and I 
would like to thank Terry for his support 
and help in guiding the Group over the 
critical restructuring period from 2014 to 
2016. CEO, Paul Taaffe, and Neil Jones, 
who joined as CFO on 1 February 2016, 
now form a very experienced and strong 
executive management team.
This team has continued to refine and 
execute the Group’s strategy during 2016, 
with a focus on reducing the cost base 
and removing loss making agencies. 
Huntsworth Health, which is now firmly 
established as the largest division in the 
Group by both revenues and profits, 
has continued to deliver strong growth 
and is the primary focus of the Group’s 
future development. Red continues to 
prove its credentials as a leading PR 
business in the UK with good growth 
in a highly competitive environment 
and has momentum moving into 2017. 
Citigate Dewe Rogerson has again 
performed strongly in some regions and 
less so in others, which are the target 
for improvement in the coming year. 
Grayling’s performance has been the 
major disappointment this year with the 
loss of key contracts in Africa and the 
Middle East and the restructuring in the 
US weighing heavily on its profitability. 
However, the actions taken in late 2015 
plus further restructuring undertaken 
this year are starting to produce results. 
Grayling is now smaller, more nimble 
and more focused, and we remain 
confident that the work we have done 
has positioned this division to return to 
improved profitability.
With the restructuring complete 
and Group profits growing, the 
key operational objective of 2017 
is to accelerate that growth, with 
improved contributions expected 
from all divisions. The hard work that 
has gone into establishing a stronger 
business is now being seen in the 
Group’s results, and we enter 2017 
with confidence for the year ahead.
On behalf of the Board, I would like 
to thank the management team and 
staff for their hard work in getting to 
this stage. I look forward to reporting 
on our progress in delivering these 
improvements during 2017.
Derek Mapp
Chairman
With the restructuring

Chief Executive’s Review
Three of our four divisions grew revenue 
and profits in 2016, and with the 
restructuring complete, each business  
is well positioned for profit growth.
Paul Taaffe
Chief Executive Officer
Delivering our  
full potential
Huntsworth continued to make progress 
in 2016 with three of our four divisions 
growing both revenue and profitability, 
and the restructuring now complete.
Huntsworth Health was the outstanding 
performer again this year with double-
digit revenue and profit growth, and the 
organic development of new agency 
offerings within the consumer-focused 
Evoke Health. Health remains the key 
asset within the Group, representing over 
50% of our revenues, and will be the focus 
of our development in the coming year. 
Red continued to grow well in a very 
competitive and sluggish market, 
holding high margins and continuing 
to win awards for the high quality work 
it does for its blue chip client base. 
Citigate Dewe Rogerson has made a 
welcome return to revenue and profit 
growth while making a number of 
changes to expand into more markets.

Grayling’s continued disappointing 
performance led to a deeper 
restructuring. As noted earlier in the year, 
Grayling experienced challenging trading 
conditions, particularly in the US, which 
was the main focus of our final phase of 
restructuring, but also in the Middle East 
region, where it has suffered client losses 
and delays in client renewals. During the 
second half of the year we accelerated 
Grayling’s restructuring, removing 
unprofitable agencies and closing the 
state lobbying business in the US, and 
sold Hudson Sandler to management 
with the Group while retaining a 25% 
minority stake. Since the year-end 
Whiteboard Associates has also been 
sold to management, allowing Grayling 
US to focus on its PtR offering.
Alongside these divestments, we 
have looked to reduce the cost base 
of each business, including central 
overhead, by redeploying resources, 
consolidating the property portfolio 
further, closing offices where necessary 
and restructuring others to align them 
to market needs. 2016 saw restructuring 
costs of £1.6 million (2015: £3.3 million) 
as we completed the process we started 
in mid-2015. We have completed the 
major restructuring and have now 
positioned each of our businesses for 
profit growth in 2017 and beyond.
Group performance overview
The Group’s performance this year 
primarily reflects a combination of 
strong growth from Huntsworth Health, 
underperformance from Grayling, 
and the impact of a favourable move 
in exchange rates. The following 
bridge shows the key movements in 
headline profits before tax in 2016:
 
The devaluation of Sterling against our 
main trading currencies over the course 
of 2016, particularly since the UK’s 
decision to leave the EU, has generated 
a translational gain of £2.4 million. This 
has been offset by an incremental loss 
of £0.6 million on FX forward contracts. 
Losses from discontinued operations also 
increased by £0.1 million. Together, these 
factors left like-for-like profits up  
£1.7 million.
On a like-for-like basis, Huntsworth 
Health has generated an additional 
£2.0 million of profits, driven by strong 
revenue growth, particularly in the US. 
In addition, central costs reduced by 
£1.7 million, reflecting a restructuring of 
central functions and tighter control over 
discretionary expenditure. These gains, 
together with an additional £0.4 million 
of profits from CDR and Red, were offset 
by a £3.2 million decrease in profits from 
Grayling. This has been driven primarily 
by the META region where trading has 
been impacted by the loss of a major 
client and the ending of a key project, and 
the US where actions have been taken to 
transition the business to a more stable 
and profitable client base.

Chief Executive’s Review continued
The Group’s income statement reflects 
these trends. Revenues were £180.1 
million in 2016 (2015: £168.4 million), 
with favourable currency movements 
contributing £14.1 million to revenue. 
On a like-for-like basis, revenues grew 
by 1%, reflecting strong growth from 
Huntsworth Health offset by decreases 
in Grayling. Headline profit before tax 
was £16.0 million, an increase of 21%. 
Operating losses were £14.5 million 
(2015: loss of £37.8 million), with much 
of the improvement attributable to a 
lower goodwill impairment charge. 
The following table reconciles statutory 
to headline profits:
£’m 2016 2015
Operating loss (14.5) (37.8)
Goodwill impairment 30.5 48.8
Impairment of software 
development costs 0.2 0.6
Amortisation of 
intangible assets 0.9 0.8
Restructuring costs 1.6 3.3
Transaction related credit (0.7) (0.4)
Operating profit before 
highlighted items 18.0 15.3
Margin 10% 9%
Interest (2.0) (2.0)
Headline profit before tax 16.0 13.3
The Group’s effective tax rate has 
increased to 30% (2015: 27%) of headline 
profits as the continued growth of 
Huntsworth Health increases the 
proportion of the Group’s profits that 
arise in the USA. Before highlighted items, 
diluted earnings per share is 3.4p (2015: 
3.0p), up 13%. After highlighted items, 
diluted loss per share is 5.6p (2015: 12.3p).
Divisional performance overview
Huntsworth Health
Huntsworth Health is the Group’s largest 
division by both revenue and profit. 
It has a strong portfolio of specialist 
healthcare communications agencies 
that have continued to perform well 
above industry averages, with double-
digit revenue and operating profit 
growth, and strong operating margins.
Divisional revenues in 2016 were £90.8 
million (2015: £72.3 million), up 14% on 
Our business model

a like-for-like basis. Operating profits 
were £18.3 million (2015: £13.8 million), 
representing operating profit growth of 
33% and an operating margin of 20% 
(2015: 19%).
Growth continues to be driven mainly 
by the US market where our full service 
digital consumer agency, Evoke Health, 
grew like-for-like revenues by 12%, 
strategic medical agency, ApotheCom, 
grew like-for-like revenues by 19%, and PR 
agency, Tonic Life Communications, grew 
like-for-like revenues by 15%. Huntsworth 
Health’s smaller brands – Audacity, Axiom 
and Nitrogen – experienced challenging 
trading conditions with like-for-like 
revenues down 13%. Actions have been 
taken to reduce the cost base of these 
units and they are on track to deliver 
an improved performance in 2017.
During the year Huntsworth Health 
invested in new organic growth 
opportunities with a new Evoke Health 
office in Los Angeles and a new 
strategic consulting agency, Traverse 
Health Strategy. FIRSTHAND, the 
digitally-driven, full service, marketing 
communications agency which opened in 
late 2015, also made a solid contribution 
to the results. Huntsworth Health will 
continue to invest in areas which offer the 
opportunity to accelerate its growth and 
even better meet the needs of its clients.
All agencies in Huntsworth Health have 
good momentum going into 2017 with a 
number of recent significant client wins. 
As such the division has the foundations 
for another year of strong revenue and 
operating profit growth in 2017.
Grayling
Grayling revenues fell 15%, or 17% on a l 
ike-for-like basis, to £53.9 million, resulting 
in a loss of £0.8 million (2015: profit of 
£2.6 million). 2016 has seen a continuation 
of the restructuring programme begun in 
2015, with the closure or disposal of loss-
making operations, and the reduction of 
the cost base.
The overall result masks a varied 
performance between regions. 
Continental Europe remains the strongest 
and most profitable part of the division, 
although revenues fell by 6% on a like-
for-like basis in 2016 reflecting difficult 
economic conditions. Nevertheless, 
margins broadly held up on 2015 levels 
and actions have been taken to deal with 
the underperforming operations within 
the region, including the closure of the 
Swedish office at the end of 2016.
In the UK, the benefits of the 
restructure in late 2015 have become 
apparent in the second half of 2016. 
Nevertheless, the region experienced 
tough trading over the course of the 
year with revenues down 23% on a 
like-for-like basis. In October 2016 
the Group completed the disposal 
of 75% of Hudson Sandler, its niche 
financial PR business, to management. 
The Group’s remaining stake in the 
associate business is expected to 
be earnings enhancing in 2017.
The META region has experienced a 
difficult trading year with the loss of a 
major client and the end of one of its 
biggest projects, which have impacted 
on its profitability. Changes made 
should drive more profitability in 2017. 
The US business underwent a transitional 
year, as it exited from its state and local 
lobbying activities. As part of this, in 
January 2017 the Group completed 
the disposal of Whiteboard Advisors, a 
strategic communications consultancy, to 
management, for an initial consideration 
of $2.5 million. In the future, the division 
will be focused on higher value PR 
budgets, digital marketing and branding 
opportunities, all of which are expected 
to help the region return to growth.
2016 has been a difficult year for Grayling, 
but Q4 saw revenues stabilise, and with 
the actions taken over the past twelve 
months the division is in a good position 
to return to profitability in 2017.
Citigate Dewe Rogerson
CDR revenues in 2016 were £22.1 million 
(2015: £20.0 million), representing like-
for-like growth of 4%. Operating profits 
were £3.6 million (2015: £3.1 million), 
representing a margin of 16% (2015: 15%). 
Within this overall result, performance 
has varied between regions in 2016. 
The Asian business, based primarily in 
Hong Kong and Singapore, continued to 
produce a strong performance in a tough 
marketplace with like-for-like revenues up 
1%. Margins also rose by 5% as the division 
focused on its operational efficiency.
Continental Europe faced tough 
comparatives after strong transaction 
revenues in the Netherlands in 
2015, leaving like-for-like revenues 
across the region down 2%. 
Nevertheless, continental Europe 
maintained its strong margins.
In the UK, CDR has invested in new 
talent and has continued to build on 
sector specialisms. As part of this, it 
established a presence in New York, 
which adds to its international reach 
and allows it access to the US market. 
The benefits of these investments are 
starting to be seen, despite continued 
intense price competition and lower 
volumes of transaction mandates. Overall, 
the UK/US business produced like-for-
like revenues up 12%, on fractionally 
lower margins, which will improve as 
the staff in which we have recently 
invested reach their full potential.
Red
Red performed strongly in 2016 in 
what remains a highly competitive 
environment, and remains a market-
leading PR business in the UK.  
Revenues were £13.3 million (2015:  
£12.8 million) representing growth of  
4%. Operating profits were £2.7 million 
(2015: £2.6 million), representing a margin 
of 20% (2015: 20%).
Highlights in 2016 included a major 
award-winning, digital content-based 
campaign for Boots Opticians which 
saw the agency build a world-first 
children’s eye-test book for parents. 
Other consumer campaigns in the 
year included stand-out work for 
McDonald’s nationwide restaurant 
makeover programme and a ‘Welcome 
to Heathrow’ online video launch. 
New clients to the agency included 
Robinson’s soft drinks, Spotify, Gumtree 
and Trainline. In addition, the agency’s 
outstanding talent development was 
recognised with its second Media 
Employer of the Year award. 
Growth momentum and organic 
investment plans give encouragement 
for continued improvements in 2017. 
Group Outlook
The Group is now positioned for 
continued growth and 2017 has started 
well. Huntsworth Health continues to 
grow strongly on the back of multiple 
client wins, Grayling, Red and CDR are 
making positive progress, and together 
with favourable exchange rates, the 
outlook for 2017 is positive.

Strategic Report
Our Approach 
• Exceptional brands are built from 
exceptional strategies. Data that 
informs our understanding of the 
world in which individuals will become 
immersed in a brand are critical to 
the strategic process. We develop 
deep insights into individual customer 
culture, values, norms and behaviour 
so that we understand how your 
customers will engage physically and 
emotionally with your brand.
• Creativity is not a commodity. It’s a 
unique intellectual process driven 
by talent and fuelled by freedom of 
thought. Creativity should not be 
stifled by technology—we embrace 
the new and exciting creative 
opportunities that technology is 
enabling us to leverage into compelling 
brand experiences and we thrive on 
the creative process.
• Technology is enabling health and 
science in a very broad way. We see 
technology driving two very critical 
aspects of health and science brand 
communications:
 – The diagnosis and management 
of disease on an individual patient 
level.
 – Immersing healthcare professionals, 
patients, and consumers in 
engaging content that informs, 
educates, and ultimately drives 
behavioural change.
 – A forum for consumers, patients, 
and healthcare providers to share 
opinions, ideas, and concerns about 
health issues.

Our Vision
We believe that health and wellness 
is fundamental to being human, that 
behavioural change requires an intimate 
understanding of human emotion and 
the perceptions/beliefs that drive human 
behaviour, and that improving health and 
wellness is a human responsibility.
Our Values
We value personal and professional 
integrity, encourage empathy for one 
another, our clients, and the customers 
they serve, and we believe that personal 
accountability is the highest form of

agencies that focus on delivering 
measurable improvements 
in clients’ performance such

The impact of changes in exchange rates 
versus 2015 was to increase revenues 
by £14.1 million and increase reported 
operating profits by £1.8 million.
The weakening of Sterling against the 
Euro and the Dollar has also resulted 
in a £20.1 million credit to Other 
Comprehensive Income and Expense 
resulting from the retranslation of 
the Group’s overseas assets.

comprises an underlying tax expense  
of £4.8 million together with a credit

The full year underlying tax rate is  
30% (2015: 27.0%). The highlighted  
tax credit of £3.0 million includes a  
£2.6 million deferred tax credit relating  
to the goodwill impairment charge in the 
period. Net corporation tax paid in the 
year was £2.1 million (2015: £1.3 million).

Responsible Business
Our ethics 
Our overriding aim is to continue to 
build and support a culture which values 
openness, accountability and disclosure.
Our Code of Ethics is published on the 
Group’s intranet and all employees 
have access to Group policies and 
Bribery Act training via a dedicated 
policy management system. Each 
employee is responsible for upholding 
the principles and practices set out 
within it. All employees have access 
to an independent whistleblowing 
hotline which enables them to 
voice any concerns without risk.
.
Before accepting work that may pose an 
ethical risk, employees are required to 
seek advice from the responsible person 
or committee in their company and/
or division. In certain circumstances the 
decision is referred to the Group CEO,  
who makes the final decision.
Huntsworth seeks to comply with all 
applicable laws and respect internationally 
recognised human rights standards in 
every location in which we operate. We 
aim to make a positive contribution to 
human rights through the clients we work 
with, our choice of suppliers and our own 
HR policies and practices.
.
Huntsworth is committed to providing its 
workers with safe, legal employment in a 
stimulating and rewarding environment. 
We are opposed to any form of slavery 
and human trafficking and the Group’s 
policy is to ensure that it is eradicated 
from both our business and from our 
supply chains. Under the Modern Slavery 
Act 2015, Huntsworth plc is required to 
prepare an annual slavery and human 
trafficking statement. The Company’s 
Modern Slavery Statement for the year 
ended 31 December 2016 was approved 
by the Board of Huntsworth plc on 
15 March 2017 and is available on the 
Company’s website at http:// 
www.huntsworth.com/about-us/ 
responsible-business/.
Our people
The experience, knowledge and creativity 
of our people is integral to the success 
of our business. We have in place 
employment policies and practices that 
enable us to attract, retain and develop 
our talent and ensure that the Group 
retains its market-leading position.
Diversity
We actively deploy recruitment policies 
and practices which enable us to attract 
the widest possible sources of talent into 
our business, which develops an inclusive 
culture.
.
All employees are recruited, appraised, 
trained and promoted on the basis of 
fairness, professional competence and 
contribution. We do not discriminate 
directly or indirectly against any 
individual on the basis of gender, marital 
status, race, nationality or ethnic origin, 
religion or belief, age, sexual orientation, 
disability, pregnancy or part-time 
or full-time employment status.
.
The Group’s equal opportunities 
policy is designed to ensure that 
disabled people are given the same 
consideration as others and enjoy 
the same training, development and 
prospects as other employees.
.
In terms of gender diversity, as at  
31 December 2016 women accounted 
for 36% (20) of executive management, 
47% (66) of senior management 
and 64% (929) of total employees. 
There are currently two female Non-
Executive Directors on Huntsworth’s 
Board. The Board understands the 
benefits of boardroom diversity and 
its aspiration and expectation is to 
maintain the proportion of women on 
the Board to at least the current level, 
while maintaining flexibility to ensure 
that all appointments are made on the 
individual’s ability and competency to 
fulfil the requirements of the role.
Introduction
The Group recognises the impact 
of its business operations on a 
diverse range of stakeholders, 
including our employees and the 
wider community. This report 
outlines the Group’s approach to 
responsible business practices 
and details some of the activities 
that we have undertaken in 
2016. We remain dedicated 
to growing our business and 
delivering shareholder value while 
maintaining an uncompromising 
stance on unethical practices, 
products or organisations. Our 
approach reflects the diverse, 
independent operations of 
the Group and each business 
implements these practices in a 
way that is appropriate for them.

Training and development
We aim for all employees to receive an 
appraisal and performance evaluation 
at least annually to assist them in 
their career development. The Group 
provides access to a number of training 
initiatives which enable our people to 
develop skills which will support our 
businesses’ development and strategy.
Each of our Group companies also 
operate their own internal training 
programmes to keep staff up to date 
with developments in their sectors and 
provide additional skills in areas such 
as people management, leadership 
development, client management and 
international client director training.
Training programmes include a mixture 
of externally and internally facilitated 
courses. A number of our businesses 
allocate a mentor or coach to support 
personal development, perform 
appraisals and identify training needs. 
Our talent management programmes 
aim to recognise our best talent through 
both monetary incentives and providing 
additional development opportunities, 
for example through secondments 
into other areas of the business.
Communication
The Group makes use of its intranet 
as a communication tool and each 
division also has its own intranet 
site and communication tools which 
deliver specialised information and 
tools which enable our people to 
work effectively and keep in touch 
with local news and developments.
.
Employees have opportunities to 
attend international conferences on 
matters of significance to their division 
as a whole. On a local scale, regular 
meetings are held between local 
management and employees to facilitate 
employee involvement in decision-
making and businesses performance.
Health and wellbeing
The Board recognises the need to 
maintain a safe and healthy working 
environment for all employees. Each 
business is responsible for ensuring 
that they operate in compliance 
with Group policies and local 
health and safety legislation.
.
The Group deploys policies and 
practices which assist its employees 
in achieving an appropriate work/
life balance, including policies on 
parental, maternity and paternity 
leave, emergency time-off and, where 
applicable, flexible working practices. 
Initiatives to promote health and 
wellbeing vary by company and include:
• Flexible working – promoted through 
a range of schemes including work-
from-home schemes and flexible 
starting times and flexi-hours;
• Flexible benefits packages allowing 
employees to take their entire package 
as remuneration or opt for a range 
of benefits, including private medical 
insurance, staff pension schemes, life 
assurance, childcare vouchers, cycle-
to-work schemes, discounted lifestyle 
vouchers or extra holiday days;
• Employee assistance programmes 
which provide confidential advice and 
counselling support across a range of 
areas; and
• Measures to promote a healthy 
working environment for employees, 
including on-site facilities for breaks, 
provision of showers for employees 
who wish to exercise in lunch breaks 
or cycle/run to work, provision of fruit 
and healthy refreshment options.

Our work
We apply our sustainability principles 
across all of our operations and wherever 
possible we make use of technologies 
that enable us to limit our environmental 
impact. Employees are trained in video-
conferencing and webinar facilities, with 
virtual meetings being conducted where 
possible. When travel is the only option, 
our policy is that public transport should 
be used where possible.
Many of our businesses have developed 
specific sustainability, corporate social 
responsibility and ethical business 
practices, where we work with our clients 
to develop, manage and communicate 
their sustainability and corporate 
responsibility activities. We work with 
various ‘not for profit’ and government 
organisations to tackle issues relating to 
the environment and to raise awareness 
of social issues.
Community
The Group recognises its responsibility 
towards the communities in which 
its businesses operate. In support of 
our communities, Group businesses 
throughout the world organise activities 
for staff to raise money for charity as  
well as offering pro bono support to  
non-profit projects, helping to raise 
money and awareness for good causes.
We support our employees in 
participating in volunteering and 
fundraising activities. Our businesses 
have supported a wide range of charities 
during the year through organising and 
participating in events. For example, 
during 2016 Grayling embarked on the 
2020 Challenge, targeting 2020 acts 
of kindness across the global network 
– from cake sales, through donations to 
charities, to acts designed to lower the 
Group’s carbon footprint. Citigate Dewe 
Rogerson in Hong Kong supported the 
Goodman Magic Mile by providing free 
PR services as well as cash sponsorship, 
whilst the staff at Red swapped their 
beds for sleeping bags and took to the 
streets to raise money for Centrepoint’s 
Sleepout initiative.
The Group also makes formal 
contributions to charities. During 2016, 
the Group donated over £13,000 to 41 
different charities around the world.
Environment
The Group recognises its responsibilities 
to conserve resources and is committed 
to continuous improvement in the 
environmental impact of its operations. 
Due to the nature of our businesses, 
the Group does not have a high 
environmental impact. Our principal 
impact arises from energy, paper and 
water consumption.
Greenhouse gas emissions
During 2016, we have measured our 
greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) emissions 
from our global operations. The Group 
measures GHG emissions based on 
financial control boundaries, so that 
all operations which are consolidated 
as subsidiaries in the Group’s financial 
statements are included in the 
measurement exercise.
We have identified the following key 
activities as being within the GHG 
reporting requirements:
• Scope 1: Natural gas, company 
cars, on-site fuel consumption and 
refrigerants;
• Scope 2: Purchased electricity, heat 
and steam.
At present, Scope 3 activities, including 
business travel, are excluded from the 
reporting scope.  25

Huntsworth plc
Annual Report 2016
We have identified GHG emissions per 
employee as the most appropriate KPI for 
the Group.
We have collected data from offices 
across the Group. We have followed the 
2013 UK Government Environmental 
Reporting Guidelines and used emission 
factors from the UK Government’s 
GHG Conversion Factors for Company 
Reporting 2016. The results are presented 
in the table below.
In some offices in the Group’s portfolio, 
electricity and heat charges are included 
in the office rental charges and therefore 
information on the exact amounts 
consumed by those particular businesses 
is not available. In these instances, we 
have calculated an estimate based on the 
size of the property being let and usage 
data from similar properties. In addition, 
it has not been practicable to measure 
the Group’s emissions from refrigerants, 
although these are not expected to  
be significant.
We are pleased to report a reduction 
in our carbon emissions this year, as a 
result of the consolidation of our property 
portfolio.

Actions
A network of Employee Champions 
promote positive environmental actions 
around the Group. We aim to minimise 
energy and water consumption, 
through encouraging staff to switch off 
electronic appliances and using electricity 
generated from renewable sources.
Paper wastage is minimised through 
promoting reuse, use of electronic 
communications and using paper from 
sustainable forests. By recycling, the 
Group’s UK businesses together saved 
the equivalent of 760 trees and 80 tonnes 
of CO

Principal Risks
Principal risks
The Group has undertaken a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group during the year. Our risk management 
approach is led by the Risk Committee and is designed 
to identify risks to the Group using both a bottom-up and 
top-down approach. The Group considers macro, strategic, 
operational and process risks, which includes all operational, 
IT and financial risks. The likelihood and impact of each risk is 
determined using a risk scoring system. 
All risks are documented in the Group’s risk register which is 
reviewed by the Risk Committee at least six-monthly or more 
frequently as required.
The Group obtains various forms of ongoing assurance over the 
controls in place to mitigate each of the risks identified. Details 
of the risk management processes undertaken in the year are 
included in the Corporate Governance Report.  27

Risk Risk and impact Mitigating factors Trend
Macro
Economic 
downturn 
Any economic downturn may result in fewer 
new client mandates, longer procurement 
processes and a squeeze on pricing, or an 
outright reduction in business. This can 
impact both revenue growth and operating 
margins. 
Weak economic conditions can increase the 
length of time that clients take to pay for 
services, which can put pressure on the 
Group’s working capital. There is also an 
increased risk of bad debts occurring as a 
result of clients’ financial problems. 
Subdued global financial markets can result in 
reductions in the level of transactional activity, 
reducing client mandates.
The UK’s decision to leave the EU has increased 
the level of uncertainty surrounding the 
economic outlook and therefore this risk has 
increased since last year.
The Group has a wide spread of clients both across 
geography and industry sector, reducing reliance on any 
particular economic environment. 
Costs are managed in each business such that they can be 
flexed where needed in a downturn. However, where there 
are protracted economic difficulties in the Group’s key 
markets, the ability of the Group to minimise the impact is 
constrained and performance may deteriorate.
The Group has formal procedures and processes, including 
contractual assurance, to mitigate against legal and 
financial risks associated with both new and existing clients. 
The Group closely reports and monitors aged debts, and 
ensures local management have action plans in place to 
minimise the risk of any loss.
Currency risk A substantial proportion of the Group 
operates outside of the UK, with significant 
operations in the USA and Europe. The Group 
may suffer restrictions on the ability to 
repatriate cash.
Reported Group earnings are impacted by any 
fluctuation of Sterling relative to other 
currencies, particularly the US Dollar and 
Euro. 
The proportion of the Group’s profits made in 
the US is increasing which increases the level 
of risk when exchange rates fluctuate. The 
UK’s decision to leave the EU has increased 
the volatility of exchange rate movements 
against Sterling.
Most of the Group’s revenue is matched by costs arising in 
the same currency. Foreign exchange exposure is 
continually monitored, and the Group uses derivative 
financial instruments to mitigate this risk where deemed 
necessary. 
Borrowings are also available to be drawn down in US 
Dollars and Euros if required to hedge foreign currency 
exposure. Surplus cash balances are swept to the UK to 
minimise any exposure to particular currencies or 
locations.
Strategic
Investment 
decisions fail 
to deliver 
expected 
growth
The Group’s strategy includes investing in new 
business opportunities, talent, start-ups and 
the acquisition of businesses which will 
broaden and enhance existing business 
operations. 
There is a risk that investments are based on 
inaccurate information or assumptions which 
fail to meet client needs and which may result 
in the investment being less financially 
beneficial than anticipated. 
All significant investments are supported by a business 
case, which must be approved by executive management 
and the Board, where appropriate.
Rigorous due diligence procedures are performed prior to 
all acquisitions in order to identify and evaluate potential 
risks to the extent possible.
In addition to the receipt of legal warranties and 
indemnities, the total consideration paid for a business 
typically includes an element of deferred consideration 
contingent upon future performance which mitigates the 
risk of overpaying for a business.

New services 
do not meet 
changing 
market needs
The communications industry is always 
changing, driven by client changes, 
technological change or emergence of 
competitors. The Group needs to be pro-
active in identifying and delivering solutions 
to changing client needs. 
Failure to evolve can result in loss of market 
share, client losses and pressures on pricing, 
which can impact on revenue and margins.
The Group’s range of services and international footprint 
increasingly allows us to offer clients an integrated 
portfolio of services across geographical locations which 
are attractive to new clients and help to strengthen existing 
client relationships. 
The Group continues to diversify its service offering to 
provide a full spectrum of healthcare communications and 
public relations services. 
Reviews of all new business opportunities won and lost 
across the Group are performed regularly. Appropriate 
actions are taken where new business conversion rates are 
below expectations.
<>
Client
Loss of key 
clients 
Any loss of a key client would result in 
reduced revenues and profits and potentially 
an inability to recover amounts due under the 
contract.
The Group endeavours to build long-term relationships 
with its clients and to obtain preferred supplier and agency 
of record status where possible.
The Group has a large portfolio of clients and seeks to 
expand and diversify its client base where possible. There is 
no dominant client or set of clients. Within each of our 
large healthcare clients, the Group typically provides 
services to multiple brands within that client. Client 
satisfaction reviews are also undertaken periodically to 
evaluate service quality.
<>
Talent
Loss of key 
talent
The Group’s talent base is its most important 
resource. There is strong competition within 
the industry for experienced healthcare 
communications and PR professionals. 
Recruitment and retention of key individuals is 
important both for maintaining client 
relationships and ensuring that our services 
are of the highest quality
The Group’s policy is to recruit both Directors and 
employees of the highest quality and to remunerate them 
accordingly. The Group carries out succession planning and 
provides promotion opportunities as well as operating both 
short-term and long-term incentive plans to motivate and 
retain key individuals.
Restrictive covenants are included in employee contracts 
where legally enforceable.
<>
Operational
Information 
systems access 
and security 
Any information systems failure could 
negatively impact the Group’s business 
operations, including delays to client work. 
Unauthorised access to confidential 
information held by the Group could 
compromise our client relationships and have 
a detrimental effect on our reputation.
Cyber security risks are perceived to be 
increasing across the industry at the moment.
Business and IT disaster recovery plans have been put  
in place to minimise any disruption in the event of an  
IT failure.
External access to data is protected by the Group’s IT 
security, which is reviewed and tested frequently to ensure 
that the Group’s network is as secure as possible. Internal 
access to data is restricted appropriately.
Compliance with data protection legislation is given high 
priority within the Group.  29

The Group has £70 million of multi-currency loan facilities 
with a syndicate of banks maturing in 2019. Management

The Group has robust cash management processes

compliance
Any failure to adhere to legislative

Group.
The Group uses internal and external legal counsel 
throughout the world to advise on local legal and 
regulatory requirements and minimise the risk of loss. 
In-house training is conducted on key legislative matters 
such as health and safety, and the UK Bribery Act. 
Policies on gifts, entertainment, anti-bribery and 
corruption, electronic communications, share trading and 
confidentiality are communicated to all employees using 
dedicated Policy Management Software.

Going concern 
The Group’s activities, financial performance and position, cash 
flows and borrowing facilities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position, over 
the next 12 months are described above.
After reviewing the Group’s performance, future forecasted 
profits and cash flows, and ability to draw down on its facilities, 
the Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For 
this reason, the Directors’ are satisfied that it is appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Company’s and 
the Group’s financial statements.
Viability Statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2014, the Directors have assessed the 
prospects of the Company over a period longer than 12 months. 
The Board has conducted this review over a period of three 
years, which was selected because it is in line with the Group’s 
long-term strategic planning period. 
The Group has developed an annual business planning process 
which comprises a strategic plan; a detailed budget for the 
next financial year; and financial projections for the two years 
thereafter, which combine to form a three-year plan. This 
process produces consolidated and divisional three-year plans 
which are reviewed and approved by the Board and used to 
monitor performance. These plans form the basis of detailed 
cash flow and covenant forecasting used by the Board to assess 
the ongoing liquidity and solvency of the Group.
In reviewing the three-year plan in 2016, the Board assessed  
the principal risks associated with the business model and 
strategy, including the likelihood and potential impact of these 
occurring. These risks formed the basis of the reverse stress 
testing undertaken to assess the longer-term viability of the 
Group. This considered severe but plausible scenarios and the 
effectiveness of any mitigating actions. 
In making their assessment, the Board considered the diversity 
of the Group’s operations, including the number of different 
agencies which make up the Group, our diverse client portfolio 
operating in a number of industry sectors and our broad 
geographic base. This naturally limits the impact on the Group 
of any individual severe event. The Group’s current committed 
loan facilities, which expire in the final year of review, financial 
covenants, and other requirements set out therein were also 
considered.
Based on the results of this analysis, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due  
over the three-year period of their assessment. 30

Letter from the Chairman
This section of the Annual Report provides insight into the activities 
of the Board during the year and how the Board operates.
Board and Committee changes
In February 2016 we welcomed Neil Jones as Chief Financial 
Officer. Since this time Neil has been working closely with Paul 
on the strategic review that commenced in 2015. A number of 
key areas for improvement in the business were identified and 
the resulting restructuring actions have been undertaken and 
completed in 2016. We are pleased with the progress made 
in the year on the key objectives of returning the Group to 
sustainable revenue and profit growth. 
Owing to his other commitments, in May 2016, Terence M. Graunke 
resigned as a Non-Executive Director after serving on the Board 
since 2012. I remain very grateful to Terry for his support since I 
joined the Huntsworth Board and for his substantial contribution 
in supporting the transformation of the Board.
We announced in January 2017 that Pat Billingham is to 
assume the role of Audit Committee Chair from 22 March 2017, 
succeeding from Andy Boland in that role. Andy will continue 
to remain as a member of the Audit Committee. The Board 
would like to thank Andy for his efforts whilst Chair of the 
Audit Committee. As Pat is an existing member of the Audit 
Committee, this should ensure a smooth transition. 
Risk Committee
The Board has kept under review its approach to risk 
management and has established during the year a new 
Risk Committee, which reports to the Audit Committee. The 
purpose of the Risk Committee is to ensure that effective 
risk management policies and procedures are established 
throughout the Huntsworth Group and to identify, assess, 
monitor and manage risk across the Group. The Risk Committee 
will direct, oversee, report and make recommendations to the 
Audit Committee in respect of the management of financial and 
non-financial risks faced by the Group. During 2016, the Risk 
Committee has focused on developing the Group’s risk appetite 
as well as managing all aspects of risk reporting to the Board. 
Change of external auditor
On 6 December 2016, the Board, on the recommendation of 
the Audit Committee, appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
(PwC) as auditor of the Company for the 2016 financial year. 
This change in the Company’s auditor followed the successful 
conclusion of a tender process for the statutory audit contract. 
The Board would like to thank Ernst & Young LLP, the resigning 
auditor, for their services to the Company over the past 16 years.
Shareholder engagement
Throughout the year, the Board actively engaged with its 
principal shareholders, particularly in the area of Executive 
Director and senior management remuneration arrangements.
Annual re-election of Directors
The Company is not required to comply with the 2014 UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the Code) provision that  
all Directors be subject to annual re-election. Nevertheless,  
in the interest of good governance and best practice, the  
Board decided to adopt this provision of the Code and the 
Company’s Articles of Association were accordingly amended 
and approved by shareholders at the 2016 AGM. Commencing 
with the 2017 AGM, each Director will therefore be subject to 
annual re-election.
2017 Board evaluation
Due to its size, the Company is not required to comply with 
Code provision B.6.2 requirement to have the evaluation of 
the board externally facilitated at least every three years. 
Nevertheless, again in the interest of good governance and  
best practice, the Board took the decision to appoint an  
external firm to oversee its 2017 Board evaluation process. 
Compliance with the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code 
The Board has been able to operate effectively and within  
the principles of good governance. We are pleased to report 
that the Company has complied throughout the year ended  
31 December 2016 with all of the provisions of the Code that  
are relevant to a smaller company outside of the FTSE 350.
Derek Mapp
Chairman
The executive leadership, the Board  
and its committees were at full strength 
during 2016 and will continue to guide 
the Group to achieve its operational 
objectives with the interests of our 
shareholders as our overriding goal.

Corporate Governance Report
The role of the Board
The Board is responsible for delivering shareholder value 
over the long-term, through the Group’s culture, strategy, 
values and governance. The Non-Executive Directors have a 
particular responsibility for challenging the Group’s strategy 
and monitoring the performance of Executive Directors against 
goals and objectives.
The formal Schedule of Matters reserved for the Board 
includes various strategic, financial, operational and 
governance responsibilities. A summary of the key 
activities of the Board during the year, in accordance 
with the formal Schedule, can be found opposite.
The Board is supported by the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination Committees. Each Board Committee has 
defined terms of reference, which can be found online at 
www.huntsworth.com. The activities of each of these Board

Decisions on operational matters and the day-to-day 
management of the business are delegated to the Executive 
Directors and divisional management. This includes 
implementing Group policy, managing client service, monitoring 
financial performance and human resource management.
Key roles and responsibilities
Effective operation of the Board relies on clarity of the various

In addition to its normal schedule of meetings, the Board held a 
strategy day during which it discussed and considered a number 
of items, including:
• how to maximise shareholder value;
• accelerating growth; and
• targets for Huntsworth Health.
The holding of a separate strategy meeting enabled the Board 
to focus on developing the Company’s strategy.
How the Board operates
Board information
Board papers containing, amongst other things, current and 
forecast trading results, governance, litigation and risk updates, 
and treasury and shareholder information, are distributed in 
advance of the meetings to allow the Directors sufficient time 
for preparation. Minutes of the meetings are also circulated to 
all Directors. The Board receives presentations from Executive 
Directors and from divisional management on specific issues as 
well as having direct access to senior operational management 
within the Group as required. Executive Directors are also 
members of operating company boards and are involved 
in regular meetings to consider financial, operational and 
compliance matters arising throughout the year.
Independent advice
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary who, through the Chairman, is responsible 
for ensuring that Board procedures are followed and that 
applicable rules and regulations are complied with. In addition, 
all Directors have access to independent professional advice, 
if required, at the Company’s expense. The Chairman also 
holds meetings with the Non-Executive Directors without the 
Executive Directors being present.
Induction and personal development
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that induction and 
training is provided for each Director. Each new Director 
receives an induction pack and undertakes a bespoke induction 
programme that provides them with information on the Group, 
their responsibilities, and obligations. Neil Jones was the only 
new Director appointed in 2016 and his induction process was 
undertaken in 2015.
In order to give new Directors insight into the various businesses 
within the Group, a series of meetings are held with the Board 
members and senior executives. Meetings are also held with the 
external auditor and/or other advisers as appropriate.
All Board members receive updates on regulatory and legal 
changes as well as operational briefings. For example, the Board 
received a briefing on the changes brought about by the EU 
Market Abuse Regulation. Training and development needs  
are kept under review by the Chairman.
Board performance evaluation
During 2016, the Chairman conducted a Board evaluation 
process, covering the individual members of the Board 
and its Committees. The evaluation was carried out using 
structured interviews with each Director. The evaluation 
results were presented to the Board at its December meeting. 
Overall, the Board considered that it was functioning well 
as a unit and that the more recent changes in the Board’s 
composition, including the new Chief Financial Officer, had 
been managed well. A summary of the key outputs from 
the Board evaluation can be found in the table below:
Key Area Action
Risk The Company to continue to develop 
its approach to risk management, 
principally through the Risk 
Committee and Audit Committee.
Nomination Committee The Nomination Committee 
to develop its role in talent 
management, ethnicity and diversity.
Investor Relations Board papers to include additional 
commentary in the area of investor 
relations. Accordingly, the Board 
now receives, amongst other 
matters, additional commentary 
from the Company’s broker.
The Chairman is monitoring progress against all action 
points identified. The Senior Independent Director also 
led an evaluation of the Chairman through interviews with 
relevant Directors.
Even though it is not a requirement for the Company under 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, for its 2017 performance 
evaluation, the Board and Nomination Committee agreed 
that this should be externally facilitated. Hence the Company 
has engaged a Board evaluation provider and will report the 
outcomes of this review, together with details of the process 
in its 2017 Annual Report. 36

 Annual Report 2016
Corporate Governance Report continued
Composition of the Board
The Board aims to have a diversity of skills, experience, length of 
service, knowledge and gender. The biographies of the Directors 
are set out on pages 32 to 33. These demonstrate a broad 
range of experience, expertise, and sufficient calibre to bring 
independent judgement on issues of strategy, performance, 
resources and standards of conduct, which are vital to the 
success of the Group.
Independence
The Board considers that, notwithstanding their interests in the 
shares of the Company as set out in the Report of the Directors 
on Remuneration, all of the current Non-Executive Directors are 
independent of the management of the Group and are free from 
any business or other relationship that could materially interfere 
with the exercise of their independent judgement.
Terence M. Graunke was a Non-Executive Director of the 
Company up to 14 May 2016. During this period he also 
managed and controlled entities on behalf of Lake Capital, a 
private equity fund, which owned a 7.38% shareholding in the 
Company. Mr Graunke was appointed to the Board for his wide 
experience in the marketing services sector to complement the 
skills of his fellow Directors and not to represent the interests 
of Lake Capital. The Board had reviewed Mr Graunke’s role 
and determined that he was independent in character and 
judgement and brought significant value to the business.
Previously, Directors had been subject to re-election every 
three years. However, the Board believed it appropriate to 
adopt best practice in this area and proposed changes to the 
Company’s Articles to make all Directors subject to annual re-
election. Following the adoption of new Articles of Association 
at the 2016 AGM, all Directors are subject to reappointment 
by shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting after 
their appointment and annually thereafter. All Non-Executive 
Directors are appointed for an initial period of three years, 
subject to annual re-election at each AGM.
Conflicts of interest
The Company’s Articles of Association permit the Board 
to consider and, if it sees fit, to authorise situations where a 
Director has an interest that conflicts, or may possibly conflict, 
with the interests of the Company. The Board has put in place a 
formal system for Directors to declare conflicts to be considered 
for authorisation by those Directors who have no interest in 
the matter being considered. Furthermore, the Board has in 
place measures to manage any actual or potential conflict of 
interest situations that may arise, which operate effectively. In 
deciding whether to authorise a potential or actual conflict, the 
non-conflicted Directors are required to act in the way that they 
consider would be most likely to promote the success of the 
Company. They may impose limits or conditions when giving 
authorisation or subsequently, if they think this is appropriate.
The potential conflict of interest arising from Terence M. 
Graunke’s continued position as Executive Chairman of Engine 
was considered by the Board and the Board agreed to continue 
to authorise this conflict situation during the period in which 
he was a Non-Executive Director of the Company prior to his 
resignation on 14 May 2016.
Risk management and internal control
The Board has ultimate responsibility for establishing, 
monitoring and maintaining the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems. These systems are designed to enable 
the Board to be confident that such risks are mitigated or 
controlled as far as possible, although no system can eliminate 
the risks entirely.
The Board has established a number of ongoing processes to 
identify, evaluate and manage the key financial, operating and 
compliance risks faced by the Group and for determining the 
appropriate course of action to manage and mitigate those risks. 
The Board delegates the monitoring of these internal control 
and risk management processes to the Audit Committee. These 
measures have been in place throughout the year and up to the 
date of this Report.
Given the Group’s divisional structure, a flexible approach 
to risk management has been implemented so that each 
operating business can tailor and adapt its processes to its 
specific circumstances. The Group’s operating divisions have 
some autonomy with regards to the implementation of risk 
management and internal control systems which meet their 
particular business risks and requirements.
A representative from each division is included on the Group’s 
Risk Committee, which reports to the Audit Committee on all 
risk management matters including the design and effectiveness 
of these risk management and internal control systems.
The Group has sought to implement the FRC Guidance on 
Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting. Further details are included in the Audit 
Committee Report.
Risk Committee
During 2016, management have established a Risk Committee 
which reports to the Audit Committee on risk management 
activities undertaken by the Group. The Committee comprises 
senior management representatives from each division, as well 
as internal audit, Group management and a member of the 
Audit Committee. The Committee has a formal schedule of 
matters delegated to it which includes:
• developing and maintaining risk management policies and 
procedures as appropriate;
• developing and maintaining the Company’s overall risk 
appetite, tolerance and strategy;
• developing and maintaining a risk register and report to the 
Audit Committee on the key risks the Company is exposed 
to;
• assigning responsibilities to manage specific risks, as 
appropriate and review the Company’s capability to identify 
and manage new risks and assess the steps taken to 
mitigate them;
• reviewing Group policies to ensure that they are up to date 
and relevant to risk management objectives;
• reviewing the Company’s annual statement on Internal 
Controls, with specific reference to risk management, prior 
to endorsement by the Audit Committee, and
• taking appropriate action relating to findings from internal 
audit work.
During the year, the Committee has debated Group-wide 
strategic risks, developed a risk appetite proposal for the Board 
and reviewed the results of management’s assessment of 
principal risks, along with monitoring the control environment.  37

Annual Report 2016
The key features of the risk management and internal controls 
system, which the Directors have established with a view to 
providing effective internal control are:
• ongoing review of strategy by the Board, which aims to 
identify potential strategic risks facing the Group;
• establishing and monitoring of the formal schedule of matters 
reserved for decision by the Board;
• establishing a defined list of authority and approval limits;
• monitoring of actual performance against budget and 
forecasts. A detailed monthly management pack is prepared, 
which includes consolidated results and summarised results 
for each individual business and division. The performance of 
each business is reviewed monthly by the Executive Directors 
and reported to the Board at each meeting;
• frequent Executive Director meetings with the management 
team of each division, which cover any emerging operational, 
financial, strategic or compliance issues and controls;
• at least annually, the Board review the principal risks 
identified;
• confirmations of key internal controls, including financial 
controls, are received quarterly from each business. The 
purpose of these confirmations is to confirm the operation 
of an appropriate system of internal controls and to highlight 
any potential new risks facing the business;
• the Executive Directors are responsible for appraising 
investments; those which are above pre-specified limits are 
put to the Board for approval;
• the Audit Committee reports to the Board at each Board 
meeting. Risks and controls are reviewed through the Risk 
Committee to ensure effective management of appropriate 
strategic, financial, operational and compliance issues; and
• the Group’s internal audit function provides an independent 
assessment of the systems and controls in place across the 
Group. Businesses are selected for internal audit on a risk 
focused basis; the results of internal audits are reported to 
management and to the Audit Committee.
The Board and Group management continue to review and 
enhance the Group’s risk management framework to ensure 
that they are actively identifying and managing risks in the most 
efficient and effective way for the Group.
Company ethics and whistleblowing
The Company is committed to the highest standards of 
integrity and honesty and expects all employees to maintain the 
same standards in everything they do at work. The Company 
recognises that effective and honest communication is essential 
to maintain our business values and to ensure that any instances 
of business malpractice are detected and dealt with.
The Company has a number of policies available via an online 
policy management portal. This includes a Code of Ethics, an 
Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy, Guidance on Gifts and 
Entertainments Policy and a Whistleblowing Policy. In particular, 
the Whistleblowing Policy has procedures for disclosing 
malpractice and is intended to act as deterrent to fraud or other 
corruption or serious malpractice. It is also intended to protect 
the Group’s business and reputation.
During 2016, an external firm continued to provide access to 
confidential whistleblowing helplines across the Group. The 
Whistleblowing Policy encourages reporting of any instances of 
malpractice for investigation and action as required. During the 
year, no issues of significance were raised.
Investor relations
Relations with shareholders
The Company is committed to ongoing dialogue with all of its 
shareholders.
The Company holds presentations and conducts meetings with 
its institutional shareholders and City analysts throughout the 
year. The Chairman and the Executive Directors, as appropriate, 
also meet with various institutional shareholders from time to 
time. The outcomes of the meetings are reported to the Board 
to ensure that the Board keeps in touch with shareholder views.
In January 2016, the Board consulted with principal shareholders 
to obtain their views on the proposed:
• Directors’ Remuneration Policy, which was subsequently 
approved at the 2016 AGM;
• two new share plans, also subsequently approved by 
shareholders at the Company’s 2016 AGM;
• approach to remuneration in 2016 for both Executive 
Directors and senior management; and
• the current dilution position at Huntsworth and the approach 
to handling it going forward.
In October 2016, as part of the Company’s ongoing commitment 
to keep shareholders informed in relation to our executive 
remuneration arrangements, the Company also wrote to its 
principal shareholders to advise them of an amendment to 
Paul Taaffe’s Service Agreement. Refer to page 42 to 43 of the 
Report of the Directors on Remuneration.
Following an individual shareholder request noted at the 
Company’s 2016 AGM, which started at 9.30am, in respect 
to having the AGM start time to be later in the day, the Board 
agreed to move the 2017 AGM start time back to 12 noon on 
Thursday 25 May.
All shareholders are welcome to attend the Company’s Annual 
General Meeting and are encouraged to take advantage of the 
opportunity to direct questions to members of the Board. An 
overview of the Company’s results and future development 
plans is given by the Chairman at the Annual General Meeting 
prior to the commencement of the formal business of the 
meeting.

1  Pat Billingham will replace Andy Boland as the Audit Committee Chair with 
effect from 22 March 2017.
The Committee’s Terms of Reference were reviewed during  
2016 and are available on the Company’s website at  
www.huntsworth.com.
Members of the Audit Committee are provided with sufficient 
resources, and have broad business and financial experience 
which has been gained in a variety of disciplines, which the 
Board considers provides recent and relevant experience to 
enable the Committee to carry out its responsibilities. The 
Directors’ biographies on pages 32 to 33 provide further detail.
Committee meetings
The Audit Committee held 3 meetings during the year.  
The Audit Committee provides a forum for reporting by the 
Group’s external auditors. Meetings were also attended, by 
invitation, by the Interim Finance Director, the Chief Financial 
Officer, the Group Financial Controller and the Head of Internal 
Audit. Provision is made for the external auditors and Head of 
Internal Audit to discuss any concerns they may have with the 
Committee in the absence of management.
The Committee receives reports from management which 
provide additional information to facilitate their review.
Activities of the Committee
The activities of the Committee are designed to assist 
the Board in carrying out its responsibilities in respect of 
financial reporting, risk management and internal control. In 
forming its opinions, the Audit Committee takes into account 
representations made by the Company’s subsidiaries in respect 
of financial statements and internal controls; the results 
presented by the Company’s internal audit function in respect 
of the operation of the Company’s internal controls; the findings 
of the Company’s external auditor; and the work of the Risk 
Committee.
The Committee considered, discussed and made decisions in 
relation to a range of matters throughout the course of the year, 
the most significant of which are highlighted below:
Financial reporting
The Committee reviewed with management and the external 
auditor:
• whether the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a 
whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position, performance, business model and 
strategy; and
• the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of 
accounting and whether the Group can meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over a three-year period (the viability 
assessment); and
• the significant issues and material judgements which were 
made in preparing the 2016 Interim Report, and the 2016 
Annual Report and Accounts.  39

Huntsworth plc
Annual Report 2016
The primary issues and areas of judgement considered by the Committee in relation to the 2016 Interim Report and 2016 Annual 
Report and Accounts were:
Goodwill impairment 
The assumptions underlying the calculation of value in use 
require significant judgement to be exercised, primarily in 
respect of the achievability of budgets and medium-term 
forecasts. 
The Committee has addressed these issues through review, 
and raising challenge where appropriate, of reports prepared 
by management outlining the basis of their assumptions 
and analysing the impact of a number of different scenarios. 
Individual business forecasts are reviewed and approved by the 
Board. Further detail is included in Note 11.
Covenant compliance, going concern and viability
The Group has to demonstrate that it can continue to meet the 
covenants of its banking facility for a period of at least 12 months 
from the date of approval of the financial statements in order for 
the Board to conclude that the Group is a going concern.
The Board also has to make an assessment of the prospects 
of the Company over a longer period of three years and state 
whether they consider the Group to be viable over this period. 
Budgets, forecasts and assumptions underlying the cash flow 
and covenant compliance model are approved by the Board 
and different scenarios are prepared by management for the 
Committee to consider.
The Committee reviewed the processes undertaken by 
management in preparing the viability assessment, including 
the potential impact of principal risks and mitigating actions. 
Management and the Board considered a number of scenarios 
and performed stress testing before concluding they have 
a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due  
over the three-year period of their assessment.
Further detail on the viability assessment process can be found 
on page 29.
Revenue recognition
Revenue reflects the fair value of the proportion of the work 
carried out in the year and therefore judgement exists over 
revenue cut-off at year-end. 
Management reports to the Committee on this matter, including 
details of any significant judgements made.
Highlighted items
Certain acquisition and transaction related costs, restructuring 
costs, amortisation charges and the impairment of goodwill 
have been classified as highlighted items, in line with the Group’s 
accounting policies.
Particular consideration was given to the consistency of 
classification of highlighted items and whether their presentation 
can be considered fair, balanced and understandable. The 
Committee addressed this judgement by reviewing with 
management the definition of highlighted items as per the 
Group’s accounting policy and the items disclosed to satisfy 
themselves that they are in accordance with this policy. Refer  
to detailed disclosure in Note 5.
All of the above were key areas of audit focus and the auditor 
also provided detailed reports to the Committee on their 
procedures, findings and conclusions.
Having undertaken the review processes detailed above, the 
Audit Committee is satisfied with the underlying assumptions 
and judgements made in respect of these issues and supports 
the conclusions reached by management.
Risk management and internal control
The Audit Committee monitors controls which are in force and 
any perceived gaps in the control environment, and also considers 
and determines relevant action in respect of any control issues 
raised by the external and internal auditors. The findings of the 
Audit Committee are communicated to the Board.
The main areas of activity for the Audit Committee during the 
year were:
• reviewing reports provided by the Risk Committee on risk 
management activities in the year;
• reviewing the Group’s risk documentation and challenging 
the classification and completeness of the risks identified;
• reviewing the Group’s risk register;
• reviewing the controls which are in force to ensure the 
integrity of the information reported to shareholders;
• monitoring the Group’s litigation register;
• assessing the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management 
systems, including fraud and bribery risk and controls; and
• reviewing the Group’s IT and cyber security arrangements.
The Committee reviewed and challenged a number of reports 
prepared by management in conducting these activities.
Internal audit
The Group has an internal audit function that performs reviews 
as part of a programme approved by the Audit Committee. 
The Head of Internal Audit has a direct reporting line to the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Committee considers 
any issues or risks arising from internal audit reviews and 
monitors the implementation of actions arising. 40
 Huntsworth plc
 Annual Report 2016
Corporate Governance Report continued
The main activities of the Audit Committee during the year were:
• reviewing and approving the scope of internal audit activities 
for 2016;
• monitoring the effectiveness of internal audit activities, 
including reviewing the results of all internal audit procedures 
undertaken during the year; and
• monitoring the status of any deficiencies in the control 
environment, ensuring active follow up and resolution.
External audit
The remit of the Audit Committee includes:
• advising the Board on the appointment, reappointment and 
removal of the external auditor and on their remuneration 
both for audit and non-audit work;
• approving the nature and scope of the external audit with the 
external auditor;
• discussing the findings of the external audit with the external 
auditor and assessing the effectiveness of the audit; and
• reviewing the independence and objectivity of the external 
auditor, including the level of fees paid.
Appointment of auditor
On 6 December 2016, the Board, on the recommendation of the 
Audit Committee, appointed PwC as auditor of the Company for 
the 2016 financial year. PwC succeeded Ernst & Young LLP, who 
had been the Company’s auditor for the previous 16 years.
The appointment of PwC followed a competitive tender process 
for the Company’s external audit contract. The Audit Committee 
oversaw the selection process and ensured that all tendering 
firms had such access as is necessary to information and 
individuals for the duration of the tendering process.
Audit effectiveness
One of the key responsibilities of the Audit Committee is to 
assess the effectiveness of the external audit process. The 
tender process ensured that PwC familiarised itself with the 
Group. In order to do so, PwC met key employees and members 
of management, including a number of individuals from outside 
of the finance function such as representatives from the Group’s 
key operating divisions. The tender process allowed PwC to 
consider carefully the scope of its audit and the important risks 
facing the Group.
During the year, the Committee reviewed the reports they 
received from both Ernst & Young LLP and PwC in their 
capacity as the auditor, including the audit plan and the results 
of the audit work performed. The Committee challenged, 
where necessary, the risks identified and the results of the work 
performed, and sought feedback from management on the 
effectiveness of the audit process.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the cost effectiveness, 
independence, objectivity and expertise of the external auditors 
and following this review recommended to the Board that PwC 
be proposed for reappointment as the external auditors for 2017.
Auditor’s independence and objectivity and non-audit services
It is the Committee’s policy to ensure that there is audit partner 
rotation every five years to safeguard the external auditor’s 
objectivity and independence.
The Committee continually reviews the nature and extent of 
non-audit services provided to the Group by the external auditor 
and receives confirmation from them, at least annually, that in 
their professional judgement, they are independent with respect 
to the audit. The Audit Committee oversees the nature and 
amount of non-audit work undertaken by the external auditor 
each year to ensure that external auditor independence and 
objectivity is safeguarded.
The Audit Committee has a policy governing the use of the 
external auditor for non-audit related services. The policy 
prohibits the external auditor from engaging in certain services 
that may give rise to actual or perceived audit independence 
issues. In addition, the Committee has to approve all services 
that are to be provided by the external auditor that exceed a 
prescribed monetary threshold. A copy of the policy is available 
on the Company’s website (www.huntsworth.com).
In 2016, non-audit services were provided by Ernst & Young LLP 
for review of the Group’s interim statement. Since their 
appointment, PwC have provided covenant compliance services. 
Details of the non-audit fees paid to the external auditors are set 
out on page 74. The provision of non-audit services, within the 
constraints of applicable UK rules, is assessed on a case-by-case 
basis so that the best-placed advisor is engaged.  41

Key responsibilities:
• identifying and recommending candidates to the Board to 
be appointed as Directors;
• making recommendations to the Board on the composition 
of the Board Committees; and
• considering succession planning for Directors and other 
senior executives, taking into account the challenges 
and opportunities facing the Group, and what skills and 
expertise are therefore needed on the Board in the future.
The Nomination Committee meets as necessary and ensures 
that for all senior and main Board appointments, including the 
composition of the Board Committees, due consideration of 
both external and internal candidates is given prior to making 
recommendations to the full Board.
Appointments are made on merit alone, with due consideration 
of the benefits of diversity in its broadest sense, including 
gender. The Board currently has 28% female representation  
(two out of seven Directors). The Board understands the 
benefits of boardroom diversity and its aspiration and 
expectation is to maintain the current proportion of women 
on the Board, while maintaining flexibility to ensure that all 
appointments are made on merit, regardless of gender.
During the year, the Nomination Committee:
• assessed the skill set and composition of the existing Board 
and its Committees, in light of the Company’s strategy, 
including agreeing the 2017 chairpersons for the Company’s 
Committees;
• monitored the orderly succession of the Audit Committee 
Chair from Andy Boland to Pat Billingham, this change to be 
effective from 22 March 2017;
• notwithstanding that the Company is not obliged under the 
UK Corporate Governance Code to do so, the Nomination 
Committee discussed and agreed with the Board’s proposal 
that the 2017 evaluation exercise of the Board and its 
Committees should be facilitated externally;
• the Nomination Committee also discussed its remit and 
future role, including reviewing its terms of reference. 42

Report of the Directors on Remuneration
Annual Statement
Dear Shareholder, 
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the 2016 
Directors’ Remuneration Report which sets out our philosophy 
and details of Directors’ remuneration and the activities of 
the Remuneration Committee for the financial year ended 31 
December 2016. This Report is split into two parts:
• This Annual Statement, incorporating a summary of the 
Remuneration Committee’s key activities in 2016, and
• The Annual Remuneration Report, which sets out the 
payments and awards made to the Directors and details the 
links between the Company’s performance and remuneration 
for the 2016 financial year. 
The 2016 Directors’ Remuneration Report is subject to an 
advisory vote at the 2017 AGM.
Key Activities During the Year
Remuneration Policy
Following a review of the Group’s Executive Directors and senior 
management remuneration arrangements, which included 
consulting with our key shareholders, shareholders approved 
a new Remuneration Policy (Policy) at the 2016 AGM. The 
Remuneration Committee thought it was vital to ensure that the 
Company’s Policy facilitated a structure for paying our Executive 
Directors and senior management that is simple, ensures 
alignment with the objectives of the business going forward and 
is fit for purpose in the competitive business and talent markets 
in which Huntsworth operates. As part of the review, we were 
also mindful of the latest developments in market practice and 
corporate governance standards and sought to reflect these in 
the structure of future executive and senior management pay.
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy, as approved at the 2016 
AGM, is available on the Company’s website at  
http://www.huntsworth.com/media/1288/remuneration-policy-
2015-huntsworth.pdf. This Policy will remain in place until the 
2019 AGM at the latest when a new policy will be submitted to 
shareholders for approval. 
Furthermore, in 2016 shareholders approved a new long-term 
incentive plan, The Huntsworth Long Term Incentive Plan 2016 
(2016 LTIP), which replaced the Company’s performance share 
plan and executive share option scheme which were established 
in 2006 and which were at the end of their ten-year term. A new 
deferred share bonus plan, The Huntsworth 2016 Deferred Share 
Bonus Plan (2016 DSBP), was also introduced, which enables 
the Remuneration Committee to have discretion to defer a 
proportion of annual bonus payments, including to Executive 
Directors, into shares. 
We were delighted that shareholders voted 99% in favour of our 
Policy, and that both the 2016 LTIP and 2016 DSBP share plans 
were supported by shareholders with over 98% of votes  
in favour.
Amendment to Paul Taaffe’s Service Agreement
In October 2016, as part of our ongoing commitment to keep 
shareholders informed in relation to our executive remuneration 
arrangements, we wrote to our key shareholders to advise them 
of an amendment to Paul Taaffe’s Service Agreement. Paul’s 
Service Agreement determined that his annual salary would be 
£600,000 per annum (the Base Salary) and made no provision 
for an exchange rate mechanism to convert his Base Salary from 
GB pounds (GBP£) into US Dollars (USD). As Paul is a resident 
of the United States of America, the continuing substantial 
volatility in GBP£ gave rise to a situation that was not envisaged

• determining the total remuneration packages for each 
Executive Director and the Chairman;
• approving the design of, and determining targets for, 
performance-related pay schemes;

The Committee endeavours to ensure that the Group’s 
remuneration strikes an appropriate balance between the 
interests of the Company’s shareholders and rewarding and 
motivating the Executive Directors and other senior executives 
of the Group. The Committee is responsible for the design 
and development of remuneration policies for the Executive 
Directors of the Company and certain other senior executives  
of the Group.
Other Directors attend remuneration committee meetings by 
invitation only. The Board as a whole reviews the policy and sets 
the remuneration for Non-Executive Directors.  43

Annual Report 2016
when Paul joined the Company, and resulted in a material 
change in the value of his Base Salary when converted into USD. 
Paul is critical to our business and its turnaround and therefore, 
our aim was to ensure that Paul’s Base Salary arrangements are 
consistent with the Committee’s intention when he joined the 
Company. The Committee therefore decided, with effect from 
1 October 2016, to amend Paul’s Service Agreement, to enable 
his Base Salary of £600,000 to be denominated and paid in 
USD. The USD exchange rate was determined by using the USD 
exchange rate prevailing on 19 December 2014 (i.e. the same 
date that Paul signed his Service Agreement), being USD 1.56 
for each GBP£, which results in a USD salary of $936,000 per 
annum. 
All other pay and benefit arrangements for Paul, including any 
future annual bonus payment or long-term incentive plan (LTIP) 
awards, will remain unchanged and shall be determined against 
his Base Salary figure and Paul will continue to not receive any 
pension from the Company. To the extent that there are any 
increases to Paul’s Base Salary in the future, then the percentage 
increase determined by the Committee would apply to the 
£600,000 figure for the purposes of the reference salary for 
his annual bonus and LTIP awards (e.g. a 2% increase to his 
Base Salary would mean that his Base Salary for bonus/LTIP 
purposes would be £612,000). By denominating Paul’s salary 
into USD, the Company has created a natural hedge against 
the translation of its USD denominated revenues into GBP£. 
Therefore, in the event that exchange rates significantly increase, 
Paul’s salary, once translated to GBP£, would be lower against 
reduced translated revenues.
The Remuneration Committee considers that this amendment to 
the Service Agreement is in the best interests of the Company 
and its shareholders. 
Senior management
The Remuneration Committee has achieved its previously stated 
aim to increase the number of below-board senior management 
participants in the 2016 LTIP. This further aligns the senior 
management of the Group with the interests of shareholders, 
and aligns the various divisions to the Group’s performance.  
This helps to achieve the appropriate balance between fixed and 
variable remuneration within senior management and allows 
equity awards to be used as a mechanism to retain and attract 
new talent. 
Dilution position
The Remuneration Committee is conscious of the Investment 
Association’s guidelines stating that companies should not 
issue new shares for employee share awards where doing so 
would result in share issues in a ten-year period which would 
exceed 10% of the company’s share capital in the case of all 
employee share plans, or 5% of the share capital in the case of 
discretionary share plans. 
As a result of broadening the equity awards to senior 
management this year, and due to the nature of legacy incentive 
plans and grants made in previous years under those plans, 
the Remuneration Committee has continued to monitor the 
Company’s dilution position.
Performance targets for Executive Directors 
The Remuneration Committee set the performance targets 
for Paul Taaffe and Neil Jones in respect of their 2016 awards, 
including Annual Bonus and LTIP awards and also an award 
made under The Huntsworth Executive Share Option Scheme 
2006 to Neil by way of compensation for the loss of awards 
from his previous employment. 
The 2016 Annual Bonus was based upon achieving PBT and 
revenue targets of £16.0m and £178.6m respectively. As the 
Remuneration Committee wanted the 2016 Annual Bonus 
to be based upon a principle of self-funding, it was decided 
that any Executive bonus would only be payable to the extent 
that it did not reduce PBT to below £16.0m. As the Company 
achieved revenues of £180.1m and a PBT of £16.0m (after taking 
into account the 2016 Annual Bonus), the 2016 Annual Bonus 
threshold targets were met. As the Remuneration Committee 
decided not to allow bonus payments to reduce PBT below 
£16.0m, the 2016 Annual Bonus payable to the Executive 
Directors represented 34.9% of their annualised salaries (which 
equated to 23.3% of the maximum bonus opportunity), versus 
the 75% of salary payable at target levels. 
Further details on the performance targets for the 2016 Annual 
Bonus and share awards, including on the outcome of the 2016 
Annual Bonus, can be found on pages 44 to 45. 
The Remuneration Committee has also agreed the 2017 
Executive Annual Bonus and LTIP targets for Paul and Neil.
Conclusion
The Remuneration Committee believe that the current Executive 
Director Remuneration Policy works effectively to motivate and 
retain our Executive Directors and senior management, whilst 
supporting the delivery of returns to shareholders. 
We welcome the opportunity to engage with shareholders 
about any aspect of our Remuneration Policy and its 
implementation. We were very pleased to receive good support 
for the 2015 Directors’ Remuneration Report and our Policy at 
the AGM in May 2016. Shareholders will have the opportunity to 
vote on the 2016 Directors’ Remuneration Report at our AGM to 
be held on Thursday 25 May 2017.

7. With effect from 1 October 2016, Paul Taaffe’s salary is USD$936,000, as explained on pages 42 to 43. In the above table, his salary is presented in GBP£, 
giving a salary figure of £637k during the full year 2016. 
Neil Jones is a non-executive director of Taptica International, an AIM-listed ad-tech business, for which he receives an annual fee of

The following sections of the report explain how each element of remuneration was calculated.
Annual Bonus (audited)
The Annual Bonus targets for 2016 were based upon achieving 2016 financial targets. The targets were based on profit before tax 
and highlighted items (PBT Performance Target), and a revenue target (Revenue Performance Target). 
The amount of Annual Bonus payable was based on actual performance as a percentage of each target, as shown in the table below. 
In addition, the Remuneration Committee determined that for 2016, the Annual Bonus would only be payable to the extent that it 
did not reduce post-bonus PBT below the budgeted target of £16.0m. The payment of any Annual Bonus was contingent on the 
threshold level of PBT being achieved.

The table below summarises the Annual Bonus outcome against the targets set and the amounts payable in total to the Executive 
Directors. The Annual Bonus payable amounted to £332,000, of which the Remuneration Committee allocated £212,000 to Paul 
Taaffe and £120,000 to Neil Jones.

Total: 34.9% 23.3%
The 2016 Annual Bonus is subject to malus and clawback provisions, and is subject to the compulsory deferral of 50% of any bonus 
payment in excess of 100% of salary (under the terms of the 2016 DSBP). For 2016, no amount was deferred, as the Annual Bonus 
payable was not in excess of 100% of salary.
LTIP awards (audited)
No LTIP awards vested or were due to vest in 2016.
Pension entitlements and cash allowances (audited)
Neither Paul Taaffe nor Neil Jones received an annual pension contribution or allowance.   45

awards under the 2016 LTIP.
2  Neil Jones has 501,853 unvested market priced awards (ESOS) and 848,484 unvested PSP awards.
3  The share price of 38 pence (as at 31 December 2016) has been taken for the purpose of calculating the current shareholding as a percentage of salary/fees. 
Unvested share awards do not count towards satisfaction of the shareholding guidelines. Vested share awards and shares awarded under the 2016 DSBP 
count towards the shareholding requirement. Vested but unexercised awards count towards the shareholding requirement based on the intrinsic gain in the 
award as at 31 December 2016. For vested market-priced awards, the number of shares which count toward the shareholding guideline is calculated as the 
number of shares that could be purchased based on the intrinsic value of such awards, i.e. the value of shares less the exercise price. Where the exercise price 
is above the value of the shares, no value is attributed to these awards.
Shareholding policy – Executive Directors
Under the Company’s shareholding policy, all Executive Directors are expected to hold shares (including vested share awards where 
applicable) equivalent in value to a minimum of one times their salary. Executive Directors will be required to retain 50% of after-tax 
vested share awards until their shareholding requirement is met. The Executive Directors have each acquired 400,000 shares during 
the year and have therefore made progress towards their shareholding guidelines.   47

2017 Annual Bonus performance targets
The 2017 annual bonus for Paul Taaffe and Neil Jones will be predominantly based on achieving specific PBT and revenue targets. 
The bonus opportunity will be in line with 2016 (i.e. a maximum opportunity of 150% of salary for Executive Directors). As referred to 
on pages 42 to 43, the bonus opportunity for Paul Taaffe will be based on his GBP£ denominated Base Salary, i.e. £600,000.
The Committee is of the opinion that given commercial sensitivity, disclosing precise PBT and revenue targets for the annual bonus in 
advance would not be in the interests of shareholders or the Company. Actual targets, performance achieved and awards made will 
be published after the end of the performance period so shareholders can fully assess the basis for any pay-outs.
Both awards will be subject to malus and clawback provisions and will be subject to compulsory deferral of half of any bonus 
payment in excess of 100% of salary under the 2016 DSBP.
2017 Long-term incentive plan targets
Awards will be made to Paul Taaffe and Neil Jones under the 2016 LTIP and, if applicable, under the 2016 DSBP, in line with award 
sizes made in 2016 i.e. 100% of salary. For Paul Taaffe, as per the approach for his annual bonus, the award under the 2016 LTIP will be 
based on his GBP£ denominated Base Salary of £600,000.
All of the awards will vest based on the achievement of specific EPS and TSR targets and will be subject to malus and clawback 
provisions. Further information on the performance measures and targets attaching to these awards will be disclosed in next year’s 
Annual Report. 50

Non-Executive Directors
The Board determined that it was appropriate to adjust the fees payable to Non-Executive Directors with effect from 1 April 2017. 
Non-Executive Directors are paid a base fee with one additional fee, as applicable, of the highest value for Committee representation. 
Fees for Non-Executive Directors are as follows:
Fees from 
1 April 2017 
£’000
Fees up to 
31 March 2017 
£’000
Independent NED base fee 40 30
Audit Committee Chair 5 10
Remuneration Committee Chair 5 10
Nomination Committee Chair 0 5
Committee membership 0 5
Senior Independent Director 0 10
Following a reassessment of duties, the above fee structure is considered to more accurately reflect the current responsibilities and 
time commitment of Non-Executive Directors. Non-Executive Directors receive a base fee of £40,000. Additional fees are only 
payable for roles as the Audit and Remuneration Committee Chairs.
Further, in view of the improved position of the Company and the stability of its Board, not least the Executive team, the Chairman 
has reassessed the amount of time that he is now required to dedicate to the Company over and above what would ordinarily 
be appropriate. The Chairman, supported by the Chief Executive, proposed a reduction to the Chairman’s fee from £150,000 to 
£130,000 per annum with effect from 1 April 2017, which the Remuneration Committee have recommended to, and which has been 
approved by the Board.
The following table sets out the expected annual fees payable to the Company’s Non-Executive Directors for 2017: 
2017 
£’000
Derek Mapp 135
Andy Boland 40
Nicky Dulieu 44
Tim Ryan 40
Pat Billingham 43
The fees above include the adjusted fees payable from 1 April 2017 on a pro-rated basis.
Andy Boland and Pat Billingham’s fees for 2017 reflect the change in Audit Committee chair with effect from 22 March 2017, when Ms 
Billingham will succeed Mr Boland in this role.
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
During 2016, the Committee engaged the services of Slaughter and May and Deloitte LLP as independent Remuneration Committee 
advisers. 
Slaughter and May were engaged to provide advice on the share schemes. Fees payable to Slaughter and May for these services 
totalled £6,508.
Deloitte LLP were retained as advisors to the Remuneration Committee and provided advice to the Committee on executive and 
long-term incentive remuneration. Deloitte LLP also provided certain other tax advisory services to the Group during the year. The 
nature of these services was not considered to conflict with their role as external adviser to the Committee. Total fees payable to 
Deloitte in 2016 for Remuneration Committee matters were £57,433 and were based partially on a retainer and partially on a time 
and materials basis.
Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the Group’s Code of Conduct 
when providing advice on executive remuneration in the UK.

Director wishing to serve again shall submit himself or herself for

Annual Report 2016
Purchase of own shares
At the Annual General Meeting in 2016 the Directors were 
granted the authority to purchase up to 10% of the Company’s 
ordinary shares (either for cancellation or for placing into 
treasury) to support the Group’s capital management policies. 
Further details of the Group’s capital management policies are 
included in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. 
The authority granted amounted to 32,831,206 ordinary shares. 
The Company may either retain shares purchased under this 
authority as treasury shares with a possible view to reissue such 
shares at a future date, or cancel them. This authority expires on 
the earlier of 25 August 2017 or the conclusion of the 2017 AGM 
on 25 May 2017. No ordinary shares were purchased during the 
year or up to the date of this report.
During the year ended 31 December 2016, no shares were 
transferred out of treasury to satisfy obligations under employee 
share plans. The total number of shares held in treasury as at 
31 December 2016 and at the date of this report was 1,686,681 
ordinary shares. 
Employment policies
The Group operates internationally and therefore has 
developed employment policies that meet local conditions and 
requirements. Further details of these policies including policies 
in relation to diversity and applications for employment made 
by disabled persons and provisions for disabled employees and 
employee involvement can be found in the Responsible Business 
Report on pages 22 to 25.
Political donations
The Companies Act 2006 (the Companies Act) and the Large 
and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008 (the Regulations) require disclosure 
of any political donation made to or political expenditure 
incurred in relation to any political party or other political 
organisation or any independent election candidate if such 
donation(s) or expenditure incurred in a year exceeds £2,000. 
Political parties, political organisations, political donation and 
political expenditure are all defined in the Companies Act.
As part of their normal work on behalf of clients and as part 
of their own marketing, certain companies in the Group need 
to attend or sponsor events which are organised by political 
parties or other political organisations, for which a charge is 
made. These companies also from time to time invite clients 
and prospective clients to attend events that fall within the 
meaning of the Companies Act’s provisions. The Companies 
Act defines ‘donations’ and ‘expenditure’ very broadly such 
that this sort of activity falls within its ambit. It similarly 
defines ‘political organisation’ widely such that it includes, for 
example, bodies concerned with policy review and law reform, 
with representation of the business community or with the 
representation of their communities or special interest groups, 
which the companies may wish to support.
During the year, Group companies made the following payments 
that might be deemed to fall within the definition of ‘political 
donation’ or ‘political expenditure’ in the Companies Act: 
political expenditure amounting to £6,835 was paid attending 
conferences and to cover function expenses. This was made 
up of £5,592 paid to the Conservative Party and £1,243 to the 
Labour Party.
Additional information for shareholders 
The following information, which summarises certain provisions 
of the current Articles of Association of the Company and 
applicable English law concerning companies (including the 
Companies Act), is required to be provided to shareholders as a 
result of the implementation of the European Directive on Takeover 
Bids (2004/25/EC) into English law. This is a summary only and 
the relevant provisions of the Articles and the Companies Act 
should be consulted if further information is required.
Rights and obligations attaching to ordinary shares
Subject to applicable law and to any existing shareholders’ 
rights, shares may be issued with or have attached to them 
such rights and restrictions as the Company may by ordinary 
resolution decide or, if no such resolution has been passed or 
so far as the resolution does not make specific provision, as the 
Board (as defined in the Articles) may decide. Subject to the 
Articles, the Companies Act and to any resolution passed by 
the Company and without prejudice to any rights attached to 
existing shares, the Board may offer, allot, grant options over or 
otherwise deal with or dispose of shares in the Company to such 
persons, at such times and for such consideration and upon 
such terms as the Board may decide. 
As part of the subscription agreement the Company entered 
into with BlueFocus and BlueFocus’s subsidiary BlueFocus 
International Limited (BlueFocus International) (the Subscription 
Agreement), BlueFocus International has the right to participate 
in any proposed issue of Company shares for cash consideration 
such that the level of shareholding BlueFocus International 
obtained at completion of the Subscription Agreement will not 
be diluted by the proposed issue.
The right of BlueFocus International to subscribe for additional 
shares representing up to 5% of the Company’s fully diluted 
share capital (as at completion of the Subscription Agreement) 
where the Company decides to issue shares for non-cash 
consideration (other than in relation to any employee share 
scheme), expired on 7 October 2016.
Additionally, under the terms of the Subscription Agreement, 
BlueFocus International is granted the right to nominate one 
Non-Executive Director to be appointed or reappointed to the 
Board of the Company. BlueFocus International’s right to appoint 
or reappoint a Director to the Board lapses if it ceases to hold at 
least 47,250,000 ordinary shares in the capital of the Company.
Voting rights
Upon a show of hands every member who is present in person 
at a general meeting of the Company and entitled to vote shall 
have one vote. On a poll every member who is present in person 
or by proxy shall have one vote for every share held. In the case 
of joint holders of a share the vote of the senior who tenders a 
vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the 
exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders and seniority 
shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in 
the register in respect of the joint holding. 
The notice of any general meeting of the Company shall specify 
the deadlines in relation to exercising voting rights with respect 
to each resolution to be proposed at such meeting. Votes are 
exercisable at the general meeting of the Company in respect 
of which the business being voted upon is being heard. Votes 
may be exercised in person or by proxy. The Articles provide a 
deadline for submission of proxy forms of not less than 48 hours 
before the time appointed for holding the meeting, except in the 
case of a poll taken subsequently to the date of the meeting or 
adjourned meeting, for which proxy forms must be received not 
less than 24 hours before the time appointed for the taking of 
the poll.  54
 Huntsworth plc
 Annual Report 2016
Directors’ Report continued
No member shall be entitled in respect of any share held by him 
to attend or vote (either personally or by proxy) at any general 
meeting or class meeting of the Company or upon a poll or to 
exercise any other right conferred by membership in relation to 
general meetings or polls unless all calls or other sums presently 
payable by him in respect of that share have been paid. In 
addition, no member shall be entitled to vote if he has been 
served with a restriction notice (as defined in the Articles) after 
the failure to provide the Company with information concerning 
interests in those shares required to be provided under the 
Companies Act. The Company is not aware of any agreements 
between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the 
exercise of voting rights.
Dividends and other payments
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the Company 
may by ordinary resolution from time-to-time declare dividends 
in accordance with the respective rights of the members, but 
no dividend shall exceed the amount recommended by the 
Board. The Board may pay such interim dividends as appear 
to the Board to be justified by the financial position of the 
Company and may also pay any dividend payable at a fixed 
rate at intervals settled by the Board whenever the financial 
position of the Company, in the opinion of the Board, justifies 
its payment. If the Board acts in good faith, it shall not incur any 
liability to the holders of any shares for any loss they may suffer 
in consequence of the payment of an interim or fixed dividend 
on any other class of shares ranking pari passu with or after 
those shares.
Variation of rights
Subject to the Companies Act, all or any of the rights attached 
to any existing class of shares may from time to time be varied 
either with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than 
75% in nominal value of the issued shares of that class (excluding 
any shares of that class held as treasury shares) or with the 
sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general 
meeting of the holders of those shares. 
Restrictions on transfer of shares
The Board may permit title to shares of any class to be held 
in uncertificated form and, subject to the Articles, title to 
uncertificated shares may be transferred by means of a 
relevant system. Provisions of the Articles do not apply to 
any uncertificated shares to the extent that such provisions 
are inconsistent with the holding of shares in uncertificated 
form or with the transfer of the shares by means of a relevant 
system. Registration of a transfer of an uncertificated share may 
be refused in the circumstances set out in the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations (as defined in the Articles) and where, 
in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint 
holders to whom the uncertificated share is to be transferred 
exceeds four.
Restrictions on transfer of shares continued
Subject to the Articles, any member may transfer all or any of 
his certificated shares by an instrument of transfer in any usual 
form or in any other form which the Board may approve. The 
instrument of transfer of a certificated share shall be executed 
by or on behalf of the transferor and (in the case of a partly 
paid share) the transferee. The transferor of a share shall be 
deemed to remain the holder of the share concerned until the 
name of the transferee is entered in the register in respect of it. 
The Board may, in its absolute discretion and without giving any 
reason for so doing, decline to register any transfer of any share 
which is not a fully paid share. The Board may also decline to 
register any transfer of a certificated share unless:
(i) the instrument of transfer is duly stamped or duly certified 
or otherwise shown to the satisfaction of the Board to be 
exempt from stamp duty and accompanied by the relevant 
share certificate and such other evidence of the right to 
transfer as the Board may reasonably require; 
(ii) the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of 
share; and 
(iii) in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint 
holders to whom the share is to be transferred does not 
exceed four.
Other restrictions on the transfer of shares in the Company may 
from time to time be imposed:
(i) by applicable laws and regulations (for example, insider 
trading laws and market requirements relating to closed 
periods);
(ii)  pursuant to the Company’s Share Dealing Code whereby 
employees require the approval of the Company to deal in 
the Company’s securities; and
(iii) in relation to shares issued pursuant to acquisitions made 
by the Company. 
As at 31 December 2016 there were no shares of the Company 
subject to lock-in restrictions. The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions 
on the transfer of shares.
Rights and obligations attaching to the deferred shares
The holders of deferred shares are not entitled to receive 
dividends when declared nor the Company’s report and accounts. 
The holders of deferred shares have no right as such to receive 
notice of or to attend or vote at any general meeting of the 
Company unless a resolution to wind up the Company or to vary or 
abrogate the rights attaching to the deferred shares is proposed. 
The deferred shares are also subject to the following terms: 
(a) the deferred shares may not be transferred without the 
prior written consent of the Directors of the Company; 
(b)  holders of deferred shares are not entitled to receive any 
share certificate in respect of their holdings; 
(c)  any cancellation of the deferred shares for no consideration 
by way of reduction of capital shall not involve a variation 
or abrogation of the rights attaching thereto; 
(d)  the Company has irrevocable authority at any time to 
appoint any person to execute on behalf of the holders of 
the deferred shares a transfer thereof and/or an agreement 
to transfer the same, in either case, to Numis Securities 
Limited or such other person as the Company may 
determine and to execute any other documents which such 
person may consider necessary or desirable to effect such 
transfer, in each case without obtaining the sanction of the 
holder(s) and without any payment being made in respect 
of such acquisition; and
(e)  the entitlement of a holder of a deferred share on a return 
of assets on a winding up of the Company is limited to the 
repayment of the amount paid up or credited as paid up 
on such share up to a maximum of 49 pence per share and 
shall be paid only after the holders of any and all ordinary 
shares then in issue shall have received payment in respect 
of such amount as is paid up or credited as paid up on 
those ordinary shares held by them at that time plus the 
payment in cash or specie of £10,000,000 for every 1p 
paid up or credited as paid up on those ordinary shares.
The rights attached to the deferred shares shall not be deemed 
to be varied or abrogated by the creation or issue of any new 
shares ranking in priority to or pari passu with or subsequent to 
such shares or by any amendment or variation to the rights of 
any other class of shares of the Company.  55

Significant direct or indirect holdings of securities and special rights
Directors’ interests in the share capital of the Company are 
shown in the table on pages 46 to 47. Major interests in the share 
capital of the Company (i.e. 3% or more) of which the Company 
has been notified are shown in the table on page 52. There 
are no securities which carry special rights with regard to the 
control of the Company. 
Employee share trust
The Huntsworth Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’) holds less than 
1.0% of the issued share capital of the Company on trust for 
the benefit of employees of the Huntsworth Group and their 
dependants. The voting rights in relation to these shares are 
exercised by the Trustees. The Trustees of the EBT may vote or 
abstain from voting on shares held in the EBT in any way they 
think fit and in doing so may take into account both financial and 
non-financial interests of the beneficiaries of the EBT or their 
dependants. The EBT waived its rights to both the 2015 final 
dividend and the 2016 interim dividend.
Appointment and replacement of Directors 
Unless otherwise determined by ordinary resolution of the 
Company, the Directors (disregarding alternate directors) shall 
be not less than two nor more than 12 in number. Directors may 
be appointed by the Company by ordinary resolution or by the 
Board. Any Director appointed by the Board shall retire at the 
next Annual General Meeting of the Company and shall then be 
eligible for election.
Following the Company’s 2016 AGM on 26 May, where new 
Articles of Association were adopted, at every subsequent AGM 
all Directors shall retire from office and may offer themselves for 
re-appointment by the members.
The Company may by special resolution remove any Director 
before the expiration of his term of office. 
The office of Director shall be vacated if: 
(i)  he resigns or offers to resign and the Board resolves to 
accept such offer; 
(ii)  his resignation is requested by all of the other Directors and 
all of the other Directors are not less than three in number; 
(iii)  he is or has been suffering from mental ill health; 
(iv)  he is absent without permission of the Board from 
meetings of the Board for six consecutive months and the 
Board resolves that his office is vacated; 
(v)  he becomes bankrupt or compounds with his creditors 
generally;
(vi)  he is prohibited by law from being a Director; 
(vii)  he ceases to be a Director by virtue of the Companies Act; or 
(viii) he is removed from office pursuant to the Articles.
Amendment to the Articles
Any amendments to the Articles may be made in accordance with 
the provisions of the Companies Act by way of a special resolution.
Powers of the Directors
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the Articles 
and to any directions given by the Company in general meeting 
by special resolution, the business of the Company shall be 
managed by the Board which may exercise all the powers of the 
Company whether relating to the management of the business 
of the Company or not. In particular, the Board may exercise all 
the powers of the Company to borrow money and to mortgage 
or charge all or any part of the undertaking, property and assets 
(present and future) and uncalled capital of the Company, 
to issue debentures and other securities and to give security, 
whether outright or as collateral security, for any debt, liability or 
obligation of the Company or of any third party.
Repurchase of shares 
Subject to authorisation by shareholder resolution, the Company 
may purchase its own shares in accordance with the Companies 
Act. Any shares which have been bought back may be held as 
treasury shares or, if not so held, must be cancelled immediately 
upon completion of the purchase, thereby reducing the 
amount of the Company’s issued share capital. The Company 
has the power to buy back up to 32,831,206 ordinary shares. 
This authority expires on the earlier of 25 August 2017 or the 
conclusion of the 2017 AGM on 25 May 2017. The minimum price 
which must be paid for such shares is 1 pence and the maximum 
price payable is the higher of (i) 5% above the average of the 
middle market quotations for ordinary shares (as derived from 
the London Stock Exchange Daily List) for the five business 
days immediately preceding the date of purchase and (ii) the 
higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest 
current independent bid on the London Stock Exchange Official

 Annual Report 2016
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect  
of the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulation.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union and Parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure 
Framework”, and applicable law). Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of the profit 
or loss of the Group and Parent Company for that period. In 
preparing the financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed for the Group financial statements 
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising 
FRS 101, have been followed for the Company financial 
statements, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and 
Parent Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and 
Parent Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and 
Parent Company and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Group and Parent Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Group and Parent Company’s website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the annual report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group and Parent Company’s performance, business model 
and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on 
page 32 to 33, confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
• the Parent Company financial statements, which have been 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure 
Framework”, and applicable law), give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and loss of the 
Company;
• the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Group; and
• the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group and Parent Company, together with 
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it 
faces.
This Directors’ Report has been approved by the Board and 
signed on its behalf by Martin Morrow, Company Secretary.

Our audit approach
Overview
Audit Scope
Areas of Focus
Materiality
• Overall Group materiality: £0.8 million which represents 5% of profit before tax and 
highlighted items.
•  We carried out procedures on parts of the business which accounted for 81% of 
Group revenues and 69% of Group profit before tax and highlighted items.
• Audits of the complete financial information were performed on the Company 
(‘plc’), Red Consultancy in the UK and the Huntsworth Health businesses, Evoke 
and Apothecom in the US, which accounted for 44% of revenue.
• Audit procedures were performed over revenue in twelve further components, 
which accounted for 37% of revenue.
•  Impairment of goodwill – particularly for the Grayling cash-generating unit (‘CGU’).
• Risk of fraud in revenue recognition in relation to cut-off– with a particular focus on 
stage of completion of project-based revenues.
• Measurement and presentation of highlighted items.
 
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. 
In particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting 
estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we 
also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the 
Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are 
identified as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in 
order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures 
should be read in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.  58

 Annual Report 2016
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Impairment of goodwill – particularly for the Grayling CGU
Refer to page 39 (Audit Committee Report), page 72 
(Significant Accounting Policies) and page 79 (notes).
The Group carried £153.5 million of goodwill at 31 
December 2016 (2015: £172.7 million).
The carrying values of goodwill are contingent on future 
cash flows of the underlying CGUs and there is a risk that if 
these cash flows do not meet the Directors’ expectations, 
the assets will be impaired.
Determining if an impairment charge is required involves 
significant judgements about the future results and 
cash flows of the business, including forecast growth in 
future revenues and operating profit margins, as well as 
determining an appropriate discount rate and long-term 
growth rate. 
The Directors aggregate CGUs into segments which 
represent the level at which the cash flows of the 
businesses (and goodwill) are monitored and therefore  
this is the level at which the Directors perform their 
impairment assessment. 
The Directors used a value in use model to compute 
the present value of forecast future cash flows for each 
segment which was then compared to the carrying value 
of the net assets of each segment (including goodwill and 
intangible assets) to determine if there was an impairment.
Market conditions remain challenging and performance has 
varied compared to the Directors’ expectations, particularly 
in the Grayling business, where revenue performance was 
26% below budget. 
The Directors’ impairment assessment showed a  
£30.5 million impairment of goodwill in the Grayling CGU 
which has been recognised in the financial statements.
All other segments showed headroom above the carrying 
value of the net assets including goodwill when subject to 
the Directors’ sensitivity analysis.
We therefore focused on the Grayling CGU and the 
judgements applied to the revised forecasts to ensure 
that they appropriately factored in historical variances 
and market conditions. We also focused on the amount 
of the impairment charge recognised and checked that 
appropriate sensitivity disclosures were provided in the 
financial statements to explain any additional impairment 
amounts which would arise from reasonably possible 
changes to the model’s key assumptions.
Focusing on the Grayling CGU, we evaluated and sensitised the 
Directors’ future cash flow forecasts and evaluated the process by 
which they were drawn up, and tested the underlying value in use 
calculations. 
We challenged:
• the key assumptions for short and long-term growth rates in 
the forecasts by comparing them to historical results, as well as 
economic and industry forecasts and comparable companies; and
• the discount rate used in the calculations by assessing the cost of 
capital for the Company and comparable organisations.
In addition, we verified the Directors’ allocation of £3.3 million of 
goodwill to Grayling Whiteboard, which is held for sale at the year-end 
and allocated in line with fair value less costs to sell. 
We considered the Directors’ potential bias through performance of 
our own sensitivity analysis on key assumptions, to understand the 
impact of reasonable changes in the key assumptions on the available 
headroom. 
This included sensitising the discount rate applied to the future cash 
flows, and the short and longer-term growth rates and profit margins. 
In performing these sensitivities we considered the historical budgeting 
accuracy and how the assumptions compared to the actual values 
achieved in prior years and post year-end.
With regard to the above procedures, including the reflection of 
historical levels of variance from budget into the future forecasts, we 
determined that the inputs to the value in use model were appropriate. 
This provided sufficient evidence for the completeness of the 
impairment charge in the Grayling CGU. 
For the remaining CGUs where the Directors determined that no 
impairment was required and that no additional sensitivity disclosures 
were necessary, we found that these judgements were supported 
by reasonable assumptions that would require significant downside 
changes before any additional material impairment was necessary.

Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Risk of fraud in revenue recognition in relation to cut-off – 
with a particular focus on stage of completion of  
project-based revenues
Refer to page 39 (Audit Committee Report) and note 2 to 
the financial statements for the Directors’ disclosures of the 
related accounting policies, judgements and estimates.
Our specific audit focus was on the risk that revenue may 
be recorded in the incorrect period in respect of stage 
of completion of project-based revenues, in light of the 
incentive schemes for management in those businesses 
designed to reward performance. Assessment of the stage 
of completion can also be judgemental in nature, and 
increases the risk around the timing of revenue recognition.
We evaluated the revenue recognition policy of the Group and on 
a sample basis we determined that the related revenue had been 
recognised in conformity with the Group’s policy and applicable IFRSs.
For a sample of transactions close to the year-end, we examined 
supporting documentation, such as underlying contracts, approved 
purchase orders and statements of work, to determine that these 
sales had taken place and the amount recognised in the year was 
appropriate. 
Where amounts recorded were based on the percentage of the 
projects’ completion, we further verified that the income was correctly 
calculated through agreement to timesheet records and corroborated 
amounts recorded through discussion with the responsible project 
managers.
There were no material issues identified by our testing of revenue 
recognition in the period.
Measurement and presentation of highlighted items
Refer to page 39 (Audit Committee Report), page 72 
(Significant Accounting Policies) and page 75 (notes).
The Group presents profit before taxation adjusted 
for highlighted items to enable users of the financial 
statements to gain a better understanding of the 
underlying results.
The classification of items as highlighted is an area of 
judgement, and we therefore focused on whether each 
item was properly classified as a highlighted item. This 
included assessing the completeness of items classified as 
exceptional, in that it includes items that both increase and 
decrease the adjusted profit measure. 
Current year highlighted charges relate mainly to the £30.5 
million impairment charge against goodwill, £1.6 million 
restructuring costs as a result of the restructure of Grayling 
and a £0.7 million residual earn out related credit in respect 
of the 2014 acquisition of Audacity. 
We considered the appropriateness of the adjustments made 
to statutory loss before taxation to derive profit before tax and 
highlighted items. 
We understood the rationale for classifying items as highlighted and 
considered whether this is reasonable and consistent, in that it includes 
items that both increase and decrease the adjusted profit measure, and 
are in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. 
Our work in relation to each type of highlighted item is summarised 
below. 
• Goodwill impairment charge – refer to our work described in the 
section above ‘Impairment of goodwill’. With regard to the quantum 
of this charge and the expectation that it is not a recurring item each 
year, we agreed it is appropriate to separate this item as highlighted.
• Restructuring costs – these include severance payments and an 
onerous lease as a result of the Group’s restructuring of the Grayling 
division. We tested the accuracy and completeness of the costs 
incurred, including checking the payments made to employees. We 
ascertained that these positions were removed from the Group’s 
structure permanently by confirming that these costs did not just 
relate to replacing specific individuals. 
• Residual earn-out credit – the costs of acquisition related earn-
out provisions, including any subsequent adjustments to these 
estimates, have been treated as highlighted items historically. This 
year’s credit relates to finalisation of the Audacity earn-out at a 
lower than provisionally expected amount. We concluded that 
classifying this item as highlighted is appropriate and consistent with 
prior years’ treatments of such items. 
We also tested the reconciliation of adjusted profit to statutory loss 
in note 5, and agreed material adjustments to underlying accounting 
records and our audit work performed over other balances. 
We determined that the rationale for including or excluding items from 
adjusted profit has been consistently applied across gains and losses, 
and provides a balanced view of the performance of the Group. 
We reviewed the disclosures explaining the rationale for providing 
alternative profit measures in the accounting policy note as well as the 
clarity of reconciliations of these measures to their statutory equivalent.  60

 Annual Report 2016
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the 
industry in which the Group operates. 
Taken together, our audit procedures accounted for 81% of Group revenues and 69% of Group profit before tax adjusted for 
highlighted items.
The Group consists of the Company (‘plc’) and four divisions: Huntsworth Health; Red Consultancy; Citigate Dewe Rogerson; and 
Grayling.
The Group’s accounting process is structured around a local finance function for each division who maintain their own accounting 
records and controls and report to the plc finance team in the UK through submission of management reporting packs. The plc 
finance team consolidates the reporting packs of Huntsworth Health, Red Consultancy, Citigate Dewe Rogerson, Grayling and the 
central functions.
In our view, due to their significance and/or risk characteristics, as defined in our areas of focus, Red Consultancy in the UK and 
Evoke and Apothecom within the Huntsworth Health division in the US, required an audit of their complete financial information. 
These procedures accounted for 44% of the Group’s revenues. 
Specific risk-based audit procedures were performed over revenue in the Grayling Europe, UK and United Arab Emirates businesses, 
two Citigate Dewe Rogerson businesses and seven further Huntsworth Health businesses based on the audit risks we had identified 
in these areas. These procedures accounted for 37% of the Group’s revenues. 
The Group consolidation, financial statement disclosures and a number of complex items were audited at the Group’s head office. 
These included goodwill, highlighted items, tax and share-based payments.
Taken together, these procedures gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the financial statements as a whole.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our 
audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both 
individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality £0.8 million
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax and highlighted items as defined in note 2 to the 
financial statements.
Rationale for benchmark applied Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality by applying 
a benchmark of 5% of profit before tax and highlighted items. We believe that 
profit before tax and highlighted items is the most appropriate measure as 
it eliminates any disproportionate effect of one-off charges and provides a 
consistent year-on-year basis for our work.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £30,000 as well 
as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement, set out on page 56, in relation to going concern. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to 
the Directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements. We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. 
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate resources to remain in operation, 
and that the Directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our 
audit we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, because not all future events or 
conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Parent Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide 
a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with 
the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. With respect to the Strategic Report, Directors’ Report 
and Corporate Governance Statement, we consider whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal 
requirements.
Other matters
We have reported separately on the Parent Company financial statements of Huntsworth plc for the year ended 31 December 2016 
and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity
for the year ended 31 December 2016 68
 Huntsworth plc
 Annual Report 2016
1. Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’), as adopted in the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
On 20 March 2017 the consolidated financial statements of the Group were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the 
Directors. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds 
(‘£000’) except where otherwise indicated.
2. Significant accounting policies
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments which have been 
measured at fair value. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use 
when pricing the asset or liability. The Group uses valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable inputs and minimise 
the use of unobservable inputs. All assets or liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are 
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, as set out within IFRS 13.
The Group’s significant accounting policies are listed below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented 
unless otherwise stated.
Changes in accounting policies
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations were mandatory for the first time for the financial year 
beginning 1 January 2016, but had no significant impact on the Group:
• IAS 19 (amendment) – Employee Benefits
• Annual Improvements (2012–2014 Cycle);
• IFRS 11 (amendment) – Accounting for Acquisition of Interests in Joint Operations;
• IAS 16 and IAS 38 (amendment) – Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation;
• IAS 16 and IAS 41 (amendment) – Bearer Plants;
• IAS 27 (amendment) – Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements;
• IAS 1 (amendment) – Disclosure Initiative; and
• IFRS 10, IFRS 12, IAS 28 (amendment) Investment entities: applying the consolidation exception.
New Standards and amendments not applied
Standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards that have been published as mandatory for later accounting 
periods but are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Group are as follows:
• IAS 7 (amendment) – Statement of cash flows (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017);
• IAS 12 (amendment) – Income taxes (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017);
• IFRS 2 (amendment) – Share-based payments (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018);
• IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018);
• IFRS 10, IAS 28 (amendment) – Sale or Contribution of Assets (effective date postponed);
• IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018); 
• IFRS 16 – Leases (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019);
• IFRS 4 (amendment) – Insurance contracts (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018); 
• IAS 40 (amendment) – Investment property (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018);
• Annual improvements (2014-2016 Cycle) (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018); and
• IFRIC 22 – Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 
January 2018).
With the exception of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16, the Directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards and amendments listed 
above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods. 
The impact that IFRS 15 will have on the financial statements is yet to be quantified. The Group has different contractual 
arrangements with each of its clients which will require detailed review in order to assess the changes the Group will need to make to 
its revenue recognition policies once the standard is implemented.
The impact that IFRS 16 will have on the financial statements is also as yet unquantified. As a result of the Group’s diverse geographic 
portfolio of businesses, the Group has a significant number of leases which will need to be assessed individually against the 
requirements of the standard.
Basis of consolidation
Huntsworth plc (‘the Company’) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. These financial statements 
consolidate the financial statements of Huntsworth plc and all entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries). Control is 
achieved when the Company:
• has power over the investee;
• is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from its involvement with the investee; and
• has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Basis of consolidation (continued)
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses 
control. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from 
the date the Company gains control until the date the Company ceases to control the subsidiary. Non-controlling interests are 
identified separately from the Group’s equity. Profit and loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to 
the owners of the Company and to any non-controlling interests. 
Business combinations
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the 
aggregate of the fair value of the assets given, liabilities assumed or equity instruments issued by the Group. Any acquisition-related 
transaction costs are recognised in the income statement within highlighted items as they are incurred. On acquisition of a business, 
all of the assets and liabilities of that business that exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values reflecting their 
condition at that date.
Where the consideration for the acquisition includes a deferred contingent consideration arrangement, this is measured at fair value 
at the acquisition date. Any subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are adjusted against the cost of 
the acquisition if they occur within the measurement period of 12 months following the date of acquisition. Any subsequent changes 
to the fair value of the contingent consideration after the measurement period are recognised in the income statement within 
highlighted items. 
Goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the acquisition date. Goodwill is measured as the excess of 
the fair value of the consideration, the amount of any non-controlling interest and the fair value of any previously held interest in the 
acquiree over the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed. Goodwill comprises the value of expected synergies 
arising from an acquisition that do not qualify for separate recognition.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment annually and in any period in which events or changes in circumstances 
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combinations. 
Impairment testing is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill relates. If 
the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount of the cash-generating units, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce 
the carrying amount of the goodwill and then to other assets of the relevant cash-generating unit.
Acquired intangible assets comprise separable corporate brand names, intellectual property and customer relationships. Intangible 
assets are amortised systematically over their estimated useful lives, which vary from two to 20 years depending on the nature of the 
asset. These intangible assets are reviewed for impairment in any periods in which events or changes in circumstances indicate the 
carrying value may not be recoverable.
Costs associated with the development of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group and that will probably 
generate economic benefits exceeding costs are recognised as intangible assets. Costs are capitalised from the point that the 
asset first meets the recognition criteria. These are reviewed for impairment until the asset is completed, after which point costs are 
amortised over their estimated useful lives of two to seven years.
Disposals and Assets held for sale
Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale if: their carrying amount will be recovered principally through 
sale; they are available for immediate sale and the sale is highly probably. A disposal group consists of assets that are to be disposed 
of in a single transaction together with the directly associated liabilities. Goodwill arising from business combinations is included 
where the disposal group is a CGU or an operation within a CGU to which goodwill has been allocated.
On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets or components of a disposal group are remeasured at the lower of their 
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment on a disposal group is first allocated to goodwill and then to 
remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis. Impairment on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses 
on remeasurement are recognised in the income statement in highlighted items. No amortisation or depreciation is charged on non-
current assets classified as held for sale. Assets classified as held for sale are disclosed separately on the balance sheet and classified 
as current assets or liabilities, with disposal groups being separated between assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale.
Disposals are disclosed as discontinued operations when they represent a single major line of business or a geographical area of 
operations. When the Group disposes of, or loses control over, a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and 
liabilities of the entity. The fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any investment retained is recognised.  
The resulting gain or loss on disposal is recognised in the income statement in highlighted items.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at their historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses. 
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment, less the estimated residual value, on a straight-
line basis over the expected useful economic life of the assets concerned. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:
• Motor vehicles    25%
• Equipment, fixtures and fittings  10%–35% 70
 Huntsworth plc
 Annual Report 2016
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Property, plant and equipment (continued)
Leasehold improvements are amortised over the shorter of the useful economic life or the period of the lease, from three to 15 years. 
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes 
in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. If the balance is 
expected to be recovered in one year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets. 
Provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full. 
Balances are written off when the possibility of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Work in progress
Work in progress is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, and consists of third party costs incurred on behalf of clients 
which have still to be recharged.
Investments in associates
An associate is an investment over which the Group has significant influence through the power to participate in the financial and 
operating policy decisions of the investee. The Group accounts for its interests in associates using the equity method. Under the 
equity method, the investment in the associate is initially measured at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to 
recognise changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the associate is 
included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment. The Group’s share 
of profits of associates, net of tax, interest and non-controlling interests is included in the income statement and the Group’s share 
of net assets us shown within interests in associates in the balance sheet. The Group assesses the carrying value of its associates to 
determine if any impairment has occurred. 
Where the Group has disposed of a business or made other contributions to an associate, a gain or loss is recognised only to the 
extent of the portion that has been disposed of, as set out in IAS 28.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and short-term deposits. Bank overdrafts are an integral part of the Group’s 
cash management and are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Consolidated Cash Flow 
Statement.
Loans and borrowings
Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the related contracts and are measured 
initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. If the amounts involved are material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax 
rate which reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. 
Where discounting is applied to provisions, the increase in the value of the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a 
finance cost.
Where a leasehold property substantially ceases to be used for the Group’s business, or a commitment is entered into which would 
cause this to occur, provision is made to the extent that the recoverable amount of the interest in the property is expected to be 
insufficient to cover the future obligations relating to the lease.
Acquisitions made by the Group typically involve an earn-out arrangement whereby the consideration payable includes a deferred 
element that is contingent on the future financial performance of the acquired entity. No material contingent consideration will 
become payable unless the acquired entity delivers revenues or profits during the earn-out period that are greater than those used 
for calculating the initial consideration. The provision for deferred contingent consideration is recorded at fair value, which is the 
present value of the amount expected to be paid in cash or shares. The provision represents the Directors’ best estimate of future 
business performance based on internal business plans.
Turnover and revenue
Turnover represents amounts received or receivable from clients, exclusive of value added tax, for the rendering of services and 
comprises charges for fees, commissions, rechargeable expenses incurred on behalf of clients and sales of marketing products.
Revenue is turnover less amounts payable on behalf of clients to external suppliers where they are retained to perform part of a 
specific client project or service, and represents fees, commissions and mark-ups on rechargeable expenses and marketing products.
Turnover and revenue reflect the fair value of the proportion of the work carried out in the year by recording turnover and related 
costs as service activity progresses.

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Turnover and revenue (continued)
Revenue derived from retainers is recognised evenly on a monthly basis over the lifetime of the retainer contract, verified to ensure 
that there are no material distortions for known periods of intense activity. Revenue for time-charge based work is recognised when 
the service is performed in accordance with the contract and is a reflection of the actual hours worked as a proportion of total hours 
expected to be required. For fixed fee projects, revenue is only recognised once the final outcome can be assessed with reasonable 
certainty. The stage of completion is determined relative to the total number of hours or significant milestones expected to complete 
the work or provision of services. Revenue in the form of commissions on media placements and fees for creative and production 
services provided is recognised as the services are performed.
Share-based payments
The Group awards equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. These are measured at fair value at the date of grant. 
Details of how the fair value of awards made in the year has been calculated are set out in Note 23. The fair value of the equity-
settled share-based payment is recognised in the income statement as an expense spread straight-line over the relevant vesting 
period, based on the Group’s estimate of the number of awards that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the Group 
revises its estimate of the number of awards expected to vest, with the impact of any revision recognised in the income statement, 
with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
Employee share ownership plans
Consideration paid to acquire shares in Huntsworth plc through Employee Benefit Trusts has been deducted from equity.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a distribution in the period in which they are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim 
dividends are recorded in the period in which they are paid.
Pensions
The Group operates defined contribution money purchase pension schemes and makes contributions to individual employees’ 
personal pension schemes. The Group’s contributions are charged against profits in the year in which the related employee services 
are performed.
Leasing and hire purchase commitments
Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed 
to the Group, and hire purchase contracts, are capitalised on the balance sheet and are depreciated over their useful lives. The 
capital elements of future obligations under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the Balance Sheet. 
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged in the income statement over the periods of the finance leases and hire 
purchase contracts and represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease 
incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the lease term. Sub-let income on operating 
leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies
Sterling is the functional currency of Huntsworth plc and the presentational currency of the Group. Transactions denominated in 
foreign currencies are initially translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are translated into the presentational currency of the Group on consolidation. Assets and 
liabilities are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date with items in the Income Statement being translated at 
the average rate for the period. Exchange differences arising on consolidation are recorded in a separate component of equity, but 
are recognised in the consolidated income statement on disposal of the subsidiary to which they relate.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of an overseas subsidiary are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
overseas subsidiary and translated at the closing rate.
Highlighted items
The Group presents highlighted items charged to profit before tax by making adjustments for costs and credits which management 
believe to be significant by virtue of their size, nature or incidence or which have a distortive effect on current year earnings.
Such items would include, but are not limited to, costs associated with business combinations, restructuring costs, impairment of 
goodwill and other intangible assets, and amortisation of intangible assets arising on business combinations.
Restructuring costs comprise cost-saving and right-sizing initiatives of a significant and a non-recurring nature.
In addition the Group presents an adjusted profit after tax measure by making adjustments for certain tax charges and credits. 
The Group uses these adjusted measures to evaluate performance and as a method to provide shareholders with clear and 
consistent reporting. 72
 Huntsworth plc
 Annual Report 2016
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Borrowing costs and finance income
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred unless they meet the criteria to be capitalised. Finance income is 
recognised as the interest accrues (using the effective interest rate method).
Taxation
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except where it relates to items 
taken directly to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and expense or equity. Current tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are 
enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
• Where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a 
business combination that at the time of the transaction affects accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
• In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future.
• Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related 
asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only 
if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes relate to the 
same taxation authority and that authority permits the Group to make a single net payment.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate movements. The Group 
does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for financial trading purposes. Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge 
accounting are accounted for at fair value through the income statement. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at 
fair value at the contract date and continue to be stated at fair value at the balance sheet date with gains and losses on revaluation 
being recognised immediately in the income statement.
Interest rate swaps are used to hedge against fluctuations in future cash flows on the Group’s debt funding due to movements in 
interest rates. When a cash flow hedge is employed, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument 
is recognised directly in equity (hedging reserve) until the gain or loss on the hedged item is realised and recognised in the income 
statement. Any ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
Foreign currency instruments are used to hedge against unfavourable exchange rate fluctuations that affect the results of the 
Group’s overseas operations when translated into Sterling. Hedge accounting is not applied to these instruments and the associated 
cost is recognised at fair value through the income statement. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as 
liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of derivatives is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
Significant accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements and assumptions about the 
future, based on historical experience and other factors which are considered to be relevant. The resulting accounting estimates will, 
by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
(a) Highlighted items
In order to ensure comparability between the Group’s results year on year, the Directors present certain large, unusual or one-off 
items separately in highlighted items, so that the reader of the accounts can better understand the underlying performance of the 
business. The decision to present an item as highlighted is a judgement of the Directors and is reserved for items of an unusual or 
non-recurring nature that are outside of the ordinary course of business, or of such significant size such that they would materially 
distort the results of any particular period. The Directors consider it appropriate to continually present amortisation as a highlighted 
item in each period because the value of intangible assets being amortised can vary considerably from period to period depending 
on the amount of acquisition activity undertaken by the Group and the remaining useful life of individual assets.
(b) Carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the procedures set out in Note 11. The 
recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use calculations. The value in use calculation 
requires the Directors to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from each cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate 
in order to calculate present value. Estimation of future cash flows has been further complicated by the economic uncertainty arising 
from the UK’s referendum decision to leave the European Union.

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Significant accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)
(c) Revenue recognition
The Group recognises revenue on projects based on the proportion of work completed at the balance sheet date. 
Judgement is required in assessing the fair value of the proportion of work completed and hence the appropriate value of revenue 
to be recognised in the year. Management make this judgement using estimates of expected hours required to complete the project 
against the budget, alongside any milestones set out in the contract. 
(d) Going concern
Judgement is required in performing the Group’s going concern assessment as it requires estimates of forecast future profits 
and cash flows to be made in order to assess future covenant compliance over the forecast period. At the time of approving the 
financial statements, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and are forecasting to remain in compliance with future covenant facility 
requirements. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of preparation in the financial statements.
Appendix 2 on page 106 includes details of the Group’s subsidiaries and associates and forms part of these financial statements. 
3. Segmental analysis
The following is an analysis of the Group’s revenue and operating profit before highlighted items by reportable segment.
The Group’s business activities are split into four operating divisions: Citigate Dewe Rogerson (CDR), Grayling, Red and Huntsworth 
Health. These divisions are the basis on which information is reported to the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker, which has 
been determined to be the Group Board. The segment result is the measure used for the purposes of performance assessment and 
represents profit earned by each segment, but before highlighted operating expenses, net finance costs and taxation.
Details of the types of services from which each segment derives its revenues are included within the Strategic Report. The 
accounting policies applied in preparing the management information for each of the reportable segments are the same as the 
Group’s accounting policies described in Note 2.

Amortisation of intangible assets
Intangible assets are amortised systematically over their estimated useful lives, which vary from two to 20 years depending on the 
nature of the asset. The amortisation charge in respect of intangible assets is excluded from adjusted results as they relate to historic 
business combinations rather than normal ongoing operations. 
Goodwill impairment
Impairments totalling £30.5 million (2015: £48.8 million) were recognised in the year relating to goodwill in the Grayling CGU. Further 
disclosures are given in Note 11. Impairment charges are individually disclosed and are excluded from adjusted results as they do not 
relate to underlying trading. 
Impairment of software development costs 
The impairment relates to significant adverse changes in the extent to which internally developed software is expected to be used. 
Further disclosures are given in Note 11. The recoverable amount is the value in use which was determined to be £nil. The charge is 
excluded from adjusted results as it does not relate to underlying trading. 
Restructuring costs
Restructuring costs comprise cost-saving and right-sizing initiatives including severance payments, compensation for loss of office 
and other contract termination costs. Property costs relating to onerous contract provisions raised for property leases because of 
restructuring initiatives are included as well as profits on disposal of subsidiaries. These costs, which are part of the new management 
team’s strategic refocus of the business, are excluded from adjusted results as they do not relate to underlying trading. These costs 
are not expected to reoccur as the restructuring was completed in 2016. 
Acquisition and transaction related credit
The credit relates to subsequent re-measurement of the fair value of deferred contingent consideration. These costs are excluded 
from adjusted results as they relate to historic business combinations rather than ongoing operations. Transaction costs are costs 
incurred in relation to acquisitions and disposals. These costs are excluded from adjusted results as they are one-off in nature. 
Taxation
The tax related to highlighted items is the tax effect of the items above.

1. Because basic EPS results is a loss per share the diluted EPS is calculated using the undiluted weighted average number of shares.
The basic (loss)/earnings per share calculation is based on the (loss)/profit for the year attributable to the Parent Company’s 
shareholders divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted (loss)/earnings per share takes the basic (loss)/earnings per share and adjusts for the potentially dilutive impact of employee 
share option schemes and shares to be issued as part of contingent consideration on acquisitions of subsidiaries.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated in order to provide information to shareholders about underlying trading performance and 
is based on the profit attributable to the Parent Company’s shareholders excluding highlighted items.

Grayling
The performance of the Grayling CGU in the first half of 2016 was considered to be an indicator of impairment as at 30 June 2016. 
The Group revised its forecasts to current expectations of the future performance of each CGU based on the prevailing conditions 
prior to any future restructuring and investment. Accordingly, goodwill was impaired by £15.0m. 
The Group has performed further impairment testing as at 31 December 2016. Following the restructure of the US lobbying business, 
including the post-year-end disposal of Whiteboard Associates, a further impairment of goodwill of £15.5m has been recognised in 
highlighted items in the income statement.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions used in determining the 
value in use are summarised below. 
Cash flow forecasts
For each CGU, the forecast cash flows for the first five years are based on the 2017 financial budget approved by the Directors 
adjusted based on past experience and historic trends. Growth rates in years two to five are based on management’s medium-term 
forecasted revenue and operating margins for each of the businesses. 80
 Huntsworth plc
 Annual Report 2016
11. Intangible assets continued
Long-term growth rate
After the initial five-year forecast period, a long-term growth rate between 2.0% and 2.5% (2015: 1.1 – 2.5%) has been applied to the 
cash flow forecasts into perpetuity. This growth rate is based on an estimate of the long-term average growth rate for the market 
that each CGU operates in.
Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate
The pre-tax discount rate applied to all CGUs is 14.3% (2015: 14.8%). The discount rates applied to the cash flows of the Group’s 
operations are based on the risk-free rate for 20-year UK government bonds, adjusted for a risk premium to reflect both the 
increased risk of investing in equities and the systematic risk of the Group’s individual CGUs. In making this adjustment, inputs 
required are the equity market risk premium (that is the increased return required over and above a risk free rate by an investor  
who is investing in the market as a whole) and the risk adjustment (‘beta’) applied to reflect the risk of the CGU relative to the  
market as a whole.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
In assessing the value in use of a CGU, the forecast future cash flows are inherently uncertain and could change materially over time 
due to the impact of market growth, discount rates and unexpected changes in key clients and personnel. 
Following the impairment loss recognised, the estimated recoverable amount of the Grayling CGU is equal to the carrying value at 
31 December 2016. Consequently, any adverse change in key assumptions would, in isolation, cause further impairment loss to be 
recognised. 
The Board has considered various alternative performance scenarios for the Red, CDR and Huntsworth Health CGUs, including 
sensitising all of the key assumptions noted above, and have not identified any reasonably possible changes which would give rise  
to an impairment.
Impairment of software development costs
Following significant adverse changes in the commercial viability of an internally developed data analytics tool, which negatively 
impacted the extent of its expected use across the Group, an impairment loss of £0.3m was recognised in highlighted items to 
reduce the carrying value of the asset to its net realisable value of £nil. The amount presented in highlighted items is net of a credit  
of £0.1m relating to the release of provisions made in the prior year against previous software impairments.

13. Investment in associate
On 30 September 2016, the Group sold the trade and certain assets of Hudson Sandler Limited to a new associate, Hudson Sandler 
LLP. Hudson Sandler Limited formed part of the Grayling CGU. The Group is a 25% partner in Hudson Sandler LLP, a public relations 
business incorporated and operating in the UK. This associate is not considered individually material to the Group. The Group

Deferred contingent consideration for acquisitions
Acquisitions made by the Group typically involve an earn-out arrangement whereby the consideration payable includes a deferred 
element, payable in either cash or a combination of cash and shares at the Company’s option, which is contingent on the future 
financial performance of the acquired entity. The amount utilised in the year represents the cash paid or shares issued under the 
earn-out arrangements. The amount arising or released in the year represents a change in the estimated future financial performance 
of the acquired company. Where deferred consideration is not contingent on the outcome of future events the amount is included in 
trade and other payables.

18. Provisions continued
Property provisions
Provisions for property represent amounts set aside in respect of property leases which are onerous and the unavoidable costs of 
restoring leasehold properties to the condition specified in the lease at the end of the contractual term. The quantification of these 
provisions has been determined based on external professional advice and is dependent on the Group’s ability to exit the leases early 
or to sub-let the properties. In general, property costs are expected to be incurred over a range of one to eight years.
Reorganisation and other provisions
This provision relates principally to redundancy provisions. In addition, when acquiring businesses, provisions have been made to 
cover the best estimate of the Group’s exposure to liabilities arising due to the acquisition.

Deferred tax has been calculated using the anticipated rates that will apply when the assets and liabilities are expected to reverse. 
The recoverability of deferred tax assets is supported by the expected level of future profits in the countries concerned.
Unrecognised temporary differences in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences amounting to £41.4 million (2015: 
£30.6 million) have not been recognised on the basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain. These comprise tax losses and 
other temporary differences of £29.1 million (2015: £18.3 million) and capital losses of £12.3 million (2015: £12.3 million). Of this total, 
tax losses of £9.8 million (2015: £9.1 million) will expire at various dates between 2017 and 2029 and the remaining losses can be 
carried forward without restriction.
Overseas dividends received on or after 1 July 2009 are largely exempt from UK tax but may be subject to foreign withholding taxes. 
The unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries affected by such taxes is £3.8 million (2015: £2.4 million). No deferred tax 
liability is recognised on these temporary differences as the Group is able to control the timing of reversal and it is probable that they 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The UK government has enacted reductions in the main rate of corporation tax to 19% and 17% with effect from 1 April 2017 and  
1 April 2020 respectively. The impact of this change is incorporated in the reported numbers where relevant.

Capital management policies and strategies
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management policy is to maintain appropriate capital ratios in order to support its 
business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or 
adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payments to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new 
shares. The capital structure of the Group consists of its share capital, as disclosed in Note 22, and its total borrowings, comprising 
bank loans and overdrafts and obligations under finance leases, as disclosed in Note 21. 84

 Annual Report 2016
20. Financial instruments continued
Financial risk management policies and strategies
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, bank overdrafts and cash and short-term deposits. The main 
purpose of these financial instruments is to provide finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has various other financial assets 
and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group enters into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps and foreign currency derivatives. The purpose is to 
manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of finance. It is the Group’s policy that 
no speculative trading in financial instruments should be undertaken. The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments 
are interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of 
these risks and they are summarised below.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long-term debt obligations with 
floating interest rates.
The Board has endorsed principles and policies to manage the Group’s interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts.  
To enable this, the Group enters into interest rate swaps. Where appropriate, these agreements are designated to hedge underlying 
debt obligations. As at 31 December 2016, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps, approximately 55% (2015: 64%) 
of the Group’s gross borrowings was at a fixed rate of interest. The Group continually reviews and assesses the balance of debt held 
at fixed and variable rates and the need for additional instruments to meet both short-term and long-term requirements.
Interest rate swap contracts
The Group uses interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates increasing the cost of servicing its debt. By fixing 
interest rates, the Group is willing to forgo the potential economic benefit that could result from a low interest rate environment in 
order to protect its downside risks and ensure the predictability of its interest cash flows. The fair value of interest rate swaps at the 
end of the reporting period is determined by reference to a market valuation. All interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow 
hedges in order to reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings. The interest rate 
swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount accumulated in equity is reclassified to profit or 
loss over the period that the floating interest rate payments on debt affect profit or loss.
The following tables detail the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding at the 
reporting date and the impact on the Group’s fixed and floating rate debt profile.

The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above table are non-interest bearing and are therefore not 
subject to interest rate risk. Floating rate surplus cash earns interest based on relevant local LIBID equivalents. Bank overdrafts bear 
interest based on the Lloyds Bank plc base rate. The bank loans payable bear interest based on LIBOR in the relevant country.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The interest rate sensitivity analysis below is based on the exposure arising from the Group’s borrowings and derivative financial 
instruments as at the balance sheet date. A 1% (100 basis points) movement is considered to represent a reasonably possible change 
in interest rates. All other variables have been held constant.
If UK interest rates had been 1% higher or lower, the Group’s profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2016 would decrease/
increase by £258,000 (2015: £192,000). If US interest rates had been 1% higher or lower, the Group’s profit before tax would 
decrease/increase by £nil (2015: £60,000). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to interest rates on its variable rate 
borrowings.
If UK interest rates had been 1% higher or lower, the Group’s other comprehensive income would decrease or increase by £600,000 
or £616,000 respectively (2015: £824,000 or £853,000 respectively). This is as a result of the changes to the fair value of the Group’s 
interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges.
Foreign currency risk
The Group operates internationally and is therefore affected by movements in foreign exchange rates, particularly the US Dollar and 
Euro. This is largely through the retranslation of the Group’s foreign operations’ results and balances into Sterling. The Group has few 
other transactional currency exposures apart from certain foreign currency bank accounts and intercompany balances that are held 
between companies with different functional currencies.
It is the policy of the Group to consider entering into foreign currency contracts in order to manage the risk associated with the 
impact of changes in exchange rates on the Group’s operating profit. The Group does not hedge foreign exchange risk that arises 
from the retranslation of overseas assets and liabilities. During the year, the Group took out foreign exchange contracts to cover a 
proportion of the Group’s Euro and US Dollar denominated operating profit. These contracts were not accounted for as a hedge.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in the US Dollar and Euro exchange rates, with all 
other variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax. Since the majority of the Group’s expenses are denominated in the 
same currency as the associated revenues, only the net profit is exposed to currency fluctuations.

Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the potential loss that the Group would incur if a debtor or other counterparty failed to fulfil its contractual 
obligations. The Group trades only with recognised and creditworthy third parties. Customers who wish to trade on credit terms 
are subject to credit verification procedures prior to credit being granted. In addition, receivable balances are closely monitored 
on an ongoing basis by each business with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts has not been significant. There are no 
significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. The Group has a minimal concentration of credit risk in relation to trade 
receivables as it trades with a large number of customers from a wide range of business segments and geographies.
With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents and derivative 
financial instruments, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to 
the carrying amount of these instruments. The credit risk on short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments is considered 
low since the majority of counterparties are banks with high credit ratings.
Liquidity risk
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and undrawn banking facilities and by continuously monitoring 
the forecast and actual cash flows. 
The Group has a £65 million multi-currency facility agreement with Lloyds Bank plc, HSBC Bank plc and Barclays Bank plc and a  
£5 million committed overdraft facility with Lloyds Bank plc. This remains unchanged from last year. Both facilities are due to expire 
in May 2019.

Fair value measurement
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, 
grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
• Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities.
• Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
• Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are 
not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Valuation techniques used to derive Level 2 fair values
Level 2 derivatives comprise foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps. The foreign exchange contracts have been fair 
valued using exchange rates that are quoted in an active market. Interest rate swaps are fair valued using forward interest rates 
extracted from observable yield curves. 
Valuation techniques used to derive Level 3 fair values
Deferred contingent consideration liabilities were valued using a discounted cash flow methodology. The liability was based on the 
acquired business’ forecast average profits for the period from the date of acquisition. The significant unobservable inputs to this 
valuation included forecast average profits and the discount rate of 1%. 
The sensitivity of this liability to changes in this discount rate is immaterial. A reconciliation of the movement in this balance in 2015 
and 2016 is included in Note 18.

Exercisable at the end of the year 1,816,166 48.2 5,938,954 33.4
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 40.8 pence (2015: 39.3 pence). 
The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining life of 8.7 years (2015: 5.4 years). The estimated 
average fair value of the options granted during the year is 30.3 pence (2015: 22.7 pence).
Fair value of share options
The fair value of share options granted in 2016 and 2015 were calculated using either the Monte Carlo model or the Black-Scholes 
model. The inputs to these models were:
2016 2015
Weighted average share price 42.2 pence 39.4 pence
Weighted average exercise price 5.4 pence 16.7 pence
Expected volatility 39%–45% 46%–47%
Expected life 3 years 3 years
Risk-free rate 0.09%–0.6% 0.91%–1.2%
Expected dividend yield 4.0%–4.2% 4.5%–5.7%
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.  
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not 
necessarily be the actual outcome. The Group recognised a total charge of £0.2 million (2015: £0.4 million) related to equity-settled 
share-based transactions during the year.
24. Reserves
Share premium account
The share premium account is used to record the premium on shares issued.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve is used to record the premium on shares issued as consideration (both initial and deferred) for acquired 
businesses where the Group acquires 90% or more of the ordinary share capital of the acquired business.
Following the impairment of certain investments held by Huntsworth plc, £1.5 million (2015: £13.4 million) relating to the acquisition  
of those subsidiaries was transferred from the merger reserve to the profit and loss reserve.
Foreign currency translation reserve
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of financial statements  
of overseas subsidiaries.
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve is used to record the effective portion of the movements in the fair value of the Group’s derivative financial 
instruments that qualify for hedge accounting and are deemed to be effective hedges.
Treasury shares
The Group did not transfer any shares to employees pursuant to the settlement of share options (2015: transferred 585,707 shares  
to past employees for proceeds of £146,250). As at 31 December 2016 the Group held 1,686,681 shares (2015: 1,686,681 shares)

24. Reserves continued
Investment in own shares
Investment in own shares represents the cost of own shares acquired in the Company by the Huntsworth Employee Benefit Trust 
and other Employee Benefit Trusts (‘the Trusts’). The purpose of the Trusts is to facilitate and encourage the ownership of shares by 
employees, by acquiring shares in the Company and distributing them in accordance with employee share schemes. The Trusts may 
operate in conjunction with the Company’s existing share option schemes and other share schemes that may apply from time to 
time.
Pursuant to the settlement of share options, the Trusts transferred 4,051,129 shares to employees and past employees, including 
231,081 accrued dividend shares (2015: 1,198,969 shares, including 115,733 accrued dividend shares), for proceeds of £251,449  
(2015: £48,750).
During 2016 the Trusts did not purchase any shares (2015: nil). At 31 December 2016 the Trusts held 2.4 million shares (2015: 6.4 
million shares) in the Company which had a market value at 31 December 2016 of £0.9 million (2015: £2.5 million).

Contingent liabilities
In the normal course of business, the Group is, from time to time, subjected to legal actions, contractual disputes, employment claims 
and tax assessments. In the opinion of the Directors the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on 
the consolidated financial statements.
The Company and its subsidiaries have entered into a number of indemnifications, performance and financial guarantees, in the 
normal course of business, which gives rise to obligations to pay amounts or fulfil obligations to external parties should certain 
conditions not be met or specified events occur. As at the date of this report, no matter has come to the attention of the Group 
which indicates that any material outflow will occur as a result of these indemnities and guarantees.

• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the Parent Company and its environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we are required to report if we have identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report. 
We have nothing to report in this respect.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion,

Directors’ Remuneration Report – Companies Act 2006 opinion
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
Other Companies Act 2006 reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Parent Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide 
a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with 
the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report, we consider whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.
Other matters 
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Huntsworth plc for the year ended 31 December 2016.

As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, Huntsworth plc has not presented its own profit and loss account.  
The Company’s significant accounting policies are set out below.
2. Significant accounting policies
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at their historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses. 
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of tangible fixed assets, less the estimated residual value, on a straight-line basis 
over the expected useful economic life of the assets concerned. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:
• Motor vehicles    25%
• Equipment, fixtures and fittings  15%–35%
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Intangible assets
Costs associated with the development of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Company and that will 
probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs are recognised as intangible assets. Costs are capitalised from the point  
that the asset first meets the recognition criteria. These are reviewed for impairment until the asset is completed, after which point 
costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
Trade and other debtors
Trade debtors are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. Provision for 
impairment is made when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to recover balances in full. Balances are 
written off when the possibility of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Provisions for liabilities 
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is  
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of 
the obligation. If the amounts involved are significant, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a 
pre-tax rate. 
Current tax
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantially 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
• Where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a 
business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
• In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future.
• Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised.

 Annual Report 2016
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Deferred tax conitinued
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related 
asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if 
a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities.
Foreign currencies
Sterling is the functional currency and presentational currency of the Company. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are 
initially translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the resulting gains and losses are recorded in 
the profit and loss account.
Investments
Investments are recognised and carried at cost less any identified impairment losses at the end of each reporting period. 
Impairment of non-financial assets
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication 
exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Company makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount 
in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating 
unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash 
inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds 
its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are 
recognised in the profit and loss account. Central costs are not allocated to individual investments.
Financial assets
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit and loss, loans and receivables 
or available for sale financial assets, as appropriate. The Company determines the classification of its financial assets at initial 
recognition. All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent measurement
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification as follows:
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and short-term deposits. 
Loans and receivables
All Company financial assets are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with 
fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective 
interest (EIR) method, less impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition 
and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance revenue in the profit and loss 
account. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the profit and loss account in other operating expenses.
Derecognition of financial assets
A financial asset is derecognised when (i) the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired or (ii) the Company has 
transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without 
material delay to a third party under a ‘pass through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the 
risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the 
asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Impairment of financial assets
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial 
assets is impaired. If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has 
been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value 
of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original 
effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced, 
with the amount of the loss recognised in administration costs. 
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event 
occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of 
an impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its 
amortised cost at the reversal date.
Operating lease commitments
Leases where the lessor retains a significant portion of the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating 
leases and rentals payable are charged in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Share-based payments
The Company awards equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. These are measured at fair value at the date of 
grant. The fair value of the equity-settled share-based payments is recognised in the profit and loss account as an expense spread 
straight-line over the relevant vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of the number of awards that will eventually vest. At 
each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimate of the number of awards expected to vest, with the impact of any revision 
recognised in the profit and loss account, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves. 
Loans and borrowings
Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the related contracts and are measured 
initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate movements. The 
Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for financial trading purposes but derivatives that do not qualify 
for hedge accounting are accounted for at fair value through the profit and loss account. Derivative financial instruments are initially 
recognised at fair value at the contract date and continue to be stated at fair value at the balance sheet date, with gains and losses 
on revaluation being recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Employee share ownership plans
Shares in the Company held by the Employee Benefit Trust have been included within equity and are stated at cost.
Borrowing costs and finance income
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred. Finance income is recognised as the interest accrues (using the 
effective interest rate method).
Significant accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
In the application of the Company’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements and assumptions about the 
future, based on historical experience and other factors which are considered to be relevant. The resulting accounting estimates will, 
by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
Carrying value of investments and other intangible assets
The Company tests annually whether investments have suffered any impairment. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units 
have been determined based on value in use calculations. The value in use calculation requires the Directors to estimate the future 
cash flows expected to arise from each investment and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. Central costs are 
not allocated to individual investments.

14. Reserves
Called up share capital
The balance classified as called up share capital includes the total net proceeds (both nominal value and share premium) on issue of 
the Company’s equity share capital, comprising £0.01 ordinary shares.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve is used to record the premium on shares issued as consideration (both initial and deferred) for acquired 
businesses where the Group acquires 90% or more of the ordinary share capital of the acquired business. 
Following the impairment of certain investments held by the Company, £1.5 million (2015: £13.4 million) relating to the acquisition of 
those subsidiaries has been transferred from the merger reserve to the profit and loss reserve.
Treasury shares
The Group did not transfer any shares to employees pursuant to the settlement of share options (2015: transferred 585,707 shares 
to past employees for proceeds of £146,250). As at 31 December 2016 the Group held 1,686,681 shares (2015: 1,686,681 shares) in 
Treasury.
Investment in own shares
Investment in own shares represents the cost of own shares acquired in the Company by the Huntsworth Employee Benefit Trust. 
The purpose of the Trust is to facilitate and encourage the ownership of shares by employees, by acquiring shares in the Company 
and distributing them in accordance with employee share schemes. The Trust may operate in conjunction with the Company’s 
existing share option schemes and other share schemes that may apply from time to time.
Pursuant to the settlement of share options, the Trust transferred 4,051,129 shares to employees and past employees, including 
231,081 accrued dividend shares (2015: 1,198,969 shares, including 115,733 accrued dividend shares), for proceeds of £251,449 (2015: 
£48,750).
During 2016 the Trust did not purchase any shares (2015: nil). At 31 December 2016 the Trust held 2.4 million shares (2015: 6.4 million 
shares) in the Company which had a market value at 31 December 2016 of £0.9 million (2015: £2.5 million).
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve is used to record the effective portion of the movements in the fair value of the Group’s derivative financial 
instruments that qualify for hedge accounting and are deemed to be effective hedges. 104

 Annual Report 2016
14. Reserves continued
Other reserves
The amount held in other reserves represents the credit to equity where Huntsworth plc grants rights in its equity instruments to 
employees of a subsidiary and such share-based compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the consolidated financial 
statements. The credit represents a contribution from the Parent Company to its subsidiaries.
15. Related parties
Details of Executive and Non-Executive Directors’ emoluments and their interests in shares and options of the Company are shown 
in the Report of the Directors on Remuneration in the sections ‘Directors’ emoluments’, ‘Directors’ interests in shares’ and ‘Directors’ 
interests in share options’. The key management personnel of the Company are considered to be the Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors. 
16. Contingent liabilities
(i) The Company is registered with HM Revenue and Customs as a member of a Group for VAT purposes and, as a result, is jointly 
and severally liable on a continuing basis for amounts owing by any other members of that Group in respect of unpaid VAT. At 
the balance sheet date, the outstanding VAT liability in the other Group companies amounted to approximately £1.6 million (2015: 
£1.6 million).
(ii) In connection with the Group’s banking and borrowing facilities, the Company and certain of its subsidiary undertakings have 
entered into cross-guarantee and indemnity arrangements with Lloyds Bank plc, Barclays Bank plc and HSBC Bank plc.
(iii) In the normal course of business, the Company is, from time to time, subjected to legal actions, contractual disputes, employment 
claims and tax assessments. In the opinion of the Directors, the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material 
adverse effect on the Company.
(iv) The Company has entered into a number of indemnifications, performance and financial guarantees, in the normal course of 
business, which gives rise to obligations to pay amounts or fulfil obligations to external parties should certain conditions not be 
met or specified events occur. As at the date of this report, no matter has come to the attention of the Company which indicates 
that any material outflow will occur as a result of these indemnities and guarantees.

to provide insight into ongoing profit generation, both individually and relative to other companies.
Headline operating profit/profit before tax
Calculated as operating profit/profit before tax excluding highlighted items. Highlighted items in the current year comprise 
amortisation of intangible assets, goodwill impairment, restructuring costs, and acquisition/transaction related costs. In the prior 
year, impairment of software development costs was also included in highlighted items. 
Both headline profit and IFRS profit measures are presented in the income statement. An analysis of highlighted items is presented in 
Note 5. 
Margin
Headline operating profit as a percentage of revenue. 
Headline basic and diluted EPS
Headline basic EPS is calculated using profit for the period before highlighted items. Headline diluted EPS is the same calculation 
but takes into account the impact of share options in issue and deferred consideration that could be settled in shares. Details of the 
underlying inputs to headline and IFRS measures of EPS are included in Note 10.
Net debt 
Net debt is the total of current and non-current borrowings and derivative financial instruments, less cash and cash equivalents.  
The Group uses this as a measure of indebtedness. An analysis of net debt is included in Note 26.
Cash conversion 
Cash conversion is the net cash inflow from operations before highlighted items expressed as a percentage of adjusted operating 
profit and provides an understanding of how much profit the group has converted to cash. 
Highlighted cash flows are the cash flows directly attributable to the items presented within highlighted items in the income 
statement. A reconciliation of the difference between cash flows before highlighted items and IFRS cash flows is included in Note 26.
Effective tax rate 
The effective tax rate is the total tax charge incurred by the Group on headline profit before tax, expressed as a percentage. This 
provides a more comparable basis to analyse our tax rate both individually and relative to other companies.
Like-for-like
Like-for-like results are stated at constant exchange rates and are adjusted to include pre-acquisition revenues and exclude 
disposals/closures. Constant currency results are calculated by translating prior period foreign currency results using the current 
period exchange rate. This provides insight into the organic growth of the business. A reconciliation of the material adjustments 
made between like-for-like results and IFRS revenues are included in the table below:

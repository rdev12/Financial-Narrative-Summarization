1 Britvic plc Annual Report 2016
This year, Britvic continued to 
deliver on the strategy laid out 
in May 2013 to drive growth in 
Kids, Family and Adult soft drinks 
through our market leading 
brands. Despite a challenging 
external environment, we made 
signiﬁ cant progress in executing 
our strategy and have delivered 
a third successive year of proﬁ t 
growth.
Delivering against 
consumer needs: 
Leading on low/no sugar
Britvic continued to lead the GB market 
in ‘No Added Sugar’ (NAS) drinks as 
a proportion of our portfolio through 
reformulation, innovation, and responsible 
marketing. We have taken bold steps to 
help consumers make healthier choices 
and currently, 68% of our GB portfolio 
and 65% of our ROI portfolio is below or 
exempt from the proposed sugar tax. 
Responding to the growing 
trend for premium adult 
drinking experiences
Britvic has been building on its history 
to combine heritage with innovation to 
build our presence in the premium adult 
soft drinks category. We re-launched 
three new premium low calorie ﬂ avours 
in the R Whites range, alongside a full 
heritage-focused rebrand centred on 
Robert and Mary White who ﬁ rst sold 
R White’s Lemonade in 1845 from a 
wheelbarrow in London. Simultaneously, 
Britvic-backed incubator company 
Wisehead Productions launched 
Thomas & Evans, a premium zero proof 
drink designed for adults who may not 
want an alcoholic 
drink but who want 
to drink something 
sophisticated when 
socialising.
Growing internationally
Robinson’s Fruit Shoot continued to 
grow in the United States and Brazil. 
In the USA we have continued to make 
good progress in single serve and 
multi-pack Fruit Shoot, which we have 
successfully launched into grocery. We 
maintained our share of the market and 
distribution is up by 10%. We continue 
to use our strong relationship with 
Pepsi to sell Fruit Shoot single bottles 
in convenience and leisure, including 
a listing in Pizza Hut. With our partner, 
Advantage Sales and Marketing, 
we have established an eﬀ ective 
route to market for Fruit Shoot 
multipack and have achieved 
listings with major retailers 
including Walmart, Kroger 
and HEB. In Brazil, we have 
successfully combined the 
strength of the local team 
with group capability, to deliver 
Maguary Fruit Shoot onto the 
shelves in Sao Paulo with four 
ﬂ avours developed for the local 
market in under 12 months.

Chairman’s
introduction
The UK’ s decision to leave 
the EU and the proposed 
sugar tax on soft drinks 
were momentous external 
events for Britvic in an 
already challenged market 
place with price deflation. 
Despite this Britvic has, 
once again, delivered a 
record pre-exceptional 
EBITA* of £186.1m, up 
8.4%. Profit after tax of 
£114.5m has translated 
into adjusted earnings  
per share* of 49.3p. The 
board is declaring a final 
dividend of 17.5p, bringing 
the full year dividend to 
24.5p, a 6.5% increase 
on 2015. These results 
reflect the resilience of our 
brands and the strength 
of the company. 
Performance review
Simon Litherland has now been Chief 
Executive Officer for three years and in 
that time has overseen the delivery of 
record profits each year. His team have 
continued to make good progress on 
delivering the strategic priorities he set out 
in 2013. Mathew Dunn has now been in 
place as Chief Financial Officer for a year, 
he brings a new energy and has been 
relentless in his pursuit of improving 
performance. 
Trading conditions in our European 
markets have not improved over the last 
12 months with structural challenges in 
the GB market and the consolidation of 
buying groups in France. GB stills 
performance during the year was 
disappointing but was compensated for 
by the performance of our carbonates 
portfolio. In Ireland performance has been 
particularly encouraging with both the 
branded and Counterpoint business 
performing well. The investment in our 
supply chain in GB is now entering its 
second year and tangible progress in 
efficiency and flexibility is being made 
across the network which should provide 
a solid platform for future profitability. 
The announcement of a proposed sugar 
tax in the UK was disappointing. Whilst we 
recognise the need to tackle obesity, given 
the choice that the soft drinks category 
offers compared to other categories, the 
focus is frustrating. No other company has 
done as much work to remove calories 
from its products reducing calories by  
19 billion annually since 2012. We are well 
positioned to respond and are working 
constructively with Government to ensure 
the best outcome for the business.
Outside of Europe our team in the US has 
launched the Fruit Shoot multi-pack, building 
on the success of our single serve business. 
The focus now for the team is to build brand 
awareness and encourage consumers to 
try the brand. The scale of the opportunity 
is huge but we are under no illusions of the 
challenges and levels of investment that we 
face to succeed in this market. In Brazil, we 
are now one year on from our acquisition of 
Ebba, and the early signs are promising. 
João Caetano has joined the PLC Executive 
team we are all impressed by the contribution 
the local management team have made 
over this first year as part of Britvic.

Strategic report Chairman’s introduction continued
The board
As announced, Bob Ivell has now stepped 
down from the board. I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank him for the significant 
contribution he made over the last 9 years 
as our Senior Independent Director and 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. 
We wish him well for the future. 
This year we have welcomed two new 
non-executive directors onto the board. 
Firstly , Euan Sutherland, CEO of Supergroup, 
joined us in February. He has over 23 years 
of experience in both retail and FMCG having 
held leadership roles with Kingfisher, B&Q, 
AS Watson and more recently as CEO of 
The Co-operative Group. Sue Clark also 
joined us in February. Sue, until recently, 
was Managing Director of SAB Miller in 
Europe and sat on their executive committee 
until the merger with Anheuser-Busch. 
Both Sue and Euan bring with them 
extensive multinational experience and I 
am delighted to have them on the board. 
The new board has settled in well, the 
results are good and the Company is in 
good shape, notwithstanding the 
challenges we face. I have been Chairman 
now for 11 years and I have indicated to 
the board my intention to step down. 
Chairing Britvic has been a privilege, the 
business has changed significantly and I 
am continually impressed by the quality 
and commitment of all colleagues in the 
business in the many countries in which we 
now operate. The Nomination Committee 
chaired by John Daly , our Senior Independent 
Director will identify my successor. I will 
seek re-election at the AGM in January 
2017 to ensure a smooth handover. 
Capital allocation
The board remains committed to its 
progressive dividend policy with a target of 
paying out 50% of earnings in dividends. 
Since flotation in 2005 the dividend has risen 
from 10p per share to 24.5p this year and 
has returned over £448m to shareholders. 
Our adjusted earnings per share* has 
more than doubled from 18.4p to 49.3p.
A strong balance sheet is a key part of  
any company’s success and the board is 
confident that the structure we have in 
place puts Britvic in a strong position to 
overcome any short term headwinds that 
may prevail and remain agile and flexible to 
take advantage of any opportunities that 
may come our way.
The board continues to be supportive of 
the management team’s ambition to grow 
internationally through selective M&A and 
to invest in the fabric of the business, with 
the three-year supply chain investment 
and the acquisition in Brazil evidence of  
its support.
AGM
The AGM will be held at 11am on 31 January 
at RSA House, Durham House Street, off 
the Strand, London WC2N 6HG and I look 
forward to seeing you there.

Our
business
model
Britvic sets itself apart from its competitors by our 
unrivalled combination of market leading brands 
and track record in innovation, our expert 
knowledge of the soft drinks market, longstanding 
and sustainable relationships with our partners, 
including PepsiCo, and a highly talented and 
committed workforce.
We manufacture, market and sell both 
Britvic and PepsiCo brands in GB and 
Ireland, supported by dedicated 
commercial teams in both countries. In 
France, we manufacture, market and sell 
our own category-leading brands, as well 
as supplying private label juice and syrups. 
On 30 September 2015, we completed 
the acquisition of Brazilian soft drinks 
company Ebba, which manufactures and 
sells the two leading liquid dilutable brands, 
Maguary and Dafruta, and has a growing 
presence in the ready to drink 
nectar category.
Internationally, we work primarily in 
partnership with local companies through 
franchise, distribution or licensing 
arrangements to exploit the global potential 
of our kids, family and adult brands. 
In the USA, we have agreements with a 
number of Pepsi bottlers. We also export 
Britvic products around the world and are 
a signifi cant player in the travel sector.
Our brands and innovations are built on 
the quality of our insight and understanding 
of the soft drinks markets in which we 
operate. We have a strong track record in 
innovation and our dedicated technical 
and consumer innovation teams are at 
the forefront of identifying consumer trends 
and new technologies to ensure that we 
deliver products that meet consumers’ 
evolving needs. Our marketing teams 
ensure that our brands are front of mind 
for our consumers.
We are committed to building sustainable 
relationships with all our partners, from 
suppliers of raw materials through to the 
customers who sell our brands.
We have developed an operating model 
which is based on the principles of simplicity , 
focus and accountability, to ensure we 
are cost-effi cient and effective and can 
invest in the growth opportunities.
All of this allows us to deliver value to our 
shareholders, our customers and partners, 
the consumers who buy our brands, the 
communities in which we operate and to 
our employees.
MANUFACTURING
Our operations
In GB we have factories in Leeds, 
Norwich, Rugby and Beckton. 
In Ireland we have factories in Dublin 
and Newcastle West.
In France we have factories in Crolles, 
Beziers, La Roche sur Foron and 
Nantes
In Brazil, we have factories in 
Araguari and Aracati.
We fully understand the impact our 
operations have on the environment 
and are committed to effi cient and 
sustainable production, as well as the 
highest quality standards.
MARKETING
Responsible 
marketing
All our marketing activity is governed by 
a Responsible Marketing Code, which 
acknowledges that soft drinks should 
be consumed as part of a balanced 
diet and lifestyle and that we have a 
particular responsibility to children. We 
do not market our drinks to children 
under the age of 12.
For PepsiCo franchised brands
in GB and Ireland we jointly fund 
and manage marketing campaigns, 
combining PepsiCo global collateral 
and local market activations.
We use the power of our brands 
to inspire people to actively play 
together and Fruit Shoot has helped 
over 500,000 children get active 
through its ‘Active Skills’ campaign. 
Creativity is at the heart of our business 
and our marketing activity and we have a 
track record of award-winning campaigns. 
CUSTOMERS
Commercial 
relationships
We pride ourselves on being a great 
company to do business with. We 
work in partnership with our customers 
to grow both their businesses and 
our own. Equally we value our 
relationships with our suppliers 
and are committed to long term, 
sustainable partnerships.
In the last year, we have been
acknowledged by the annual
Advantage survey of food and drink 
companies and overall, we ranked 
2nd across convenience and routes to 
markets, a step change improvement 
on the previous year.
As part of our responsible sourcing 
programme, all our partners are 
required to comply with our Ethical 
Business Policy and are subject to 
our annual audit programme. 9 Britvic plc Annual Report 2016

There are several 
consumer trends that  
are shifting the soft drink 
landscape in our core 
markets – however there 
are two major ones that 
are increasingly dominating, 
both underpinned by 
consumer attitudes around 
increasing health and 
well-being and the desire 
to have more premium 
experiences when 
choosing a soft drink. 
There are further trends around looking 
for new functionality – both in liquids and 
packaging – whether it is around time 
saving convenience or improving health/
wellness. There is a growing debate on 
sugar vs natural sweeteners vs artificial 
sweeteners which is driving growth of 
packaged water and leading to consumer 
confusion as to what is best for them – 
the ultimate proposition is low in calories 
and completely natural.
Consumers are increasingly looking to 
brands for reassurance and little moments 
of reward and indulgence. Within this, 
consumers are becoming more ingredient 
conscious and are also willing to pay  
a premium for this. There has been a 
proliferation of choice in brand offerings 
as consumer requirements widen and 
create future opportunities for growth. 
Product choices and package formats/
materials definitions are becoming more 
blurred and soft drinks are becoming 
more varied as the range of consumer 
requirements widen. Thus growth 
opportunities are not just about 
refreshment, hydration or additional 
functional benefits, but all of the above.

STRATEGY IN ACTION: THE HEADLINES
  
New innovation* generated 4% 
of total revenue. These included:
•  Drench – largest of all adult 
innovation launched in the 
past 3 years
•  Purdeys and Purdeys Edge 
– fastest growing evolved 
energy brand; 
•  J
2
0 Spritz – recent successful 
launch in GB market;
•  WiseHead Productions: 
Thomas & Evans – inventing 
and growing new Zero Proof 
category 
•  Launch of sugar-free MiWadi 
Mini and ‘MiWadi 0% sugar’, 
which has become the first 
soft drinks brand to receive 
approval from Diabetes 
Ireland.
•  Launch of Teisseire pump 
pack in France
Out of home, we have grown 
in leisure and licensed, winning 
accounts such as Subway – 
giving us a 7 year arrangement 
in over 2000 outlets – and G1, 
the leading hospitality group in 
Scotland, as well as retaining 
major contracts including KFC  
and Fullers.
GB delivered an outstanding 
carbonates performance, led 
by Pepsi Max, Tango and 7UP 
Free. Volume led full year 
revenue growth and a robust 
performance with double-digit 
Q4 revenue growth. 
Supply chain investments 
& efficiencies Programme is 
on-track to deliver projected 
returns.
The new PET line – the fastest 
in Europe – is now running in 
Leeds, producing pack sizes 
from 500ml to 3litres, enabling 
us to better access growth 
channels. 
Additional warehousing is 
operational in Leeds, giving 
additional space to supply the 
North and Scotland, and also in 
London - reducing mileage, 
stockholding and emissions.
Separately, we will deliver £5m 
annualised cost savings from 
2017.
We continue to lead the market in 
‘No Added Sugar’ (NAS) drinks as 
a proportion of our portfolio in GB 
through reformulation, innovation, 
and responsible marketing.
Reformulating drinks with no 
compromise on taste or quality.
•  Removed added sugar Fruit 
Shoot (2014) and Robinsons 
(2015) in GB and reformulated 
other brands, e.g. J
2
0.
•  GB & Ireland reduced 
sweetness of Fruit Shoot.
•  68% of our current volume sold 
in the UK is exempt or below the 
proposed sugar tax threshold.
•  Our actions have led to an 
annualised 19bn calorie 
reduction across our portfolio***.
•  In the Republic of Ireland, we 
are the leaders in no added 
sugar in both market share and 
in absolute revenue terms. 
65% current volume exempt or 
below proposed tax threshold.
Continual innovation in products 
and range
• Led the use of Stevia in 2012.
•  60% of new innovation will be 
no or lower sugar and/or 
nutritionally enhanced drinks 
by 2020.
•  This year we’ve launched 
Purdey’s Edge – caffeine free 
evolved energy drink; 
re-launched Drench & R Whites 
with sugar levels under the 
proposed sugar tax; added 
multi-vitamins and reduced 
sweetness in Fruit Shoot; 
launched MiWadi Mini (NAS) 
and MiWadi Zero.
Using the power of our brands 
responsibly through our 
Responsible Marketing Code to 
promote low and no sugar 
alternatives and encourage 
active play:
•  Focus on low/no sugar 
•  Britvic does not advertise any 
products to children under 12 
and does not advertise high 
sugar products to underv 16s.
•  Since 2005, all above the line 
advertising in relation to Pepsi 
has led with sugar-free Pepsi 
MAX. 
•  We’ve used the power of our 
brands to inspire 2.6m people 
to actively play together and 
Fruit Shoot has helped over 
500,000 children get active 
through its ‘Active Skills’ 
campaign.  
GENERATING SHAREHOLDER VALUE
Fruit Shoot delivered growth 
in United States and Brazil
In the USA we have continued 
to make good progress in single 
serve and multi-pack Fruit Shoot, 
which we have successfully 
launched into grocery.
We maintained our share of 
the market and distribution is 
up by 10%. We continue to 
use our strong relationship 
with Pepsi to sell Fruit Shoot 
single bottles in convenience 
and leisure, including a listing 
in Pizza Hut which will give 
access to over 6,000 outlets.
With our partner, Advantage 
Sales and Marketing, we have 
established an effective route to 
market for Fruit Shoot multipack 
and have achieved listings 
with major retailers including 
Walmart, Kroger and HEB.
In Brazil, we have successfully 
combined the strength of the 
local team with group capability, 
to deliver Maguary Fruit Shoot 
single serve onto the shelves 
in Sao Paulo with four flavours 
developed for the local market 
in under 12 months. 
Fruit Shoot is already listed  
in key retailers with 56% 
distribution.
This achievement demonstrates 
the benefits of us bringing 
together the expertise of our 
core markets with the local 
knowledge of our Brazilian 
team underpinned by strong 
commercial execution and  
a full marketing campaign. 
*** Calorie and sugar savings from reformulations undertaken during the year are assumed on the previous year’s sales volumes regardless of when  
the reformulation entered onto the market in that year. Where a change of flavour occurs, the calorie/sugar calculations are assumed on the closest 
comparable flavour for sales volumes, e.g. blackcurrant & apple assumed comparable to pear & blueberry. All reformulation values are based on the 
latest recipe nutritional content.

Key performance
indicators
LINK TO STRATEGIC PRIORITIES WHY DO WE MEASURE THIS? PERFORMANCE
Revenue This measure refl ects our performance 
in terms of our ability to participate in 
markets effectively and to grow average 
prices and/or grow volume sold.
Group net revenue increased by 10.1% 
to £1431.3m in 2016, refl ecting an 
outstanding year in GB Carbs and an 
excellent fi rst year in Brazil, offset by a 
challenging year in GB Stills.
Pre-exceptional 
EBITA*
Underlying EBITA measures the on-going 
profi tability for the group. EBITA is preferred 
ahead of EBIT to allow for the impact of 
fair value amortisation that is generated 
when acquisitions are made.
Pre-exceptional EBITA of £186.1m 
represented growth of 8.4% driven by 
like for like growth of 3.8%, the inclusion 
of a 53rd week and the acquisition 
of Brazil. 
Pre-exceptional 
EBITA margin*
Improving operating margin is a key focus 
of the business and measures our ability 
to drive a positive mix and eliminate 
unnecessary cost. EBITA is preferred 
ahead of EBIT to allow for the impact of 
fair value amortisation that is generated 
when acquisitions are made.
Pre-exceptional EBITA margin reduced by 
20bps as a result of incorporating Brazil, 
which operates at a lower margin than 
the group average margin.
Adjusted EPS* Earnings per share refl ects the profi tability 
of the business and how effectively we 
fi nance our balance sheet. It is a key 
measure for our shareholders.
Adjusted earnings per share was 
49.3p, up 6.5%, refl ecting the growth in 
pre-exceptional EBITA of 8.4% and the 
benefi t of a reduction of £1.2m in net 
pre-exceptional interest costs.
Underlying free 
cash ﬂ ow*
Underlying free cash fl ow is a key 
indicator of the fi nancial management 
of the business and refl ects the cash 
generated by the business to fund 
payments to our shareholders and 
acquisitions.
Free cash fl ow was £10.9m, compared 
to a £89.3m in 2015. 
Working capital was an outfl ow of £25.8m 
due to the 53rd week resulting in an extra 
payment run and, as planned, capital 
expenditure was £61.0m higher than last 
year due to the implementation of our 
business capability programme in the 
GB supply chain.
We use these key performance indicators to measure our performance 
in fi nancial and non-fi nancial terms, as described below.

Chief 
Executive  
Officer’s 
review
We remain focused on 
delivering the strategy 
we laid out in May 2013. 
Despite a challenging 
environment in all the 
markets in which 
we operate, we have 
delivered another strong 
set of financial results 
and continue to make 
good progress in 
executing our longer 
term strategic goals.
The breadth of our portfolio, strength 
of our core brands and increasing 
innovation capability means we are 
well placed to adapt and evolve with 
consumer trends and customer needs 
that continue to change, probably 
faster than ever before.
We have returned to like-for-like 
revenue growth and, through our 
transformational business capability 
programme, we continue to build a 
stronger, more efficient business. Our 
pre-exceptional EBITA* increased by 
8.4%, enabling us to declare a 6.5% 
increase in the dividend.
Generate profitable growth  
in our core markets
GB
Our carbonates portfolio, which includes 
both PepsiCo brands and our owned 
brands, enjoyed another successful year. 
Our continued focus on no and low sugar 
resulted in Pepsi Max, 7UP and Tango all 
delivering growth. Whilst the value of the 
cola category declined by 1.4%, Pepsi 
grew its retail market value* by 6.7%, 
adding over £26m of retail value from  
Max, with its new Cherry variant leading 
this growth. 7UP Free outperformed the 
fruit carbonates category with double digit 
retail value* growth, and Tango delivered 
its best performance in over 10 years.
We have been more challenged in stills 
this year although the second half of the 
year reflected encouraging signs of 
improvement. Robinsons declined year  
on year following our decision to remove 
added sugar from the range and due to 
very competitive own label pricing in the 
dilutes category. J
2
O had a weak 
Christmas and our limited-edition flavours 
performed poorly this year. J
2
0 Spritz, a 
lower sugar sparkling variant introduced 
last year is performing well and offers 
good future growth potential. Fruit Shoot 
gained share in a declining category. We 
continue to evolve the brand, reducing 
sweetness and adding vitamins to the 
core brand and Fruit Shoot Hydro, our 
flavoured kids water, is growing strongly.
Over the last three years we have invested 
in our marketing and innovation capability 
and this is now starting to bear fruit. The 
contribution from innovation* continues to 
grow and represented 4% of our 2016 
revenue. Recent successes in GB include 
J
2
0 Spritz and Robinsons Squash’d; we 
are particularly pleased with the early 
performance of the Drench and Purdey’s 
brands which we have improved, 
repositioned and relaunched with new 
variants. Our innovation pipeline is strong; 
2017 will include new adult offerings such 
as the relaunch and extension of R Whites 
lemonade and the introduction of adult 
premium brands, including our ‘zero proof’ 
Thomas and Evans and our premium mixers 
range from the London Essence Company.

Strategic report Chief Executive Officer’s review continued
We have made good progress broadening 
our channel presence, winning new 
accounts such as Subway and G1, the 
leading hospitality group in Scotland, and 
retaining major contracts such as KFC 
and Fullers. A key element of our revenue 
management strategy has been to grow 
our higher margin immediate refreshment 
portfolio which includes pack sizes such 
as 500/600ml PET and 330ml cans. As  
a result we have taken share and grown 
more retail market value in this category 
than any other manufacturer, with Pepsi 
Max, Drench and Ballygowan leading this 
success. Further opportunity in this 
segment remains as we still under-index 
versus our overall market share. 
France
The tragic terrorist events of the last year, 
combined with social and economic 
pressures, have had an impact on 
consumer confidence and behaviour  
in France. In addition, syrup sales are 
particularly weather sensitive and the 
weather this summer did not match the 
previous year affecting sales. In contrast 
Fruit Shoot performed well, aided by the 
introduction of a 1.5 litre sharing pack. 
Our juice brand Pressade also continued 
to grow strongly, with its focus on organic 
and locally sourced fruit proving popular 
with consumers. Next year we are 
introducing a high juice version of Fruit 
Shoot and a new range of premium 
syrups under the Moulin de Valdonne 
brand, addressing the consumer demands 
for naturalness and a premium treat.
Ireland 
2016 has been a successful year for our 
Irish business unit. We leveraged our 
number one position in “no added sugar”, 
in which we enjoy over 30% share, to 
outperform the market. Ballygowan water 
contributed more growth to the Irish soft 
drinks market than any other brand. We 
successfully extended the brand through 
the launch of Sparklingly Fruity. 
MiWadi led the squash category back into 
growth and this year MiWadi 0% sugar 
became the first soft drink brand to receive 
approval from Diabetes Ireland. It was a 
successful year for our business out of 
home as we used the breadth of our 
portfolio to successfully take share in both 
convenience and through our licensed 
wholesaling arm, Counterpoint. 
To further increase our reach into the 
Licensed channel, we are today announcing 
the acquisition, subject to competition 
approval, of East Coast Suppliers Ltd, a 
licensed wholesaler with a strong presence 
in Dublin. Through this acquisition, our 
business will become the number two 
wholesaler, providing a direct route to 
market for our growing adult premium soft 
drinks portfolio.
Realise global opportunities 
in kids, family and adult 
categories
We have had an excellent first year in Brazil. 
Despite the current tough economic 
conditions, we have grown volume and 
revenue and our brands Maguary and 
Dafruta have gained market share. Multiple 
price increases were successfully executed 
to maintain margins in the face of double 
digit raw material inflation. More recently we 
have launched Maguary Fruit Shoot, a 
fantastic achievement for the combined 
Ebba and Britvic team in such a short 
period of time. Initially we are focusing our 
efforts on Sao Paulo city before we 
undertake a broader roll out across Brazil. 
The local senior management team have all 
been retained and have proved a great 
addition to Britvic.
We continue to invest behind our 
international division in the USA. Fruit Shoot 
singles, distributed by our partner Pepsi in 
the convenience and leisure channels, have 
continued to perform well and we have 
maintained our market share. Fruit Shoot is 
now listed in Pizza Hut nationally and is 
performing well. 
This year we have also launched multi-pack 
into the grocery channel with our partner 
Advantage Sales and Marketing, who are a 
well-established operator in grocery. The 
scale of the opportunity is large but the USA 
grocery market is complex, diverse and 
highly competitive. We are pleased with the 
listings we have gained with major retailers 
such as Walmart, Kroger and HEB but 
recognise that we have further work to do 
to properly establish the brand in this 
channel in the year ahead.
Finally, we took the difficult decision to 
withdraw from India this summer. Whilst the 
brand was growing its distribution, the path 
to sustainable profitability was proving to be 
a long one and we have decided to focus 
our efforts and investment elsewhere.
Continue to step-change our 
business capability
Last year we announced a 
transformational three-year investment 
programme to deliver increased supply 
chain flexibility and efficiency with a 
minimum 15% EBITDA* return. We 
continue to see a significant opportunity 
for our business to improve its capability 
and our current expectation is that the net 
capital investment in the programme will 
be around £240m. The first year of our 
investment into the supply chain in GB is on 
track and we have identified opportunities 
in Ireland and France. In 2016 we 
commissioned our first new large PET line 
and on site warehousing in Leeds. We also 
made significant progress on the installation 
of three new can lines in Rugby. These will 
be fully operational in spring 2017 and will 
start to deliver significant cost and 
commercial benefits as we head into 2018. 
In 2017 we will commence the next phase 
of our investment programme, with a new 
PET line in London, as well as new aseptic 
lines in Rugby and in France. In Ireland, 
we announced changes to our distribution 
model, outsourcing all warehousing and 
distribution to increase capacity and 
reduce cost. 
As we have looked to extend our business 
capability agenda beyond supply chain, 
we have taken the opportunity to flatten 
our team structures and create more 
synergy between our business units, which 
will improve the speed and effectiveness 
of decision making as well as drive out 
cost. We anticipate that these initiatives 
will deliver incremental annual cost 
savings from 2017 of £5m.

BRITVIC HAS DELIVERED ANOTHER STRONG  
SET OF RESULTS IN CHALLENGING MARKET 
CONDITIONS. 
”
177534_BRITVIC_TEXT-p001-037.indd   17 13/12/2016   18:59 Build trust and respect in our 
communities
Public health has continued to be a key 
issue in 2016, with soft drinks levies 
proposed to be introduced in 2018 in the 
UK and Ireland. Britvic believes in offering 
choice, whilst making it easier for 
consumers to reduce their calorific intake 
without compromising taste or quality.  
We are disappointed at the introduction  
of category-specific taxes, since we 
believe a holistic approach is necessary  
to tackle this complex issue. 
Playing a proactive role in helping to 
address obesity has long been an integral 
part of our sustainable business plan. We 
have led the industry in our approach to 
health: reformulating brands such as J20 
and Drench; introducing new product 
innovations such as MiWadi Zero and 
MiWadi Mini; and removing added sugar 
Fruit Shoot and Robinsons. Our actions 
since 2012 have led to an annualised 
19bn calorie reduction and our portfolio is 
now strongly weighted towards low and 
no sugar in GB and Ireland.
Our brands have also continued to help 
families get active, promoting sport through 
high level sponsorships including Robinsons’ 
enduring association with the Wimbledon 
Lawn Tennis Championships and 
Teisseire’s sponsorship of the Tour de 
France. This year Fruit Shoot partnered 
with Tough Mudder to enable children 
across the UK, France, Ireland and the 
USA to participate in a Mini Mudder 
obstacle course. 
Fruit Shoot also partnered with Right to 
Play – a global organisation that uses the 
transformative power of play to educate 
and empower children facing adversity.
We have made good progress on reducing 
our environmental impact, with the 
investment in our manufacturing plants 
leading to a 1.5% reduction in water 
usage per litre of soft drink produced. At 
our Leeds factory, water consumption is 
down 22% and energy use reduced 45% 
relative to production, compared to FY15. 
We are confident our London and Rugby 
sites should see a similar efficiency saving 
once the supply chain investments 
become fully operational by 2020. 
This year our charitable contributions have 
been valued at nearly £900,000 and our 
employees have continued to live our 
values, going the extra mile to support 
great causes and build an inspiring place 
to be. In GB, our employees have been 
supporting our two new charity partners, 
Sported and the Wildlife Trust. In Ireland, 
we launched our employee volunteering 
policy, enabling employees to take 2 days 
paid leave to volunteer. In France we have 
been supporting young people entering 
the labour market through workshops, 
open days and partnering employee 
volunteers with young people on job 
discovery exercises.
Outlook
2017 will be another challenging year, with 
difficult trading conditions and input cost 
inflation for the first time in several years. 
The UK’s vote to leave the EU and the 
proposed soft drinks levies in GB and 
Ireland from April 2018 have created 
additional uncertainty.
However, we are well positioned to deal 
with these challenges. We have a clear 
strategy that is working, hugely talented and 
committed people, and a robust balance 
sheet that provides a strong platform from 
which we will continue to deliver our strategic 
goals. The breadth of our portfolio, strength 
of our brands and innovation capability 
leaves us well placed to continue to grow. 
Through our transformational business 
capability programme we are creating a 
stronger, more efficient business, with a 
lower cost base. I am confident that we 
will deliver 2017 results in line with market 
expectations whilst continuing to progress 
our strategic priorities.

Chief 
Financial  
Officer’s 
review
The following is based 
on Britvic’s results for 
the 53 weeks ended  
2 October 2016. 
Overview 
In the period, we sold over 2.3 billion litres 
of soft drinks, an increase of 12.3% on the 
previous year, with Average Realised Price 
(ARP*) of 59.2p, declining by 3.3%. 
Revenue was £1,431.3m, an increase of 
10.1% (AER) compared to last year. 
Like-for-like* performance saw revenue 
increase 0.4% to £1,321.6m.
Pre-exceptional EBITA* increased 8.4% to 
£186.1m, and pre-exceptional EBITA* 
margin decreased 20bps due to the 
first-time inclusion of Brazil. Like-for-like 
pre-exceptional EBITA increased 3.8% to 
£178.8m with like-for-like pre-exceptional 
EBITA margin increasing 40bps. The 
summer weather was an improvement on 
2015 in both GB and Ireland, whilst 
France lapped a particularly warm 2015. 
The better weather combined with strong 
execution meant like-for-like quarter four 
revenue increased 5.7% for the 
comparable 12-week period.

The performance of the carbonates portfolio has been strong this year. Pepsi has continued to grow and gain market share, generating retail 
market value growth of £28m in a category where value declined £22m. Pepsi Max was in strong growth, accounting for 90% of the brand’ s 
market value growth. 7UP , led by low-sugar 7UP free, outperformed the category and also gained value share. T ango achieved its highest 
sales since 2005. Quarter four was particularly strong, with total carbonates revenue increasing by nearly 13.5% and both ARP* and volume 
in growth. Over this period, we delivered strong growth in our single serve immediate refreshment pack formats and benefitted from the 
Subway contract, where our range is now available in over 2000 outlets.
1  The GB and Ireland businesses include an additional week this year in quarter four. This occurs as we operate a 52-week accounting 
calendar rather than a 365-day calendar, resulting in an additional week in 2016. As a result, the next financial year will be a 52-week period 
ending on 1 October 2017. To ensure consistent and comparable reporting the additional week has been excluded from the segmental 
analysis included within this report.

GB stills performance was challenged and 
revenue declined 7.0%. The total stills take 
home market, as measured by Nielsen, 
declined in retail market value* by 1.5% 
(excluding water) with the squash and kids 
categories declining by 3.0% and 7.6% 
respectively. The removal of the added 
sugar range of Robinsons in 2015 resulted 
in a decline in sales as fewer consumers 
switched to the new formulation than 
originally anticipated. However, 
performance in the second half of the year 
improved, particularly in quarter four when 
we began to cycle the removal of the full 
sugar variant. Whilst Fruit Shoot declined, it 
outperformed the category with the Hydro 
flavoured water variant in growth. During 
the year, we also improved the offering of 
the core brand with the addition of 
multi-vitamins and a reduction in 
sweetness as we continued to improve the 
“better for you” credentials of our portfolio. 
J20 performance was also challenged, in 
part due to the poorer performance of the 
limited-edition variants. Earlier in the year 
we relaunched the Drench juice drink 
brand with a range of new, lower sugar 
flavours and this resulted in strong growth 
in the second half of the year.

Quarter three was soft, largely due to 
cooler, wetter weather impacting syrup 
sales, whilst revenue returned to growth in 
quarter four. This was in part due to a 
reversal in the weather trends benefiting 
our syrups brands. Fruit Shoot continued 
to grow, led by the launch of a 1.5 litre 
sharing pack, and the Pressade juice 
brand, with its organic and “juice from

Ireland has delivered strong growth this 
year with both our own brand portfolio 
and the Counterpoint business 
contributing to this. Our leading water 
brand, Ballygowan, performed well, whilst 
good performances from MiWadi Zero 
and the fruit carbonate brand Club Zero 
have also contributed to our growth. 
Counterpoint has continued to benefit 
from an improved range in both snacks 
and alcohol which has helped to provide a 
more attractive offering to its licensed 
trade customers. The margins in the 
licensed wholesale channel and in the 
water category, both of which grew 
strongly, are dilutive when compared to 
the Ireland average.

*  Whilst reported revenue, ARP and brand 
contribution declined, this was in part 
due to a change in the route to market in 
the Netherlands resulting in costs that 
were previously reported against 
overheads now being reported against 
revenue and marginal costs. 
Comparable ARP declined 2.0%, 
revenue declined 0.6% and brand 
contribution declined 30.4%. The 
comparable revenue decline of 0.6% 
was driven by weakness in our 
European exports division, including our 
operations in Benelux and travel sectors 
where volumes declined in the mid-
single digits. Brand contribution was 
further impacted by our upweighted 
investment in the USA with the Fruit 
Shoot multi-pack launch this year. We 
have also gained a listing for the 
single-serve range with Pizza Hut in the 
USA, which will put Fruit Shoot in front 
of thousands of families every week and 
will drive brand awareness.

Note: Brazil has no comparatives as it is the first time of inclusion in the Britvic group, however non-audited comparatives are provided in the commentary to aid 
understanding.
The performance in our first year in Brazil 
has been excellent. On a pro forma* 
basis, volumes increased by nearly 8%, 
revenue increased by nearly 19%, brand 
contribution* increased by over 7% and 
our brands gained retail market volume 
and value share. Price increases have 
been successfully implemented to recover 
the inflationary cost pressure faced in the 
market. Investment in the business has 
seen a doubling of A&P* spend as well as 
the recruitment of additional heads into 
the commercial team. In the Summer we 
launched Maguary Fruit Shoot in Sao 
Paulo with listings secured in key retailers.

below the Britvic average. Actual spend 
was £2.5m lower than last year with

Strategic report Chief Financial Officer’s review continued
Exceptional and other items 
In the period, we accounted for a net 
charge of £6.0m of pre-tax (£7.1m post 
tax) exceptional and other costs. These 
include:
• Brazil integration costs of £5.2m
•  Costs in relation to closure of 
operations in India of £2.4m
•  Gain on disposal of property in GB £3.2m
•  Strategic restructuring – cost initiatives 
of £0.6m
•  Strategic restructuring – business 
capability programme of £8.4m
• Fair value gains of £11.3m
•  Unwind of discount on deferred 
consideration of £3.3m
• Debt repayment charges of £0.6m 
The cash cost of exceptional and other 
items in the period were £11.6m.
Interest 
The net finance charge before exceptional 
and other items for the 53-week period 
for the group was £20.8m compared with 
£22.0m in the prior year, reflecting the 
lower debt profile of the group and the 
refinancing of the group bank facilities 
earlier in the financial year. 
Taxation 
The underlying tax charge was £36.3m 
which equates to an effective tax rate of 
23.0% (52 weeks ended 27 September 
2015: 23.5%). The decrease in the 
effective tax rate reflects the decrease in 
the UK corporate tax rate during the period. 
However further start-up losses in certain 
territories as a part of its International 
expansion, for which no tax relief is 
currently available, continue to exert 
upward pressure on the effective tax rate.
Earnings per share
Adjusted basic EPS for the period was 
49.3p, up 6.5% on the same period last 
year. Basic for the period was 43.8p 
compared with 41.8p for the same period 
last year.
Dividends
The board is recommending a final 
dividend of 17.5p per share, an increase 
of 7.4% on the dividend declared last 
year, with a total value of £46.0m. The 
final dividend will be paid on 3 February 
2017 to shareholders on record as at 9 
December 2016. The ex-dividend date is 
8 December 2016.
Cash flow and net debt
Underlying free cash flow* was £10.9m, 
compared to a £89.3m inflow the previous 
year. Working capital generated an outflow 
of £25.8m, due to the 53rd week resulting 
in an extra payment run. Capital expenditure 
was £61.0m higher than last year, driven 
by the implementation of our business 
capability programme in the GB supply 
chain. Overall adjusted net debt* 
increased by £152.5m and took our 
leverage to 1.8x EBITDA* from 1.3x last 
year. In July 2015 £87.8m of cash was 
received from the issue of shares under a 
non pre-emptive placing, which was 
subsequently used in consideration for 
the acquisition of “EBBA” which reduced 
net debt in the prior year. Excluding the 
cash received on the placing, leverage 
last year was 1.7x EBITDA. The adjusted 
net debt* (taking into account the foreign 
exchange movements on the derivatives 
hedging our US Private Placement debt) 
at 2 October 2016 was £416.4m, compared 
to £263.9m at the end of last year.
Treasury management
The financial risks faced by the group are 
identified and managed by a central 
treasury department, whose activities are 
carried out in accordance with board 
approved policies and subject to regular 
Audit and Treasury Committee reviews. 
The department does not operate as a 
profit centre and no transaction is entered 
into for trading or speculative purposes. 
Key financial risks managed by the 
treasury department include exposures  
to movements in interest rates and foreign 
exchange rates whilst managing the 
group’s debt and liquidity, currency risk, 
interest rate risk and cash management. 
The group uses financial instruments to 
hedge against interest rate and foreign 
currency exposures. At 2 October 2016 
the group has £902.3m of committed 
debt facilities consisting of a £400.0m 
bank facility which matures in 2021, and  
a series of private placement notes with 
maturities between 2016 and 2026, 
providing the business with a secure 
funding platform. 
At 2 October 2016, the group’ s unadjusted 
net debt of £573.9m (excluding derivative 
hedges) consisted of £115.1m drawn under 
the group’s committed bank facilities, 
£659.8m of private placement notes, 
£3.3m of accrued interest and £3.8m of 
finance leases, offset by net cash and 
cash equivalents of £205.9m and 
unamortised loan issue costs of £2.2m. 
After taking into account the element of the 
fair value of interest rate currency swaps 
hedging the balance sheet value of the 
private placement notes, the group’s 
adjusted net debt was £416.4m which 
compares to £263.9m at 27 September 
2015.
In November 2016, agreement was reached 
with a series of investors to raise a further 
£175m of USPP floating and fixed rate 
notes funding in February 2017, with 
maturities between February 2025 and 
February 2032. The funds raised will be 
used to replace USPP notes maturing in 
December 2016 and February 2017 and 
to provide additional funding headroom.

Pensions
At 2 October 2016, the IAS 19 pension 
deficit in respect of the group defined 
benefit pension schemes was £17.4m (27 
September 2015: net surplus of £17.3m). 
The move from surplus into deficit was 
driven by significantly higher liabilities due 
to a sharp decrease in gilt yields partly 
offset by improved performance of the 
scheme assets (especially in the GB 
scheme where a significant proportion of 
assets are held in corporate bonds and 
gilts), the additional employer contributions 
made to the GB plan of £20.0m, and the 
Pension Increase Exchange exercise 
completed by the GB scheme during the 
financial period.
The defined benefit section of the GB 
pension scheme is closed to future 
accrual. The Northern Ireland scheme is 
only open to future accrual for members 
who joined before 28 February 2006, and 
new employees are eligible to join the 
defined contribution scheme. All new 
employees in Ireland join the defined 
contribution plan. The 1 January 2015 
actuarial valuation of the Britvic Ireland 
Defined Benefit scheme has been 
completed and shows there was no past 
service deficit. The GB Pension scheme 
actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2016  
is underway.
The Ireland and Northern Ireland Defined 
Benefit Pension schemes have an 
investment strategy journey plan to 
manage the risks as the funding position 
improves. The GB Pension scheme 
mainly has credit-type investments and 
the Trustees have developed proposals  
to manage the investment risks.
Risk management process
Our approach
As with any business we face risks and 
uncertainties. We believe that effective risk 
management supports the successful 
delivery of our strategic objectives. The 
management of these risks is based on  
a balance of risk and reward determined 
through assessment of the likelihood and 
impact as well as the Company’s risk 
appetite. The Executive Team perform a 
formal robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Company annually, which 
is reviewed by the Board. Similarly all 
business units and functions perform 
formal annual risk assessments that 
consider the Company’s principal risks 
and specific local risks relevant to the 
market in which they operate. Risks are 
monitored throughout the year with 
consideration to internal and external 
factors, the Company’s risk appetite  
and updates to risks and mitigation  
plans are made as required.  
Key areas of focus
This year the Board and the Executive 
Team has placed a significant focus on 
defining the Company’s risk appetite. This 
is an expression of the amount and types 
of risk that the Company is willing to take 
to achieve its strategic and operational 
objectives. We have agreed a set of 
Company appetite statements for our 
principal risks. We are using the 
articulation of risk appetite in decision 
making across the Company and to 
define and validate the mitigating  
activities required to manage our risks. 
During 2015/16, in accordance with the 
requirements under the UK Corporate 
Governance Code the Directors also 
assessed the long-term viability of the 
Company in the context of its principal risks.

Britvic’s business is built on providing consumers 
with great drinks that they enjoy, from brands that 
they trust. We know that building trust and respect 
in our communities is about doing the right thing by 
our customers, our employees, our shareholders, 
the environment and the communities in which we 
operate and it continues to be an integral part of our 
business strategy.

Sustainable  
business review
Our continued commitment to 
our sustainable business 
programme was recognised 
with an improved score within 
the Business in the Community 
Corporate Responsibility (CR) 
Index, which grew to 2.5 stars 
this year . 
Further information about our sustainable 
business programme can be found within 
our annual Sustainable Business Report 
which can be found at www.britvic.com
Focused on the issues  
that matter
Our sustainable business programme is 
based on addressing the issues that are 
most material to our business – those that 
represent a direct or indirect impact on our 
ability to create, preserve or erode economic, 
environmental and social value for us, our 
stakeholders, the environment and society at 
large. We maintain regular dialogue with our 
key stakeholders to understand the issues 
they deem of importance and incorporate 
these considerations in our sustainable 
business programme, aligning time, 
resources and investment accordingly . We 
concentrate on the highest priority issues 
within this report but more detail can be 
found at www.britvic.com and within our 
annual Sustainable Business Report. 
Reporting boundaries
This year has been the first year we have 
captured data for the Brazilian business, 
Empresa Brasileira de Bebidas e Alimentos 
SA “Ebba” and have included this data 
within our overall business performance 
unless explicitly stated otherwise. Water, 
energy and carbon emissions data relates 
solely to our manufacturing sites in GB, 
Ireland, France and Brazil where we have 
full operational control. 
Uncertainty and estimates
While we make every effort to capture all 
information as accurately as possible, it is 
neither feasible nor practical to measure all 
data with absolute certainty . 
Where we have made estimates or 
exercised judgement this is highlighted 
against the data disclosure.
Consumer health
Obesity and other health issues such as 
diabetes are a growing concern within our 
markets and we are committed to helping 
our consumers make informed choices to 
live healthier and more active lives. We 
believe that all of our drinks can be enjoyed 
as part of a balanced diet and healthy 
lifestyle and we are proud of our leading 
approach to innovation and reformulation.
We have witnessed a shift in consumer 
behaviour towards healthier products and 
this year we have removed a further 19bn 
calories / 5MT*** sugar from our portfolio 
and remain committed to helping 
consumers make healthier choices through 
reduced sugar products that are clearly 
labelled. Some of the innovations that 
entered the market this year included the 
launch of MiWadi Mini in Ireland, the launch 
of Sparkling Drench with only 3.9g sugar per 
can in GB and the reformulation of Fruit 
Shoot in the US and France to reduce sugar 
and calories respectively .
***Calorie and sugar savings from reformulations 
undertaken during the year are assumed on the 
previous year’s sales volumes regardless of when 
the reformulation entered onto the market in that 
year. Where a change of flavour occurs, the calorie/
sugar calculations are assumed on the closest 
comparable flavour for sales volumes, e.g. 
blackcurrant & apple assumed comparable to pear 
& blueberry. All reformulation values are based on 
the latest recipe nutritional content.

Inclusion
We are committed to providing equal 
opportunities to our current and potential 
employees and apply fair and equitable 
employment practices. We value diversity 
and we recruit and promote talent on the 
basis of ability, skills, experience, behaviour, 
performance and potential for the job. Our 
selection, training, development and 
promotion policies ensure equal 
opportunities for all colleagues regardless 
of factors such as age, sex, disability 
(including colleagues who become 
disabled during service), gender (including 
gender reassignment), marital status, 
pregnancy and maternity, race, nationality, 
religion or belief or sexual orientation.
Diversity in our workforce is crucial to our 
success and we have a responsibility to 
create an environment where people can 
be themselves and are valued for their 
uniqueness. This year we worked with the 
Business in the Community (BITC) race 
and gender equality campaigns, accessing 
best practice resources and training on 
unconscious bias. We developed reporting 
and monitoring activities to include gender 
and pay, internal promotions, external 
applicant demographics and recruitment 
decisions, and are currently participating in 
the BITC benchmarking surveys for gender 
and race. We also launched our four-year 
roadmap for becoming a fully inclusive 
organisation.
The overall gender balance across all 
employees at 2 October 2016 was 28% 
female and 72% male. This figure is 
indicative of our industry, with a high 
proportion of operational employees 
typically being male. Our Board level 
gender diversity increased to 22% with the 
appointment of Sue Clark as an additional 
female Non-executive Director. 
Human rights
Our human rights policy is set out in our 
Ethical Business Policy which is available at 
www.britvic.com/sustainable-business/
resources. This applies to our employees, 
our suppliers and partners and anyone 
working on behalf of our business. It covers 
bribery and corruption, conducting business 
with respect, integrity and equality and 
managing personal activities and interests. It 
also covers responsible trading and sets out 
our standards regarding human rights, 
health & safety and environmental 
responsibilities and what we expect of our 
suppliers and other trading partners, which 
are monitored through our responsible 
sourcing programme.
We run a confidential whistle blowing hotline 
for anyone who is concerned about a 
breach of the policy.
All our employees are trained and required 
to complete an on-line test to ensure 
compliance with the policy.

Responsible sourcing and

We are committed to sourcing all our 
materials in a responsible manner, 
working alongside our suppliers to drive 
best practice through audits and training 
and have a responsible sourcing 
programme in place to manage the 
environmental and ethical risks within our 
supply chain. The Modern Slavery Act 
2015 has introduced changes in UK law 
focusing on increasing transparency in 
supply chains. We will publish a slavery 
and human trafficking statement on our 
website in due course and in compliance 
with the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
Employee Health & Safety
We’re committed to providing a safe 
working environment for our people and 
identifying and managing safety risks is a 
top priority for us. This year our safety 
performance in relation to accident 
frequency and severity rate has significantly 
improved on last year with a 23% and 
24.6% reduction respectively across the 
group. A number of factors have 
contributed towards this achievement 
including the introduction of the new ‘How 
2’ Standards and audit programme and 
greater uptake of the ‘contribution to 
safety’ behavioural safety model. 
Additionally, the infrastructure investment 
projects in GB have been instrumental in 
introducing the highest levels of safety 
possible for our plant and machinery.
Health, safety and wellbeing
The health, safety and wellbeing of our 
employees is paramount to Britvic and we 
have a Health, Safety and Wellbeing 
Committee which is chaired by our General 
Counsel with cross-functional representation 
and support from health and safety 
specialists from across the group. 
We run an employee wellbeing programme 
‘Wake up to Wellbeing’ in GB and Ireland 
which is based on the Government’ s ‘One 
You’ campaign designed to encourage, 
empower and enable people to protect 
and improve their health and we also 
provide an Employee Assistance 
Programme which is confidential and 
designed to offer support 24 hours a day, 
both online or on the phone.
Creating a great place to 
work for our employees
We recognise that our people are central 
to our success and to achieving our future 
ambitions. We currently employ over 4,000 
people around the world and have a talented 
and diverse workforce. We want Britvic to 
be an inspiring, safe place to be and for 
our people to realise their ambitions. Each 
employee is guided by a common purpose, 
our vision and our values which are 
integrated into our people processes and 
programmes, including our performance, 
reward and talent programme – Growth, 
performance, success. 
We measure our overall employee 
engagement through the Great Place to 
Work survey, which allows all our people to 
anonymously feedback their views. This is 
our fourth year of completing the survey 
and we continue to make progress in 
making Britvic a great place to work. This 
year we achieved a Trust Index score of 
72% with an 86% response rate.
Learning and development
We are committed to nurturing and growing 
our employees at all levels, enabling them 
to lead Britvic into the future. We encourage 
them to own and grow their careers within 
Britvic. We continue to run an extensive 
learning and development curriculum, 
which offers all employees the chance to 
improve their core business skills and 
managers the opportunity to enhance 
their management skills, through on-line 
and face to face training. We also run 
programmes tailored to the needs of 
specific areas of the business.

Strategic report Sustainable business review continued
Communication and 
engagement
Engagement with our employees is a priority 
for us and we keep people informed about 
our business, its performance and things 
that affect them through a variety of 
channels. These included, our company 
intranet, Teamlink – our monthly digital 
update and Teamtalk – our regular face to 
face meetings led by senior management. 
Our quarterly magazine, Zest, is available 
to all employees. 
We have well established Employee 
Involvement Forums in GB and Ireland as 
well as the Britvic Group Forum with 
nominated employee representatives who 
ensure that employee’s views are taken 
into account regarding issues that are 
likely to affect them. Where the group has 
entered into a recognition agreement with 
a trade union, it fulfils its obligations to 
consult and negotiate accordingly. 
Sharing in success
We monitor our total pay and benefits 
offering as part of our reward philosophy 
which is based on delivering competitive 
salaries and benefits, performance-related 
bonus and share ownership opportunities. 
In a number of our markets, pay for large 
populations of our employees is determined 
with trade union representatives on the 
basis of fair terms and conditions for all 
members. 
Management pay and bonuses are linked 
to business performance and their personal 
contribution. Selected senior executives 
also receive annual awards of long-term 
incentives to directly align their packages 
with sustainable shareholder creation. Pay 
outs under these plans depends on Britvic’ s 
performance over a three year period. 
We also provide competitive pension and 
healthcare benefits in addition to statutory 
arrangements. 
Supporting our communities
We recognise the importance of supporting 
our local communities and this year our 
charitable contributions were valued at 
almost £900,000. This included volunteering 
time, matched funding, payroll giving, 
drinks donations and our monthly 
employee lottery.
In GB our employees participated in our 
‘Rowed to Rio’ fundraising challenge, 
collectively covering a total of 9962 miles 
and raising money for our charity partner 
Sported, a charity aimed at supporting 
over 3,000 local sports clubs. The Wildlife 
Trust also became our charity partner in 
2016 and our employees have been 
volunteering at their local Wildlife Nature 
Reserves, helping protect nature whilst 
also building stronger relationships within 
their teams. 
In Ireland we launched our employee 
volunteering policy, enabling employees to 
take 2 days paid leave to volunteer. 304 
hours of volunteering took place this year 
as a result of the introduction of this new 
policy, supporting charities close to our 
employee’s hearts.
Reducing resource use
Protecting the environment and the natural 
resources on which we depend is critical 
to our business success. We manage our 
environmental impacts by focusing on those 
we can control, namely energy and its 
associated carbon emissions, water use 
and packaging. Minimising our impact on 
these resources helps us control operating 
costs and helps build a resilient 
competitive business.
Water use
Responsible water use continues to be a 
concern across the world with increasing 
numbers of people without access to 
clean water. We recognise we have a 
responsibility to manage our water use 
prudently and this year we successfully 
reduced our water intensity ratio by 1.5% 
to 1.9 across our European manufacturing 
sites, meaning for every litre of soft drink 
we produce we use 1.9 litres of water. We 
have a 2020 ambition to reach a water 
intensity ratio of 1.4.
Climate change
Climate change is one of the biggest 
challenges we face and society is already 
beginning to experience its impacts - 
socially, economically and ecologically. 
Through our investments in new, more 
efficient technology we endeavour to 
reduce our emissions in the long term, 
however this year our carbon emissions 
increased relative to production. This 
increase was caused by the infrastructure 
investment works underway that 
increased our energy consumption at our 
manufacturing sites by 3.4% across the 
business. We are confident however that 
the investments will see a significant 
improvement in our energy and 
subsequent carbon footprint going 
forward. Our new production line at 
Leeds, for example, uses 41% less 
electricity than older lines.
We continued to offset our GB business 
travel emissions through the 
CarbonNeutral
®
 certification scheme 
supporting a de-forestation project in the 
Amazon rainforest. This project works 
with local communities to help preserve 
the biodiversity of this area of global 
significance.
The table below sets out the quantities of 
greenhouse gas emissions in tonnes of 
carbon dioxide equivalent (CO
2
e) for the 
53 weeks ended 2 October 2016. The 
table also contains last year’s emissions 
to demonstrate our progress. Please note 
the reporting scope changed this year as 
we have included Brazil in our 
calculations. We have also provided 
performance excluding Brazil to allow for 
year-on-year comparison.
We have reported on all of the emission 
sources required under the Companies 
Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Reports) Regulations 2013. Emissions 
outside of our responsibility, including 
shared office locations and those 
originating from our contract packers and 
franchise partners, have been omitted 
from our disclosure. We have used the 
GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (revised edition) and 
emission factors from UK Government’s 
GHG Conversion Factors 2016 for this 
year’s calculations.

Packaging
Packaging is an essential component of 
our products and we take our responsibility 
to produce packaging with minimal 
environmental impact very seriously.  
Our approach focuses on transforming, 
innovating, reducing and optimising the 
use of materials we use. In order to do 
this we have been developing a tool to 
measure the environmental impact of our 
packaging formats and will be integrating 
its consideration within our packaging 
development process moving forward.
Over the past 3 years we have been 
working in partnership with Innovate UK 
and the UK based SME, Natural Resources 
(2000) Limited (NRL), on a new sustainable 
packaging technology that could 
revolutionise packaging across multiple 
sectors. This year, we have reached a proof 
of principle milestone on developing a 
viable bottle from sustainable wood fibres. 
The technology platform, using patented 
(pending) moulding and processing 
techniques, has been producing bottles 
on a prototype manufacturing line. 
A closure system using similar wood fibre 
based material has also been demonstrated. 
This new technology has the potential to 
significantly reduce the environmental 
impact of packaging as the materials are 
sustainably sourced, renewable and fully 
recyclable and the forming process 
requires less energy to produce a bottle 
than its contemporary equivalents. Further 
work is underway to bring this technology 
to market as part of our sustainable 
packaging strategy.

CONSUMER PREFERENCE
Failure to deliver brand propositions 
which respond to changing consumer 
preferences. 
Consumer preferences, tastes and behaviours evolve over time 
and differ between the different markets in which we operate. 
Our ability to anticipate these trends and ensure the strength and 
relevance of our brands is critical to our competitiveness in the 
market place and performance.
• Broad portfolio of products across a number of sub categories 
and markets to increase coverage of consumer trends. 
• Continuous assessment of consumer trends in order to 
anticipate changes in preferences and match our offerings to 
these trends. 
• Ongoing evaluation and development of brand portfolio and 
innovation pipeline. 
• Our mitigating approaches remain broadly unchanged and 
we continue to invest in innovation and our marketing 
programmes. For example, we have signifi cantly grown 
market share with Pepsi max, relaunched Purdeys and 
extended our presence in the premium adult category 
through new brands such as Thomas & Evans and the 
London Essence Company in GB. In France we have seen 
signifi cant growth from our organic juice brand Pressade. 
HEALTH AND OBESITY CONCERNS
Failure to address health concerns of 
government, consumers and other 
stakeholders (e.g. sugar and obesity).
There are different consumer preferences in the markets we 
operate in to natural or artifi cial sweeteners and other ingredients 
such as preservatives. Additionally there is a continued high level 
of media and government scrutiny on health and obesity in our 
core markets; GB, Ireland and France. It is important that we 
continue to take a leadership position on health issues.
• We have a wide range of soft drinks, many of which are low or 
no sugar.
• Ongoing evaluation and development of the brand portfolio 
and innovation pipeline.
• Reformulation of products where we can to help consumers 
make healthier choices. For example we were the fi rst UK soft 
drinks company to introduce stevia and in Fy15 we removed all 
sugar variants from Robinsons and Fruit Shoot ranges in the UK.
• Our Innovation pipeline is weighted towards lower-sugar or 
nutritionally enhanced brands.
• We market our brands responsibly with no marketing to under 
12s and a focus on low or no sugar variants as well as 
encouraging consumers to lead active life styles.
• We work closely with non government organisations and trade 
associations in our markets to fully participate in the debate 
and help shape solutions. 
• In GB and Ireland, the governments announced plans 
for a tax on soft drinks manufacturers, commencing in 
April 2018. 
• We continue to reformulate products to reduce/remove 
sugar content e.g. Drench, as well as bringing new 
products to market – e.g. Purdeys Edge and MiWadi 
Mini – which are outside of the tax. In addition we 
reduced the sweetness of Fruit Shoot and added 
multivitamins during the year. 
• MiWadi Zero – partnership with Diabetes Ireland charity. 
We are also supporting the change4life campaign on 
Robinsons.
• In the UK and Ireland we are engaging constructively 
on the detail of the proposed sugar tax with the 
government.
RETAILER LANDSCAPE AND 
CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS
We may not be able to maintain 
strong relationships or respond to 
changes in the retailer landscape.
Maintaining strong relationships with customers is critical for our 
brands to be available and well presented to our consumers. A 
failure to do this may impact our terms of business with customers 
and /or the availability and presentation of our brands.
• Operate across many different customer channels and 
markets.
• Continuous monitoring of customer performance and trends. 
• Develop compelling offerings for our customers’ shoppers 
based on our understanding of their business and the soft 
drinks category. 
• Soft drinks market and retail conditions in GB, Holland 
and France remain challenging. 
• GB supply chain investment programme will enable us 
to respond to customer and consumer needs through 
improved capability to produce different pack sizes. 
• Recent Subway 7 year contract win, serving 2 million 
customers every week.
THIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPS 
Partnerships may not be renewed or 
are renewed on less favourable terms. 
We currently bottle and co-market a number of PepsiCo products 
in GB and Ireland, including 7UP and Pepsi. Additionally we have 
a relationship with a number of partners to grow our family, adult 
and kids brands outside of our core markets. Our partnership 
with PepsiCo and distributors and franchisees is an important 
part of our business and delivery of our strategy going forward.
• Robust governance and management of relationship with 
PepsiCo and other partners.
• The Pepsi and 7UP bottling agreement for Ireland was 
renewed for 10 years with effect from 1 January 2016, 
which further strengthens our long term relationship 
with PepsiCo.
Strategic report
Our 
risks
As with any business we face risks and uncertainties. 
We believe that effective risk management supports 
the successful delivery of our strategic objectives. 
The management of these risks is based 
on a balance of risk and reward determined 
through assessment of the likelihood and 
impact as well as the group’ s risk appetite. 
The Executive Team perform a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing 
the group annually, which is reviewed by 
the Board. Similarly all business units and 
functions perform annual risk assessments 
that consider the group’s principal risks 
and specifi c local risks relevant to the 
market in which they operate. Risks are 
monitored throughout the year by the 
Board, Executive Team and business 
units and functions with consideration to 
internal and external factors, the group’s 
risk appetite and updates to risks and 
mitigation plans are made as required. 
Key areas of focus
This year the Board and the Executive T eam 
has placed a signifi cant focus on defi ning the 
group’s risk appetite. This is an expression 
of the amount and types of risk that the 
group is willing to take to achieve its strategic 
and operational objectives. We have agreed 
a set of group appetite statements for our 
principal risks. We are starting to use the 
articulation of risk appetite in decision making 
across the group and to defi ne and validate 
the mitigating activities required to manage 
our risks. During 2015/16, in accordance 
with the requirements under the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Directors 
also assessed the long term viability of the 
group in the context of its principal risks.

Brexit Implications
Following the vote on 23 June 2016, the 
Executive Team and the Board have 
considered the implications of the vote to 
leave the European Union on the short 
and medium prospects of the group. 
There are three main areas where Brexit 
could impact the group in the period prior 
to exit:
1.  the risk of a downturn in the UK economy 
leading to a weaker soft drinks category 
growth. However the potential impact 
of this is too early to foresee at this 
stage and historically the UK soft drinks 
category has shown a good level of 
resilience to downturns in the economy. 
2.  the impact of a sustained reduction in 
the value of Sterling which despite the 
group’s hedging strategies will lead to 
an increase in the year on year cost of 
commodities such as PET, sugar 
and juices. 
3.  the further reduction in gilt yields has an 
impact on the value of the deficit related 
to the group’s defined benefit schemes. 
Additional contributions of £15m per 
annum in 2018 and 2019 will be made 
should the formal actuarial valuation in 
2016 reveal that these contributions are 
necessary to return the GB scheme to 
full funding on a self-sufficiency basis 
by 31 March 2020.
We cannot comment on the likely impact 
when the United Kingdom leaves the 
European Union, as the terms and 
conditions have not yet been negotiated. 
Principal risks and 
uncertainties
The Executive Committee and Board 
considered the risks described below as the 
principal risks facing our business during the 
year. These are not the only risks that may 
impact the Group but they are the ones that 
we believe are the most significant at this time.

INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION
Our plan to grow our International business 
is limited by lack of brand momentum, local 
geo-political or economic risks, the risks 
associated with start – up profitability or 
substandard processes and systems.
To achieve our strategy of growing internationally it is important 
that we have the appropriate governance, systems and 
processes in place and that our brand propositions respond 
appropriately to local consumer preferences.
• Geo-graphic spread mitigates against localised geo-political 
or economic risk. 
• Mix of ‘asset light’ franchise and business acquisitions also 
reduces our exposure to this risk. 
• Extensive due diligence prior to entering into a new market. 
• Closely monitor market and country information provided 
by our partners and business units. 
• Initial stage of integration of Ebba business completed. 
Continued focus on embedding the control and 
compliance framework.
• Launch of multi pack in the US with development 
of associated processes and systems. 
SUPPLY CHAIN
Supplier failure, market shortage or an 
adverse event in our supply chain impacts 
sourcing of our products and / or that the 
cost of our products is significantly affected 
by commodity price movements.
Our business depends on purchasing a wide variety of products 
and services, efficient manufacturing and distribution processes. 
• Monitoring of market conditions for commodities and 
where appropriate hedging our contractual positions. 
• Robust supplier strategy, selection, monitoring and 
management processes. 
• Maintain multiple sources of supply for our products 
wherever possible.
• Externally certified management systems across 
the supply chain.
• Business continuity planning processes. 
• Continued embedding and development of 
management systems and assurance processes. 
• The GB supply chain investment programme will further 
improve the flexibility and therefore resilience of our GB 
supply chain.
SAFE AND HIGH QUALITY  
PRODUCTS
A faulty or contaminated product, either 
through malicious contamination, human 
error or equipment failure, is supplied to  
the market.
The quality of our products is of the upmost importance to us 
and it is of paramount importance that we manage product 
quality and integrity.
• Robust quality management standards applied across 
our supply chain and rigorously monitored. 
• Supplier assurance and management processes.
• Dedicated central teams to oversee quality and supplier 
assurance, working closely with the business units.
• Continued focus on improving the management 
standards framework used across the Group and the 
monitoring and oversight processes.
LEGAL AND REGULATORY
Non-compliance with local laws or 
regulations or breach of our internal  
policies and standards.
Britvic is subject to a wide range of legislation, regulation, 
guidance and codes of practice in areas such as composition, 
labelling, packaging, marketing claims, advertising, safety, 
environment, competition, tax and employee health and safety. 
Failure to comply with such requirements could have a significant 
impact on our reputation and/or incur financial penalties.
• Britvic code of conduct and our Group policies trained 
and rolled out to employees. 
• Monitoring processes to ensure compliance with all relevant

TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION 
SECURITY
We experience a major failure of IT 
infrastructure or breach in system or 
information security.
We interact electronically with customers, suppliers and 
consumers and our supply chain operations are dependent on 
reliable IT systems and infrastructure. Disruption to our IT 
systems could have a significant impact on our sales, cashflows 
and profits. Additionally, and in common with many businesses, 
cyber security breaches could lead to unauthorised access to, or 
loss of sensitive information.
• Disaster recovery plans tested every year. 
• Central governance and decision making processes 
for system changes.
• Development and implementation of robust information 
security policies and processes. 
• In 2015/16 a number of major organisations were 
subject to cyber attacks. 
• We have increased investment to improve information 
security processes and cyber risk awareness.
• Recognising that this risk can be managed but not 
eliminated we have built and enhanced processes to 
test and build resilience to cyber attacks.
TREASURY AND PENSION
Changes to exchange rates and interest 
rates can have an impact on profits and 
cashflows. 
Britvic is exposed to a variety of external financial risks relating to 
treasury and pension. Changes to exchange rates and interest 
rates can have an impact on business results and the cost of 
interest on our debt.
Additionally the GB and Ireland businesses have defined benefit 
pension plans, which whilst closed to new employees and future 
accruals are exposed to movements in interest rates, values of 
assets and increased life expectancy. 
• Robust monitoring of exchange rates and interest rates.
• Active risk management and hedging strategies in place 
to manage exchange and interest fluctuations.
• Close working with the trustees of the pension fund to 
agree future investment and funding strategies.
• Review of foreign exchange hedging in place ahead of 
the EU referendum to ensure good levels of hedging in 
place across the main currency pairs.
• Despite the hedging strategies in place, the recent 
reduction in the value of Sterling, if sustained, will lead 
to higher input costs across a number of our key 
commodities. However we are taking action to reduce 
some of this impact.

Strategic report
Viability statement
During the year, the 
Directors assessed the 
viability of the Company 
over a three-year period, 
taking into account the 
group’s current financial 
position and the principal 
risks, particularly those 
that could threaten the 
business model. These 
risks and the actions 
being taken to manage 
or mitigate them are set 
out above.
The Directors have determined that  
a three-year period is an appropriate 
timeframe for the assessment given the 
dynamic nature of the FMCG sector and 
this is in line with the group’s strategic 
planning period. The starting point for the 
viability assessment is the strategic and 
financial plan, which makes assumptions 
relating to the economic climate in each of 
our markets, the growth of the soft drinks 
category, input cost inflation and growth 
from the group’ s value drivers. The process 
for assessing the viability of the group 
involved input from a number of functions 
across the business to model a series of 
theoretical ‘stress test’ scenarios based 
on the materialisation of principal risks. 
Examples include a faulty product being 
supplied to market or a failure to respond 
to changing consumer preferences including 
health trends. The approach also considered 
interdependencies between the group’s 
principal risks as well as reverse stress 
testing allowing the Directors to assess 
the circumstances that would render  
the business model unviable. 
To support the final conclusion on viability, 
the assessment also took into account 
the mitigations available to the group to 
protect against these downside scenarios. 
Finally the stress test scenarios were 
reviewed against the group’s current and 
projected debt and liquidity position. 
Based on the results of this analysis, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the three year period to 
September 2019.
The Strategic Report was approved by 
the Board and signed on its behalf by 
Simon Litherland.

177534_BRITVIC_TEXT-p033-088.indd   33 13/12/2016   19:05 Dear Shareholder,
As I mentioned in my Chairman’s 
statement earlier in this report, market 
conditions continued to be challenging 
during 2016 with additional uncertainty 
caused by the UK’s decision to leave 
the EU, and a proposed tax on soft 
drinks in GB and Ireland. Despite 
these challenges, Britvic has continued 
to deliver the strategic priorities set 
out in 2013 and the Board has 
remained focussed and close to the 
key issues facing the company. 
The board is committed to high standards of corporate 
governance and supports the principles laid down in The 
UK Corporate Governance Code published in September 
2014 by the Financial Reporting Council (‘the Code’). This 
report aims to demonstrate our approach to governance 
through effective leadership and ensuring that good 
governance principles and practices are adhered to.  
Changes to board composition
There have been a number of changes to the board over the 
past year. As part of our previously reported succession plans, 
we welcomed Sue Clark and Euan Sutherland to the Board as 
Non-Executive Directors on 29 February 2016. They stand for 
appointment at the AGM in 2017. Having reached his nine year 
tenure, Bob Ivell was succeeded by John Daly as Senior 
Independent Director and Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
at the 2016 AGM. Bob remained on the Board until the 
appointments of Sue and Euan had been made. John Gibney, 
our former CFO, stepped down from the Board on 27 January 
2016 after 16 years of service to the company. We wish him well 
in his retirement. Mathew Dunn succeeded John as Chief 
Financial Officer in November 2015 and stood for appointment at 
the 2016 AGM. 
Your board is committed to remaining effective and recognises 
that to do so it must ensure that it has the right balance of skills, 
independence and knowledge of the company to enable it to 
discharge its duties and responsibilities. Further details on the 
board’s succession planning activities, and the steps it is taking 
to develop its policy on diversity, are discussed in my Nomination 
Committee Report on pages 47 to 49.
Details of the directors’ biographies are set out on pages 36 and 37.

Fair, balanced and understandable
During the year the board reviewed the requirement for directors to 
make a statement that they consider the annual report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced and understandable. The 
Audit Committee met to consider the criteria for a fair, balanced 
and understandable annual report and to review the processes 
underpinning the compilation and assurance of the report, in 
relation to the financial and non-financial information. The board 
then considered the annual report as a whole, being mindful of 
the UK reporting requirements to ensure consistency between 
the narrative sections and the financial statements.
The board’s statement on the report is outlined on page 88.

Governance  Compliance with The UK 
Corporate Governance Code
The board supports the principles laid down in The UK Corporate 
Governance Code as issued by the Financial Reporting Council in 
September 2014, which applies to financial years beginning on or 
after 1 October 2014 (‘the Code’) (available at www.frc.org.uk). 
This report describes how the principles of the Code are applied 
and reports on the company’s compliance with the Code’s 
provisions. 
Throughout the financial year ended 2 October 2016 and to the 
date of this report, we have complied with the provisions set out 
in the Code with the exception of the provisions below:
Code Provision B.1.2 For a short period following the AGM 
on 31 January 2016 until 29 February 
2016 when Euan Sutherland and Sue 
Clark were appointed as directors, 
the composition of the Board was 
temporarily imbalanced in terms of 
independence with Bob Ivell reaching 
his nine years tenure and remaining 
on the Board until Euan and Sue had 
been appointed. 
Code Provision B.6.2 The last externally facilitated Board 
evaluation was carried out during 
July – September 2013. The Board 
agreed that following the significant 
changes to the Board over the past 
year, that there would be more value 
in delaying the externally facilitated 
evaluation during 2017. Further details 
are set out on page 46 of this report.
Leadership
The board
The board of directors currently has nine members, comprising 
the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, five 
independent Non-Executive Directors and the PepsiCo nominated 
Non-Executive Director. The biographical details of the board 
members are set out on pages 36 and 37. All of the directors 
bring strong judgement to the board’s deliberations. They have all 
occupied, or occupy, senior positions in UK and/or international 
companies (including listed companies) and have substantial 
experience across a range of businesses. Other than their fees, 
which are disclosed on page 69, the Non-Executive Directors 
received no remuneration from the company during the year. 
They also do not participate in any of the group’s pension 
schemes or in any of the group’s bonus, share option or other 
incentive schemes. 
The role of the board
The board is responsible for the long term success of the group, 
corporate governance, strategy, risk management and financial 
performance. The board normally meets at least 8 times each 
financial year and has a formal schedule of matters reserved  
to it for decision making, including responsibility for the overall 
management and performance of the group, and the approval of 
its long term objectives and commercial strategy, approval of 
annual and interim results, annual budgets, material acquisitions 
and disposals, material agreements and major capital 
commitments, approval of treasury policies, and assessment  
of its going concern position. 
Board members are given appropriate documentation in advance 
of each board or committee meeting. This includes a detailed 
report on current trading performance and comprehensive 
briefing papers on matters where the board will be required to 
reach a decision. Senior executives below board level attend 
board meetings where appropriate to present business updates. 
There is an established procedure for the preparation and review 
by the board of the annual budget. The business reports monthly 
on its performance against its agreed budget. The board receives 
a monthly update on performance and reviews any significant 
variances at each of its meetings. All major investment decisions 
are usually subject to post-completion reviews. At least one of 
the board’s regular meetings every year is devoted to reviewing 
and agreeing the group’s long-term strategy.
Matters reserved for the board
The board provides strong and effective leadership within a 
framework of prudent and effective controls, and in accordance 
with the Code provisions there is a formal schedule of matters 
specifically reserved for board decision which defines the board 
from sub-committees and management. This clear definition not 
only compliments and strengthens the company’s decisions, but 
builds the foundations of a solid business. Although there is a 
standard agenda of items, these are regularly reviewed to ensure 
that the board provides continual effective leadership and drive 
towards the group’s strategic aims. Matters which the board 
consider suitable for delegation are contained in the terms of 
reference of its committees which, in line with the Code provisions, 
can be found on the company’s website at  
http://www.britvic.com/investor-centre/corporate-governance
Re-election of directors
The company’s articles of association provide that all directors 
will stand for re-election at least every three years but in order to 
comply with the Code, all of the directors submit themselves for 
re-election (or election following first appointment) at each annual 
general meeting (‘AGM’).
Board committees 
The board is assisted by four board committees (as shown in 
the governance framework diagram below) to which it delegates 
specific responsibilities. Each committee has full terms of reference 
that have been approved by the board and which can be found 
on our website at http://www.britvic.com/investor-centre/

177534_BRITVIC_TEXT-p033-088.indd   43 13/12/2016   19:05 Service contracts and letters of appointment
Details of the Executive Directors’ service contracts and the 
Chairman’ s and the Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment 
are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 75. These 
documents are available for inspection at the registered office of 
the company during normal business hours and at the AGM.
Independent advice
The board has approved a procedure for directors to take 
independent professional advice at the company’s expense if 
necessary. No such advice was sought by any director during the 
year. In addition, the directors have direct access to the advice 
and services of the Company Secretary.
Indemnification of directors
In addition to the indemnity granted by the company to directors 
in respect of their liabilities incurred as a result of their office in 
accordance with our articles of association, we maintain a 
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy throughout the 
year. Neither our indemnity nor the insurance provides cover in 
the event that a director has proven to have acted dishonestly or 
fraudulently. 
Risk management and internal control 
The board has overall responsibility for monitoring the group’s 
system of internal control and risk management and for carrying 
out a review of its effectiveness. In discharging that responsibility, 
the board confirms that it has established the procedures 
necessary to apply the Code, including clear operating procedures, 
lines of responsibility and delegated authority. These procedures 
have been in place since the company listed and are regularly 
reviewed by the board. 
Business performance is managed closely and the board and the 
executive team have established processes, as part of the normal 
good management of the business, to monitor:
• Strategic plan achievement, through a regular review of progress 
towards strategic objectives;
• Monitoring and maintenance of insurance cover to insure all 
risk areas of the group;
• Financial performance, within a comprehensive financial planning 
and accounting framework, including budgeting and forecasting, 
financial reporting, analysing variances against plan and taking 
appropriate management action;
• Capital investment and asset management performance, with 
detailed appraisal, authorisation and post investment reviews; 
and
• The principal risks facing the business ensuring that the 
significant risks faced by the group are being identified, 
evaluated and appropriately managed, giving consideration  
to the balance of risk, cost and opportunity. 
The board is supported by the Audit Committee in reviewing  
the effectiveness of the group’s risk process and internal control 
systems. The system of internal control is designed to manage, 
rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and it must be recognised that it can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
Management, with the assistance of the finance function, is 
responsible for the appropriate maintenance of financial records 
and processes. This ensures that all financial information is 
relevant, reliable, in accordance with the applicable laws and 
regulations, and distributed both internally and externally in  
a timely manner. A review of the consolidation and financial 
statements is completed by management to ensure that the 
financial position and results of the group are appropriately 
recorded, circulated to members of the board and published 
where appropriate. All financial information published by the 
group is subject to the approval of the board, on the 
recommendation of the Audit Committee.

Conflicts of interest
The company’s articles of association allow the board to 
authorise potential conflicts of interest that may arise and to 
impose limits or conditions, as appropriate. Any decision of the 
board to authorise a conflict of interest, whether matter-specific 
or situational, is only effective if it is agreed without the 
participation of the conflicted director(s), and in making such a 
decision, as always, the directors must act in a way they consider 
in good faith will be most likely to promote the success of the 
company. The company has an established procedure whereby 
actual or potential conflicts of interest are reviewed annually and 
for the appropriate authorisation to be sought prior to the 
appointment of any new director or if a new conflict arises. The 
Nomination Committee engaged with Spencer Stuart during the 
year for the purpose of recruiting Mathew Dunn, Sue Clark and 
Euan Sutherland. As Gerald Corbett serves on the Advisory 
Committee of Spencer Stuart, it was agreed that he should 
absent himself from discussions relating to the engagement of 
Spencer Stuart and from discussions relating to their 
appointments. John Daly, the Senior Independent Director 
chaired the Nomination Committee which made the appointments. 
John Daly serves on the Board of Wolsely plc with T essa Bamford 
who is a consultant with Spencer Stuart. Both John Daly’s and 
Gerald Corbett’s external appointments were considered as part 
of the annual review and renewed for a period of one year. 
Induction and development
The Chairman is responsible for preparing and co-ordinating 
an induction programme for newly appointed directors, including 
presentations from senior management on different aspects of 
the business, as well as guidance on their duties, responsibilities 
and liabilities as a director of a listed company. The Non-Executive 
Directors are encouraged to visit group manufacturing sites to 
enable them to gain a greater understanding of the group’s 
activities and to meet senior managers throughout the business. 
Every director has access to appropriate training as required 
subsequent to his appointment and is encouraged to develop 
his understanding of the group. To strengthen the directors’ 
knowledge and understanding of the Group, board meetings 
regularly include updates and briefings on specific areas of the 
group’s activities and board meetings, where possible, are held 
offsite at other Britvic sites.
Following Sue Clark and Euan Sutherland’s appointment to the 
board, the Company Secretary assisted the Chairman in organising 
an appropriate induction programmes for both directors. The 
programme was tailored according to their background, experience 
and the requirements of their role, noting their appointments as 
members of the Remuneration and Audit Committees respectively. 
The table below details the highlights of their induction 
programme to date: 
Type of induction activity
Face to face meetings • Meetings with Chairman, CEO and CFO to understand the culture and values, strategy, 
recent developments, overview of financials (including last year’s report and accounts) and key 
challenges and opportunities 
• Meetings with members of the Executive team to gain insight of their role and responsibilities, 
the structure of their teams and current challenges and opportunities
Site visits • Visits to our Leeds and Rugby sites to further their knowledge of operations
Committee inductions • To understand Committee remit and overview of key issues/policies/developments 
• Meeting with Chair of Committee and advisers to Committee
Investor relations  
and media views
• To gain an overview of investor relations activities, market facing issues and investor concerns
Governance, risk 
management and  
litigation

and schedule of future meetings
• Directors’ duties and Board procedures for conflicts of interest and share dealing 
• Key governance issues affecting the company 
• Principal risk register and risk management approach
• Overview of material litigation
• Directors & Officers insurance policy
Use of Board portal • To gain access to key materials and policies allowing each director to further their knowledge of 
the work of the Board and annual planning cycles, minutes from previous meetings and other 
relevant information
In terms of on-going development for the other directors, John Daly was appointed Chair of the Remuneration Committee in January 
2016 and has been supported by the Remuneration Committee’s advisers to further understand remuneration related hot topics, 
investor views on remuneration and market trends.

177534_BRITVIC_TEXT-p033-088.indd   45 13/12/2016   19:05 Board evaluation
Each year the performance of the Board, its Committees and directors is evaluated. The last externally facilitated evaluation was 
carried out during July – September 2013. The Board agreed that following the significant changes to the Board over the past year 
that there would be more value in delaying the externally facilitated evaluation to 2017. This year, an internal evaluation process 
was carried out by way of a questionnaire based on the performance of the Board and its Committees and that of the Chairman. 
The results of the evaluation were presented to the Board and confirmed that the Board and its Committees were operating effectively. 
2015 Evaluation Recommendations Actions delivered 
Continue to focus on shorter-term 
succession planning and for a  
successor to the Chairman
Bob Ivell and Silvia Lagnado’s succession plans were completed 
in February 2016 with the appointment of Sue Clark and Euan 
Sutherland. Given the year of change on the Board, the Chairman 
has agreed to remain on the Board until the new board has settled
Implement a deeper succession plan  
and focus on talent management
A talent review is brought to the Board on an annual basis to focus 
on the pipeline of talent for the leadership team
Increase the board’s visibility to external 
investor concerns and updates
The Board portal is used to ensure directors have access to the 
latest sector and company related broker notes
Continue with opportunities for the  
Non-Executive Directors to visit other 
sites and to meet informally outside  
of board meetings
The Board have visited the Amsterdam office and the Rugby factory 
during the year. Meetings are scheduled to take place off-site with 
board dinners to enable discussion outside of the boardroom
Focus on strategy and risk  
management
In light of the increased governance focus on risk, the board’s 
agenda has been re-shaped with risk and strategy appearing as 
regular features. During the year, an additional meeting was held 
off-site with an exclusive focus on strategic opportunities and 
challenges for the company
      
2016 Evaluation Recommendations for 2016-17
• Continue to embed the newer members of the Board through informal engagement 
• Continued focus on strategic priorities with regular ‘deep dives’
• Develop content and format of information for the Board
• Develop Board succession plans

I am pleased to present its report for 
the year ended 2 October 2016. It has 
been an eventful year for the Committee 
with a focus on succession planning. 
The Committee is responsible for 
considering and recommending to the

for appointment as Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors and for other 
senior management roles, so as to 
maintain an appropriate balance of 
skills and experience within the 
company and on the board and to 
ensure progressive refreshing of the 
board. This report describes how the 
Committee has carried out its 
responsibilities during the year.

Governance
177534_BRITVIC_TEXT-p033-088.indd   47 13/12/2016   19:06 Appointment of Directors
There is a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the 
appointment of new directors to the board under which the 
Committee interviews suitable candidates who are proposed 
either by existing board members or by an external search firm. 
Careful consideration is given to ensure proposed appointees 
have enough time available to devote to the role and that the 
balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the board is 
maintained. When discussions relate to the appointment of a 
Chairman, the Senior Independent Director will chair the Committee 
and lead the recruitment process. When the Committee has 
found a suitable candidate, the Chairman of the Committee will 
make a proposal to the whole board, which retains responsibility 
for all such appointments. The Chairman of the Committee also 
provides a report of Committee meetings to the board.
Appointment processes
The recruitment procedure described above was undertaken 
during the year for the appointments of Mathew Dunn, Sue Clark 
and Euan Sutherland. During the year, the Committee engaged 
Spencer Stuart to assist with the recruitment process. Gerald 
Corbett serves on the Advisory Committee of Spencer Stuart and 
accordingly it was agreed that Gerald should absent himself from 
discussions relating to the engagement of Spencer Stuart and 
from discussions relating to their appointments. John Daly, the 
Senior Independent Director chaired the Nomination Committee 
which made the appointments. John Daly shares a directorship 
link with Tessa Bamford at Wolseley plc, who is a consultant at 
Spencer Stuart. The Committee agreed that whilst a potential 
conflict, this would not preclude John from acting within the best 
interests of the company.
Spencer Stuart held no other relations with the company, and the 
following process was undertaken:
• Role profiles were prepared against which potential candidates 
were considered;
• Interviews arranged between Chairman and an initial list of 
candidates, from which a shortlist of preferred candidates was 
selected;
• Other Non-Executive and Executive board members 
interviewed the shortlist of candidates and provided feedback 
to the Committee;
• The Committee considered these views in its deliberations 
before recommending a preferred candidate to the Board; and
• The Board approved the appointment as recommended. 
Succession planning
Succession planning has continued to be an area of focus of the 
Committee during the year. This has included the succession of 
longer standing members of the board, in particular, Bob Ivell 
who stepped down from the board on 1 March 2016 having 
reached his ninth year of tenure and initial conversations around 
succession planning for the role of the Chairman. It was agreed 
that John Daly would succeed Bob Ivell as Senior Independent 
Director and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee with 
effect from the AGM in January 2016. During the year, the 
Committee were successful in finding a successor for Silvia 
Lagnado, Non-Executive Director, through the appointment of 
Euan Sutherland and Sue Clark as an additional independent 
Non-Executive Director to ensure that it maintains the appropriate 
balance of independent versus non-independent representation 
on the board. The Committee recommended that Euan 
Sutherland join the Audit Committee and Sue Clark joined the 
Remuneration Committee. 
The Committee also made a recommendation to the board 
which resulted in the appointment of Hessel de Jong as 
successor to Simon Stewart, International Managing Director.
In terms of succession planning for the Chairman’s role, 
recognising that the Board has undergone a number of changes 
during the year with the appointment of a new Chief Financial 
Officer, a new Senior Independent Director and two new 
non-executive directors, it is widely recognised as good practice 
to avoid sequencing of changes of key roles on the Board. 
Therefore, the Chairman has agreed to remain until the current 
composition is settled. To ensure stability in leadership, on-going 
discussions have taken place during the year to understand the 
most appropriate time for departure. The formal process to 
search for a successor to replace the Chairman will commence 
during the next financial year (year ending 1 October 2017). 
The Board acknowledges that Ben Gordon will reach his ninth year 
of tenure in January 2018, appropriate succession processes are 
in place and will be discussed during the coming year.
Diversity
The Committee monitors diversity on behalf of the board. At Britvic, 
diversity is a wider topic than simply gender and the board 
recommend to the company that, in order to achieve its future 
growth aspirations, it should remain committed to building a 
pipeline of diverse talent and to regularly review its HR processes, 
including recruitment and performance management frameworks. 
There are a number of women in senior management roles. The 
directors’ view, however, remains that we do not feel in a position 
to publish a target of the percentage of women on the board. 
Further details of the company’s statistics on gender diversity 
may be found on page 25 of the Strategic Report.

177534_BRITVIC_TEXT-p033-088.indd   48 13/12/2016   19:06 Board evaluation
Details of the review of the board and its committees, including 
this committee and the effectiveness of the Chairman, 
undertaken during the year can be found on page 46.
Having reviewed the results of the evaluation, the Committee has 
confirmed to the board that the present board and its committees 
continue to operate effectively and that all of the Non-Executive 
Directors remained independent, with the exception of Joanne 
Averiss (PepsiCo nominated Director) in accordance with the 
Code and all Directors should stand for re-election (or election  
in the case of Sue Clark and Euan Sutherland) at the AGM. 
Conflicts of interest
As referred to on page 45, the Board operates a formal policy to 
identify and where appropriate, manage any potential conflicts of 
interest that Directors may have. It is the role of the Committee to 
monitor the situation and determine actions to address any 
potential or actual conflicts that may arise. 
Shareholder Engagement
Investor Relations
The board is committed to maintaining good communications 
with shareholders. Senior executives, including the Chairman, 
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have regular 
dialogue with individual institutional shareholders in order to develop 
an understanding of their views which is then discussed with the 
board. All directors are offered the opportunity to meet with major 
shareholders to listen to their views and, in addition to a monthly 
report prepared by the Chief Financial Officer, receive regular 
reports prepared by an independent capital markets advisory firm 
which provides comprehensive information relating to the 
company’s major shareholders.
Presentations are made to analysts, investors and prospective 
investors covering the annual and interim results and the company 
seeks to maintain a dialogue with the various bodies which monitor 
the company’ s governance policies and procedures. The Strategic 
Report set out on pages 19 to 31 details the financial performance 
of the company as well as setting out the risks it faces. 
Private Investors
We are keen to hear the views of our private shareholders and 
we encourage them to use our shareholder mailbox (investors@
britvic.com) for detailed inquiries and to access our website for 
our company reports and business information. Specific inquiries 
to the Company Secretary may be sent to the Secretariat 
mailbox (company.secretariat@britvic.com) or sent to the 
registered office.
At the AGM, the Chief Executive Officer gives a regular update 
on the positioning and outlook for the business. Shareholders are 
invited to ask questions formally during the meeting and to follow 
up these discussions with directors on a one-to-one basis 
afterwards. The chairmen of the board committees and the 
Senior Independent Director are present and available to respond 
to questions at the AGM. We look forward to welcoming all our 
shareholders to our 2017 AGM in January and to updating them 
on our business developments.

177534_BRITVIC_TEXT-p033-088.indd   49 13/12/2016   19:06 On behalf of the Audit Committee, 
I am pleased to present its report for 
the year ended 2 October 2016. It has 
been another busy year for the 
Committee and the purpose of this 
report is to describe how the 
Committee has carried out its 
responsibilities during the year. 
During the year, we welcomed Euan Sutherland as a member of 
the Committee and he is already proving to be a valued member. 
As disclosed in the 2015 annual report, we indicated that we 
intended to carry out a tender for external audit services. Following 
a robust and comprehensive process, we concluded that it was 
in the best interests’ of the company to retain Ernst & Young LLP , 
our incumbent auditors, subject to approval at the AGM in 2017. 
Further details of the process and our approach to the tender 
can be found on page 55.
Following changes to The UK Corporate Governance Code in 
2014 (the ‘Code’), the Board is now required to include a statement 
on the group’s longer term viability. We have played a supporting 
role in enabling the Board to have confidence in making this 
statement through preparing and assessing key assumptions 
and sensitivities. In addition, the Committee has placed further 
emphasis on our assessment of principal risks facing the company 
including our controls for mitigating these risks and how effective 
these controls are. 
We continue to consider and challenge the integrity of the group’ s 
financial statements, significant areas of judgement and other 
relevant financial information as appropriate. 
The Committee confirms that during the year the group has 
complied with the provisions of the Statutory Audit Services for 
Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of 
Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014, as published by the UK 
Competition and Markets Authority.
Role of the Committee
The Committee’s role is to ensure appropriate oversight and 
review of the presentation and integrity of the financial reporting 
and statements, internal control and risk management, internal 
audit programmes, changes in regulatory requirements, and the 
independence and appointment of external auditors. The terms 
of reference for the Audit Committee can be found on our 
website at http://britvic.com/investors/corporate-governance/
corporate-governance.
To enable the Committee to discharge its responsibilities, 
discussions on a broad range of topics and reports were held 
with management, internal audit and the external auditors 
throughout the year. This provided us with insight into the 
progress towards the company’s strategic goals and the 
challenges and risks and how they are being managed. The 
activities of the Committee can be found below on page 52.
The Committee has an open dialogue throughout the year with 
the Director of Audit and Risk and the external auditors to raise 
challenges and questions to support understanding whilst 
sharing experience and an independent perspective.

The most significant matters discussed over the course of the 
year are described in the report below. 
Responsibilities
• Reviewing the financial results announcements and financial 
statements and any significant financial reporting issues and 
judgements which they may contain;
• Advising the board on whether the annual report and 
accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and 
understandable and provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the group’s performance, business 
model and strategy;
• Ensuring compliance with applicable accounting standards 
and reviewing the appropriateness of accounting policies and 
practices in place;
• Assessing the adequacy of the internal control environment 
and the processes in place to monitor this, including reviewing 
the activities and performance of the internal audit team;
• Reviewing risk management processes and considering the 
adequacy of the actions being taken to identify risks and 
reduce the exposure of the group to those risks;
• Overseeing the relationship with the external auditors, 
reviewing their activities and performance and advising the 
board on their appointment and remuneration; including an 
assessment of their effectiveness, independence and 
objectivity;
• Review of the effectiveness of the Committee as required 
under the Code; and
• Ensuring appropriate safeguards are in place for individuals to raise 
issues with the board where a breach of conduct or compliance, 
including any financial reporting irregularity, is suspected.
Meetings and Composition of the Committee
The Committee comprises independent Non-Executive Directors, 
John Daly, Ben Gordon, Euan Sutherland and the Chairman of 
the Committee is Ian McHoul. The board is satisfied that Ian has 
recent and relevant financial experience as required by the Code. 
The Committee meets three times a year; in November and May 
to review the annual report and accounts and interim report 
respectively and to consider the external audit findings, and in 
September to review the activities of the previous year, the plan 
for the year ahead and to consider any emerging issues. At each 
meeting the performance and findings of the internal audit team 
are reviewed and the most recent key risks are considered. 
The attendance of the Committee for each meeting during the 
year can be found on page 42. Attendees at each of the 
meetings are the Committee’s members as well as, by invitation, 
the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, Director of 
Finance Controls & Governance, the General Counsel, the 
Director of Audit and Risk and the external auditor, Ernst and 
Young LLP . 
Each meeting allows time for the Committee to speak with key 
people without the presence of the others, in particular the 
external auditor and the Director of Audit and Risk.
Main activities during the year 
The Committee supports the board in carrying out its responsibilities 
in relation to financial reporting, risk management and assessing 
internal controls. It also reviews the effectiveness of the group’s 
internal audit function and manages the relationship with the external 
auditor. The Committee ensures that the group has appropriate 
provision for confidential and impartial whistleblowing process in 
line with good practice. 
Committee meetings usually take place prior to a board meeting. 
The Chairman of the Committee subsequently reports on the activities 
of the Committee and matters of particular relevance to 
the board.

Fair, balanced and understandable assessment 
At the request of the board, the Committee considered whether the 2016 annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy. To enable the board to have confidence in making this statement, the Committee 
considered the elements in the table below: 
FAIR BALANCED UNDERSTANDABLE
Is the whole story being presented? 
Has any sensitive material been omitted 
that should have been included?
Is there a good level of consistency 
between the narrative in the front half 
and the financial reporting in the back 
of the report?
Is there a clear and understandable 
framework to the report?
Are the key messages in the narrative 
reflected in the financial reporting?

Governance Audit Committee continued
177534_BRITVIC_TEXT-p033-088.indd   52 13/12/2016   19:06 To form its opinion, the Committee reflected on the information 
and reporting it received from management and the external auditor 
and the discussions that took place during the year. Key 
considerations for the Committee in 2016 include the following:
• The financial statements comply with all applicable financial 
reporting standards and any other required regulations;
• Material areas of significant judgement have been given due 
consideration by management and reviewed with external 
auditors;
• The application of acceptable accounting policies and 
practices is consistent across the group; 
• The disclosures provided are clear, and as required by financial 
reporting standards;
• Reporting and commentary provides a fair and balanced view 
of group performance; and   
• Any correspondence from regulators received in relation to our 
financial reporting are considered and disclosures are updated 
if required.
T o ensure these considerations are met, reviews take place based 
on information provided by the Chief Financial Officer and his 
team at each Committee meeting as well as reports from the 
external auditor based on the outcomes of their half year review 
and annual audit. 
Financial statements and significant issues
Significant financial and reporting issues considered by the Committee in relation to the 2016 financial statements, and how these 
were addressed are as follows:
Revenue  
recognition
There has been no change in the group approach to revenue recognition in 2016, however  
it remains a key area of focus. The control, accounting and accuracy of long term discounts, 
promotional discounts and account development funds is reviewed throughout the year to ensure  
it remains consistent and IFRS compliant. 
Developments in the market have also been discussed with the Committee, where continued 
challenging conditions increase the focus of our customers on rebates and promotional spend.  
The impact of this is continually monitored by management and reviewed with the external auditor  
to ensure that policy and practice remains consistent across the group, with robust controls in place. 
Valuation of goodwill and 
indefinite lived assets
The review of goodwill and intangible assets is based on a calculation of value in use, using cash  
flow projections based on market measures and financial budgets prepared by senior management 
and approved by the board of directors. The assessment models were reviewed as part of the 
audit, for which the external auditor, provided reporting to the Committee. 
The Committee has also considered management reports on potential triggers of impairment and  
the outcome of sensitivity testing for all areas of the group including France, Ireland and Brazil and 
also the potential reversal of prior year impairments.
Despite the impact of Brexit and uncertain macro economic conditions in Brazil, the Committee was 
satisfied that there is no requirement or impairment or reversal of impairments made in prior years.
Acquisition accounting Following the acquisition of Ebba in 2016, management has calculated the purchase price allocation 
and resulting goodwill to be accounted for in the group accounts. The Committee has reviewed 
and approved the approach to these calculations, including areas of judgement and potential risks.
In addition, the Committee has discussed the integration approach, progress and associated one-
off costs and is satisfied that the plans, execution and outcome are proportionate to the investment  
and risk associated with the acquisition.
Exceptional & other items The classification of exceptional items is defined by a group accounting policy, as approved by the 
Committee, and includes items of significant income and expense which due to their size, nature 
or frequency merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better the elements 
of financial performance in the year. Management have reviewed items to be included with the 
Committee throughout the year to confirm appropriateness.
Derivative and hedging 
activities
The group has derivative instruments to which hedge accounting is applied and which swap  
principal and interest of US Private Placement notes. The Committee reviewed reporting on 
comparisons of valuations to external confirmations and assessment of hedge effectiveness  
to be satisfied with the quality of financial statement disclosures.
Taxation Any uncertain tax positions within the group were reviewed to ensure that the balance sheet 
provisions are appropriate and the group effective tax rate is calculated appropriately.
Defined benefit pension 
scheme valuation
The Committee reviewed benchmarks and assumptions that are provided by the group’s actuaries 
and used to value the pension liabilities for the four defined benefit schemes. The underlying 
assumptions based on market conditions and the characteristics of the schemes are reviewed by 
management and the external auditors and conclusions reported to the Committee.
The triennial valuation of the GB scheme as at 31 March 2016 is currently underway and is  
expected to be complete by 31 March 2017. The Committee has been updated by management  
on current progress and will receive further reporting upon completion of the valuation.
The Committee subsequently recommended to the Board that, taken as a whole, the Company’s 2016 Annual Report is fair, balanced 
and understandable and that it provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.

Governance Audit Committee continued
177534_BRITVIC_TEXT-p033-088.indd   53 13/12/2016   19:06 Internal audit and control
The Internal Audit function carries out work across the Company, 
acting as a third line of defence. In September, the Committee 
agreed the audit plan to be undertaken by the internal audit team 
prior to the start of the year. The audit plan coverage is based on 
risk, strategic priorities and consideration of the strength of the 
control environment. 
The Committee receives a report at each of the meetings and 
reviews the results of the Internal Audit reports, looking in detail 
at any reports where processes and controls require 
improvement or any reports that are particularly pertinent to 
delivery of strategic objectives or priorities. For example, a focus 
of the Internal Audit work was a review of the Ebba acquisition 
which was reported to the Committee. As a result the Committee 
were able to understand the development of the controls 
framework in Ebba. Updates are received on progress made 
against actions agreed from previous audits and an update on 
the overall control environment progress related to previous audit 
areas. 
Additional areas were added to the audit plan as required where 
circumstances gave rise to an increased level of risk and any 
changes to the agreed audit plan were agreed by the Committee. 
Detailed updates on specific areas are provided at the request of 
the Committee. 
Risk management
During the year, the Committee reviewed the Financial Reporting 
Council changes to the Code and considered how these changes 
would impact risk management processes and the work that 
needed to be carried out to enable the Board to make the viability 
statement. The risk management process is reviewed at each 
meeting by the Committee to ensure that it is set up to deliver 
appropriate risk management across the group. A particular 
focus during this year has been on defining the group’s risk 
appetite. This is an expression of the amount and types of risk 
that the group is willing to take to achieve its strategic and 
operational objectives. The Board has agreed these statements 
which are now being used in decision making processes across 
the group to define and validate the mitigating activities required 
to manage our risks. Additionally during the year the risk 
management process was rolled out to Ebba. 
A summary of the key risks and uncertainties to which the 
business is exposed to can be found on pages 28 and 31.
Viability statement
The Committee reviewed management’s work in conducting a 
robust assessment of those risks which could threaten the 
business model and the future viability of the Company was 
carried out. This assessment included identifying severe but 
plausible scenarios for each of our principal risks as well as 
considering interdependencies and scenarios involving multiple 
risks. Additionally, reverse stress testing was carried out, allowing 
the Committee to assess the circumstances that would render 
the business unable to pay its liabilities as they fall due. To 
support the final conclusion on viability, the assessment also took 
into account the mitigations available to the Company to protect 
against these downside scenarios. Based on this analysis, the 
Committee recommended to the Board that it could approve and 
make the Viability Statement on page 32. 
Internal control
The board is responsible for reviewing the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the risk management framework and the system 
of internal controls. The board has delegated responsibility for 
this review to the Committee. Management in each business unit 
are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal 
controls. Functions such as finance, legal, procurement and 
quality are responsible for setting out the Company policies to be 
followed by the business units. The Committee, through the Internal 
Audit function reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of internal 
control procedures and identifies any weaknesses and ensures 
these are addressed within agreed timelines. 
The system of internal control has been designed to manage 
rather than eliminate material risks to the achievement of our 
strategic and business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable, and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement of loss. 
The risk management process is reviewed annually by the 
Committee to ensure that it is set up to deliver appropriate risk 
management across the group. The risk management process is 
continually improving, in particular in relation to embedding 
across new and developing areas of the business. The Committee 
believe that the improvements will continue to strengthen the way 
that the business understands and manages risk. 
External audit 
There are a number of areas that the Committee considers in 
relation to the external auditors; their performance in discharging 
the audit and the interim review, their independence and objectivity, 
and their reappointment and remuneration. The Chairman of the 
Committee has regular contact with the external audit partner 
outside of Committee meetings and without the management  
of the business present. 
The external auditors, Ernst & Young LLP (EY), provided the 
Committee with their plan for undertaking the year end audit 
which highlighted the proposed approach and scope of the audit 
for the coming year and identified the key areas of audit risk, 
including the audit approach for these areas. These key areas 
were primarily identified as areas of judgement and complexity 
and included accounting for discounts, acquisition accounting for 
Ebba, exceptional items classification, the carrying value of 
goodwill and indefinite lived assets, the accounting for the 
group’s derivatives and hedging activities, revenue recognition 
and the valuation of the defined benefit pension scheme. The 
Committee reviewed and appropriately challenged the basis for 
these before agreeing the proposed approach and scope of the 
external audit. 
The external auditors prepared a detailed report of their audit 
findings at the year end, which they took the Committee through 
at the meeting in November. The findings were reviewed and 
discussed in detail by the Committee, particularly in relation to 
the areas highlighted above. A similar review of the external 
auditors’ report of their findings at the half year review is undertaken 
by the Committee. As part of this review the Committee 
questioned and challenged the work undertaken, the findings 
and the key assumptions made, with particular attention to the 
areas of audit risk identified.
54    Britvic plc Annual Report 2016
Governance Audit Committee continued A description of the process undertaken is depicted below: 
Independence and reappointment 
The Committee reviews the independence of the auditors 
throughout the year. The external auditor is required rotate the 
lead audit partner every five years. The current lead auditor 
partner began his tenure for the financial year ended 30 September 
2013. Based on the Committee’s recommendation, the board is 
proposing that EY be reappointed to office at the AGM in January 
2017. 
Non-audit fees
The group has a policy regarding the provision of non-audit 
services by the external auditors which has been reviewed during 
the year to take into consideration new regulations on non-audit 
services. Any non-audit services provided must be pre-approved 
by the Committee unless the activity will have a total value of less 
than £5,000 and falls within the allowed services defined by FRC 
guidance. 
Control over total non-audit fees is also exercised by reviewing 
spend on all activities proposed or provided by the external 
auditor and we can confirm that we are significantly below a 1:1 
ratio in this financial year as disclosed in note 7 in the reports and 
accounts, and well within the FRC guidance of 70% cap that will 
be required from 2019. 
Ian McHoul 
Chairman, Audit Committee
Tender for external audit services
During the year, the Committee had oversight and responsibility 
for carrying out the tender for external audit services. The process 
spanned two phases, during which each firm was provided equal 
opportunity to engage with management and the Committee and 
to review relevant company information. A total of four firms, 
including the incumbent auditors, were invited to participate in 
the tender. During the first phase, key decision criteria were 
agreed and included; partner fit, senior audit team capability, 
relevant understanding of the company, commercial insight, 
service history, transition approach and fees. 
After a number of meetings with management, written proposals 
were submitted by each firm followed by presentations to the 
Committee. The Committee considered these proposals and 
presentations and came to a recommendation, which was 
proposed to the board. Following due consideration by the 
board, the proposal was approved and a sub-committee was 
established to agree the final outcome. The sub-committee 
unanimously agreed that EY be re-appointed as the company’s 
auditors having taken into account each of the decision criteria 
and quality of presentations, subject to shareholder approval at 
the AGM.

Annual Statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Bob Ivell for 
leading the Committee prior to my appointment earlier in the 
year and the other members for welcoming me into my new 
role. I am also pleased to welcome Sue Clark who, as a new 
member of the Committee, brings with her a wealth of business 
experience. I would also like to take this opportunity to say how 
pleased the Committee was to continue to receive a very positive 
response at the January 2016 AGM with 98.9% votes “For” the 
annual report on remuneration. The Committee remains very 
mindful of the current focus on executive pay and its implications 
across all our stakeholders and so I trust the actions taken 
over the course of the year and disclosed below reﬂ ect that 
this responsibility is very much at the forefront of the 
Committee’s decision making.
The contents of this annual statement provide an overview 
of the remuneration outcomes for the period ending on 
2 October 2016 and a summary of the business context 
in which those outcomes have been determined.
The remainder of the report sets out:
• An ‘at a glance’ summary of the remuneration outcomes for 
2015/16 and an overview of how the Remuneration Policy for 
directors will be implemented in 2016/17. Page 61

Executive Director changes
John Gibney stepped down from the board on 27 January 2016 
and retired from the company on 5 April 2016. I am delighted to 
welcome Mathew Dunn as his successor. Details of John’s 
remuneration for the year are set out in this remuneration report. 
I can confi rm that the treatment of his remuneration on departure 
is in line with the approved Remuneration policy. John has not 
received any discretionary payments or payment in lieu of notice 
in respect of his retirement from the company.
Full details of Mathew Dunn’ s remuneration package were disclosed 
in last year’s remuneration report. I can reconfi rm that Mathew’s 
remuneration is in line with the approved Remuneration Policy and 
Mathew did not receive any buy out awards or one off awards on 
his recruitment to the company. The company did provide 
Mathew with some support to assist in his relocation from South 
Africa to the UK. The intention to do this was disclosed last year 
and the details are set out in the following pages.
Business performance and remuneration 
outcomes for the year
Whilst the business has faced challenges over the last fi nancial 
year the overall performance for the three years ending in 
October 2016 has been strong. This has resulted in:
• Annual bonus pay outs for Executive Directors at 80.6% of the 
maximum opportunity due to strong performance across all 
three fi nancial measures during the year;
• The performance share plan awarded in 2013 will vest at 65.8% 
of the maximum opportunity refl ecting sustained long-term 
ROIC and relative TSR performance over the last three years.
• The executive share option plan awarded in 2013 will vest at 
100% of the maximum opportunity due to strong EPS growth 
over the performance period. However due to the recent share 
price volatility these vested options currently have no value as the 
exercise price is higher than the share price as at the year end. 
In line with the remuneration reporting regulations, details of the 
performance targets and actual achievement against these are 
set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
In my ﬁ rst year as Remuneration Committee Chairman I am pleased to 
present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ending 2 October 
2016 which has been another strong year for Britvic despite the continuing 
sector and economic challenges in our core markets. 
59 Britvic plc Annual Report 2016
Governance Looking ahead to 2016/17
Our shareholders will be aware that the current and forward 
looking customer environment and price deflation in our core 
markets present potential challenges to the business. In addition, 
we are now dealing with greater economic uncertainty and 
unfavourable exchange rate movements following the EU 
referendum outcome as well as the UK government’s proposed 
sugar tax. In this context and in recognition that salary increases 
awarded to the wider workforce have been moderated, the 
Committee have determined that no salary increases should be 
awarded to the Executive Directors. 
In the annual bonus the Committee has introduced an additional 
component within the overall 30% revenue weighting. Net 
revenue from innovation will have a 10% weight in the annual 
bonus for 2016/17 and will sit alongside the total net revenue 
measure with a 20% weighting. This is to reflect that net revenue 
from innovation is an increasing focus for the business and so the 
Committee considered it appropriate to include it as a 
component of the annual bonus. The targets set and the 
achievement against them for the 2016/17 annual bonus 
measures will be disclosed in next year’s remuneration report. 
The Committee is also mindful that our medium term growth 
expectations and consensus estimates for the business have 
materially reduced since the range was last reviewed in 2014 
where the business was in a different economic phase. The 
Committee, therefore embarked on a consultation exercise in the 
second half of the year with many of our major investors to 
discuss a new range that would ensure that the LTIP awards to 
be made in respect of 2016/17 remain stretching in this new 
economic context and at the same time provide an effective and 
realistic incentive for executive directors and the wider senior 
leadership team. On behalf of the Committee I would like to 
thank those shareholders who participated and I can confirm that 
a new three-year EPS range of 3% to 8% per annum growth will 
apply to the LTIP awards in respect of 2016/17, (see page 68 for 
full details). For clarity no changes are being made to the target 
ranges for existing LTIP awards. 
Shareholder engagement and Remuneration 
policy review in summer 2017
2016/17 will be the final year of the current Remuneration Policy 
that was approved by our shareholders at the January 2015 
AGM. During the coming year the Committee will conduct a 
holistic review of the Remuneration Policy and consider what the 
structure of executive pay should be for the next policy cycle. 
The objective of the review will be to consider all the internal, 
external and wider stakeholder considerations including the 
implications from the various executive remuneration guidance 
changes anticipated over the next few months and the 
corresponding evolving best practice. In particular, the 
Committee is mindful of the recently released Investment 
Association guidelines including the recommendations made on 
the disclosure of pay ratios. I will be in contact again with our 
larger shareholders over the course of 2017 to listen to your 
views and feedback ahead of the 2018 AGM where a new 
Remuneration Policy will be presented for shareholder approval. 
In the meantime, I look forward to receiving your support on the 
Annual Report on Remuneration at the January 2017 AGM. 
Should you have any questions relating to our approach to 
executive remuneration, please feel free to contact me at

Governance Directors’ remuneration report continued Remuneration – at a glance
This section summarises the remuneration outcomes for the 2015/16 year, including how the Remuneration Policy has been 
implemented during the year and the link between remuneration and our strategy.
Our remuneration principles
Our Remuneration Policy is designed to support our overall vision to become the most dynamic, creative and admired soft drinks 
company in the world. At the heart of our vision is our people which the company is required to attract, engage and retain from across 
our global sector. Our remuneration arrangements, therefore, are simply comprised of the two pay components – Fixed and Variable 
pay. Within each of these components the following arrangements above exist.
To determine the shape, size and variability of each element of pay the Committee follow fi ve key remuneration principles:
Competitive market 
positioning and 
opportunity
To attract, retain and engage the executive talent we need to realise our vision and deliver our 
strategy our remuneration arrangements need to be suffi ciently competitive but not excessive.
Pay aligned with 
sustainable long-term 
performance
The mix between both fi xed and variable pay as well as the balance between rewarding short 
versus long-term performance are critical to ensure they are correctly balanced and reward those 
behaviours that will lead to the realisation of our long-term vision without compromise for short-
term gain. In addition, all forms of variable pay are only fully delivered in return for performance 
materially above the standards required by Britvic and our shareholders – in other words the 
superior pay opportunity available can only be realised in return for superior performance.
Incentive metrics aligned 
with our strategy
The performance measures selected to determine both our annual bonus and long-term incentive 
plans have been carefully considered to focus on a simple and effective selection of those key 
drivers of our strategy and long-term value creation for our shareholders, (see below).
Alignment of executive 
and shareholder interests
To ensure the continued alignment of executive and shareholder interests, the greatest potential 
pay opportunity for executives is via our long-term incentive plans. Awards are based in shares 
and are dependent on a balance of absolute and relative growth in long-term value creation 
for shareholders. In particular, the mix of share options and performance shares is designed to 
ensure that executives are only rewarded for superior market performance and the realisation of 
our vision. This is further reinforced by meaningful shareholding guidelines for executives so that 
their long-term wealth remains tied to Britvic’s sustained long-term success.
Mindful of our 
wider stakeholder 
responsibilities 
In support of our vision our Executive Directors’ pay arrangement are not only focused on 
fi nancial returns but also mindful of performance against our wider long-term stakeholder goals. 
The Committee takes great care to set appropriate targets that do not compromise our wider 
stakeholder aspirations. Both malus and claw-back provisions are in place to address potential 
inappropriate actions or risk taking when determining incentive plan pay outs.

Summary of implementation of the Remuneration Policy for 2016/17
The implementation of the Remuneration Policy for 2016/17 is based on 4 key pillars of our strategy:
COMMUNITY
Outside of bonus, our senior 
leaders have individual  
objectives designed to  
support trust and respect  
in the community 
EPS GROWTH
Sustainable long-term earnings 
per share (EPS) growth is 
aligned with long-term value 
creation for our shareholders.
The PSP also has a ROIC  
underpin to ensure long-term 
returns are value enhancing
TSR GROWTH
Long term share price and  
dividend growth that determine 
T otal Shareholder Returns (TSR)  
are heavily dependent on  
consistent long-term EPS  
growth performance. 
PROFIT 
Growing the profits our 
core businesses allows us to 
invest in our various longer 
term growth initiatives. For 
bonus purposes we use 
Profit Before Tax (PBT )

John Gibney’s pay on retirement 
John Gibney stepped down from the board on 27 January 2016 
and retired from the company on 5 April 2016. John was paid up 
to his date of departure. John received a pro-rated bonus in 
respect of 2015/16 and his outstanding awards under the ESOP 
and PSP will vest at the normal vesting date on a pro-rated 
basis, subject to the achievement of the relevant performance 
conditions. John did not receive a 2015/16 ESOP or PSP award 
due to his departure, nor did he receive a salary increase on 1 
January 2016. John had a deferred pension under the defined 
benefit pension and also the Britvic Executive Top Up Scheme 
(BETUS), the company’s unfunded retirement benefits scheme. 
Both of these were closed to future accrual on 10 April 2011. 
John became entitled to payments from the deferred pension 
from his date of retirement and elected to cash out of the BETUS 
in exchange for any future pension entitlement under this 
scheme. No additional payments were made to John as a result 
of his departure. 
Full details of John’s pay prior to him stepping down from the 
Board are set out in the Single Total Figure of Remuneration. 
Details of payments for the period from him stepping down from 
the Board up to his retirement, including pension payments, are 
set out in the Payments to Past Directors disclosure on page 74.
Mathew Dunn’s pay on appointment 
Mathew Dunn was appointed to the position of CFO on 25 
November 2015. Mathew’s pay is in line with the Remuneration 
Policy. As part of his recruitment, Mathew received a relocation 
allowance with a net value of £56,148 (which was within the 
maximum net allowance of £70,000) to assist in his move from 
South Africa to the UK as previously communicated in the RNS 
announcement. No other payments were made to Mathew on 
his recruitment to compensate for awards forgone from his 
previous employer or otherwise. 
Whilst no salary increase is to be awarded to Mathew Dunn in 
January 2017, the Committee has previously stated in last year’s 
Directors’ Remuneration Report that Mathew may receive a 
salary increase higher than that of the wider employee population 
in the first 3 years following appointment subject to performance.

Illustration of the application of Remuneration Policy
As described in the remuneration principles section on page 61 the 
Committee believes that our executive remuneration packages should 
provide a significant part of total potential pay based on performance. 
Set out below are the potential total pay outcomes for both Executive 
Directors across three alternative performance scenarios under the current 
Remuneration Policy. The three scenarios are minimum, on-target and 
maximum performance, respectively. For simplicity, the illustrations below  
are calculated before any change in share price and roll-up of dividends.

 The chart has been prepared using the following assumptions:
1)  Base salaries as at 1 January 2017
2)  Benefits reflect those estimated to be paid in 2016/17
3)  Target bonus is calculated at 50% of maximum opportunity 
4)   Target vesting for the PSP is 60%, being the mid-point between 
threshold and maximum vesting level 
5)   Options awarded under the ESOP are valued on the standard 
market value for options of 30% of the face value of award. A 
target vesting of 60% values the ESOP award at 18% of the 
maximum value

177534_BRITVIC_TEXT-p033-088.indd   65 13/12/2016   19:06 Implementation of the remuneration policy for other employees
The implementation of the Remuneration Policy described above applies specifically to Executive Directors. Where possible, principles 
set out in the policy have been applied to all employees to achieve alignment as per the below table:
Element Application of policy for other employees
Base salary Paid in cash and reviewed annually, normally taking effect 1 January. Salaries are set with reference to 
internal pay levels, as well as local market competitiveness compared to roles of a similar nature and 
size of responsibility.
Benefits Britvic provide local market typical benefits focused on employee health and wellbeing. The majority 
of employees participate in the company’s flexible benefits plan.
Pension Subject to local market practice and regulations. 
GB employees have rights under the GB legacy defined benefit pension arrangement which is now 
closed to future accrual (the plan was closed to executives at the same time). A defined contribution 
pension was introduced following the closure of the defined benefit pension in which UK employees 
are entitled to participate in.
Annual bonus Approximately 250 leaders and senior managers participate in bonus arrangements with measures 
aligned to that of the executive directors. Typically, all other employees are eligible to receive a bonus 
linked to profit and revenue of the company as well as their individual performance.
Long term  
incentives
The performance share plan is awarded to approximately 90 leaders globally each year. Approximately 
15 leaders also receive options under the executive share option plan. Performance conditions for both 
awards are linked to those of the executive directors.
All employee  
share plans
Where possible, we offer employees annual free share awards linked to company performance as well 
as the opportunity to purchase Britvic shares. In some locations, alternative profit sharing arrangements 
are available, depending on local market practices and legislation.
The value of each element the employee may receive will vary according to the employee’s seniority and level of responsibility.

PwC were appointed as advisors to the Committee in August 
2014. The company is also advised by PwC on other 
remuneration-related items and provided consulting support on 
non-remuneration related issues. PwC is a member of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group (the professional body for 
executive remuneration consultants). PwC’s fees in respect of 
advice to the Committee in the year under review were £40,100 
and were charged on the basis of that firm’s standard terms of 
business for advice provided.
The Committee also received advice from Willis Towers Watson 
during the year the fees for which were £12,000 and were 
charged on the basis of that firm’s standard terms of business  
for advice provided. Willis Towers Watson also provide support to 
the company on other remuneration-related items.
During the year, Addleshaw Goddard LLP were also engaged by 
the Committee to provide legal advice on contractual 
arrangements and share schemes.
Unless otherwise stated, these advisors have no other 
connection with the company and the Committee, based on its 
experience, is satisfied that the advice it received from these 
organisations was objective and independent. 
 
Statement of implementation of Remuneration Policy in the following year
The Remuneration Policy approved at the January 2015 AGM 
will continue to be implemented from the commencement 
of the new financial year (2016/17) as follows:
Base salary
In recognition of the increasingly challenging economic and 
commercial environment ahead in 2016/17, the Committee 
determined that no salary increases should be awarded to the 
CEO and CFO in January 2017. 
2016  
base salary
£’000
2017  
base salary
£’000
Increase
Simon Litherland 600.0 600.0 0%
Mathew Dunn 340.0 340.0 0%
Benefits and pension
Implemented in line with policy.
Annual Bonus 
Implemented in line with policy. The bonus measures¹ and 
weightings for 2016/17 are: 
• Profit before tax and amortisation (50%)
• Total Net Revenue (20%)
• Net Revenue from Innovation (10%)
• Underlying free cash flow (20%)
Target award amounts for the CEO and CFO are 70% and 60% 
of base salary and maximum award values are 140% and 120% 
of base salary, respectively. 
The Committee has introduced an additional metric into the 
annual bonus for 2016/17 - net revenue from innovation. This will 
have a 10% weight in the annual bonus and will sit alongside the 
total net revenue measure with a 20% weighting. This is to reflect 
the long-term importance of innovation to the growth strategy of 
the company and so an increasing focus for 2016/17 was 
considered appropriate by the Committee. 
The Committee is of the view that the performance targets under 
the bonus plan are commercially sensitive and that it would be 
detrimental to the interests of the company to disclose them 
before the start of the financial year. Disclosure of targets in 
advance could lead the company to be at a disadvantage as 
many competitors are not subject to the same levels of 
disclosure. Targets and the performance against them will be 
disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report following the 
end of the financial year.
Note: 
1.    Performance measures defined as follows: 
Profit Before Tax and amortisation (PBTA) - measured before exceptional 
and other items on a budget currency basis
  Total Net Revenue and Net Revenue from Innovation - measured on a 
constant currency basis.
  Underlying free cash flow - measured excluding movements in borrowings, 
dividend payments, exceptional and other items.
Long-term incentive plans (PSP and ESOP)
As set out in the Chairman’s letter at the front of this report, the 
current and forward looking customer environment and price 
deflation in our core markets present potential challenges to the 
business. In addition we are now dealing with greater uncertainty 
and unfavourable exchange rate movements following the EU 
referendum outcome. The result of this is that growth 
expectations and consensus estimates for the business have 
reduced such that the established EPS target range would be 
unrealistic to achieve. The Committee, therefore, wants to ensure 
that the LTIP remains incentivising and relevant to the executive 
directors whilst at the same time sufficiently stretching and 
aligned with shareholder interests. During the second half of the 
year the Committee consulted with a number of the company’s 
larger shareholders to agree a new EPS target range for the LTIP 
awards in 2016/17. This consultation exercise concluded with a 
decision to adopt a new three-year EPS range for LTIP awards 
made in 2016/17 of 3% to 8% per annum growth and a 
commitment to undertake a holistic review of Remuneration 
Policy in the summer of 2017.

1 The values shown for John Gibney are in respect of services as an executive director up to him stepping off the board on 27 January 2016.
Simon Litherland’s, Mathew Dunn’s, and John Gibney’s normal retirement age is 60. Mathew Dunn receives a contribution to the 
Defined Contribution section of the Britvic Pension Plan up to the HMRC annual allowance each tax year. The balance of his 
entitlement is paid as a cash allowance.
The cash allowance payable to the executives:
• Reflects contributions the company would have made to the defined contribution section of the Plan had these individuals elected 
to join, less a deduction to ensure the cash allowance is cost neutral to the company from a National Insurance perspective. 
• Was paid at a rate of 24.6% of pensionable pay (base salary only) for Simon Litherland, 22.0% of pensionable pay (base salary only) 
for John Gibney and 4.7% for Mathew Dunn.
John Gibney had a deferred pension in the defined benefit section of the Plan and was a member of the Britvic Executive Top Up 
Scheme (‘BETUS’), the company’s unfunded retirement benefits scheme.
Both the Plan and BETUS were closed to future accrual on 10 April 2011. 
On his retirement, John commenced receipt of his deferred pension. John received a cash lump sum of £375,000 and is entitled to an 
annual pension payable for life of £139,363. John elected to cash out of BETUS and received a cash sum of £1,055,848 in exchange 
for any further entitlement under BETUS.

Notes:
1. The EPS outcome is calculated excluding the impact of the share placement and ebba acquisition in July 2015 as the award was made prior to this occurring. 
2. Mathew Dunn joined the Company on 25 November 2015 and therefore was not granted a 2013 LTIP award. 
3. John Gibney retired on 5 April 2016. John’s ESOP and PSP will vest at the normal vesting date on a pro-rated basis to reflect his service up to the point of 
retirement. As vesting occurs after his retirement date, the value of his LTIP is declared in the ‘payments to past directors’ section on page 74.
4. The combined PSP and ESOP vesting values were estimated at £342,235 for Simon Litherland and £192,906 for John Gibney.
5. A share price estimate of £6.30 was used to calculate the value of the above awards which is based on the average share price over the last quarter of the 
financial year.
6. The relative TSR comparator group is made up of the following 18 companies; AG Barr plc, Associated British Foods, C&C Group, Dairy Crest, Diageo, Fuller 
Smith & Turner, Glanbia, Greencore, Greene King, Marston’s, Nichols, Origin Enterprises, Premier Foods, Reckitt Benckiser, SABMiller, Smith & Nephew, Tate and

Directors’ shareholding requirements and interests in shares (subject to audit)
The table below sets out the shareholding of directors and connected persons and requirements as at 2 October 2016. A 
shareholding requirement of 200% of salary for the CEO and 100% for the CFO applies. The CEO was appointed to role in February 
2013 and currently has a shareholding of 120% of salary. The CFO was appointed to role on 25 November 2015 and currently has a 
shareholding of 0% of salary. Under the shareholding requirement arrangement both executive directors may not sell any vested 
shares from the company LTIPs (except to settle taxes and the payment of exercise prices or following approval by the Committee) 
until their shareholding requirement has been satisfied.

compared with the percentage change in the weighted average of each of those components for all full-time equivalent employees 
based in Great Britain (GB). The GB employee workforce was chosen as a suitable comparator group as the CEO is based in GB 
(albeit with a global role and responsibilities) and pay changes across the Group vary widely depending on local market conditions.
In recognition of the increasingly challenging economic commercial environment in which the business operates no salary increases 
will be awarded to the CEO and CFO for 2016/2017.

Base Salary 
Element of fixed pay that reflects the 
individual’s role, position, experience and 
contribution to the group.
Base salaries are paid in cash and reviewed annually, with any changes normally 
taking effect from 1 January.
Out of cycle reviews may be conducted if considered appropriate by the Committee.
Base salaries are set with reference to comparator groups made up of similar sized 
UK listed companies (both pan-sector and from the food and beverages sector).
The Committee also has reference to international food and beverages companies.
Alternative peer groups may be considered depending on the location and domicile 
of Directors based outside of the UK.
Whilst there is no prescribed formulaic maximum, annual increases will normally be 
in the context of overall business performance and the level awarded to the general 
GB-based workforce.
Higher increases may be made where there have been significant changes in the 
responsibility and accountability in a role, where there are large
variances to the market, for example in the case of a new Executive Director 
appointed on a salary below the market median, or where there is a significant 
change in the relationship of the company relative to the peer group. Any significant 
increases will be fully explained.
n/a
Benefits
To provide market typical benefits which 
are valued by recipients and allow 
Executives to carry out their duties 
efficiently.
Benefits and allowances include but are not limited to: annual car benefit (or 
allowance), membership of the company’s private medical healthcare plan, and the 
ability to ‘buy’ or ’sell’ holiday under the company’s flexible benefits plan, payment of 
up to two subscriptions to recognised professional bodies, and life assurance.
There is also a relocation policy which provides for reasonable expenses to be paid 
subject to the Committee’s approval.
Other benefits may be provided from time to time if considered reasonable and 
appropriate by the Committee and will be explained in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration for the relevant year.
The maximum levels of benefit provision are:
• Provision of a company car or car allowance paid in cash. The company car rental 
cost would not exceed £10,800 and a cash allowance would not exceed £10,634 
per annum
• Private medical insurance on a private basis
• The value of any professional subscriptions paid by the company may vary but 
would not be excessive
• Life assurance cover of 4 times base salary
The value of any relocation allowance provided is dependent on the relevant 
circumstances when the need arises. However the Committee would not pay more 
than necessary in such situations. 
Up to 5 days holiday may be sold at a prorated value of the individual’s salary.
n/a
Pension
Supports a market aligned compensation 
package and assists participants plan for 
retirement.
Pension provision is provided in the form of a defined contribution (DC) pension or 
a cash allowance where the individual opts out of the pension scheme as a result of 
exceeding the tax efficient pension savings limits set by HMRC.
A legacy defined benefit pension and Executive Top Up Scheme (BETUS), a 
securitised unfunded unregistered pension scheme, closed to future accrual on 
10 April 2011. Current Executive Directors have accrued benefits under these 
arrangements.
For the defined contribution pension, the maximum annual contribution is:
• 28% of base salary for the CEO
• 25% of base salary for the CFO
For the cash allowance, the maximum contributions reflect those under the DC 
pension less a deduction to ensure the cash allowance is broadly cost neutral to the 
company from a National Insurance perspective.
A discounted one-off cash settlement of the BETUS may be offered to an eligible 
member of the legacy defined benefit plan who is leaving or retiring from the 
company.

Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy
For reference, the following is an extract from Britvic’ s Remuneration 
Policy approved at the 2015 AGM. The full policy can be found in 
the 2013/14 remuneration report on www.britvic.com. 
There is no intention to revise the policy more frequently than 
every three years. However the Committee will review the 
Remuneration Policy annually in order to ensure it remains 
aligned with the company’s strategy, appropriately positioned 
against the market and aligned with corporate governance 
requirements.
In the event a change to the policy is required, the Committee will 
consult with Britvic’s major shareholders prior to submitting the 
policy for approval by all shareholders.
Please note that because the below is an extract of the 
Remuneration Policy, some of the text relates specifically to the 
2015 financial year. 
Our overall approach to remuneration
The principal objective of our executive Remuneration Policy is to 
support a performance-based culture that will help drive the 
successful execution of our business strategy. We aim to provide 
competitive levels of remuneration opportunity for our senior 
Executives and leadership team, a significant portion of which is 
in the form of variable pay. 
In setting the Remuneration Policy the Committee carefully 
considered corporate governance best practice and the 
company’s environmental and social responsibilities. 
Remuneration Policy table
The table below sets out the Remuneration Policy the Committee 
will continue to apply to Directors in 2017 following its approval 
at the 2015 AGM.

The value of any relocation allowance provided is dependent on the relevant 
circumstances when the need arises. However the Committee would not pay more 
than necessary in such situations. 
Up to 5 days holiday may be sold at a prorated value of the individual’s salary.

Pension
Supports a market aligned compensation 
package and assists participants plan for 
retirement.
Pension provision is provided in the form of a defined contribution (DC) pension or 
a cash allowance where the individual opts out of the pension scheme as a result of 
exceeding the tax efficient pension savings limits set by HMRC.
A legacy defined benefit pension and Executive Top Up Scheme (BETUS), a 
securitised unfunded unregistered pension scheme, closed to future accrual on 
10 April 2011. Current Executive Directors have accrued benefits under these 
arrangements.
For the defined contribution pension, the maximum annual contribution is:
• 28% of base salary for the CEO
• 25% of base salary for the CFO
For the cash allowance, the maximum contributions reflect those under the DC 
pension less a deduction to ensure the cash allowance is broadly cost neutral to the 
company from a National Insurance perspective.
A discounted one-off cash settlement of the BETUS may be offered to an eligible 
member of the legacy defined benefit plan who is leaving or retiring from the 
company.

Annual Bonus 
To motivate employees and incentivise 
delivery of annual performance targets.
Annual bonuses are paid after the year end of the financial year to which they relate.
Targets are set at the beginning of the performance year which runs from the start 
to the end of each financial period. 
The Committee has the discretion to adjust the bonus outcome if the pure 
application of a formula is not felt to produce an appropriate result in light
of overall underlying performance. In particular the Committee has the discretion to 
adjust payments downwards if profits have fallen. Any adjustment made using this 
discretion will be explained.
Malus and clawback may be applied in respect of the bonus in certain situations 
where the payment of the bonus resulted from a material misstatement in the 
company’s accounts or an error in the assessment of the satisfaction of a 
performance condition.
Target and maximum opportunities are:
• 70% and 140% of base salary for the CEO
• 60% and 120% for the CFO
The level of payment at threshold is set on an annual basis but 
will not exceed 25% of the maximum award value.
The specific measures, targets and weighting may vary from 
year to year in order to align with the group’s strategy, but 
always with a substantial proportion based on key financial 
metrics.
For 2014/15 the annual bonus will be based 100% on key 
financial metrics.
The performance conditions are set annually based on the 
metrics the Committee feels are most appropriate for the 
business and create value for shareholders. These may include, 
but are not limited to, profit, revenue and cash flow metrics. 
Strategic KPIs may be chosen to support particular objectives 
for the year. 
Annual bonus targets are set with reference to internal budgets 
and analyst consensus forecasts, with maximum pay-out 
requiring performance well ahead of budget.
Further details of performance measures for the 2015/16 
annual bonus are given on page 63.
Long-Term Incentives –  
Executive Share Option Plan (ESOP) 
and Performance Share Plan (PSP)
To motivate and incentivise delivery of 
sustained, long-term performance and 
encourage share price and dividend growth 
over the performance period of the awards.
The Committee believes that long-term 
incentive plan measures should be 
simple, aligned to sustainable long-term 
shareholder value creation as well as 
providing line of sight to management so 
that they are meaningful and incentivising. 
ESOP - Allows for annual grants of market value options. Awards vest after three 
years, subject to performance conditions. Options expire 10 years following the 
grant date.
PSP - Allows for annual grants of performance share awards. Awards vest after 
three years, subject to performance conditions. 
Under the PSP participants are entitled to dividend equivalents between award and 
vesting in respect of awards that vest.
Malus and clawback may be applied in respect of LTIP awards in certain situations 
where the vesting of an LTIP award resulted from a material misstatement in 
the company’s accounts or an error in the assessment of the satisfaction of a 
performance condition.
ESOP - The maximum opportunities are:
• 300% of base salary for the CEO
• 250% of base salary for the CFO
PSP - The maximum opportunity is 150% of base salary for the 
CEO and 100% for the CFO.
Under the ESOP and PSP 20% of the maximum award vests 
for achieving threshold performance increasing to 100% of 
the maximum opportunity vesting for achieving maximum 
performance on a straight line basis.
The Committee chooses performance metrics measured 
over three years that support the company’s long-term 
strategic priorities, provide a direct link with shareholder 
value and ensure a clear line of sight for participants between 
performance and reward. 
For ESOP grants made in 2014/15, performance will be 
measured using an EPS performance condition.
For PSP grants made in 2014/2015, 75% of performance will 
be measured using the same EPS performance condition as for 
the ESOP , with the remaining 25% of performance measured 
using relative TSR. ROIC over the performance period will also 
be considered by the Committee in determining the level of 
vesting at the end of the period. 
EPS growth is a key measure of our success in growing value 
for shareholders over time. The setting of the EPS targets takes 
into account analyst consensus forecasts, internal projections, 
and the levels of performance required over the long-term to 
deliver absolute value appreciation for shareholders.
Relative TSR strongly links share price growth and dividends 
to the rewards executives receive. The relative nature of 
the measure ensures participants only receive awards if 
outperformance is achieved against a basket of investment 
comparables.
ROIC is an important financial discipline to ensure growth in the 
business continues to be value enhancing over the long-term.
The Committee may adjust the performance measures for 
future awards and the weighting of these measures if it feels 
this will create greater alignment with business and strategic 
priorities.
A significant change to the measures used would only be 
adopted following consultation with major shareholders.
Shareholding Guidelines
To encourage long-term share ownership 
by the Executive Directors so that interests 
are aligned with other long-term investors
Executive Directors are to acquire and then hold a certain shareholding from the 
date of their appointment to the board. 
Until this holding is acquired, the Executive Directors may not sell any shares 
received through the long term incentives operated by the company other than 
to finance the cost of exercising share options and any tax liabilities arising from 
the vesting of long-term incentive plans, unless approved by the Committee (for 
example, in cases of financial hardship).
Shareholdings are set at 200% of base salary for the CEO and 
100% for the CFO from the date of appointment to the board. 
The Committee will monitor progress on this requirement on an 
annual basis.

All-employee Share Plans
To allow Executives to participate in 
share plans on the same terms as other 
employees.
Executive Directors may participate in the Britvic Share Incentive Plan, which is an 
all-employee HMRC approved share plan open to employees based in Great Britain. 
The plan has three parts, all of which the Directors participate in:
• Free share awards, which are made annually subject to the company’s performance 
and at the discretion of the Committee
• Partnership shares, which are purchased by employees through payroll deductions
• Matching shares, which are provided by the employer to individuals purchasing 
partnership shares
The Committee reserves the right to use its discretion to amend the operation of the 
all-employee share plan from time to time.
• Free share awards, up to a maximum of 4% of earnings, 
capped at £3,600 per annum. 
• Partnership shares, up to £1,800 per year.
• Matching shares, on a one for one basis up to a maximum 
of £650 per year. 
The Committee has the discretion to limit the free share awards 
in light of performance against internal profit targets.
Chairman and  
Non-Executive Director (NED) fees
To attract and retain experienced and 
skilled Non-Executive Directors.
The fees paid to the Chairman are determined by the Committee, while the fees of 
the NEDs are determined by the Board with affected persons absenting themselves 
from the discussions as appropriate.
Annual fees are paid to the Chairman and other NEDs on a monthly basis. 
Additional fees are paid to NEDs who are members of and who chair a board 
Committee and to the Senior Independent Director (SID).
NED fee levels are periodically reviewed by the board (for NEDs) and the Committee 
(for the Chairman). Any increases to fees are normally effective from 1st January. 
NEDs do not participate in company incentive arrangements, and do not receive any 
form of pension provision.
NEDs will be reimbursed by the company for all reasonable expenses incurred in 
performing their duties of office.
The maximum fee level for each NED is set by reference to 
fees paid in UK-listed companies of a similar size and scope 
to Britvic.
Any planned increases in fees will take into account general 
increases across the wider employee population.

approved Remuneration Policy
Unvested ESOP and PSP awards will continue to pay out in 
accordance with the relevant plan rules. Any payments under 
these plans will be disclosed in the Annual Report on

Committee discretion
In addition to the discretion set out in this policy report, the 
Committee may apply discretion in operating the Remuneration 
Policy in certain matters including the following:
• The timing of any payments
• The impact of a change of control or restructuring
• Any adjustments to performance conditions or awards 
required as a result of a corporate event (such as a transaction, 
corporate restructuring event, special dividend or rights issue)
• The operation of malus and clawback provisions
• Minor administrative matters to improve the efficiency of 
operation of the plans or to comply with local tax law or 
regulation
Discretion regarding the treatment of leavers is set out in Service 
contracts and the policy on the payment for loss of office section.
The Committee also reserves the right to make a remuneration 
payment that originated from before the individual became an 
Executive Director.
In relation to the annual bonus and LTIP plans, the Committee 
retains the ability to amend the performance conditions and/or 
measures in respect of any award or payment if one or more 
event(s) have occurred which would lead the Committee to 
consider that it would be appropriate to do so, provided that 
such an amendment would not be materially less difficult to 
meet.
If the Committee used any of the discretions set out above these 
would, where relevant, be disclosed in the next Annual 
Remuneration Report and the views of major shareholders may 
also be sought.
Statement of consideration of employment 
conditions elsewhere in Britvic
The Committee is kept regularly updated on pay and conditions 
across the Group and has reference to average pay increases 
and the average salaries for the wider employee population. 
These metrics are considered by the Committee when reviewing 
the remuneration for Executive Directors.
The company did not consult with employees when drawing up 
the Remuneration Policy.
Statement of consideration of shareholder 
views
The Committee is committed to on-going dialogue with the 
company’s shareholder base. This can take a variety of forms, 
such as: 
• Meetings with major shareholders to consider significant 
potential changes to policy or specific issues of interest to 
particular shareholder groups
• Other dialogue to update shareholders and take their feedback 
on planned refinements to arrangements
In drawing up the Remuneration Policy approved at the last 
AGM, the Chair of the Committee wrote to Britvic’s major 
shareholders and key institutional representative bodies and held 
several follow up meetings. The views expressed by our 
shareholders during this process have been considered in the 
development of the Remuneration Policy.

Governance Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued
177534_BRITVIC_TEXT-p033-088.indd   82 13/12/2016   19:06 Approach to remuneration on recruitment
When hiring a new Executive Director, or making internal promotions to the Board, the Committee will in principle apply the same 
policy as for existing Executive Directors, as detailed in the Remuneration Policy. The rationale for the package offered will be explained 
in the next Annual Remuneration Report.
For internal promotions any commitments made prior to appointment may continue to be honoured as the Executive is transitioned to 
the new remuneration arrangements.
Our recruitment Remuneration Policy aims to give the Committee sufficient flexibility to secure the appointment and promotion of 
high-calibre Executives to strengthen the management team and secure the skill sets to deliver our strategic objectives. The details are 
set out in the table below:
Area Policy and operation 
Base salary • Base salary would be set at an appropriate level to recruit the best candidate based on their skills, 
experience and current remuneration. In some instances it may be appropriate to recruit on a 
salary at the lower end of the typical market range and progress salary increases above the typical 
rate of increases provided to the wider employee workforce to align with performance and policy 
over time
Benefits and pension • Benefits and pension would be in line with normal policy and may include, where appropriate, 
relocation benefits or other benefits reflective of normal market practice in the territory in which the 
Executive Director is employed
Annual bonus • Awards would be made under the annual bonus plan in line with the Remuneration Policy
• Maximum opportunity would not exceed 140% of base salary
Normal LTIP awards  
(ESOP and PSP)
• Awards would be made under the LTIP plans in line with the Remuneration Policy
• Under the ESOP , maximum opportunity would not exceed 300% of base salary
• Under the PSP , maximum opportunity would not exceed 150% of base salary
Additional LTIP awards 
(ESOP and PSP)
• On the recruitment of a director the Committee may make a one-off performance linked award 
under the ESOP and PSP subject to the below limits. Under the ESOP an award of up to 500% of 
base salary may be made in a year to an executive (inclusive of the normal annual award that 
would be granted to an executive)
• Under the PSP an award of up to 200% of base salary may be made in a year to an executive 
(inclusive of the normal annual award that would be granted to an executive)
Replacement awards • The Committee will normally seek to avoid using replacement awards. However where, in 
exceptional circumstances, replacement awards are considered by the Committee to be 
necessary, they are not subject to a formal maximum, although would be designed to reflect only 
the value of remuneration forgone by the recruited Executive or less. In making any buyout awards 
the Committee would take into account any additional LTIP awards made as set out above
Service contracts • The Committee may agree a contractual notice period with the Executive which initially exceeds 
twelve months, as applies to other Executives, particularly if it is necessary to attract Executives 
who will be required to relocate their families
• This will reduce to a twelve month rolling notice period once the individual is twelve months from 
the end of their initial notice period

177534_BRITVIC_TEXT-p033-088.indd   83 13/12/2016   19:06 Service contracts and policy on payment for loss of office 
The table below sets out items that are contained within the service contracts for the Executive Directors. It is the policy that these will 
apply to any future Director.
Item Policy
Notice period • 12 months if given by the company
• 6 months if given by the Executive
Remuneration • Base salary and pension
• Eligibility to participate in the annual bonus and LTIP and other share incentive plans
Benefits • Provision of company car or cash alternative
• Payment of professional subscriptions for up to two recognised professional bodies
• Eligibility for private medical insurance
Contractual 
termination payment
• The company may terminate the Executive’s employment at any time and with immediate effect and will 
pay the Executive an after tax sum in lieu of notice equal to the basic salary which the Executive would 
have been entitled to receive during their notice period. A payment may also be made in respect of 
outstanding untaken holiday entitlement accrued up to and including the date of termination
• Payments in lieu of notice would be paid monthly and are subject to mitigation if the Executive obtains 
alternative income during the period
• If the Executive is terminated for reasons such as gross misconduct no payment in lieu of notice will be due
• The Committee may at its discretion put the Executive on garden leave for any period provided that base 
salary and contractual benefits are paid during this period. The Committee would only use this discretion 
when appropriate and would seek to minimise the cost to the company if such discretion was required
Non-Executive 
Directors
• The NEDs do not have service contracts but instead have letters of appointment for a three-year term
• On termination NEDs shall only be entitled to accrued fees as at the date of termination
In the event of a settlement agreement, the Committee may agree payments it considers reasonable in settlement of legal claims. This 
may include reasonable reimbursement of professional fees in connection with such agreements.
The table below sets out details of how an Executive Directors incentives and pension would be treated on termination. Items of fixed 
pay are detailed in the previous table.
Incentives Treatment
Annual Bonus • In the case of retirement with the agreement of the Committee, redundancy, death in service, or such 
other reason as the Committee may in its discretion approve, the bonus will be pro-rated to the date of 
termination and paid on the normal payment date
• Executives leaving for any other reason will normally forfeit their awards
ESOP & PSP • Awards for executives who are treated as a ‘good leaver’ under the rules of the LTIPs (reasons include ill 
health, injury, disability, redundancy, change of control, retirement with the consent of the company, and 
any other reason at the Committee’s discretion) will vest at the normal vesting date unless the Committee 
determines the awards should vest at an alternative date taking into consideration the extent to which any 
performance conditions have been satisfied and time served over the performance period
• If the executive is not a ‘good leaver’, the awards will lapse immediately on termination
• If the executive ceases to be a director as a result of death, awards will vest as soon as practicable taking 
into consideration the extent to which any performance conditions have been satisfied and time served 
over the performance period
Pension • The Committee may consider offering a discounted one-off cash settlement to a member who is leaving 
the company to reduce the company’s balance sheet exposure to the BETUS liability. This is normally 
used at retirement
• All members of the defined benefits section of the pension plan (Plan) may benefit from the Enhanced 
Early Retirement Facility (‘EERF’) which allows the Plan members to retire within five years of reaching 
normal pension age without a reduction in their pension. The EERF includes benefits payable from BETUS 
and is non-contractual. Continuation of the EERF formed part of the agreement with the Plan trustee on 
the closure of the defined benefit section of the Plan. The company has given notice to all of the Plan 
members that the EERF will be withdrawn by 5 April 2016
Other appointments 
The Executive Directors are not permitted to have any engagement with any other company during the term of their appointment 
without the prior written consent of the board.

shareholders amounted to £151.9m (2015: £137.6m) and the 
profit after taxation amounted to £114.5m (2015: £103.8m). An 
interim dividend of 7.0p (2015: 6.7p) per ordinary share was paid 
on 8 July 2016.
Subject to shareholder approval, the directors have proposed a 
final dividend of 17.5p (2015: 16.3p) per ordinary share payable 
on 3 February 2017 to shareholders on the register at the close 
of business on 9 December 2016, giving a total dividend in 
respect of 2016 of 24.5p (2015: 23.0p), an increase of 6.5%  
per cent over the previous year. 
Articles of association
The company’s articles may only be amended by a special 
resolution at a general meeting of shareholders. No amendments 
to the articles are being proposed at the AGM.
Directors
The following were directors of the company during the year: 
Gerald Corbett, Simon Litherland, John Gibney (resigned on 27 
January 2016), Joanne Averiss, Sue Clark (appointed 29 
February 2016), Mathew Dunn (appointed 25 November 2015), 
John Daly, Ben Gordon, Bob Ivell (resigned 1 March 2016), Ian 
McHoul and Euan Sutherland (appointed 29 February 2016).
Subject to company law and the company’s articles, the directors 
may exercise all of the powers of the company and may delegate 
their power and discretion to committees. The executive team is 
responsible for the day-to-day management of the group. The 
articles give the directors power to appoint and replace directors. 
Under the terms of reference of the Nomination Committee, any 
appointment must be recommended by the Nomination 
Committee for approval by the board. The articles also require 
directors to retire and submit themselves for election to the first 
AGM following appointment and to retire at the AGM held in the 
third calendar year after election or last re-election, but to comply 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code all of the directors will 
submit themselves for election (Sue Clark and Euan Sutherland) 
or re-election at the AGM. The biographical details of the 
directors are set out on pages 36 and 37 of this report. The 
service contracts of the Executive Directors and letters of 
appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are available for 
inspection at the company’s registered office. 
Directors’ interests
The directors’ interests in ordinary shares of the company are 
shown within the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 72. 
No director has any other interest in any shares or loan stock of 
any group company. Other than Joanne Averiss, who is a 
director of a number of PepsiCo’s subsidiaries, no director was or 
is materially interested in any contract, other than under their 
service contract or letter of appointment, which was subsisting 
during or existing at the end of year and which was significant in 
relation to the group’s business. Further details of Joanne 
Averiss’ appointments are set out on page 43 in the Corporate 
Governance Report.
There are procedures in place to deal with any conflicts of 
interest and these have operated effectively during the year.

issued share capital comprised of 262,871,256 ordinary shares.
Rights and restrictions attaching to shares
On a show of hands at a general meeting of the company, every

and the numbers for, against or withheld in relation to each 
resolution are announced at the general meeting and published 
on the company’s website after the meeting.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the 
company other than:
• Certain restrictions which may from time to time be imposed 
by laws and regulations (for example, insider trading laws); and
• Pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority and Britvic’s share dealing code whereby certain 
employees of the group require the approval of the company 
to deal in its ordinary shares.
The company is not aware of any agreements between 
shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of 
securities and/or voting rights.
Dividend Waiver
The trustees of the Britvic Share Incentive Plan have elected to 
waive dividends on shares held under trust relating to dividends 
payable during the year.
Shares held in employee benefit trusts
Under the rules of the Britvic Share Incentive Plan (‘the Plan’) 
eligible employees are entitled to acquire shares in the company. 
Plan shares are held in trust for participants by Equiniti Share 
Plan Trustees Limited (‘the Trustees’). Voting rights are exercised 
by the Trustees on receipt of participants’ instructions. If a 
participant does not submit an instruction to the Trustees no vote 
is registered. In addition, the Trustees do not vote on any 
unawarded shares held under the Plan as surplus assets. As at 
28 November 2016, the Trustees held 1.24% (2015: 0.08%) of 
the issued share capital of the company.

177534_BRITVIC_TEXT-p033-088.indd   86 13/12/2016   19:06 Similarly, if First Names (Jersey) Limited, as Trustee of the Britvic 
Employee Benefit Trust (‘the Trustee’), holds ordinary shares on 
trust for the benefit of the executive directors, senior executives 
and managers of the group, a dividend waiver is in place. The 
Trustee is not permitted to vote on any unvested shares held in 
the trust unless expressly directed to do so by the company. 
The Trustees held 0.19% of the issued share capital as at 28 
November 2016 (2015: 0.5%).
Change of control provisions
There are no agreements between the company and its directors 
or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or 
employment (whether through resignation, purported redundancy 
or otherwise) that occurs because of a takeover bid. The 
company’s banking arrangements are terminable upon a change 
of control of the company. Certain other indebtedness becomes 
repayable if a change of control leads to a downgrade in the 
credit rating of the company. The company’s agreements with 
PepsiCo are terminable upon a change of control. Further details 
of these agreements can be found on page 28.
Financial risk management
It is the group’s objective to manage its financial risk so as to 
minimise the adverse fluctuations in the financial markets on the 
group’s reported profitability and cash flows. The policies for 
managing each of the group’s main financial risk areas are 
referred to in the Treasury Management section of the Chief 
Financial Officer’s review on page 22 and in more detail within 
note 24 of the consolidated financial statements.
Research and development
The group carries out research and development necessary to 
support its principal activities as a manufacturer and distributor of 
soft drinks.
Branches
As a global group, our interests and activities are held or 
operated through subsidiaries, branches, joint arrangements or 
associates which are established in, and subject to the laws and 
regulations of, many different jurisdictions. 
Going concern and viability
The Directors consider that the group and the company have 
adequate resources to remain in operation for the foreseeable 
future and have therefore continued to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements.
The UK Corporate Governance Code requires the directors to 
assess and report on the prospects of the Group over a longer 
period. This longer term viability statement is set out on page 32.
Events since the balance sheet date
Subsequent to the period end, the group announced the 
acquisition, subject to competition approval, of East Coast 
Suppliers Limited, a licensed wholesaler in Ireland. The 
acquisition price is deemed not material to the group.
2017 annual general meeting
The AGM will be held at RSA House, Durham House Street, off 
the Strand, London WC2N 6HG, at 11.00am on 31 January 
2017. Details of the resolutions to be proposed at the AGM are 
set out in the separate circular which has been sent to all 
shareholders with this Annual Report.
Audit information
The directors confirm that, so far as they are aware, there is no 
relevant audit information (as defined in section 418 of the 
Companies Act 2006) of which the auditor is unaware and that 
each director has taken all reasonable steps to make themselves 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
auditor is aware of that information. 
The directors confirm full compliance with the Competition and 
Markets Authority’s Statutory Audit Services Order. A full 
competitive audit tender was undertaken during the year which 
resulted in Ernst & Young LLP being retained. Further information 
relating to the tender process can be found on page 55 of the 
Audit Committee report. 
Disclaimer
The purpose of this Annual Report is to provide information to the 
members of the company and it has been prepared for, and only 
for, the members of the company as a body, and no other 
persons. The company, its directors and employees, agents and 
advisers do not accept or assume responsibility to any other 
person to whom this document is shown or into whose hands it 
may come and any such responsibility or liability is expressly 
disclaimed. A cautionary statement in respect of forward-looking

Governance Directors’ report continued The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and 
Accounts, including the consolidated 
financial statements and the Company 
financial statements, the Directors’ 
Report, including the Remuneration 
Report and the Strategic Report, in 
accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU, and 
the Company financial statements and the Remuneration Report 
in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom generally accepted 
accounting practice, UK GAAP). In preparing the consolidated 
financial statements, the Directors have also elected to comply 
with IFRS, issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB). Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company 
on a consolidated and individual basis and for the profit or loss  
of the Company on a consolidated basis for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• state that the consolidated financial statements comply with 
IFRS as issued by the IASB and IFRS adopted by the EU and, 
with regard to Company financial statements, that applicable 
UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and
• prepare the consolidated financial statements and Company 
financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Company, on a consolidated 
and individual basis, will continue in business, in which case 
there should be supporting assumptions or qualifications as 
necessary.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company on a consolidated and 
individual basis, and to enable them to ensure that the consolidated 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and the Company financial statements 
and the Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and its subsidiaries and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on 
page 36 to 37, confirms that:
• to the best of their knowledge, the consolidated financial 
statements and the Company financial statements, which have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB 
and IFRS as adopted by the EU and UK GAAP respectively, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Company on a consolidated and 
individual basis;
• to the best of their knowledge, the Strategic Report contained 
in the Annual Report and Accounts includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company on a consolidated and individual 
basis, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces; and
• they consider the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law 
and United Kingdom accounting standards (United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice) including FRS 101.
This report is made solely to the company’ s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’ s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’ s report and for no other purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’ s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 88, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual 
Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies, we consider the implications for our report.
Our assessment of risk of material misstatement
We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those which had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team. In addressing these risks, we have performed the 
procedures below which were designed in the context of the financial statements as a whole and, consequently, we do not express 
any opinion on these individual areas.

the members of Britvic plc

Financial statements
177534_BRITVIC_TEXT-p089-158.indd   90 13/12/2016   19:11 These risks are consistent with those identified and reported in 2015 with the exception of one additional area within the risk of 
management override of internal control, being the accounting for, and valuation of, the contingencies that management have 
identified in respect of the Group’s acquisition of Britvic Brazil in the current year. 
The risks noted below are discussed in the Audit Committee Report on pages 50 to 55 and in the accounting policy notes on pages 101 to 108.
RISK – revenue recognition
Description of risk
• Revenue is recognised on confirmation of product delivery to customers. Given the volume of deliveries and market focus on 
revenue performance we consider there is a risk in relation to the potential overstatement of revenue at the period end.
Our response to this risk
• we tested controls over revenue recognition, including those relating to the timing of revenue recognition; 
• we performed revenue transaction testing, which included ensuring that the transaction had been appropriately recorded in the 
income statement at the right time;
• we performed cut-off testing on customer delivery notes around the period end; 
• we reviewed post year end credit notes for any items that related to the audit period;
• we examined the appropriateness of the roll-forward adjustments recorded for both Britvic Brazil and Britvic France that are  
posted due to the non-coterminous year end dates of these components with the Group.
• we looked for and tested journal entries relating to revenue for transactions close to the period end to ensure they were valid 
entries. We also analysed and selected journals for testing which appeared unusual in nature either due to size, preparer or 
being manually posted. We verified the journals to originating documentation to confirm that the entry was valid; and
• we ensured that the financial statement disclosures were in accordance with accounting standards.
• The above work was performed at all full and specific scope locations.
Within International Standard on Auditing (UK&I) 240 there is a presumption that there are risks of fraud in revenue recognition.  
We therefore evaluated the revenue transactions or assertions which give rise to such risk in the current year as noted above.
Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee
Based on our procedures we are satisfied that the revenue cut-off was appropriate.
RISK – management override of internal control over discounts
Description of risk
• The risk of material misstatement due to management override of controls is considered a risk in every audit. Management has  
the  primary responsibility to prevent and detect fraud. We are required by professional auditing standards to consider how this  
risk may manifest itself and design appropriate procedures. 
• Management could manipulate results through the accounting for promotional discounts and long term discounts which are 
deducted from revenue.
Our response to this risk
• we obtained an understanding of the Group’s processes for the recognition and management of discounts provided to customers 
including obtaining an understanding of the design of the controls in place within the GB, Ireland and International divisions where 
such discounts are most prevalent;
• we tested a sample of long term and promotional discount expenses throughout the period and the period end accruals by agreeing 
balances through to supporting documentation and ensured that the revenue recognition policies adopted complied with IFRS;
• we performed analytical procedures including the correlation of revenue to discounts to assess completeness of discounts;
• we performed testing of post year end discounts, both settled and recorded, as evidence of the appropriateness of discount 
accruals recognised at the year end;
• we reviewed post year end credit notes for any items that related to the audit period;
• we held bi-annual meetings with the customer account teams in GB to update our knowledge of the status of customer 
negotiations and the process by which discounts have been recorded;
• we looked for and tested journal entries relating to revenue for transactions close to the period end to ensure they were valid 
entries. We also analysed and selected journals for testing which appeared unusual in nature either due to size, preparer or being 
manually posted. We verified the journals to originating documentation to confirm that the entry was valid; and
• we ensured that the financial statement disclosures were in accordance with accounting standards.
Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee 
Based on our procedures, we have not identified any management override of the discounts either expensed or accrued in the 
financial statements.

177534_BRITVIC_TEXT-p089-158.indd   91 13/12/2016   19:11 RISK – management override of internal control over customer claims and other financial items
Description of risk
• The risk of material misstatement due to management override of controls is considered a risk in every audit. Management has 
the primary responsibility to prevent and detect fraud. We are required by professional auditing standards to consider how this risk 
may manifest itself and design appropriate procedures; 
• There are a number of judgemental accruals which are susceptible to manipulation by management including customer claims in 
GB, group wide bonuses and contingent liabilities associated with the acquisition of ebba (“Britvic Brazil”). 
Our response to this risk
• We performed procedures, including analytical procedures and journal entry testing, sufficient to address the identified risk in 
respect of subjective areas which were considered to be most susceptible to management override.
• For GB customer claims:
 - we held bi-annual discussions with a sample of customer account teams directly involved in negotiations with customers, 
including those responsible for the relationship with the big supermarkets. Through these discussions we understood the 
current relationship with each customer and the status of any claims;
 - we reviewed the methodology and process by which claims have been accrued for appropriateness and consistency with the 
prior year, specifically reviewing the process for identifying claims which have not been received and audited a sample of 
payments made after the year end to audit the accuracy of the accrued amounts; and 
 - we compared the level of aged debt held in relation to significant customers to the customer claims provision and investigated 
any additional significant un-provided aged debts that did not have a corresponding provision within the customer claims 
provision. 
• For other financial items (including group wide bonuses):
 - we audited the inputs in the assessments made by management to determine if balanced judgement and accurate calculations 
have been applied; 
 - where possible, we have tested post year payments to validate the amounts recorded at the reporting period end; and
 - where similar accruals and provisions were held in the previous period we compared assumptions used in the current period 
calculations to those used previously and tested any changes in assumptions to gain assurance that they are appropriate.
• For the contingent liabilities arising on the acquisition of Britvic Brazil:
 - we have reviewed the contract terms of the sale and purchase agreement to understand the nature of any items covered by 
warranties given in the sale and purchase agreement;
 - we have traced the gross liabilities through to supporting documentation; and
 - we have assessed the appropriateness of the weighted average probability applied to the gross liabilities to arrive at the fair 
value.
Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee 
Based on our procedures, we have not identified any instances of management override in the areas noted.
Our application of materiality 
The scope of our work is influenced by materiality. We apply this concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in 
evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion. As we develop our audit strategy we 
determine materiality at the overall level and at the individual account level (referred to as our performance materiality).
Materiality £7.7m
Performance  
materiality £5.8m
Reporting  
threshold £0.39m

177534_BRITVIC_TEXT-p089-158.indd   92 13/12/2016   19:11 Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that individually, or in aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our 
audit procedures. 
We determined materiality for the group to be £7.7 million (2015: £7.5 million), which is approximately 5% (2015: 5%) of pre-tax profit 
adjusted for the exceptional costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Britvic Brazil because, in our view, this is the most 
relevant measure of the underlying financial performance of the Group. This materiality provided the basis for determining the nature, 
timing and extent of our audit procedures, and identifying and assessing the risk of material misstatement.
Performance materiality
 The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the 
probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the group’ s overall control environment, our judgement was that 
overall performance materiality for the group should be 75% (2015: 75%) of planning materiality, namely £5.8 million (2015: £5.6 million). 
 Audit work at individual components is undertaken based on a percentage of our total performance materiality. The performance 
materiality set for each component is based on the relative size of the component and our view of the risk of misstatement at that 
component. In the current year the range of performance materiality allocated to components was £0.6 million to £4.9 million (2015: £0.6 
million to £4.8 million).
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.39 million (2015: 
£0.38 million), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in the light of 
other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.

177534_BRITVIC_TEXT-p089-158.indd   93 13/12/2016   19:11 An overview of the scope of our audit 
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for 
each entity within the Group which, when taken together, enable us to form an opinion on the group financial statements under 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We take into account size, risk profile, changes in the business environment and 
other factors when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
In addition to auditing the Group level functions our group audit scope focused on five businesses, of which GB, France and Brazil 
were subject to a full scope audit for the 53 week period ended 2 October 2016. Certain operations of the remaining two businesses 
- Ireland and International - were subject to a specific scope audit, where the extent of the audit work was based on our assessment 
of the risk of material misstatement in specific account balances and the materiality of those operations to the Group’s business. 
Together with the Group functions, which were also subject to a full scope audit, these operations represent the principal business 
units of the Group and account for 97% (2015: 95%) of the Group’s total assets, 96% (2015: 96%) of the Group’s revenue and 95% 
(2015: 90%) of the Group’s adjusted profit before tax. For 2016, the full scope components contributed 105% of the Group’s adjusted 
profit before tax. The two specific scope components contributed 8% of the Group’s revenue and (10)% of the Group’s adjusted profit 
before tax. The audit scope of these components did not include testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have 
contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for the Group. 
For the remaining locations, we performed other procedures, including analytical review, testing of consolidation journals and 
intercompany eliminations and foreign currency translation recalculations to respond to any potential risks of material 
misstatement to the Group Financial Statements.
We have obtained an understanding of the entity-level controls of the Group as a whole which assisted us in identifying and 
assessing risks of material misstatement due to fraud or error, as well as assisting us in determining the most appropriate audit 
strategy.
Changes from the prior year
Our scoping broadly remains unchanged from the prior year other than the allocation of a full scope audit for Brazil, since this 
entity was acquired on 30 September 2015.
Involvement with component teams
The Senior Statutory Auditor leads the audit of GB, the audit of both specific scope locations, and the audit of the group functions. The 
Senior Statutory Auditor visited Brazil, a full scope location, participated in the Brazil and France component team’s planning 
including the discussion of fraud and error and joined the closing meeting calls in both territories. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; 
and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial period for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements;
• the information given in the Corporate Governance Report set out on pages 34 to 35 with respect to internal control and risk management 
systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures is consistent with the financial statements.

ISAs (UK 
and Ireland) 
reporting
We are required to give a statement as to whether we have anything material to add or to draw

performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the disclosures in the annual report that describe those risks and explain how they are being 
managed or mitigated;
• the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any 
material uncertainties to the entity’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve 
months from the date of approval of the financial statements; and
• the directors’ explanation in the annual report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the 
entity, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, 
and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the entity will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have 
nothing 
material

100    Britvic plc Annual Report 2016
Financial statements Notes to the consolidated 
financial statements
1. General information
Britvic plc (the ’company’) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. It is a public limited 
company domiciled in England & Wales and its ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange. Britvic plc and its 
subsidiaries (together the ‘group’) operate in the soft drinks manufacturing and distribution industry, principally in the United Kingdom, 
Republic of Ireland, France and Brazil.
The financial year represents 53 weeks ended 2 October 2016 (prior financial year 52 weeks ended 27 September 2015). For the UK, 
Ireland and International the results are for the 53 weeks ended 2 October 2016 (prior financial year 52 weeks ended 27 September 
2015). For France and Brazil the results are for the calendar year ended 30 September 2016 (prior calendar year ended 30 September 
2015).
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the board of directors on 29 November 2016.
2. Statement of compliance
The financial information has been prepared on the basis of applicable International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (IFRS), as they apply to the financial statements of the group. 
3. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except where measurement of balances at fair 
value is required as explained below. The consolidated financial statements of the group are presented in pounds sterling, which is 
also the functional currency of the company, and all values are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million except where otherwise indicated.
Going concern
The directors are confident that it is appropriate for the going concern basis to be adopted in preparing the financial statements. As at 
2 October 2016, the consolidated balance sheet is showing a net assets position of £281.0m (27 September 2015: net assets of 
£211.8m).
Group reserves are low due to the capital restructuring undertaken at the time of flotation. This does not impact on Britvic plc’s ability 
to make dividend payments.
The liquidity of the group remains strong, the group has a £400.0m bank facility with a recently extended maturity date of November 
2021, and £659.8m of private placement notes which have maturity dates between 2016 and 2026. 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements of the group incorporate the financial information of the company and the entities controlled by 
the company (its subsidiaries) in accordance with IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’. Control is achieved when the company:
• Has the power over the investee;
• Is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
• Has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared using consistent accounting policies. All intra-group transactions, balances, 
income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired in the year are included in the 
consolidated income statement from the date the group gains control or up to the date control ceases respectively. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and the revenue can be reliably 
measured, regardless of when payment is being made.
Revenue is recognised when goods are delivered and accepted by customers, when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of 
the goods have passed to the buyer and the amount can be measured reliably.

Financial statements
177534_BRITVIC_TEXT-p089-158.indd   101 13/12/2016   19:11 3. Accounting policies (continued)
Revenue recognition (continued)
Revenue is the value of sales, excluding transactions with or between subsidiaries, after the deduction of sales related discounts and 
rebates, value added tax and other sales related taxes. Sales related discounts comprise:
• Long term discounts and rebates – which are sales incentives to customers to encourage them to purchase increased volumes and 
are related to total volumes purchased and sales growth
• Short term promotional discounts – which are directly related to promotions run by customers
Where sales related rebates and discounts are earned, management make an accrual where it is probable that the rebate will be 
earned by the customer. Accruals are made for each individual promotion or rebate based on the specific terms and conditions of the 
customer agreement. Management make estimates on an ongoing basis to assess customer performance and sales volume to 
calculate total amounts earned to be recorded as deductions from revenue. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Cost comprises the 
aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset and includes costs directly attributable 
to making the asset capable of operating as intended. 
Assets under construction are carried at cost. Depreciation of these assets commences when they are ready for use.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, on a straight-line basis, over the 
useful economic life of that asset as follows:
Plant and machinery 3 to 20 years
Vehicles (included in plant and machinery) 5 to 7 years
Equipment in retail outlets (included in fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment) 5 to 10 years
Other fixtures and fittings (included in fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment) 3 to 10 years
Land is not depreciated.
Freehold properties are depreciated over 50 years.
Leasehold properties are depreciated over 50 years, or over the unexpired lease term when this is less than 50 years.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise 
from the continued use of the asset. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount, and 
are included in the consolidated income statement in the period of derecognition.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate 
the carrying value may not be recoverable and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount. Useful lives and residual 
amounts are reviewed annually and where adjustments are required these are made prospectively.
Non-current assets held for sale
The group classifies non-current assets as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale rather than 
continuing use. Such non-current assets as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying value and fair value less costs to sell. 
Property, plant and equipment and intangibles assets are not depreciated or amortised once classified as held for sale.
Assets classified as held for sale are presented separately beneath current items in the statement of financial position.
Business combinations and goodwill
While the original acquisition of Britannia Soft Drinks Limited was accounted for under the merger method, business combinations on or 
after 4 October 2004 have been accounted for under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ using the acquisition method. The consideration 
transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value which includes recording deferred consideration at discounted values 
where the impact of discounting is material.
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any 
excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of the 
cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired (discount on acquisition) is credited to the consolidated 
income statement in the period of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised.
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets
Software costs
Software expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only after its technical feasibility and commercial viability can be 
demonstrated. Acquired computer software licences and software developed in-house are capitalised on the basis of the costs 
incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. Costs include resources focussed on delivery of capital projects where the 
choice has been made to use internal resources rather than external resources. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful 
lives of three to seven years on a straight line basis.
Trademarks, franchise rights and customer lists
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at the fair value of consideration paid. Following initial 
recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation or impairment losses. An intangible asset acquired 
as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill, at fair value at the date of acquisition, if the asset is separable or 
arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.

Intangible assets (continued)
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Amortisation is charged on assets with finite lives on a 
straight-line basis over a period appropriate to the asset’s useful life.
The carrying values of intangible assets with finite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are also tested for impairment annually either individually or, if the intangible asset does not 
generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, as part of the cash generating unit to 
which it belongs. Such intangibles are not amortised. The useful life of an intangible asset with an indefinite life is reviewed annually to 
determine whether indefinite life assessment continues to be supportable. If not, the change in the useful life assessment from 
indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.
Research and development
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset when the group can demonstrate:
• The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that the asset will be available for use
• Its intention to complete and its ability to use the asset
• How the asset will generate future economic benefits
• The availability of resources to complete the asset
• The ability to measure reliably the expenditure during development
• The ability to use the intangible asset generated
Following initial recognition of development expenditure as an asset, the asset is carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation of the asset begins when development is complete and available for use. It is 
amortised over the period of expected future benefit. During the period of development, the asset is tested for impairment annually.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. For all remaining intangible assets the group assesses at each reporting date whether there 
is an indication that an asset may be impaired. Where impairment testing for an asset is required, the group makes an estimate of the asset’ s 
recoverable amount or the recoverable amount of the Cash Generating Unit (“CGU”) to which the asset belongs if it does not generate largely 
independent cash flows. An asset’ s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’ s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is 
determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or 
groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written 
down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects senior management’ s estimate of the cost of capital. Impairment losses of continuing operations are 
recognised in the consolidated income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may 
no longer exist or may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised 
impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since 
the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. 
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment 
loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Goodwill impairment losses cannot subsequently be reversed.
Inventories and work in progress
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct 
labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is 
determined using the weighted average cost method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated 
costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial assets
The group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. When financial assets are recognised initially, they are 
measured at fair value, which is normally the transaction price, plus directly attributable transaction costs for those financial assets not 
subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. The group assesses at each reporting date whether a financial asset or 
group of financial assets is impaired.
Loans and receivables
The group has financial assets that are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets 
with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been 
designated as either fair value through profit or loss or available for sale. Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement when 
loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables, which generally have 30-90 day terms, are recognised at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount.
Provision is made when collection of the full amount is no longer considered probable. Balances are written off when the probability of 
recovery is assessed as being remote.

Fair value
The group measures financial instruments, such as derivatives, at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset 
or transfer the liability takes place either:
• In the principal market for the asset or liability; or
• In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The fair value of an asset or liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or 
liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
The group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstance and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair 
value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value 
hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
Level 1:  quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2:   other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly .
Level 3:   techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the group determines whether transfers 
have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation at the end of each reporting period.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated 
with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations. All derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently remeasured 
at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar 
maturity profiles. The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is appropriate, the hedging relationship is documented at 
its inception. This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being 
hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration. Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the 
consolidated income statement. The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluing derivatives designated as hedging 
instruments depends on the nature of the hedging relationship, as follows:
Cash flow hedges
Hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular 
risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion 
of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised 
in the consolidated income statement. Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the 
consolidated income statement in the period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale occurs. 
However, when the forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts previously recognised 
in other comprehensive income are included in the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred 
to the consolidated income statement. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or 
rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income remain in equity 
until the forecast transaction occurs and are then transferred to the consolidated income statement or included in the initial carrying 
amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above. 
Net investment hedges
Financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges when they hedge the group’ s net investment in foreign operations. Some of the 
group’ s foreign currency borrowings qualify as hedging instruments that hedge foreign currency net investment balances. The effective portion of 
gains or losses on translation of borrowings designated as net investment hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income. Any ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. Upon disposal of the associated investment in foreign operations any 
cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is recycled through the consolidated income statement.
Fair value hedges
Hedges of the change in fair value of recognised assets or liabilities are classified as fair value hedges. For fair value hedges, the gain or loss 
on the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised in the consolidated income statement. The gain or loss on the hedged item 
attributable to the hedged risk adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item and is also recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
If the hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the hedged item would no longer be adjusted and the cumulative 
adjustment to its carrying amount would be amortised to the consolidated income statement based on a recalculated effective interest rate.
The fair value gain or loss on the hedging instrument would continue to be recorded in the consolidated income statement.

177534_BRITVIC_TEXT-p089-158.indd   104 13/12/2016   19:11 3. Accounting policies (continued)
Derecognition of financial instruments
The derecognition of a financial asset takes place when the contractual rights to the cash flows expire, or when the contractual rights 
to the cash flows have either been transferred or an obligation has been assumed to pass them through to a third party and the group 
does not retain substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset.
Financial liabilities are only derecognised when they are extinguished, that is, when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Share-based payments
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted. 
Fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate pricing model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is 
taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares (‘market conditions’).
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the 
performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (‘vesting 
date’). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent 
to which the vesting period has expired and the number of equity instruments that, in the opinion of the Directors and based on the best 
available estimate at that date, will ultimately vest (or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting 
as described below). The consolidated income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative 
expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other 
performance conditions are satisfied.
Taxation
The current income tax expense is based on taxable profits for the period, after any adjustments in respect of prior periods. It is 
calculated using taxation rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected 
to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
Provision is made for deferred tax liabilities, or credit taken for deferred tax assets, on all material temporary differences between the 
tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying values in the consolidated financial statements.
The principal temporary differences arise from accelerated capital allowances, intangible assets, provisions for pensions and other 
post-retirement benefits, provisions for share-based payments and unutilised losses incurred in overseas jurisdictions.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability will be settled based 
on the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are not 
recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the 
provision due to passage of time is recognised a finance cost.
Pensions and post retirement benefits
The group operates a number of pension schemes. These include both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
Defined benefit plans
The defined benefit pension liability or asset in the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. The cost of providing benefits 
is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period.
Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling and the return on plan assets (excluding 
interest), is reflected immediately in the statement of financial position with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive 
income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recognised in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in 
retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss.
Past service cost is recognised in the consolidated income statement in the period of a plan amendment. Net interest is calculated by 
applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset. 
Defined benefit costs are categorised as follows:
• Service cost (including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements);
• Net interest expense or income; and
• Remeasurement.

177534_BRITVIC_TEXT-p089-158.indd   105 13/12/2016   19:11 3. Accounting policies (continued)
Pensions and post retirement benefits (continued)
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the actual deficit or surplus 
in the group’s defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits 
available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.
Defined contribution plans
Under defined contribution plans, contributions payable for the period are charged to the consolidated income statement as an 
operating expense.
Employee benefits
Wages, salaries, bonuses and paid annual leave are accrued in the period in which the associated services are rendered by the 
employees of the group.
Leases
Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are retained by the lessor are classified as 
operating leases by the group. Leases in which the group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified 
as finance leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Any lease 
incentives received are credited to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases to which they 
relate.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, on demand deposits with banks and other short-term, highly liquid investments 
with original maturities of three months or less, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant 
risk of changes in value. For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, bank overdrafts repayable on demand are a component of 
cash and cash equivalents.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
Interest bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value less directly attributable transaction 
costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance 
income and finance cost.
On a refinancing any unamortised financing charges are accelerated through the consolidated income statement.
Foreign currencies
Functional and presentation currency
The consolidated financial statements of the group are presented in pounds sterling. The presentation currency of the consolidated 
financial statements is the same as the functional currency of the company. For each entity the Group determines the functional 
currency and items, included in the financial statements of each entity, are measured using that functional currency.
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to 
the consolidated income statement, except when hedge accounting is applied and for differences in monetary assets and liabilities 
that form part of the group’s net investment in a foreign operation. These are taken in other comprehensive income until the disposal of 
the net investment, at which time they are recognised in consolidated income statement.
Foreign operations
The consolidated income statement and statement of cash flows of foreign operations are translated at the average rate of exchange 
during the period. The balance sheet is translated at the rate ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on opening net 
assets and arising on the translation of results at an average rate compared to a closing rate are both recognised in other 
comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign operation, the accumulated exchange differences previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income are included in the consolidated income statement. 
Certain of the group’s financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges when they hedge the group’s net investment in 
foreign operations. See derivative financial instruments and hedging policy above for further detail.
Issued share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in 
equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Own shares
The cost of own shares held in employee share trusts and in treasury is deducted from shareholders’ equity until the shares are 
cancelled, reissued or disposed. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, the fair value of any consideration received is 
also included in shareholders’ equity.

Exceptional and other items
The group presents items as exceptional and other items on the face of the consolidated income statement to allow shareholders to 
understand better the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess 
trends in financial performance more readily. 
• ‘Exceptional’ items include those items of income and expense which, because of the size, nature or infrequency of the events 
giving rise to them, merit separate presentation.
• ‘Other’ items include fair value movements on financial instruments where hedge accounting cannot be applied on future 
transactions and also where hedge ineffectiveness is recognised. These items have been included within ‘exceptional and other 
items’ because they are non-cash and do not form part of how management assesses performance.
Key judgements and estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during 
the year. However, the nature of estimation means that the actual outcomes could differ from those estimates. In the process of 
applying the group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements and estimates which have the most 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Post-retirement benefits
The determination of the pension and other post-retirement benefits cost and obligation is based on assumptions determined with 
independent actuarial advice. The assumptions include discount rate, inflation, pension and salary increases, expected return on 
scheme assets, mortality and other demographic assumptions. These key assumptions are disclosed in note 22.
Franchise rights
Franchise rights represent franchise agreements acquired as part of the Britvic Ireland business combination which provides long term 
rights to distribute certain soft drinks. These agreements were allocated a 35 year useful economic life at the time of acquisition based 
on a third party assessment. As at 2 October 2016 these intangible assets have a remaining useful life of 26 years. The franchise 
agreement itself has a remaining contract life of 9 years which is less than the useful economic life. The useful economic life has been 
determined on the basis that the renewal of the franchise agreements, without significant cost, is highly probable. Evidence to support 
this conclusion is:
• Significant emphasis on maintaining a strong relationship with Pepsi, strengthened through the addition of Pepsico products to 
Britvic’s portfolio in recent years;
• Lack of alternative suppliers; and
• High barriers of entry to the Irish soft drinks bottling market. 
Intangible assets with indefinite lives
Management have made a judgement that certain intangible assets relating to brands have indefinite lives.
It is expected that the trademarks with indefinite lives will be held and supported for an indefinite period of time and are expected to 
generate economic benefits. The group is committed to supporting its trademarks and invests in significant consumer marketing 
promotional spend.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives
Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the 
cash generating units to which the goodwill/intangible asset has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires an estimate of 
the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. 
Further details are given in note 15.
New standards adopted in the current period
During the period, the group did not adopt any new standards.

4. Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. 
The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating 
segments, has been identified as the board of directors of the company.
For management purposes, the group is organised into business units and has six reportable segments as follows:
• GB stills – United Kingdom excluding Northern Ireland
• GB carbs – United Kingdom excluding Northern Ireland
• Ireland – Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland
• France
• Brazil
• International
These business units sell soft drinks into their respective markets.
Management monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource 
allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on brand contribution. This is defined as revenue 
less material costs and all other marginal costs that management considers to be directly attributable to the sale of a given product. 
Such costs include brand specific advertising and promotion costs, raw materials and marginal production and distribution costs. 
However, group financing (including finance costs) and income taxes are managed on a group basis and are not allocated to 
reportable segments.

A decline in the impact of overseas tax differences on the operating effective income tax rate (ETR) in the current period reflects the 
change in geographical mix of profits earned during the current period. Future period operating ETR will continue to be impacted by 
the profit mix of operational jurisdictions. Permanent items have increased due to non-qualifying expenditure relating to capital 
investment for the business capability programme.

The £16.0m reduction in net income tax payable from £24.0m in 2015 to £8.0m in 2016 arises due to prior year adjustments reducing 
the tax due, compounded by in year quarterly instalment payments for 2015 and 2016, based on previous estimates of corporation 
tax due, for both the UK and France. Other material reducing items include tax on current period share scheme exercises, credit for 
loss on the prior period FX forwards hedging the Brazil acquisition and incremental tax recoverable as a result of the acquisition of 
Brazil.
d) Uncertain tax positions
Uncertainties in relation to tax liabilities have been provided for in the tax payable account to the extent that it is considered probable 
that the group will be required to settle a tax liability in the future. Settlement of tax provisions could potentially result in future cash tax 
payments however these are not expected to result in an increased tax charge as they have been fully provided for in accordance with 
management’s best estimates of the most likely outcomes.
e) Unrecognised tax items
The group expects that future remittances of earnings from its overseas subsidiaries will be covered by the UK dividend exemption 
and so no tax is recognised on the un-remitted earnings of these subsidiaries.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in relation to losses made in the preceding period. These are expected to be recoverable on 
an ongoing basis due to a reduction in interest charges leading to higher profits in subsequent periods. Tax losses may be carried 
forward indefinitely, but the amount of carry forwards losses that can be utilised in certain territories is limited to 30% of taxable income 
in each carry forward year.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of unused tax losses of £8.3m (2015: £8.8m). Previously unrecognised losses 
arising on India have been eliminated as a result of the closure of the business.
There are no other unrecognised temporary differences associated with investments.

charge (2015: overall £1.3m charge) in the consolidated income statement.
g) Impact of rate change
Finance Act 2015 and 2016 enacted reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 17% from 1 
April 2020 respectively. The effect of the reduction from 20% to 17% is to reduce the deferred tax provision by a net £2.5m, 
comprising a credit of £1.4m to the income statement and a credit of £1.1m to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

177534_BRITVIC_TEXT-p089-158.indd   116 13/12/2016   19:11 11. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit/(loss) for the period attributable to the equity shareholders of 
the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to the ordinary equity shareholders of the 
parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period plus the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares. 
The following table reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:

The group has granted share options to employees which have the potential to dilute basic EPS in the future which have not been 
included in the calculation of diluted EPS as they are antidilutive for the periods presented (see note 27).
The group presents as exceptional and other items on the face of the consolidated income statement, those items of income and 
expense which, because of the size, nature or infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow 
shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance in the period, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods 
and to assess trends in financial performance more readily.
T o this end, basic and diluted earnings per share are also presented on this basis with the amortisation of acquisition related intangible assets

**  Following a review in the prior year, further non-current deferred tax liabilities were identified that should have been recognised in relation to acquired indefinite life 
brand intangibles upon acquisition of Britvic France which has resulted in an increase in goodwill.
Trademarks
Britvic Ireland and Britvic France
All trademarks have been allocated an indefinite life by management. A list of the trademarks held in respect of the Britvic Ireland and 
Britvic France segments is shown in note 15.
Britvic Brazil
Trademarks in Brazil have been allocated useful economic lives of 14.3 years. As at 2 October 2016 these intangible assets have a 
remaining useful life of 13.3 years.

177534_BRITVIC_TEXT-p089-158.indd   119 13/12/2016   19:11 14. Intangible assets (continued)
Franchise rights 
Franchise rights represent franchise agreements acquired as part of the Britvic Ireland business combination which provides long term 
rights to distribute certain soft drinks. These agreements were allocated a 35 year useful economic life at the time of acquisition based 
on a third party assessment. As at 2 October 2016 these intangible assets have a remaining useful life of 26 years. The franchise 
agreement itself has a remaining contract life of 9 years which is less than the useful economic life. The useful economic life has been 
determined on the basis that the renewal of the franchise agreements, without significant cost, is highly probable. 
Evidence to support this conclusion is:
• Significant emphasis on maintaining a strong relationship with Pepsi, strengthened through the addition of Pepsico products to 
Britvic’s portfolio in recent years;
• Lack of alternative suppliers; and
• High barriers of entry to the Irish soft drinks bottling market. 
In the unlikely event that it was deemed that the contract might not be renewed then the useful economic life would need to be 
reduced to its remaining contractual life. As at 2 October 2016 this would increase the annual amortisation for franchise rights by 
£1.4m to £2.1m.
Customer lists
Britvic France
Customer lists recognised on the acquisition of Britvic France relate to those customer relationships acquired. These intangible assets 
have been allocated useful economic lives of 20 years. At 2 October 2016 these intangible assets have a remaining useful life of 14 
years.

Goodwill amounts for Britvic GB were recognised on acquisitions made within Britvic GB.
Trademarks with indefinite lives were recognised as part of the fair value exercises relating to the 2007 acquisition of Britvic Ireland and 
the 2010 acquisition of Britvic France. They were allocated by senior management to the individual cash-generating units for 
impairment testing as shown in the table above.
Method of impairment testing
Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives
Impairment reviews of goodwill and intangible assets are undertaken by senior management annually. Value in use calculations are 
performed for each cash-generating unit using cash flow projections and are based on the latest annual financial budgets prepared by 
senior management and approved by the board of directors. Senior management expectations are formed in line with performance to 
date and experience, as well as available external market data.

Method of impairment testing (continued)
Discount rates reflect senior management’s estimate of the pre-tax cost of capital adjusted where necessary to reflect the different 
risks of different countries in which the group operates. The estimated pre-tax cost of capital is the benchmark used by management 
to assess operating performance and to evaluate future capital investment proposals. The group has considered the impact of the 
current economic climate in determining the appropriate discount rate to use in impairment testing. The same discount rate is relevant 
to all CGUs in each country as the group only operates in the soft drinks manufacturing and distribution market sector. The applicable 
pre-tax discount rate for cash flow projections is:
2016 2015
Britvic GB 9.4% 10.9%
Britvic Ireland 8.4% 9.3%
Britvic France 10.9% 12.8%
Britvic Brazil 17.9% -
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations
The following describes each key assumption on which management has based its cash flow projections to undertake impairment 
testing of goodwill.
Volume growth rates – reflect senior management expectations of volume growth based on growth achieved to date, current strategy 
and expected market trends and will vary according to each CGU.
Marginal contribution – being revenue less material costs and all other marginal costs that management considers to be directly 
attributable to the sale of a given product. Marginal contribution is based on financial budgets approved by the Britvic plc board. Key 
assumptions are made within these budgets about pricing, discounts and costs based on historical data, current strategy and 
expected market trends.
Advertising and promotional spend – financial budgets approved by senior management are used to determine the value assigned to 
advertising and promotional spend. This is based on the planned spend for year one and strategic intent thereafter.
Raw materials price, production and distribution costs, selling costs and other overhead inflation – the basis used to determine the 
value assigned to inflation is the forecast increase in consumer price indices in the relevant market. This has been used in all value in 
use calculations performed.
Cash flows are based on the latest approved budgets and forecasts (in most cases this is periods beyond one year). The applicable 
long term growth rates are:
2016 2015
Britvic GB 2.1% 2.0%
Britvic Ireland 2.7% 2.5%
Britvic France 1.6% 2.0%
Britvic Brazil 2.9% -
Intangible assets with finite lives
No indicators of impairment were identified on intangible assets with finite lives and no impairment was recognised against these 
assets.
Results and conclusions
No impairments have been identified during the 53 week period ended 2 October 2016. In 2015 no impairments were identified.
Other than for the Britvic trademark within Britvic Ireland where the recoverable amount is equal to its carrying value, the directors do 
not consider that a reasonably possible change in the assumptions used to calculate the value in use of remaining goodwill and 
intangible assets would result in any impairment. The key assumption to which the calculation of value in use for the Britvic trademark 
within Britvic Ireland is most sensitive is the discount rate where an increase in the discount rate from 8.4% to 9.4% would result in an 
impairment charge of £1.1m.

GB Schemes
The group’s principal pension scheme for GB employees, the Britvic Pension Plan (‘BPP’) has both a final salary defined benefit 
section and defined contribution section. The defined benefit section was closed to new members from 1 August 2002 and closed to 
future accrual for active members from 1 April 2011, with active members moving to the defined contribution section for future service 
benefits.
The BPP is a limited partner of Britvic Scottish Limited Partnership (‘Britvic SLP’), which in turn is a limited partner in both Britvic 
Property Partnership (‘Britvic PP’) and Britvic Brands LLP . Britvic SLP , Britvic PP and Britvic Brands LLP are all consolidated by the 
group. The investment held by BPP does not represent a plan asset for accounting purposes and is therefore not included in the fair 
value of the plan assets.
Certain properties and group brands have been transferred to Britvic PP and Britvic Brands LLP respectively, all of which are leased 
back to Britvic Soft Drinks Limited. The group retains operational flexibility over the properties and brands including the ability to 
substitute the properties and brands held by Britvic PP and Britvic Brands respectively. The BPP is entitled to a share of the profits in 
Britvic SLP until 2026. At the end of this period, the partnership capital allocated to the BPP will be changed to an amount equal to 
any funding deficit of the BPP at this time, up to a maximum of £105m.

GB Schemes (continued)
Contributions are paid into the defined benefit section of the BPP as determined by the Trustee, agreed by the company and certified 
by an independent actuary in the Schedule of Contributions. In addition to the expected partnership income of at least £5m per 
annum, the group will make payments to the BPP of £15m per annum by 31 December each year, in 2016 and 2017. Additional 
contributions of £15m per annum by 31 December in the years 2018 and 2019 will be made should the formal actuarial valuation in 
2016 reveal that these contributions are necessary to return the BPP to full funding on a self-sufficiency basis by 31 March 2020. 
During this year £20.0m of additional contributions were paid to the BPP , of which £15.0m was paid by the group and £5.0m relates 
to income received from the pension funding partnership (‘PFP’) structure. The triennial valuation of the scheme as at 31 March 2016 
is currently underway and is expected to be complete by 31 March 2017.
The amount recognised as an expense in relation to the BPP defined contribution scheme in the consolidated income statement for 
2016 was £12.0m (2015: £11.4m).
Britvic’s business in GB also has a secured unfunded, unregistered retirement benefit scheme called The Britvic Executive Top Up 
Scheme (‘BETUS’) which provides benefits for members who have historically exceeded the Earnings Cap, or the Lifetime Allowance 
whilst members of the defined benefit section of the BPP . BETUS closed to future accrual on 10 April 2011 which coincided with the 
closure of the defined benefit section of the BPP . 
Republic of Ireland scheme
The Britvic Ireland Pension Plan (‘BIPP’) is a defined benefit pension plan. Following legislative changes made in 2012 no deficit 
recovery contributions are currently required. The 1 January 2015 triennial valuation has now been completed. The Trustee has been 
undertaking investment de-risking to protect the on-going funding position achieved as a result of the 2012 changes. 
The amount recognised as an expense in relation to the Irish defined contribution schemes in the consolidated income statement for 
2016 was £0.7m (2015: £0.6m).
Northern Ireland scheme
The Britvic Northern Ireland Pension Plan (‘BNIPP’) is a defined benefit pension plan which was closed to new members on 28 
February 2006, and since this date new employees have been eligible to join a Stakeholder plan with Legal & General. The latest 
formal actuarial valuation for contribution purposes was carried out as at 31 December 2014. 
France schemes
Britvic France operates two defined benefit schemes: in the first, employees receive long-service cash payments at various stages 
throughout their careers. From the second, employees receive a lump sum at retirement. Payment amounts are dependent upon 
salary and service with the company. The schemes are unfunded therefore these benefits are paid directly as they fall due.
All group pension schemes are administered by trustees who are independent of the group’s finances, except for the Britvic France 
schemes which are operated directly by the company.

The past service cost gain during the current period arose on the GB scheme due to a Pension Increase Exchange that was offered to 
members, in which members were given the option to exchange pensions which will receive future inflationary increases, for a higher 
pension now which will not increase in future. The curtailment/settlement gain in the current period of £1.2m arose due to the 
retirement of an executive and the exchange of his benefits in the BETUS for a cash lump sum recognised in administration expenses.
Other than stated below, the net income detailed above is recognised in arriving at net profit from continuing operations before tax and 
finance costs/income, and is included within cost of sales, selling and distribution costs and administration expenses.

Demographic assumptions
The most significant non-financial assumption is the assumed rate of longevity. This is based on standard actuarial tables, which for 
the BPP are known as SAPS Series 1. An allowance for future improvements in longevity has also been included. The following life 
expectancy assumptions have been used:

The mortality assumptions used to calculate the GB pension obligation were revised in 2014 following a mortality analysis carried out 
as part of the actuarial valuation of the BPP at 31 March 2013.
Sensitivities
Changes in assumptions used for determining retirement benefit costs and obligations may have a material impact on the consolidated 
income statement and balance sheet. The main assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of inflation and the assumed mortality rate. 
The following table provides an estimate of the potential impact of each of these variables on the principal pension plans.

Categories of scheme assets (continued)
The fair values of the above equity and debt instruments are determined based on quoted market prices in active markets whereas the 
fair values of properties are not based on quoted market prices. The fixed interest and index linked asset classes include leveraged gilt 
funds.
Normal contributions of £0.8m are expected to be paid into the defined benefit pension schemes during the 2017 financial year.
Additional contributions of £21.5m are expected to be paid into the defined benefit pension schemes during the 2017 financial year, of 
which £16.5m is expected to be paid by the group and £5.0m by the partnership.
Risks
For defined contribution sections and plans, the group’s liability is limited to the requirement to pay contributions on behalf of each 
employee. In these arrangements the associated risks are borne by the members.
For defined benefit sections and plans, the group bears the risks of operation. The main risk that the group runs in respect of the 
defined benefit schemes is that additional contributions are required to pay for the benefits if investment returns are not sufficient. The 
contributions required for the schemes are in general determined at each triennial actuarial funding valuation. The key factors that will 
affect the need for additional contributions include levels of long-term inflation and interest rates and the assessment of how long 
members are expected to live, along with the level of investment return achieved. The level of investment return achieved is subject to 
a range of risks typical of the asset classes held, in particular market risk on equities, credit risk on corporate bonds and exposure to 
the property market. The discount rates used to calculate the liabilities are set by reference to yields on high quality corporate bonds. 
There is therefore a mismatch between the assets held and the way that the liabilities are calculated, meaning that the net balance 
sheet position disclosed under IAS 19 could fluctuate.
For the BPP , the trustee holds the power to determine the contribution rates that the group should pay, although the group fully uses 
the opportunity to make representation to the trustee on this point.
The trustee of the BPP agreed to implement an investment strategy which consists of a diverse range of fixed interest and index-linked 
securities, which will provides a significant hedge against inflation and interest rate risk. The intention is to continue to remove equities 
from the investment portfolio to further reduce investment risk.
The funding partnership mitigates the risk that additional cash contributions will be required after 31 March 2026, as the partnership 
will pay up to £105m to remove any funding deficit at 31 March 2026.

24. Financial risk management objectives and policies
Overview
The group’s principal financial instruments comprise derivatives, borrowings and overdrafts, and cash and cash equivalents. These 
financial instruments are used to manage interest rate and currency exposures, funding and liquidity requirements and share price 
exposure arising under the group’s employee incentive schemes. Other financial instruments which arise directly from the group’s 
operations include trade receivables and payables (see notes 17 and 23 respectively).
It is, and has always been, the group’s policy that no derivative is entered into for trading or speculative purposes.
The main risks arising from the group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. 
Additionally, the group is exposed to commodity price risk and share price risk. The board of directors review and agree policies for 
managing these risks as summarised below.
Interest rate risk
The group’s policy is to manage its interest cost by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. The group enters into interest rate 
swaps, cross currency swaps and forward rate agreements to hedge underlying debt obligations. At 2 October 2016 after taking into 
account the effect of these instruments, approximately 55% of the group’s borrowings are at a fixed rate of interest (2015: 77%).
Interest rate risk table
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, 
on the group’s profit before tax (through the impact on floating rate borrowings) and equity (through the change in fair values of 
applicable derivative instruments).

Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk is primarily in respect of exposure to fluctuations to the sterling-euro, sterling-US dollar, euro-US dollar and 
sterling-Brazilian real rates of exchange. The group has operations in euro-denominated countries and finances these partly through 
the use of foreign currency borrowings and cross currency swaps which hedge the translation risk of net investments in foreign 
operations. Additionally cash generation from euro-denominated operations can be utilised to meet euro payment obligations in 
sterling denominated companies, providing a natural hedge. In addition during the current period the group has entered into forward 
currency contracts to fix the sterling amount payable on the deferred consideration due on the purchase of a subsidiary in Brazil. 
The group also has transactional exposures arising from purchases of prime materials, capital expenditure and interest costs in 
currencies other than the functional currency of the individual group entities. Non-functional currency purchases and interest costs are 
mainly in the currencies of US dollars and euros. As at 2 October 2016 the group has hedged 74% (2015: 62%) of forecast net 
exposures 12 months in advance using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Where funding is raised in a currency other than the currency ultimately required by the group, cross currency interest rate swaps are 
used to convert the cash flows to the required currency. These swaps have the same duration and other critical terms as the 
underlying borrowing.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar, euro and Brazilian real exchange 
rates, with all other variables held constant, of the group’s profit before tax (due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and 
liabilities) and the group’s equity (due to changes in fair value of forward exchange contracts).

Credit risk
The group trades only with recognised creditworthy third parties. It is the group’s policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit 
terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result 
that the group’s experience of bad debts is not significant. The maximum exposure is the carrying amount disclosed in note 17. There 
are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the group.
The group maintains a policy on counterparty credit exposures with banks and financial institutions arising from the use of derivatives 
and financial instruments. This policy restricts the investment of surplus funds and entering into derivatives to counterparties with a 
minimum credit rating maintained by either Moody’s, Standard & Poors or Fitch. The level of exposure with counterparties at various 
ratings levels is also restricted under this policy. The level of exposure and the credit worthiness of the group’s banking counterparties 
is reviewed regularly to ensure compliance with this policy.
Commodity price risk
The main commodity price risk arises in the purchases of prime materials, being polyethylene terephthalate (PET), sugar, steel and 
frozen concentrated orange juice. The group does not enter into derivative contracts to hedge commodity price risk however in the 
normal course of business where it is considered commercially advantageous, the group enters into fixed price contracts with 
suppliers to protect against unfavourable commodity price changes. 
Share schemes equity price risk
The group operates several employee incentive share schemes. It has an exposure to the share price for the schemes in which shares 
are purchased in the market to satisfy the requirements of the plan. To hedge this risk the group has entered into equity derivatives 
against future scheme maturities.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the Britvic plc share price, with all other variables 
held constant, of the group’s profit before tax (due to changes in the fair value of the equity derivatives).

Liquidity risk
The group monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using rolling cash flow forecasts. These forecasts consider the maturity of both its 
financial investments and financial assets (e.g. accounts receivable and other financial assets) and projected cash flows from 
operations. The objective of the group’s liquidity policy is to maintain a balance between continuity of funds and flexibility through the 
use of bank loans and overdrafts and long term private placement issuance. 
The group’s bank facility has a maturity of November 2021 and is unsecured. As at 2 October 2016, the group had drawn down 
£113.5m (2015: £nil) under this facility. In addition to this facility the group had £1.6m of outstanding external borrowings all of which 
were secured (2015: £0.5m all of which were secured).

Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
Hierarchy
The group uses the following valuation hierarchy to determine the carrying value of financial instruments that are measured at fair 
value:
Level 1:  quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2:   other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly 
or indirectly.
Level 3:   techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable 
market data.
Unless otherwise stated, the valuation basis used to calculate fair value is level 2.
All derivatives are valued using discounted cash flow analysis using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments. 
Forward currency contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates 
matching maturities of the contracts. Cross currency interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows 
estimated and discounted based on quoted forward exchange rates and the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest 
rates. Equity derivatives are measured using share prices and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of 
the contracts. The fair value of derivatives also includes the non-performance risk of both Britvic and its derivatives trading 
counterparties. 
As in the prior year, the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities are considered to be reasonable approximations of their fair 
values, except for fixed rate borrowings.
The fair value of the group’s fixed rate interest-bearing borrowings and loans at 2 October 2016 was £690.3m (2015: £596.8m) 
compared to a carrying value of £661.3m (2015: £575.1m). The fair value of the group’s fixed rate interest-bearing borrowings and 
loans are determined by using discounted cash flow methods using discount rates that reflect the group’s borrowing rate as at the end 
of the reporting period. 
Capital management
The group defines ‘capital’ as being net debt plus equity. The group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern and maintain an appropriate capital structure to balance the needs of the group to grow, whilst 
operating with sufficient headroom within its bank covenants.
The following table summarises the capital of the group:

Adjusted net debt 416.4 263.9
Equity 281.0 211.8
Capital 697.4 475.7
The group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions or in order to facilitate 
acquisitions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group has a number of options available to it including modifying dividend 
payments to shareholders, returning capital to shareholders or issuing new shares. In this way, the group balances returns to 
shareholders between long term growth and current returns whilst maintaining capital discipline in relation to investing activities and 
taking any necessary action on costs to respond to the current environment.
The group monitors capital on the basis of the adjusted net debt/EBITDA ratio. Adjusted net debt is calculated as being the net of 
cash and cash equivalents, interest bearing loans and borrowings and the element of the fair value of interest rate currency swaps 
hedging the balance sheet value of the US private placement notes. Adjusted net debt is shown in note 28. The adjusted net debt/
EBITDA ratio enables the group to plan its capital requirements in the medium term. The group uses this measure to provide useful 
information to financial institutions and investors.

Derivatives not designated as part of hedge relationships
Equity derivatives –equity forwards
The group operates several employee incentive share schemes. It has an exposure to the share price for the schemes in which shares 
are purchased in the market to satisfy the requirements of the plan. The group has equity forwards against schemes that mature in 
2016 and 2017.
Forward currency contracts – Ebba 
As part of cash management for expected future payments in relation to the deferred consideration of the purchase of Ebba BR$150.0m 
of BR$/sterling FX forwards were in existence at 2 October 2016 (2015: BR$50.0m in relation to operational requirements).
Derivatives designated as part of hedge relationships
As at the 2 October 2016 these hedging relationships are categorised as follows:
Cash flow hedges
Forward currency contracts 
The forward currency contracts hedge the expected future purchases in the period to March 2018 and have been assessed as part of 
effective cash flow hedge relationships as at 2 October 2016. 
Forward currency contracts – Ebba
As part of the transaction to purchase Ebba on 30 September 2015, the group purchased forward currency contracts to hedge the FX 
movement on the purchase of the company in Brazilian Real. 
Cross currency interest rate swaps 
USD GBP cross currency interest rate swaps
The group has a number of cross currency interest rate swaps relating to the 2007, 2010 and 2014 USPP Notes. These cross 
currency interest rate swaps have the effect of fixing both the value of the USD borrowings into sterling and the rate of interest 
payable. The cross currency interest rate swaps are designated as part of a cash flow hedge relationship with the Notes.
Cash flows due under these cross currency interest rate swaps match the interest payment dates and maturity profile of the USPP 
Notes. The maturity profile of the USPP Notes can be seen in note 21.
During the year the cash flow hedge has been tested for effectiveness and as a result a £0.4m gain (2015: £2.1m gain) has been 
recognised in the income statement in respect of ineffectiveness.

Fair value hedges
Cross currency interest rate swaps
The group has a number of cross currency interest rate swaps in respect of the 2009 and 2010 USPP Notes. These instruments swap 
the principal and interest from fixed rate US dollar into floating rate sterling (the ‘2009 and 2010 USD GBP cross currency interest rate 
swaps’). The cross currency interest rate swaps are designated as part of a fair value hedge relationship with the Notes.
The fair value movements on the 2009 and 2010 USD GBP cross currency interest rate instruments are recorded in the consolidated 
income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the Notes where the hedge is deemed effective. 
The increase in fair value of the cross currency interest rate swaps, excluding maturities, of £29.7m (2015: £11.9m increase) has been 
recognised in finance costs and offset with a similar loss on the borrowings of £30.2m (2015: £12.5m loss). The net loss of £0.5m 
(2015: £0.6m loss) represents the ineffective portion on the hedges of the debt.

Net investment hedges
2009 and 2010 GBP EUR cross currency interest rate swaps
These instruments swap sterling liabilities arising from the 2009 and 2010 USD GBP cross currency interest rate swaps into euro 
liabilities and have been designated as part of effective hedges of the net investments in Britvic France and Britvic Ireland.
The GBP EUR cross currency interest rate swaps, along with the underlying loan instruments, are being used to hedge the group’s 
exposure to foreign exchange risk on these euro investments. Movements in the fair value of the GBP EUR cross currency interest rate 
swaps are taken to equity where they offset foreign exchange movements on the translation of the net investments in Britvic France 
and Britvic Ireland.
No ineffectiveness has been recognised in the consolidated income statement (2015: £nil).

Restructuring provisions
Restructuring provisions at 2 October 2016 and 27 September 2015, primarily relate to contract termination costs, consultation fees 
and employee termination benefits, recognised by the group following the implementation of cost initiatives announced in May 2013.
Other provisions
Other provisions at 27 September 2015, primarily relate to onerous lease provisions that have arisen due to the exit of certain group 
premises, and the period over which these will be settled ranges from 1 to 8 years. In addition during the current period certain 
provisions have been recognised on the acquisition of a subsidiary in Brazil which relate to regulatory and legal claims and are 
expected to be settled in 1 to 5 years. The impact of discounting was deemed to be immaterial.
27. Share-based payments
Britvic operates a broad base of employee plans as well as executive plans. In GB Britvic operates SIP plans for all employees, 
whereas outside of GB Britvic operates both share-settled and cash-settled plans. Executives participate in ESOP and PSP plans and 
senior leadership team participates in PSP plans.
The expense recognised for share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the 53 weeks ended 2 October 
2016, including national insurance is £6.6m (2015: £10.6m). This expense arises from transactions which are expected to be 
equity-settled share-based payment transactions. 
The Britvic Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’)
The SIP is an all-employee HMRC approved share plan open to employees based in GB. Employees are entitled to receive the annual 
free share award, where granted by the group, provided they are employed by the company on the last day of each financial year and 
on the award date. Employees can’t sell these shares for three years from their date of award. There are no cash settlement 
alternatives. Employees also have the opportunity to invest up to £138 every 4 weeks (£1,800 per year) through the partnership share 
scheme. This is deducted from their gross salary. Matching shares are offered on the basis of one free matching share for each 
ordinary share purchased with a participant’s savings, up to a maximum of £50 (2015: £50) per four week pay period.

The Britvic Executive Share Option Plan (‘ESOP’)
The ESOP allows for options to buy ordinary shares to be granted to executives. The option price is the average market price of Britvic 
plc’s shares on the three business days before the date of grant. Options become exercisable on the satisfaction of the performance 
condition and remain exercisable until ten years after the date of grant.
Options granted in 2016 and 2015
The performance condition requires the increase in EPS of 6% - 12% pa compound over a three year performance period for the 
options to vest. If the EPS growth is 6%, 20% of the options will vest, with full vesting at 12% EPS growth. Straight-line apportionment 
will be applied between these two levels to determine the number of options that vest and no options will vest if the EPS growth is 
below the lower threshold.
In some circumstances, at the discretion of the company, an option holder who exercises his/her option may receive a cash payment 
rather than the ordinary shares under option. The cash payment would be equal to the amount by which the market value of the 
ordinary shares under option exceeds the option price. However, it is expected that this plan will be equity-settled and as a 
consequence has been accounted for as such.
The following table illustrates the movements in the number of share options during the period:

Outstanding at 2 October 2016 3,896,276 579.8
Exercisable at 2 October 2016 1,324,139 381.5
The weighted average share price for share options exercised during the period was 706.7p (2015: 711.8p).
The share options outstanding as at 2 October 2016 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 7.3 years (2015: 6.9 years) 
and the range of exercise prices was 221.0p – 711.7p (2015: 221.0p – 671.0p).
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the period was 110.7p (2015: 101.3p).
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial model, taking account of the 
terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The Britvic Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’)
The PSP allows for awards of ordinary shares or nil cost options to be made to selected employees with vesting subject to the 
satisfaction of performance conditions, where different performance conditions apply to different groups of employees. Awards up to 
and including 2008, and 2013 and later were made in respect of ordinary shares. Awards granted between 2009 and 2011 were nil 
cost options. Nil cost options remain exercisable until 7 or 10 years after the date of grant for employees based in Ireland and UK 
respectively, whereas awards of ordinary shares are exercised when vested.

The Britvic Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) (continued)
Awards granted in 2016
Two awards were granted in 2016. The first award is split between the senior leadership team and the senior management team. The 
performance condition applied to awards granted to members of the senior leadership team is divided 75% and 25% between EPS 
and the total shareholder return (TSR) performance conditions respectively. EPS is the only condition applied to awards granted to 
senior management team. The EPS condition is the same as described in the ESOP section for options granted in 2015. 
The TSR condition measures the company’s TSR relative to a comparator group (consisting of 18 companies) over a three year 
performance period. The awards will not vest unless the company’s position in the comparator group is at least median. At median 
20% will vest, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting at upper quartile.
In some circumstances, at the discretion of the company, vested awards may be satisfied by a cash payment rather than a transfer of 
ordinary shares. However, it is expected that this plan will be equity-settled and as a consequence has been accounted for as such.
The second award is an exceptional award under the Performance Share Plan and has been awarded to selected employees. The 
performance condition applied to awards granted is continued employment for three years from date of grant. 
Awards granted in 2015
Awards granted in 2015 were as per the first award in 2016 outlined above.

Key assumptions used to determine the fair value of ESOP and PSP
The fair value of options and awards granted is estimated as at the date of grant, taking account of the terms and conditions upon 
which shares options were granted. The fair value of the award subject to the TSR condition is determined using a Monte Carlo 
simulation. The fair value of all other awards is calculated using the share price at the date of grant, adjusted for dividends not received 
during the vesting period.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used in respect of the PSP awards and ESOP options granted during the financial year:
2016 2015
Dividend yield (%) 3.79 - 3.94 3.84
Expected volatility (%) 25.6 - 25.7 26.5
Risk-free interest rate (%) 0.6 - 0.9 0.7 - 1.2
Expected life of option (years) 3 - 5 3 - 5
Share price at date of grant (pence) 676.0 - 704.5 648.0
Exercise price (pence) 683.0 - 711.7 671.0
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily 
be the actual outcome.

31. Acquisition of subsidiary
On 30 September 2015, the group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Empresa Brasileira de Bebidas e Alimentos SA 
(Ebba), a leading soft drinks company in Brazil. The acquisition is in line with the strategic direction of the group, specifically to pursue 
international expansion by capitalising on global opportunities in the kids, family and adult categories, where Britvic has the leading 
brands in its core markets.

177534_BRITVIC_TEXT-p089-158.indd   146 13/12/2016   19:11 31. Acquisition of subsidiary (continued)
The consideration for the acquisition comprises an initial cash consideration of £32.4m (BR$193.8m) and the cost of foreign exchange 
forwards taken out to hedge the purchase of the company of £10.2m less £2.0m tax receivable in relation to the foreign exchange 
forwards. The deferred consideration of £25.4m (BR$152.2m) is due on 30 September 2017 and is included in the consolidated 
balance sheet in other current liabilities at its current discounted value of £31.2m. In addition there was a repayment of Ebba debt of 
£32.1m (BR$192.5m) subsequent to acquisition*.
Included in goodwill are certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured due to their nature. These 
items include the assembled workforce and the market presence which Ebba has in the Brazilian market that Britvic can use to exploit 
the potential of its global brands.
Trade and other current receivables with a fair value of £12.2m have been recognised on acquisition. The gross contractual amounts 
on these receivables are £12.8m with £0.6m not expected to be collected. 
From the date of acquisition to 2 October 2016, the acquired business contributed £89.5m to revenue and £17.5m to brand 
contribution for the period. Due to the timing of the acquisition on 30 September 2015, the revenue and contribution for the period is 
materially the same as if Ebba had been completed on the first day of the financial period. Foreign exchange gains of £8.7m on 
goodwill have been recognised in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income in the period to 2 October 2016.
Integration related costs of £5.2m have been incurred in the current period. Acquisition related costs of £6.5m were incurred in the 
prior period. These have been included within exceptional and other items (see note 5).
*All £ amounts are at the £:BR$ rate prevailing at the acquisition date of 30 September 2015 with the exception of the current value of 
the deferred consideration.
32. Post balance sheet event
Subsequent to the period end, the group announced the acquisition, subject to competition approval, of East Coast Suppliers Limited, 
a licensed wholesaler in Ireland. The acquisition price is deemed not material to the group.

financial statements
1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions
Statement of compliance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101)
The company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 (FRS 100) issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council. Accordingly, these financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 
Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101) and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
There were no material measurement or recognition adjustments on the adoption of FRS 101. 
Basis of preparation 
These financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable 
UK accounting standards and present information about the company as an individual undertaking, and not about its group.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention except for the measurement of derivative instruments at fair 
value. The company has taken advantage of the exemption permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to publish its 
individual profit and loss account and related notes.
The financial statements are presented in GBP sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest million pounds (£ million). 
Significant accounting policies: use of judgement, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for income and expenditure during 
the year. However, the nature of estimation means that the actual outcomes could differ from those estimates. There are no significant 
judgements and estimates relevant to these financial statements.
Foreign currency translations
The company’s financial statements are presented in sterling, which is also the company’s functional currency. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the entity’s functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate ruling at 
the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange 
ruling at the balance sheet date. Any resulting exchange differences are included in the income statement and should be read in 
conjunction with the information provided under Derivative financial instrument and hedging in Notes 3, 24 and 25 of the consolidated 
financial statements.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at 
the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange 
rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
Investments
The company recognises its investments in subsidiaries at cost less any provisions made for impairment. The company assesses 
investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be 
recoverable. If any such indication of impairment exists, the company makes an estimate of its recoverable amount. Where the 
carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, the investment is considered impaired and is written down to its 
recoverable amount. 
In respect of IFRS 2 ‘Share based payment’, the company records an increase in its investment in subsidiaries to reflect the share-
based compensation expense recorded by its subsidiaries.
Share-based payments 
The cost of the equity-settled transactions with employees of other members within of the group is measured by reference to the fair 
value at the date at which equity instruments are granted and is recognised as a capital contribution in investments in subsidiary 
undertakings over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the employees become fully entitled to the award. A 
corresponding credit is recognised within equity. Fair value is determined by using an appropriate, widely used, valuation model. In 
valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the 
shares of the company (market conditions). 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of three months or less, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of 
changes in value. For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, bank overdrafts repayable on demand are a component of cash 
and cash equivalents.

Income taxes
The current income tax is based on taxable profits for the period, after any adjustments in respect of prior periods. It is calculated 
using taxation rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be 
recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
Provision is made for deferred tax liabilities, or credit taken for deferred tax assets, on all material temporary differences between the 
tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying values in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised.
Financial assets
All financial assets held by the company are classified as loans and receivables. Financial assets include cash and cash equivalents, 
other receivables and loans. The company determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. Financial assets are 
recognised initially at fair value, normally being the transaction price plus directly attributable transaction costs. 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in active markets, do 
not qualify as trading assets and have been designated as either fair value through profit or loss or available for sale. Such assets are 
carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognised 
in consolidated income statement when loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired. 
Finance costs arising from the outstanding loan balance and finance charges are charged to the profit and loss account using an 
effective interest rate method.
Financial liabilities
All financial liabilities are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value less directly attributable transactions costs and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. 
Gain and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance 
income and finance cost. 
Dividends
Dividend income is recognised when the company’s right to receive payment is established. Final dividends are recorded in the 
financial statements in the period in which they are approved by the company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recorded in the 
period in which they are declared.
Derivative financial instruments
The company uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated 
with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations. All derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently 
remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar 
maturity profiles. The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is appropriate, the hedging relationship is documented at 
its inception. This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being 
hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration. Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the 
consolidated income statement. The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluing derivatives designated as hedging 
instruments depends on the nature of the hedging relationship, as follows:
Cash flow hedges
Hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular 
risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion 
of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised 
in the consolidated income statement. Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the 
consolidated income statement in the period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale occurs. 
However, when the forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts previously recognised 
in other comprehensive income are included in the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred 
to the consolidated income statement. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or 
rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income remain in equity 
until the forecast transaction occurs and are then transferred to the consolidated income statement or included in the initial carrying 
amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above. 
Fair value hedges
Hedges of the change in fair value of recognised assets or liabilities are classified as fair value hedges. For fair value hedges, the gain or loss 
on the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised in the consolidated income statement. The gain or loss on the hedged item 
attributable to the hedged risk adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item and is also recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
If the hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the hedged item would no longer be adjusted and the cumulative 
adjustment to its carrying amount would be amortised to the consolidated income statement based on a recalculated effective interest rate. 
The fair value gain on loss on the hedging instrument would continue to be recorded in the consolidated income statement.

Issued share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in 
equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Other reserves
Share premium account
The share premium account is used to record the excess of proceeds over the nominal value on the issue of shares.
Own shares reserve
The own shares reserve is used to record purchases and issues by the company of its own shares, which will be distributed to 
employees as and when share awards made under the Britvic employee share plans vest.
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve records the effective portion of movements in the fair value of forward exchange contracts, interest rate and cross 
currency swaps that have been designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve arose as a result of the non pre-emptive share placement which took place on 21 May 2010. It was executed 
using a structure which created a merger reserve under Section 612-3 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Own shares
The cost of own shares held in employee share trusts and in treasury is deducted from shareholders’ equity until the shares are 
cancelled, reissued or disposed. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, the fair value of any consideration received is 
also included in shareholders’ equity.

2014 February 2024 – February 2026 $114m US$ fixed at 4.09% - 4.24%
The company entered into a number of cross-currency swap agreements in relation to the loan notes to manage any foreign exchange 
risk on interest rates or on the repayment of the principal borrowed. These swaps expire in line with the loan notes and are discussed 
in note 25 of the consolidated financial statements.
See note 24 of the consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the interest rate profile and the maturity of the borrowings and 
related interest rate swaps.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
Hierarchy
The company uses the following valuation hierarchy to determine the carrying value of financial instruments that are measured at fair 
value:
Level 1:   quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2:   other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly 
or indirectly.
Level 3:   techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable 
market data.
Unless otherwise stated, the valuation basis used to calculate fair value is level 2.
All derivatives are valued using discounted cash flow analysis using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments. 
Forward currency contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates 
matching maturities of the contracts. Cross currency interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows 
estimated and discounted based on quoted forward exchange rates and the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates. 
Equity derivatives are measured using share prices and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the 
contracts. The fair value of derivatives also includes the non-performance risk of both Britvic and its derivatives trading counterparties. 
As in the prior year, the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities are considered to be reasonable approximations of their fair 
values, except for fixed rate borrowings.
The fair value of the company’s fixed rate interest-bearing borrowings and loans at 2 October 2016 was £689.9m (2015: £596.1m) 
compared to a carrying value of £660.9m (2015: £574.6m). The fair value of the company’s fixed rate interest-bearing borrowings and 
loans are determined by using discounted cash flow methods using discount rates that reflect the company’s borrowing rate as at the 
end of the reporting period.

Derivatives not designated as part of hedge relationships
Forward currency contracts – Ebba 
As part of cash management for expected future payments in relation to the deferred consideration of the purchase of Ebba 
BR$150.0m of BR$/sterling FX forwards were in existence at 2 October 2016 (2015: BR$388m in relation to the purchase of Ebba 
and BR$50.0m in relation to operational requirements).
Derivatives designated as part of hedge relationships
As at the 2 October 2016 these hedging relationships are categorised as follows:
Cash flow hedges
Cross currency interest rate swaps 
The company has a number of cross currency interest rate swaps relating to the 2007, 2010 and 2014 USPP Notes. These cross 
currency interest rate swaps have the effect of fixing both the value of the USD borrowings into sterling and the rate of interest 
payable. The cross currency interest rate swaps are designated as part of a cash flow hedge relationship with the Notes.
Cash flows due under these cross currency interest rate swaps match the interest payment dates and maturity profile of the USPP 
Notes. The maturity profile of the USPP Notes can be seen in note 8.
During the year the cash flow hedge has been tested for effectiveness and as a result a £0.4m gain (2015: £2.1m gain) has been 
recognised in the income statement in respect of ineffectiveness.
Fair value hedges
Cross currency interest rate swaps
The company has a number of cross currency interest rate swaps in respect of the 2009 and 2010 USPP Notes. These instruments 
swap the principal and interest from fixed rate US dollar into floating rate sterling (the ‘2009 and 2010 USD GBP cross currency 
interest rate swaps’). The cross currency interest rate swaps are designated as part of a fair value hedge relationship with the Notes.
The fair value movements on the 2009 and 2010 USD GBP cross currency interest rate instruments are recorded in the income 
statement, with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the Notes where the hedge is deemed effective. 
The increase in fair value of the cross currency interest rate swaps, excluding maturities, of £29.7m (2015: £11.9m increase) has been 
recognised in finance costs and offset with a similar loss on the borrowings of £30.2m (2015: £12.5m loss). The net loss of £0.5m 
(2015: £0.6m) represents the ineffective portion on the hedges of the debt.

company’s date of transition to FRS 101, and made those changes in accounting policies and other restatements required for the first 
time adoption of FRS 101. There were no material measurement or recognition adjustments on the adoption of the FRS 101.

Warning to shareholders – boiler room  
fraud and other investment scams
Share or investment scams are often run from ‘boiler rooms’ 
where fraudsters cold-call investors offering them worthless, 
overpriced or even non-existent shares, or offer to buy their 
shares in a company at a higher price than the market value. 
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited 
advice, offers to buy shares at a discount, or offers of free reports 
about the company. Even seasoned investors have been caught 
out by such fraudsters and it is estimated that £200 million is lost 
in this way in the UK each year.
The FCA have some helpful information about such scams on 
their website, including tips to protect your savings and how to 
report a suspected investment scam. Britvic encourages shareholders 
to read the information on the site which can be accessed at 
www.fca.org.uk/consumers/scams/investment-scams.

Annual Report and Accounts For the year ending September 2005
It is my great privilege and pleasure to be writing my first
annual statement as your Chairman. I became Chairman
at the end of May, two-thirds of the way through our year
and succeeded Sir Fred Holliday to whom I would like to
pay particular thanks for his sterling work. He held office
during an important period in our Company’s history and
his reasoned and thoughtful execution of his duties was
invaluable. I wish Sir Fred a happy and well deserved
retirement. 
The year under review has seen our Group return 
a robust performance in terms of both revenue and profits
growth. This has been achieved across our two main
income streams of Private Client Investment
Management and Corporate Broking. There have been 
a number of significant developments during the year
including the opening of our office in Belfast in February
2005. This marks our first venture in Ireland and the
progress made to date is most satisfactory. We were also
very pleased to have added Corporate Broking services to
our office in Birmingham. In addition we have recruited
five new teams to other locations throughout the Group.
A major part of our strength is our extensive branch
network and our emphasis that clients have both freedom
of choice and the ability to communicate directly with the
individual manager who looks after them.
Since becoming your Chairman I have visited each one of
our 34 branches and three operational centres and
without exception I have seen the dedication and team
spirit that prevails throughout. This is, of course, of
enormous importance as our people are our most
valuable asset without whom we would not be able to look
after our clients and the interests of our Shareholders. 
We operate in an environment where the impact of
regulation is significant both in terms of costs and
management time. Your Group remains committed to the
attainment of the highest standards of business practice
and is very conscious of the need to meet, if not exceed,
the requirements of the Financial Services Authority. At
the same time we share the widely held view that
regulation must be constructed and executed in a manner
that is sensible, practical and relevant. To this end we are
committed to working closely with the Regulator and
Government at various levels.
We operate in a market place that is sensitive to events
that may take place across the globe. Against that
background it is not easy or appropriate to make
short-term predictions about our markets but it remains
very much your Company’s objective to achieve steady
growth and returns for Shareholders.
What has been achieved in the year under review is due to
the exceptional hard work of my colleagues all around the
Group and the continued loyalty of our clients to whom I
must express sincere thanks. Since the year end we have
welcomed Simon Miller as a Non-Executive Director of
the Company, his considerable City experience will be
invaluable to the Board. He, John Hall, our Chief
Executive, with whom I am working very closely in the
transitionary period prior to his retirement, Robin Bayford,
our Finance Director and Vikram Lall who has given many
successful years to our corporate finance side, will be
standing for election or re-election at the 28 February
2006 Annual General Meeting. I commend their many and
varied talents to you.
Your Company is firmly committed to pursuing the
achievement of another good performance for the 
year ahead.

Chairman’s Statement
pp 01-07:pp 01-07  30/12/05  11:15 am  Page 5 Page 6 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC
Annual Report and Accounts For the year ending September 2005
It is always a pleasure to report on a good set of figures
and that is certainly the case for the Group for the year
ended 30 September 2005. The market background
against which we have been operating during those twelve
months has been relatively benign although it did not
always appear that this would be the case.
For the year ended 30 September 2005 your Group’s
profits before tax, before an exceptional item covered later
in this report, and before goodwill amortisation,
amounted to £24.7m against £16.1m in 2004 an increase
of 53%. Fully diluted earnings per share calculated on the
same basis were 8.3p against 5.6p in 2004, an increase of
48%, whilst basic earnings per share, again before an
exceptional item and goodwill amortisation, were 8.7p
against 5.7p, an increase of 53%. Basic earnings were
4.1p per share against 3.5p per share after taking into
account the exceptional item and goodwill amortisation,
still an increase of 17%.
We have continued our past practice of paying dividends in
April and October. On 27 September 2005 we announced a
second interim dividend of 2.5p (2004: 2p) making a total
of 4.5p against 3.5p in 2004, an increase of 29%. We
propose announcing the first interim payment for 2006 at
our AGM on Tuesday 28 February 2006.
When the full Statutory Accounts are published it will be
seen we have anticipated the requirement to prepare
consolidated financial statements under the new
International Financial Reporting Standards and prepared
a report showing the effect of these on our 2005 Results
and Balance Sheet. These Standards may change;
however, applying these in their current state, there would
be no change to earnings per share before goodwill
amortisation and an increase in unadjusted earnings per
share due to the removal of goodwill amortisation. The
restated Balance Sheet will show a reduction in net
assets, from £89 million to £77 million, this is primarily
due to the recognition of pension liabilities. For regulatory
purposes, the effect on our capital will not be significant.
The exceptional item referred to above includes the £5m
contribution made to Fund Distribution Limited for the
benefit of those who lost money in Zero Dividend
Investment Trust shares. The exceptional charge has been
taken to the profit and loss account, plus other directly
attributable costs, less recoveries to date. We do not
believe that any further provision for Split Capital
liabilities is required.

The value of discretionary funds under management on
30 September 2005 had risen to £6.9bn compared with a
figure of £5.6bn a year earlier, an increase of 23%. We are
particularly pleased with this increase, as can be seen
from the figures above; discretionary fund management is
the most profitable part of our business. Putting a single
aggregate transaction through the market and the office
is far more efficient, and there is no doubt that being able
to react to market situations quickly enables us to obtain
a better overall return for our discretionary clients and we
continue to recommend this service to our clients.
Advisory fund management, however, continues to be a
very important area for us and the value of funds under
advisory management in our nominee or sponsored
member account has risen to £6.7bn compared to £5.8bn
a year ago. Many trusts and other long established clients
make use of this service. In addition a number of our new
clients take it as a starting point and clients pay a basic
annual fee.
Chief Executive’s Report
pp 01-07:pp 01-07  30/12/05  11:15 am  Page 6 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Page 7
Annual Report and Accounts For the year ending September 2005
Stocktrade has enjoyed another successful year. The
strategy to concentrate on alliances and corporate clients
has again proved its worth with the number of companies,
to which we provide dealing services, rising above 120
with 37 of those currently in the FTSE 100. We are also
well positioned to take advantage of the increase in
activity within SIPPs, providing execution only dealing
services to the leading SIPP Administrators.
We had anticipated that the PEP/ISA business could come
under pressure as a result of the reduction in the tax
advantages which it enjoys, but we are pleased to report
that withdrawals have been more than offset by new
business transferred in. The fee income has risen to
reflect the increase in the general level of the market.
Over the past twelve months we have strengthened our
Financial Planning Division to enable us to provide the
broadest range of financial advice covering not just
investment but also financial planning, inheritance tax
planning, school fee schemes and pensions advice. Last
year we recruited a further eight financial consultants and
we now have thirty-eight fully qualified consultants who
are based in twelve offices around the country. From there
they can easily visit our other branches and arrange
meetings with clients wherever they are based. We plan to
develop this aspect of our coverage in the coming year.
We opened a branch in Belfast at the end of February
2005. It is trading under the name of Bell Lawrie reflecting
the close links between Northern Ireland and our Scottish
offices. I am pleased to report that it has made a very good
start building a significant client base, we have seven
investment advisers in the branch and we expect it to be a
significant contributor to Group profits in future years.
In London we have welcomed a number of new
investment advisers and also a direct marketing team
which specialises in pensions advice, particularly
important with the approach of ‘A’ day next April. The
latter manage portfolios in conjunction with our well
established and successful model portfolio, or
alternatively with one of our investment managers on our
usual bespoke lines.

Revenues in our Corporate Broking Divisions overall rose
by 10% and there was a gratifying improvement in
margins. The year made a quiet start but momentum
gathered pace significantly in the second half and is
continuing.
During the year we opened a new Corporate Finance
branch in Birmingham which has made an encouraging
start. Additional investment has been made in improving
systems and in recruiting new staff. We have continued to
gain market share through the acquisition of new
corporate clients.
Conclusion
I cannot conclude without thanking all our staff for their
immense effort in achieving this excellent set of figures as
well as our clients for their continued loyal support. The
year has started well and providing markets remain at
current levels or continue to advance steadily, as we are
presently forecasting, then we can expect good progress
from your Group over the coming year.

Chief Executive’s Report
pp 01-07:pp 01-07  30/12/05  11:15 am  Page 7 Page 8 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC
Annual Report and Accounts For the year ending September 2005
Business Overview
The Brewin Dolphin Group has one principal operating
Company, Brewin Dolphin Securities Limited, which is
regulated by the Financial Services Authority. 
Trading 
2005 saw the continuation of the strong recovery started
in 2004. 
Dividend
The improvement in profitability enabled the Board to
increase the total dividend paid in the year to 4.5p 
(2004: 3.5p).
Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure
2005 saw a small cash inflow after a substantial increase
in capital expenditure in relation to computer systems. In
total, capital expenditure, including expenditure on long
term investment, was £6.6m up from £2.6m in 2004.
Capital Structure, Treasury Policy and 
Capital Requirement
At 30 September 2005 the Group had net assets excluding
goodwill of £51m (2004: £47m), representing the Group’s
capital for regulatory purposes. These net assets were
largely represented by net cash of £50m (2004: £50m) at
the year end, including £12m (2004: £12m) of client
settlement money. For regulatory purposes the Group
needs to maintain a net asset surplus so that it can always
meet its liabilities. The new International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), and new capital adequacy
requirements will mean a number of changes to the
calculations required. These have been worked through in
detail and it is anticipated that the Group’s capital will on
today’s figures not be less than 175% of the requirement. 
The Group’s treasury policy remains straightforward. It
has no borrowings, and maintains substantially all its
cash with the Bank of Scotland, part of HBOS, where
substantially all client cash is also deposited. HBOS has
one of the highest credit ratings of the major UK clearers.
This policy means we take no material liquidity risk.
Currency risk is normally insignificant with all
transactions matched on a bargain by bargain basis, see
note 22 to the accounts for further details.
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
The Directors have looked into the necessary adjustments
to bring the Group’s accounts onto an IFRS basis as is
required for the year to 30 September 2006. These
adjustments, and the required new accounting policies,
are set out on pages 48 to 56.
The preliminary IFRS financial information set out on
pages 49 to 56 has been audited by our auditors, who have
reported to the Directors. A copy of the auditors report to
the Directors is provided on page 57.
Going Concern
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors have
formed a judgement that there is a reasonable
expectation that the Company and the Group have
adequate resources to continue in operational existence
for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial
statements.

This policy will be put forward for approval at the Annual
General Meeting.

Employment Policies
Brewin Dolphin recognise that our staff are vital to the
continued success of the Company.
Staff are encouraged to identify with, and to become
involved with, the financial performance of the Group and
service to clients by extensive profit sharing and bonus
arrangements. In addition, the employees own over 28%
of the Group.
Communication
Communication to our staff is essential. Staff are kept
informed of key issues affecting them, and the Group, by:
intranet; quarterly Group meetings around the country,
which include question and answer sessions; and email
where appropriate. In addition, management accounts are
widely distributed.
Training & Development
The Group has a substantial training department to
ensure continued learning, growth and development for
all. Each member of staff completes an assessment of
Continued Professional Development twice a year, which
is monitored to ensure continued development and
growth. Each member of staff must participate in an
annual development review. This review will highlight any
training requirements of the individual to assist their
career progression. From this review our training
department will structure tailored training programmes
to meet the individual’s needs. Training is both actively
encouraged and supported by the Board.

Equal Opportunities
It is the policy of the Group to provide equal opportunities
in employment irrespective of colour, race, nationality,
ethnic or national origin, sex, mental or physical
disabilities, marital status or sexual preference. For staff
who may have a disability, the Company ensures that
procedures and equipment are in place to aid them. 
For the purposes of training, career development and
promotion, all staff are treated in the same way.
Benefits
The Company is proud of the attractive benefits available
to staff. All staff are allowed to participate in our interest
free loan facility in respect of an annual season ticket for
travelling to and from work. In addition, all staff have the
option of joining our private medical insurance scheme. 
The Company offers a flexible benefits package for senior
staff which includes permanent health insurance and a
company car facility. 
The Company recognises the need for an equal work/life
balance for staff which not only improves morale within
the Group, but helps to retain staff.
We are proud to report that staff turnover is very low.
Employee Assistance Programme
The Company provides a confidential 24 hour helpline
available to all staff as we are aware that from time to
time staff may need advice on issues on matters such as
employment, personal, financial or legal.
Pension
The Group has a normal retirement age of 65. In
recognition of retirement, all permanent staff are invited
to join the senior staff pension scheme after successful
completion of their probation period. Other than those
staff participating in our flexible benefits package,
members of the senior staff pension scheme receive a
generous employer contribution of 6% into the scheme.
Mrs Linda Cartwright is the Group’s Personnel Director. 
Charitable Fundraising
During the last year our Branches have organised a great
number of fundraising events for local and national
charities raising over £110,000 between them. The
Company has contributed in cash and in kind to all these
events, which have ranged from marathon running to
parachute jumping. Branches have been involved in
coastal cleaning projects and saving dolphins and many of
our Divisional Directors provide pro bono director and
trustee services to local charities and hospices. Towards
the end of the year a Stocktrade colleague set off to row
the Atlantic single handedly, aiming to raise £100,000 for
charity.
Sponsorship
In addition to these fundraising activities the Company
also sponsors a number of sporting and charitable events
around the country, including the Bell Lawrie Scottish
Series sailing competition, an event organised by Clyde
Cruising Club whose aim is to promote sailing, including
sailing for the disabled. The Bell Lawrie division also
sponsors the Scottish Schools Cup which encourages
rugby for children in all schools throughout Scotland.
Brewin Dolphin received an Arts & Business Award for
sponsoring the Arts in the South West of England.
Community Policy
Two of your Directors are presently High Sheriffs. Ben
Speke and Simon Still are High Sheriffs of
Northumberland and Durham, respectively. The office is
voluntary, independent and non-political and they are
both particularly active in promoting the reduction of
crime and the development of an anti-crime culture
among young people in these areas. The Wise Speke
division was involved in the start up of the Newcastle
Young Professionals Forum which now has over 1,000
members in the North East and this year raised £16,000
for charity. Throughout the Company we have a policy of
providing work experience placements for students in
many branches, for a number of weeks each, per annum.

Creditor Payment Policy
It is the Group’s policy to settle all of its trading
transactions on the agreed settlement date; this policy
extends to other trade creditors, which are normally paid
within 30 days. On average, creditors were paid within ten
days in 2005 and 2004.
Environmental and Ethical Matters
In the Ethical sector, the Company acts as nominated
stockbroker to Cafedirect, Traidcraft and The Ethical
Property Company and is helping to promote share
ownership of fair trade businesses around the UK.
The Group makes every effort to reduce its environmental
footprint. It has reduced the use of paper by encouraging
electronic communication both to and from its clients by
the use of the internet and internally by the widespread
use of the intranet. 
Simon Still is the Director responsible for environmental
matters. The Board have considered areas where there
may be environmental risk from direct actions by the
Group. This risk is considered to be minimal, as in all
cases the Group’s offices are located in large towns and
its activities are desk based. The Group’s major suppliers
are UK based and mainly provide market data and
computer hardware and software. Simon Still ensures
that appropriate environmental considerations are
considered when a new supplier is chosen. Overseas
labour or call centres are not used.
While the Group’s overall investment policy is solely
concerned with obtaining the best return for clients, it is
our policy to construct portfolios, which take into account
the personal preferences of our clients in relation to
ethical and environmental matters.
We have a specialist Ethical Investment Service. In
providing this service we have enlisted the help of EIRIS,
who since 1983 have been helping investors, choose
shares on ethical grounds.
There are three levels of service provided:
• Ethical Collection – a fund-based approach for
investors wishing to spread their risk. In this service
the principal investments are unit or investment
trusts investing in ethical companies. The emphasis
of each may be different and the service is designed
to provide an indication of the thrust of the principal
investments available and their respective historical
performance. This is a discretionary service option.
• Ethical Emphasis – a facility for investors wishing to
avoid the negative criteria, or even encourage the
positive ethical contribution, of a particular sector
or invest within their broader investment portfolio,
without necessarily impacting on all of their
investments – an ethical “pick and mix”. In this
service we have established a number of
benchmark criteria for measuring the positive or
negative ethical impact of specific sectors, thereby
creating a “black” or “white” list for the purposes of
investment selection. This service can either be run
on a discretionary or advisory basis.
• Ethical Concentration – a customised, in-depth
service for clients with detailed ethical
requirements and whose portfolios need to be
constructed or screened with reference to specific
and detailed ethical criteria. In this instance an
in-depth questionnaire is completed by the client at
the outset. As implied, this service allows individual
clients to effectively set their own ethical criteria, to
which the fund manager will always refer when
selecting the individual investments in the 
clients’ portfolio. This option is only available as a
discretionary service.
Auditors
A resolution to re-appoint Deloitte & Touche LLP as the
Company’s auditors will be proposed at the forthcoming

corporate governance and to compliance with the best
practice provisions of the Combined Code on corporate
governance published in July 2003 by the Financial
Reporting Council (“the Combined Code”). This statement
explains how the Group has applied the principles of good
governance contained therein. 
The Board
Throughout the year the Board had eleven members,
comprising seven Executive Directors and four Non-
Executive Directors. All the Non-Executive Directors are
regarded as independent save for Vikram Lall who was an
Executive Director until December 2003. Biographies of
all the Directors are presented on page 58. One third of
the Board is re-elected each year . Sir Fred Holliday retired
from the Board on 30 September 2005. Simon Miller
joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director on
27 October 2005.
The Board maintains a schedule of matters reserved for
the Board which was updated and approved in October
2005. The specific responsibilities retained by the Board
include: establishing Group strategy and approving the
annual budget; reviewing the Group’s operational and
financial performance; approving major acquisitions,
divestments and capital expenditure; reviewing the
Group’s systems of control and risk management;
approving appointments to the Board and the Company
Secretary; approving policies relating to Directors’
remuneration and the severance of Directors’ contracts;
and ensuring that a reasonable discourse occurs with
shareholders.
The Board met ten times during the course of the year. All
meetings were attended by all Directors save that Messrs
Williams, Hood and Holliday missed one board meeting
each. 
The Non-Executive Directors meet with the
Chairman/Chief Executive prior to most Board meetings.
On four occasions during the year the Non-Executives met
on their own.
New Directors receive an appropriate briefing when they
first join the Board. And at least once a year the whole
board attends a training seminar; in 2005 there were two
training sessions covering systems and regulation.
Executive members of the Board have to date been
appointed from within the Group and have served on the
Brewin Dolphin Securities Limited Board prior to
appointment.
Appointment of an Executive Chairman
The Board and the Nomination Committee have for some
time been considering Board succession. The Board felt
that it was very important that there should be a smooth
seamless transfer of responsibility from the Chief
Executive on his retirement, and especially that 45 years
of experience built up by John Hall should not be wasted
but passed on. 
The model of having a Non-Executive Chairman and a
Chief Executive was first adopted by the Group when 85%
of the shares were owned by members of staff and there
were venture capital loans to the Group, with the
Chairman being appointed by the venture capitalists. 
The Board considered whether this model was still
appropriate at a time when 29% of the Group was owned
by staff and the next largest holder owned 7% of the
Company. The Board considered that its main asset was
its employees and that it was essential that they should
feel that they had direct access to the Chairman who
should have detailed knowledge of the industry. 
The Group has always prided itself on its flat management
style and low overheads. Until the appointment of the
Executive Chairman only the Chief Executive, Finance
Director and Chief Operations Officer were involved in
day-to-day management of the Group. The other
Executive Directors main role remained that of looking
after clients.
This structure and the strong representation of fund
managers on the Board is attractive to new teams joining
the Group.

Annual Report and Accounts For the year ending September 2005
It is noteworthy that a number of other similar Financial
Services companies, where there is a substantial staff
holding in the company, have executive chairmen.
It was therefore determined to appoint an Executive
Chairman, and a Non-Executive Deputy Chairman. In
November 2004 Sir Fred Holliday stood down from the
Nomination Committee and Christopher Legge and
Vikram Lall were appointed to the Committee.
The Nomination Committee met and interviewed four
internal candidates for the post of Executive Chairman.
Jamie Matheson was appointed Executive Chairman on
24 May 2005 and Sir Fred Holliday stood down as
Non-Executive Chairman. To facilitate a smooth handover
he did not retire from the Board until 30 September 2005.
Jamie Matheson is not considered to be an Independent
Director. Extensive consultation was carried out with
shareholders on his appointment.
Jamie Matheson is working closely with John Hall over
the transition period until John’s retirement and has
already visited all the Group’s branches.
Until 24 May 2005 there was a clear division of
responsibility between the Non-Executive Chairman and
the Chief Executive, which ensured that there was a
balance of power and authority. Following the
appointment of Jamie Matheson the Chief Executive and
Executive Chairman are working closely together over the
transition period.
There is a clear division of duties between the Executive
Chairman and the Non-Executive Deputy Chairman, with
written terms of reference. This ensures that there is a
clear balance of power and authority.
Jamie Matheson is a Non-Executive Director of AIM
VCT2 plc.
Committees of the Board
The Board has three standing committees: the
Nomination Committee; the Audit Committee and the
Remuneration Committee. These committees have
written terms of reference, which were last reviewed in
October 2005 and approved by the Board. Membership of
the committees is set out on page 4. The terms of
reference of the Committees can be obtained from the
Company Secretary. Sight of all Directors’ contracts, 
or, in the case of Non-Executive Directors, letters of
appointment, can be obtained via the Company Secretary.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Nick Hood.
The Chief Executive, by invitation, attended the
Remuneration Committee meetings held in the year for
part of its deliberations. There were two meetings of the
Remuneration Committee during the year attended by all
the Independent Non-Executive Directors.
Audit Committee
Jock Worsley took over as Chairman of the Audit
Committee from Sir Fred Holliday in January 2005 and
increased the number of meetings from two per annum to
four. Two meetings are primarily focused on reports from
the external auditors and two with reports from the
internal auditors and setting and monitoring the internal
auditors’ work programme for the year. 
Reports are received from the Compliance Officer and
Head of Internal Audit four times a year. Reports are
received from external auditors twice a year. The Group’s
results are reviewed twice a year.
The Finance Director, Chief Operating Officer, Compliance
Officer, Head of Internal Audit and the Company Secretary
normally attend all Audit Committees at the Committee’s
request; as does Vikram Lall for those meetings which
consider the Group’s results.
The Committee is able to call on other professional
advisers, when necessary, to carry out special projects.
The external auditors meet privately with the Audit
Committee at least twice a year without senior
management being present. One member of the Audit
Committee has recent relevant financial experience.

Annual Report and Accounts For the year ending September 2005
During the period under review the Committee met four
times and was fully attended by all its members save that
Nick Hood missed one meeting. 
Nomination Committee
Nick Hood took over the Chair of the Nomination
Committee from Sir Fred Holliday in November 2004. The
Nomination Committee met formally once to appoint the
Executive Chairman but during the lengthy process
outlined above there were a number of informal meetings.
Company Secretary
The Company Secretary is appointed by the Board as a
whole and is responsible for good information flows within
the Board and its Committees. The Company Secretary is
responsible for advising the Board on all governance
matters.
Insurance
The Company has arranged appropriate insurance cover
in respect of litigation against the Directors.
Board Evaluation
The Board has conducted a formal evaluation of its
performance in 2004/5 with each Director expressing his
views to the Chairman and the Chairman reporting these
results to the Board. Formal development reviews were
carried out on all Executive Directors by the Chief
Executive during 2005 in accordance with the Group’s
normal internal procedures.
The Group’s internal procedures for development reviews
were updated in September 2005 and will be applied to all
Directors for the year to 31 December 2005 with the
Chairman carrying out the reviews and the Independent
Directors reviewing the Chairman.
Relationship with Shareholders
The Company places a great deal of importance on
communication with shareholders and aims to keep
shareholders informed by regular communication. The
Group’s website is kept up-to-date covering all corporate
activity. Half-yearly reports, written on the Group by Equity
Development Limited, are available to all shareholders on
the Web at www.equity-development.co.uk. The Company
welcomes all shareholders to its AGM with the opportunity
to ask questions formally at the meeting, or more
informally afterwards. The Company’s policy is to announce
the number of proxy votes cast on resolutions at the AGM.
Auditors’ Independence
The Board uses the auditors solely for audit and related
activities. The sum paid to the auditors for non audit work
in 2005 relates mainly to the costs of an income tax and
dividend audit carried out at the request of the United
States Tax Authorities.
Another major accountancy firm carries out tax advisory
and similar work. The auditors were changed in 2001. It is
the Board’s policy to review formally the appointment of
auditors every six years.
Internal Control
The Board undertakes a full review of all aspects of the
Group’s business, identifies the main risks to the
business, and identifies the key controls to counter these
risks. Day-to-day review and monitoring has been
delegated to the Risk and Controls Committee of Brewin
Dolphin Securities Limited (BDS), which includes the
Group’s Chief Executive, the Finance Director, the Chief
Operating Officer, the Group Compliance Officer, Head of
Internal Audit and two further compliance personnel. This
Committee meets weekly.
The Compliance Department and Internal Audit carry out
continuous reviews. The Board considers reputational
risk, portfolio performance and the added risk of taking on
new teams and business streams. The level of complaints
is carefully monitored.
The Directors are responsible for the system of internal
control established by the Group, reviewing its
effectiveness and reporting to the shareholders that they
have done so. They report as follows:-
i) There is an ongoing process for identifying,
evaluating and managing the significant risks faced
by the Group as outlined above. This has been in

place for the period under review and up to the date
of approval of the annual report and accounts. It is
regularly reviewed by the Board and accords with
the guidance in the Combined Code. Any system of
internal control is designed to manage rather than
to eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business
objectives, and can provide only reasonable, and not
absolute, assurance against material misstatement
or loss.
ii) Financial results, key operating statistics and
controls are reported to the Board monthly, and
variances are followed up vigorously. Monthly
reports are received from the compliance and
internal audit functions.
iii) The Directors have reviewed the Group’s system of
internal controls and compliance monitoring and
believe that these provide assurance that problems
have been identified on a timely basis and dealt with
appropriately throughout the period under review
and up to the date of approval of the annual report
and accounts.
Compliance with the Combined Code
The Directors consider that they have complied with the
provisions of section 1 of the Combined Code throughout
the period ended 30 September 2005.

Annual Report and Accounts For the year ending September 2005
The members of the Remuneration Committee are: 
William Nicholas Hood CBE (Chairman)
Francis Edward (Jock) Worsley OBE, FCA 
Simon Edward Callum Miller (appointed 27 October 2005)
The Remuneration Committee consists solely of
Independent Non-Executive Directors. None of the
Committee members has any personal financial interests
(other than as shareholders), conflicts of interest arising
from cross Directorships or day-to-day involvement in
running the business. The Chief Executive and Executive
Chairman attend part of the meetings of the Committee
but not when their own remuneration is discussed. The
Finance Director provides factual and statistical
information to the Committee, which in turn can call for
external reports and assistance.
Policy on Remuneration of Executive Directors 
The remuneration of Jamie Matheson, the Executive
Chairman from 24 May 2005, John Hall, the Chief
Executive, Robin Bayford, Finance Director, and Simon
Still, Chief Operating Officer, is awarded by reference to
the performance of the Group and their contribution to
enhancing future growth. The Remuneration Committee
reviews the basic salaries of these Directors together with
their profit participation, based on a number of factors
including work undertaken and comparable salaries. 
In assessing all aspects of pay and benefits, the
Remuneration Committee compares packages offered by
similar fund management companies. These companies
are chosen having regard to: 
i. the size of the Company – its turnover and numbers
of employees; and
ii. its growth pattern.
The Remuneration Committee also compares these
salaries to the remuneration of other senior employees
within the Group including the other Executive Directors.
The working of this policy can be seen in the table below
so that all Directors are remunerated within the same
framework.
The Committee determines the other Executive Directors’
basic salaries but their profit participation is determined
solely by reference to their own team’s performance on
strict formulae in line with other fund managers or
corporate financiers within the Group. Teams normally
share at 30% to 40% of profit after paying a full
contribution to Group overheads. The members of the
team, depending on individual performance, determine
the split of profit share within the team. The profit share
percentage can rise to 45% on the margin or be as little as
20% depending on pre determined formulae based on
total team salary.

Terms of the Option Schemes (Audited)
The Group’s two approved employee option schemes were
adopted in 1994 and 2004 respectively and the Share-Save
Scheme in April 1998. An unapproved option scheme 
was adopted in 1999 though to date only 100,000 options
have been granted under this scheme. The approved and
unapproved option schemes have the same performance
criteria, namely that the year on year growth in annual fee
income charged on portfolios shall not be less than 10%
per annum compound or a 33% increase in annual fees
over a three year period. Under the above schemes the
number of options over ordinary shares may not exceed
10% of the Company’s ordinary share capital over a ten
year period. The approved and unapproved options are
exercisable from five to ten years from grant. The
Share-Save Scheme options are exercisable from three to
five years of grant. It is the current intention of the
Directors not to issue more shares under the Share-Save
Scheme thus reducing the limit to 5% over ten years 
over time.
The Senior Employee Matching Share Purchase Scheme is
additional to the above schemes and allows a further 5%
issue of options over a ten year period, provided that a
similar number of shares are subscribed for by senior
executives at the price the options are issued at. These
shares are issued nil paid but have to be subscribed for at
the earlier of the exercise of the matching option, the sale
of the shares, the employee leaving the Group, or after
seven years. The options can be exercised within four to
seven years. There are two strict performance criteria for
the options to be exercised involving both the executive
team’s profitability and Group earnings per share exceeding
the growth in the retail price index by 4% compound and 2%
compound respectively. This is a criteria thought to be
realistic but not easy to achieve. This formulae recognises
that the Group operates in a cyclical business but the
compound rate of return means that the hurdle increases
over time if the decision to exercise is not taken at the first
opportunity which would not be encouraged as the
incentive is seen to be long term and matched by an equal
commitment with considerable risk by the employee.

Policy on External Appointments
The Group encourages external appointments at senior
level. Directors’ fees arising from external appointments
are either paid to the Group or taken into account in
assessing the overall executives’ remuneration package.
Group Policy on Contracts of Service
All senior executives including Executive Directors have
substantially identical six-month rolling contracts. There
are no exceptional termination provisions for Directors.
All contracts include six-month garden leave clauses,
which are vigorously enforced. If Directors were allowed to
leave without going on garden leave within the six-month
notice period the normal policy would be to only pay them
for the period worked. Profit share is never paid to any
member of staff who has indicated that they will be
leaving except in the case of ill health or retirement when
exceptions can be made.
The commencement date of the executive contracts are
as follows: -
J.P. Hall January 2000
R.A.Bayford January 2000
C.D. Legge January 2000
J.G. Matheson November 2003
I.B. Speke August 1998
S.J.H. Still January 2001

Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration
The Board determines the level of Non-Executive fees.
Non-Executive Directors have three year letters of
engagement.
Material Contracts with Directors
Other than the loans set out above, there were no material
contracts between the Group and the Directors. The
Directors undertake transactions in stocks and shares in
the ordinary course of the Group’s business for their own
account. The transactions are not material to the Group in
the context of its operations. £Nil was outstanding in
respect of these transactions at 30 September 2005 and
24 September 2004.

Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Page 21
Annual Report and Accounts For the year ending September 2005
United Kingdom company law requires the Directors to
prepare financial statements for each financial year,
which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
Company and the Group as at the end of the financial
period and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply
them consistently; 
• make judgements and estimates that are
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have
been followed; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume
that the Company and the Group will continue in
business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper
accounting records which disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company
and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the
financial statements comply with the Companies Act
1985. They are also responsible for the system of internal
control, for safeguarding the assets of the Company and
the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

To the Members of Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC
We have audited the financial statements of Brewin Dolphin
Holdings PLC for the 53 week period ended 30 September 2005,
which comprise the consolidated profit and loss account, the
consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses, the
consolidated and company balance sheets, the consolidated cash
flow statement, and the related notes 1 to 24. These financial
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set
out therein. We have also audited the information in the parts of
the Directors’ remuneration report that are described as having
been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body,
in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
company’s members those matters we are required to state to
them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the
company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report,
or for the opinions we have formed.  
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As described in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities, the
company’s Directors are responsible for the preparation of the
financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom
law and accounting standards. They are also responsible for the
preparation of the other information contained in the annual report
including the Directors’ remuneration report. Our responsibility is to
audit the financial statements and the parts of the Directors’
remuneration report described as having been audited in
accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory
requirements and auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial
statements and parts of the Directors’ remuneration report
described as being audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report if, in our
opinion, the Directors’ report is not consistent with the financial
statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting
records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified
by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and transactions with
the company and other members of the group is not disclosed.
We also report to you, if in our opinion, the company has not
complied with any of the four directors’ remuneration disclosure
requirements specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority. These comprise the amount of each
element in the remuneration package and information on share
options, details of long term incentive schemes, and money
purchase and defined benefit schemes. We give a statement, to
the extent possible, of details of any non-compliance.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects
the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the July
2003 FRC Combined Code specified for our review by the listing
rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does
not. We are not required to consider whether the board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or
form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the Directors’ report and the other information contained
in the annual report for the above year as described in the
contents section including the un-audited parts of the Directors’
remuneration report and consider the implications for our report
if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial statements.
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom
auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence
relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and the parts of the Directors’ remuneration report
described as having been audited. It also includes an assessment
of the significant estimates and judgements made by the
Directors in the preparation of the financial statements and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the
circumstances of the company and the group, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements and the parts of the
Directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or
other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion, we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information
in the financial statements and the parts of the Directors’
remuneration report described as having been audited. 
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of
the state of affairs of the company and the group as at
30 September 2005 and of the profit of the group for the 53 week
period then ended, and the financial statements and those parts
of the Directors’ remuneration report described as having been
audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.

Annual Report and Accounts For the year ending September 2005
1. Accounting Policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in
relation to the Group’s financial statements.
(a) Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards
and under historical cost accounting rules, modified to include the revaluation of certain fixed assets.
(b) Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC and all its subsidiary undertakings.
The acquisition method of accounting has been adopted. Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings
acquired during the period are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition to the date
of disposal.
In the Company’s accounts, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost. Dividends received and receivable
are credited to the profit and loss account to the extent that they represent a realised profit for the Company.
In accordance with Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC has taken advantage of the legal
dispensation not to present its own profit and loss account. The amount of the profit for the financial period dealt with in
the financial statements of the Company is disclosed in note 8 to the accounts.
(c) Transaction date accounting
All securities transactions entered into on behalf of clients are recorded in the accounts on the date of the transaction.
(d) Turnover
Turnover comprises gross commission, management fees and other income, excluding VAT, receivable in respect of the
period. Other fees are taken to the profit and loss account when payment is contractually due.
(e) Foreign currencies
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities have been translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the
balance sheet date. Transactions during the period have been translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the time the
transactions were executed. All exchange differences are reflected in the profit and loss account.
(f) Depreciation of tangible fixed assets
Depreciation has been provided on the basis of equal annual instalments to write off the cost less estimated residual values
of tangible fixed assets over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Computer equipment 3 to 4 years
Office equipment 4 to 10 years
Leasehold improvements Over 5 years

Notes to the Accounts
1. Accounting Policies (continued)
(g) Investments
Investments in Group companies held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for impairment. Holdings in external
fixed asset investments are held at Directors’ valuation, or where quoted, market value.
Current asset listed investments are stated at the lower of cost and market value and unlisted investments at the lower of
cost and Directors’ valuation; in establishing market value account is taken of size of the holding and its marketability.
(h) Goodwill 
Purchased goodwill arising on business combinations in respect of acquisitions before 30 September 1998 was written off
to reserves in the year of acquisition.
Purchased goodwill (representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair value of the separable net
assets acquired) since then has been capitalised. Payments made to individuals as part of an acquisition who remain in the
employment of the Group are included within goodwill.
Goodwill is amortised to nil by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful life not exceeding 20 years, subject to annual
impairment testing. The useful life of goodwill is normally 20 years in respect of payments made to owners of a stockbroking
firm; payments made to individuals as part of an acquisition who continue to remain in the employment of the Group are
amortised over periods up to 7 years and the charge is included within the charge for goodwill amortisation within other
operating costs.
(i) Leases
Annual rentals on operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
(j) Pensions
The Group operates two types of pension scheme. The majority of senior employees are in a defined contribution pension
scheme; the majority of other employees are in a pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay. The
amount charged against profits represents premiums payable to the scheme in respect of the year. In the case of the
defined benefit scheme, payments are calculated so as to spread the cost over employees’ working lives within the Group.
The transitional arrangements of FRS 17 “Retirement Benefits” require certain additional disclosures to be given which are
shown in note 23. There is no effect on the results or financial position of the Group, as the transitional provisions only
require disclosures to be made.
(k) Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax
or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and
law. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods
different from those in which they are included in financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that
it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
(l) Netting of balances
Amounts due to and from counterparties due to settle on balance are shown net. Amounts due to and from counterparties
due to settle against delivery of stock are shown gross.
(m) Other operating income
Interest receivable and payable on client free money balances is netted to calculate the Group’s share of interest receivable
and included under the heading other operating income.

5. Exceptional Item – Split Capital Trusts
In December 2004 the Group made a £5m contribution to a fund (Fund Distribution Limited) set up under the auspices of
the Financial Services Authority for those who have lost money in Zero Dividend Shares. The charge for the period, included
within other operating costs and staff costs, represents this payment, less recoveries to date, plus other directly attributable
costs.
The Directors believe that, having carefully examined all claims received to date, no further provision for split capital
liabilities is required; they also consider that further liabilities, if any, are fully covered by insurance.
The Directors remain in discussion with the Group’s insurers in respect of claims for costs already incurred and expensed
regarding split capital trusts. An estimate of the further potential favourable financial effect is not given as the Directors
consider that any such disclosure would seriously prejudice their ongoing negotiations with insurers.

Group’s holding in Euroclear plc at £7.5m. This valuation took into account the Group’s share of net assets, dividend yield
and the prices of similar quoted Companies discounted for marketability. At 30 September 2005 this valuation was updated
and increased to £8.5m.

Notes to the Accounts
22. Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments
The Group acts as a fund manager and agency stockbroker and very rarely undertakes trading on its own behalf. Therefore
the Group does not hold derivatives or other financial instruments other than cash and securities.
All cash is repayable on demand (see note 16) and is held mainly at the Bank of Scotland in the UK. This in turn means that
the Group takes no interest rate risk and the credit risk is deemed to be minimal. The Group carries out at least annual
reviews of all its banks’ and custodians’ credit ratings.
The Group deals in foreign currencies on a matched basis on behalf of clients, limiting foreign exchange exposure. The total
net foreign exchange exposure at the year end was £163,000 (2004: £456,000).
The Group’s trade debtors and creditors are held on a matched basis and are largely settled between 1 and 25 days.
Consequently we have taken advantage of the exemptions provided in FRS13 in respect of short term debtors and creditors.
Loans to clients are repayable on demand, and are secured against marketable securities. Loans to staff are repayable over
5 to 10 years and are secured against the Company’s shares (see note 15). The market value of current asset investments
is shown in note 14.
23. Pensions
The Group operates two pension schemes for its employees comprising a defined benefit scheme and a defined
contribution scheme. The pension charge was as follows:
2005 2004 
53 weeks 52 weeks
£000’s £000’s
Defined benefit scheme – including death in service contributions 1,722 2,234
Defined contribution scheme 6,498 4,139
8,220 6,373
The assets of the schemes are held by trustees in funds separated from the Group’s finances.
The following disclosure is made in accordance with the provisions of FRS 17 “Retirement Benefits”.
The Group operates one active defined benefit scheme in the UK, the Brewin Dolphin Securities Limited Retirement Benefit
Scheme (Brewin Dolphin Scheme). This Scheme is closed to new members, and no employee contributions for those under
55 have been paid into the scheme from April 2004 as these members ceased to accrue further service from that date.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 30 June 2003 and has been updated to 30 September 2005 by a qualified
independent actuary.
The main assumptions used by the actuary were (in nominal terms):
30 September 24 September 26 September
2005 2004 2003
% per annum % per annum % per annum
Rate of increase of salaries 2.8 2.9 2.6

The actuarial (loss)/gain can be analysed as follows:–
Actual return less expected return on pension scheme assets 3,666 613 1,935 (5,175)
Percentage difference between the expected and actual return 10% 2% 6% –26%
Experience gains and losses arising on the scheme liabilities 89 3 2,363 (3,382)
Percentage of the present value of the scheme liabilities – – 6% –10%

(666) (301) 2,423 (13,547)
Percentage of the present value of the schemes’ liabilities –1% –1% 6% –40%
The scheme is no longer admitting new entrants. The current service cost shown in the disclosure is calculated using the
projected unit method, as required by the FRS 17, and the percentage contribution rate required will, all other things being
equal, increase over time as the active membership of the scheme ages.

Chairman’s Statement
RECONCILIATION OF RESULTS AND EQUITY UNDER
UK GAAP TO IFRS
The year ending 30 September 2006 is the first period that
the Group has to present its financial statements under
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). This
year’s financial statements for the period ended 30
September 2005 have been prepared under UK GAAP.
To enable the readers of our accounts to understand the
impact of IFRS we have restated our balance sheet as at
30 September 2005 and our profit and loss account for the
53 week period then ended. We also show below the new
IFRS accounting policies, which we have adopted from 1
October 2005.
Basis of preparation
For the year ending 30 September 2006 the Group will be
required to prepare consolidated financial statements
under ‘International Accounting Standards’ as adopted by
the European Commission. These will be those
International Accounting Standards, International
Financial Reporting Standards and related Interpretations
(SIC-IFRIC interpretations), subsequent amendments to
those standards and related interpretations and future
standards and related interpretations issued or adopted
by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)
that have been endorsed by the European Commission.
This process is ongoing and the Commission has yet to
endorse certain standards issued by the IASB.
This preliminary IFRS financial information has been
prepared by management using its best knowledge of the
expected standards and interpretations of the IASB, the
facts and circumstances, and accounting policies that are
expected to be applied when the Group prepares its first
complete set of IFRS financial statements for the year
ending 30 September 2006. These accounting policies are
set out on pages 52 to 56. Therefore, until the Group
prepares its first complete set of IFRS financial
statements, the possibility cannot be excluded that the
accompanying preliminary IFRS financial information may
require adjustment. Moreover, under IFRS, only a
complete set of financial statements comprising a
balance sheet, income statement, statement of changes
in equity and cash flow statement, together with
comparative financial information and explanatory notes,
can provide a fair presentation of the Group’s financial
position, results of operations and cash flow.
The Group’s auditors have audited the preliminary IFRS
financial information set out below and have reported to
the Directors. A copy of the Group’s auditors’ report to the
Directors is provided on page 57.
The Group will apply the transitional provisions of IFRS 1:
First time adoption of International Financial Reporting
Standards. The Group’s date of transition to International
Financial Reporting and Accounting Standards was 25
September 2004. 
IFRS 1 contains a number of exemptions which companies
are permitted to apply. The Group has elected:
• to present comparative information in accordance
with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and
Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments:
Recognition and Measurement;
• not to restate its financial information for
acquisitions occurring before 25 September 2004;
• to recognise all actuarial gains and losses on
pensions and other post-retirement benefits directly
in equity attributable to equity holders of the parent
at 25 September 2004; and
• to apply IFRS 2 to all grants of equity instruments
after 7 November 2002 that had not vested as of 1
January 2005.

Accounting Policies
(a) Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for the
first time.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial
instruments. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
(b) Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC and all its subsidiary undertakings. 
The acquisition method of accounting has been adopted. Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired
during the period are included in the consolidated income statement from the date of acquisition to the date of disposal. 
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into
line with those used by the Group. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
(c) Transaction date accounting
All securities transactions entered into on behalf of clients are recorded in the accounts on the date of the transaction.
Preliminary IFRS Financial Information
pp 48-63:pp 47-62  30/12/05  11:18 am  Page 52 Accounting Policies (continued)
(d) Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents gross commission,
management fees and other income, excluding VAT, receivable in respect of the period. 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate
applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial
asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Other fees are taken to the income statement when payment is contractually due.
(e) Foreign currencies
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet
date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at
the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Transactions during the period have been translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the time the transactions were
executed.
All exchange differences are reflected in the income statement, except for any exchange differences arising on any non-
monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.
(f) Depreciation of tangible fixed assets
Depreciation has been provided on the basis of equal annual instalments to write off the cost less estimated residual values
of tangible fixed assets over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Computer equipment 3 to 4 years
Office equipment 4 to 10 years
Leasehold improvements over 5 years
(g) Investments
Investments are recognised and derecognised on trade date, where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract
whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially
measured at cost.
Investments are classified as either held-for-trading or available-for-sale and are measured at subsequent dates at fair
value. Where investments are held for trading, gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised through
profit and loss.
For available-for-sale investments, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity via
the revaluation reserve until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain
or loss is recognised and is included in the net profit or loss for the period, the revaluation reserve having first been reversed.
Any loss is limited to amounts written off below original cost, the revaluation reserve having first been reversed.

Annual Report and Accounts For the year ending September 2005
Accounting Policies (continued)
(h) Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets
and liabilities at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised
immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts
subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not
been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
(i) Leases
Annual rentals on operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis
over the lease term.
(j) Pensions
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made
to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the
Group’s obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
For defined benefit retirement benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit
Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised
in full in the period in which they occur. They are recognised outside the profit or loss and presented in the statement of
recognised income and expense (“SORIE”).
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised
on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit
obligation, as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset 
resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in
future contributions to the plan.
Preliminary IFRS Financial Information
pp 48-63:pp 47-62  30/12/05  11:18 am  Page 54 Accounting Policies (continued)
(k) Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year . Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expenses that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be
available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the
temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is
realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
(l) Netting of balances
Amounts due to and from counterparties due to settle on balance are shown net where there is a currently enforceable legal
right to set off the recognised amounts. Amounts due to and from counterparties due to settle against delivery of stock are
shown gross. 
(m) Other operating income
Interest receivable and payable on client free money balances is netted to calculate the Group’s share of interest receivable
and included under the heading other operating income.
(n) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset
does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the
cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

Annual Report and Accounts For the year ending September 2005
Accounting Policies (continued)
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying
amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an
expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated
as a revaluation decrease.
(o) Share based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share based payments. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS
2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments granted after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share based payments are measured
at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share based payments is
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected life used in the model has been
adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and
behavioural considerations.
(p) Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
(q) Shares to be issued including premium
Shares to be issued represent the Group’s best estimate of the amount of ordinary shares in Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC, which
are likely to be issued on the successful completion of acquisitions which involve deferred payments in the Company’s shares.
The sum is revised annually. Where shares are due to be issued within a year then the sum is included in current liabilities.

pp 48-63:pp 47-62  30/12/05  11:18 am  Page 56 Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom
auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the
amounts and disclosures in the preliminary IFRS financial
information. It also includes an assessment of the significant
estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation
of the preliminary IFRS financial information and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the circumstances of the
Group, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the preliminary IFRS financial information is free
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error . In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
preliminary IFRS financial information.
Emphasis of matter
Without qualifying our opinion, we draw attention to the fact that
page 48 explains why there is a possibility that the accompanying
preliminary IFRS financial information may require adjustment
before constituting the final IFRS financial information. Moreover,
we draw attention to the fact that, under IFRS, only a complete set of
financial statements comprising a balance sheet, income statement,
statement of changes in equity, cash flow statement, together with
comparative financial information and explanatory notes, can
provide a fair presentation of the Group’s financial position, results
of operations and cash flows in accordance with IFRS.
Opinion
In our opinion the preliminary IFRS financial information is
prepared, in all material respects, on the basis set out on page 48
and pages 52 to 56, which describes how IFRS will be applied
under IFRS 1, including the assumptions the directors have made
about the standards and interpretations expected to be effective,
and the policies expected to be adopted, when the Group
prepares its first complete set of IFRS financial statements as at
30 September 2006.

the assumptions the directors have made about the standards
and interpretations expected to be effective, and the policies
expected to be adopted, when the Group prepares its first
complete set of IFRS financial statements as at 30 September
2006. Our responsibility is to audit the preliminary IFRS financial
information in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal
and regulatory requirements and auditing standards and report
to you our opinion as to whether the preliminary IFRS financial
information is prepared, in all material respects, on the basis set
out on page 48 and pages 52 to 56. 
We read the other information contained in the annual report for

Notes.
1. A member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting convened by this notice is entitled to appoint one or more proxies to attend and, on a poll, to vote
in his/her/its stead. A proxy need not be a member of the Company.
2. A form of proxy is enclosed and, to be valid, must be lodged with the Company’s registrars, Lloyds Bank Plc, Registrars Department, The Causeway,
Worthing, West Sussex BN99 6DA, not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the holding of the meeting. Submitting a proxy does not prevent
a member from attending the meeting and voting in person.
3. Under Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, only those members who are registered on the Company’s share register at
9 am on Monday 27 February 2006 are entitled to attend the meeting and to vote in respect of the number of shares registered in their names at that
time. Changes to entries on the share register after 9 am on Monday 27 February 2006 shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to
attend and/or vote at the meeting.
4. Brief biographies of the Directors are set out on page 58.
5. The Directors have no present intention of exercising the authority to allot relevant securities pursuant to resolution 8. As at 10 November 2005 and at
the date of this notice, the Company does not hold any shares in treasury.
6. The directors have no present intention of exercising the authority to make purchases of the Company’s shares pursuant to resolution 11. If exercised
the shares would be held in treasury. If granted, the authority would only be exercised if it was expected that an improvement in earnings per share
would result and that the purchase would be in the best interests of shareholders generally. As at 10 November 2005 the latest practicable date prior
to publication of this notice there were outstanding options to subscribe for a total of 11,752,537 ordinary shares of 1p each in the Company. These
options represent 5.9% of the Company’s issued share capital as at 10 November 2005. if the authority under resolution 11 to make market purchases
is granted and then exercised in full, the options would represent 6.6% of the Company’s issued share capital as at 10 November 2005.
Electronic proxy appointment through CREST 
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the Annual General Meeting
to be held on 28 February 2006 and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST Personal Members or other
CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service
provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must
be properly authenticated in accordance with CRESTCo’s specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the
CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or to an amendment to the instruction given to a previously
appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID 7RA01) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy
appointments specified in the notice of meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to
the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by
CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that CRESTCo does not make available special
procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy
Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member
or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to
ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their
CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST
system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.

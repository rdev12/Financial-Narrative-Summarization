Year ended 31 October 2005 Financial Highlights I am proud to report Research Now’s maiden results as a public company, following our Admission to AIM in August
2005. Sales and profits for the year ended 31 October 2005 both exceeded expectations at the time of our
flotation. Sales of £3.6m were more than 500% of the prior year and profit before tax of £0.5m was ten times the
equivalent performance in the 2004 financial year.
During the year, the Company established itself as one of the leading players in the online fieldwork and panel
market in Europe and expanded into new markets in Australia and America as a result of client demand. The
Company also significantly broadened its client base during the period and I am particularly pleased to note that
our sales were derived from a diversified range of more than 100 different clients in many industry sectors and
that much of the Group’s revenue came from repeat business.
The Group’s flotation on the AIM market in August last year proved to be very successful. The float was more than
twice subscribed, attracting an impressive register of institutional investors and successfully raising £9.2m,
substantially more than had initially been sought, of which £2.5m (gross of expenses) was raised for the Company
and the balance used to provide an exit for our angel investors.
I am delighted that Richard Dale agreed to join the board on the Group’s admission to AIM as a non-executive
director. Richard has a vast amount of experience in both the City and in the media industry, which will prove
invaluable in the future development of the business.
The market for the online collection of survey data or fieldwork is growing rapidly. To a large extent this growth
is as a result of an ongoing shift away from traditional ‘face to face’ or telephone interviews, to the use of online
panels of respondents. The collection of survey data online is not only faster and provides more accurate results
but is also far cheaper. In the US, the market for online fieldwork has grown by 30% p.a. over the last five years
and now accounts for 29% of the total fieldwork market (2000: 9%). In Europe, the online market lags that of the
US at only 4% of the total market but is showing similarly rapid growth patterns to that seen in the US over the
last five years.
I would like to take this opportunity of thanking all those who have contributed to the success of the Company.
Our clients, suppliers, advisors and investors have all been key to getting us to where we are today but I must
single out for special mention our people. It is tempting to portray an online business as being about efficiency
and seamless processes and, whilst this is true, quality and client service is at the heart of our business model. I
would therefore like to thank all our employees for their outstanding efforts during the last year.
Trading in the new financial year to date has continued to be excellent and we look forward to the future with
great confidence and excitement. We believe the market for online fieldwork in Europe is only just emerging and
we see many opportunities to continue our successful growth story.

Chairman’s Statement Overview
The year was one of great achievement as well as rapid and profitable growth for Research Now and I am pleased
to say our results are considerably above what was expected at the time of the Group’s IPO in August.
The float successfully raised £2.5m for the Company, providing additional funding to exploit the growth
opportunities in the market for online fieldwork. During the period, Research Now saw rapid growth on many
fronts, not least in terms of delivering many more projects to support five-fold revenue growth, but also in terms
of expanding our online panels, enhancing our IT systems and growing our team further.
The market for online fieldwork and panel services in Europe continues to expand, with the trend away from
traditional telephone and ‘face to face’ fieldwork continuing in favour of online alternatives. The collection of
survey data online is typically faster, more accurate and also more cost-effective than traditional techniques.
Results
Group turnover for the year to 31 October 2005 increased five fold to £3.6m (2004: £0.7m) and profit before tax
increased to £0.52m (2004: £0.05m). 
The Group’s strong performance was due to a combination of adding new clients and also increasing sales to
existing clients. Around 86% of Group revenue in the year was derived from custom ad-hoc projects, while the
remainder was from ongoing tracking studies.
The number of full time employees in the business increased from 11 at the start of the year to 46 by the year
end. Recruitment is a key area for the business; it is our firm belief that good people are at the heart of good
delivery and as such we have recruited excellent staff from both within the market research industry and beyond.
This has allowed us to grow rapidly while continuing to deliver high quality work to all our clients.
At the time of the float we stated that one of the areas we would focus on is developing our online consumer
panels, both in the UK and internationally, and as such we made an investment of £0.54m in this area during the
year.
Client Service
Research Now provides online fieldwork and panel services to a broad range of over 100 clients. The vast majority
of these are market research agencies, although the Group also provides fieldwork to an array of well known blue
chip and other corporate clients directly, along with a number of media and advertising agencies and consultancies.
Our largest client in the year accounted for only 10% of turnover and our breadth of clients is further illustrated
by the fact that the percentage of our turnover from large international market research agencies reduced from
43% in the first half of the financial year to 34% in the second half, while rising in absolute terms.
It is crucial to clients in the research industry that online survey data from fieldwork studies is of high quality and
delivered on time - accordingly we seek to differentiate ourselves through our quality of delivery and our online
research panels, with client retention a key indicator of our success.
During the year we continued to expand both the size and number of our branded ‘Valued Opinions’ panels and
also continued to introduce additional panel profiling, spanning specialist areas such as healthcare, in order to
increase the value and appeal of our panels to clients.
Reflecting client demand to deliver research projects across multiple countries, we launched new panels at the
beginning of the year in Germany, France, Spain and Italy, enabling us to provide a one stop shop solution for the
‘Big 5’ European economies. Later in the year, new panels were also recruited and launched to cover Austria,
Australia and the Republic of Ireland.
3
Chief Executive’s Review Our total number of panellists reached 707,000 by year end.
Although localised, each of the new panels follows the successful ‘Valued Opinions’ template, which the Group
originally pioneered in the UK. Cared for by our native language panel support teams based in London, our panels
are used solely for research purposes, with panel members earning a range of incentives designed to maintain
high response rates. Panellists are highly profiled and regularly screened in order to enable us to provide clients
with fast turnaround, accurate and dependable fieldwork.
At the beginning of the year, Research Now served UK clients from a single office in London. In line with our stated
strategy at IPO to increase returns from our existing panels by selling access to them to new clients in different
geographies, we have since opened a number of new international sales offices. In September the Group opened
a sales office in Australia, providing access to our Australian and European consumer panels to clients based in
the Asia Pacific region. In November, just after our year end, we announced the opening of our office in New York
and the appointment of a new team to drive sales of European interview data to the sizeable and relatively
developed market in the USA and Canada. More recently, in January 2006, we have announced the opening of an
office in Germany to build sales in the developing German market, capitalising on our 118,000-strong German
panel and our ability to deliver one-stop-shop international projects to German clients.
Outlook
We believe the market for online fieldwork in Europe will continue to expand rapidly, with the cost-effectiveness,
speed and quality of online data collection continuing to drive substitution of traditional fieldwork methods. 
During 2005, Research Now established itself as one of the leading players in this attractive market. In 2006 we
will maintain our focus on quality of delivery, continue investing in our online panels and continue to establish
sales channels in selected overseas markets where we are not currently active and where we believe returns will
be highest. The new financial year has begun well and we are well positioned to continue to take advantage of
the rapid growth in the online fieldwork market in 2006.

Chief Executive’s Review Admission to AIM
The Company placed 1,925,000 new ordinary shares at a price of 130 pence per share and was admitted to trading
on AIM on 4 August 2005. The Company raised £1,746,000 net of costs from this issue of ordinary shares.
Results for operations
The Group achieved sales of £3,639,000 (2004 £701,000) and operating profits of £510,000 (2004 £51,000).
Sales growth in successive half years is as follows:
Half Year Ending Unaudited £000
April 2004 241
October 2004 460
April 2005 1,259
October 2005 2,380
Gross margins improved to 80.3% (2004 72.2%) due to the reduction in work commissioned from other panel
providers and efficiency gains. This increase in margin represented more than half of our expenditure on panels
of £543,000.
The main elements of administration expenses are as follows:
2005 2004
£000 £000
Staff costs (excluding non-executive directors) 1,430 295
Depreciation and panel amortisation 319 3
Other overheads 664 157
Staff numbers have risen during the year but staff costs as a percentage of turnover have fallen to 39.3% (2004
42.1%). We were pleased to introduce a share incentive plan to all staff as part of the flotation process.
During the year the Company invested £543,000 (2004 £nil) in new panellists. Such amounts are written off over
the first twelve months and the asset at year end of £258,000 (2004 £nil) is treated as a current asset.
Other overheads as a percentage of turnover have fallen to 18.2% (2004 22.4%). During the year there was an
increase in trade marketing and costs associated with becoming and being a public company. The Group opened
offices in London, Athens and Brisbane during the period. The board constantly seeks internal efficiencies
consistent with the growth of the business.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)
The company calculates EBITDA as follows:
2005 2004
£000 £000
Operating profit 510 51
Add back:
Depreciation and panel amortisation 319 3
EBITDA 829 54
5
Financial Review The Company achieved an operating margin of 14.0% (2004 7.3%) and an EBITDA margin of 22.8% (2004 7.7%). Such
margins reflect the higher margins being achieved by the UK business being offset by the costs of operations and
panels in the start-up territories in which we operate.
Taxation
No tax charge arises on the profit for the financial year. At 31 October 2005 the Company has approximately
£3,520,000 of losses available to carry forward to set against future taxable profits, subject to agreement with
the Inland Revenue.
Working capital
The Company’s operational cash position has been strengthened by the placing in August 2005. At 31 October
2005, the Company had cash of £1,428,000 (2004 £62,000). The Company has no debt. At the end of the financial
year the Company had net current assets of £2,260,000 (2004 £93,000).
During the year the Company had cash outflows from operating activities of £249,000 (2004 £75,000). This outflow
reflects the investment in new panellists. In addition there were capital expenditures principally on computer
equipment and new office space of £196,000.
Pensions
The Company does not operate a defined benefit pension scheme and therefore at present there are no
circumstances in which the Company will face a future pension liability.
Financial instruments
During the period, the Company’s financial instruments comprised cash and various items such as trade creditors
that arise directly from operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Group’s
operations. The Company’s policy is, and was throughout the period under review, not to trade in financial
instruments.
Dividend
As indicated at the IPO the directors currently propose continued investment in growing the business and are not
proposing to recommend a dividend at present.

Directors’ Report Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of
the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those
financial statements, the directors are required to:
a. select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
b. make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
c. state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements;
d. prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the requirements of the
Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
9
Directors’ Responsibilities in the Preparation of Financial Statements The Board of Research Now plc appreciates the value of good corporate governance not only in the areas of accountability and
risk management but also as a positive contribution to the business. The Board considers that the Company, whilst trading on
the AIM, has adopted those requirements of the New Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the “Code”) published in July
2003 as best applicable to the Company given its current size.
Board Structure
The Board comprises two executive directors and three non-executive directors. The roles of chairman and chief executive are
separate. The non-executive directors are independent of management and free from any business or other relationship with
the Company other than owning shares. The directors’ biographies appear on page 7.
The board is scheduled to meet at least eleven times a year. At each meeting the chief executive and managing director report
on the Group’s operations. The board is satisfied that it is provided with information in an appropriate form and quality to
enable it to discharge its duties. All directors are subject to re-election by shareholders at the first opportunity after their
appointment. All directors are required to retire by rotation and one third of the board is required to seek re-election each
year. The Chairman ensures that the directors are permitted to take independent professional advice as required.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is responsible to the Board for ensuring that
Board procedures are followed and that applicable rules and regulations are complied with.
The following committees of the board have been established to deal with specific aspects of the Group’s affairs.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee consists of two independent non-executive directors, Charles Fairbairn as chairman and Richard Dale. The
Committee considers matters relating to the financial accounting controls, the reporting of results and the effectiveness and
cost of the audit. It aims to meet at least twice a year with the Group’s auditors in attendance. Other directors attend as
required. The Company Secretary provides secretarial support to the committee. The terms of reference of the committee are
available on request.
The audit committee is satisfied that the Group’s auditors, Baker Tilly, have been objective and independent of the Group.
Baker Tilly performs non-audit services for the Group, but the Audit Committee is satisfied that their objectivity is not impaired
by such work.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee consists of the three non-executive directors. The committee is chaired by Geoff Westmore, and
meets as necessary. The Committee is formally constituted with written terms of reference and is responsible for reviewing and
making proposals to the board on the appointment of directors. The Company Secretary provides secretarial support to the
committee. The terms of reference of the committee are available on request.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is formally constituted with written terms of reference and makes recommendations to the board
with regards to remuneration policy and related matters. The committee consists solely of two independent non-executive
directors, Richard Dale as Chairman and Charles Fairbairn. However the other directors attend as required and have the right
to address the committee. The committee aims to meet at least twice a year. The terms of reference of the committee are
available on request.
Further details of the Group’s policy on remuneration, including details of directors’ share options and compensation payments
are given in the Report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 12 to 13.
Shareholder Communication
The Group believes in maintaining good communication with shareholders. The Chairman and Chief Executive intend to meet
analysts and institutional shareholders regularly with a view to ensuring that the results, strategies and objectives of the Group
are well understood.
10
Corporate Governance Going Concern
The directors have satisfied themselves that the Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future, and for this reason the financial statements continue to be prepared on a going concern
basis.
Internal Financial Control
The Group has complied with the provisions of the Combined Code in internal control, having established the procedures
necessary to implement the guidance issued in September 1999 (the Turnbull Committee Report) and by reporting in accordance
with that guidance.
The Board is responsible for ensuring that the Company maintains a system of internal financial controls, including suitable
monitoring procedures. The objective of the system is to safeguard Company assets, ensure proper accounting records are
maintained and that the financial information used within the business and for publication is reliable. Any such system can only
provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material fraud or loss.
Given the Company’s size and nature of business, the Board does not consider it would be appropriate to have its own internal
audit function. An internal audit function will be established as and when the Company is of an appropriate size, but meanwhile
the audit of internal financial controls forms part of the responsibility of the Company’s finance function.
All day to day operational decisions are taken initially by the executive directors, in accordance with the Company’s strategy.
Where appropriate, the Board approves such decisions. The executive directors are also responsible for initiating all transactions
and authorising all payments, save for those relating to their employment. As such, the internal controls primarily comprise:
● The segregation of duties, such that the executive directors have no involvement in the recording of any financial data;
● The review of pertinent financial and other information by the Board on a regular basis;
● The prior approval of all significant strategic decisions; and
● Having a formal strategy for business activities.

Corporate Governance Remuneration Committee
The Group’s Remuneration committee is chaired by Richard Dale, and the other member is Charles Fairbairn. The remuneration
of all executive directors and other senior executives is recommended to the Board by the Committee. The remuneration of the
non-executive directors is determined by the Board. During the year the Committee has reviewed salary surveys and the policies
of other companies of a comparable nature but has taken no external advice.
Remuneration Policy
The policy of the Board is to provide executive remuneration packages designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the
calibre necessary to maintain the Group’s position as a market leader and to reward them for enhancing shareholder value and
return on investment. The remuneration should also reflect the directors’ responsibilities and contain incentives to deliver the
Group’s objectives. The main elements of the executive directors’ remuneration packages are as follows:
● Basic salary;
● Performance related bonus – the Company operates a discretionary performance related bonus scheme, the terms of
which are set annually in advance by the Remuneration Committee;
● Share option incentives – a number of share option plans are in place. Details of these plans and options granted are shown
below.
The Directors are not members of any company pension scheme.

Report of the Remuneration Committee TO THE MEMBERS OF RESEARCH NOW PLC
We have audited the financial statements on pages 15 to 29.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state
to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or
for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United
Kingdom Auditing Standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with
the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information
and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions
with the Company is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. This other information comprises only the Directors’ Report, Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Review,
Corporate Governance Report, Financial Review and the Report of the Remuneration Committee. We consider the implications
for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes
an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements,
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately
disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group at
31 October 2005 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended and have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.

Consolidated Cash Flow Statement
Reconciliation of Net Cash Flow to Movement in Funds Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting
standards in the United Kingdom.
Basis of consolidation
The Group’s financial statements consolidate the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings. The results of
subsidiary undertakings acquired in the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the effective date of
acquisition. As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, Research Now plc has not presented its own profit and loss
account.
Turnover
Turnover represents the invoiced value, net of Value Added Tax, of services provided to customers and income accrued on un-
invoiced work performed up to the period end. Accrued income represents the sales value of all complete and partially complete
project works for which the Company has not yet raised an invoice by the period end.
Tangible fixed assets
Fixed assets are stated at historical cost. Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write each
asset down to its estimated residual value evenly over its expected useful life, as follows:-
Computer equipment Over 3 years
Office equipment Over 2 to 5 years
Investments
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less any provision for impairment in value.
Stocks and work in progress
Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is based upon
estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal. Provision is made for obsolete and
slow-moving items.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date
where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future
have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its
results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods
different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are
expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Leased assets and obligations
All leases are “operating leases” and the annual rentals are charged to profit and loss on a straight line basis over the lease
term.
Foreign currencies
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. All differences are taken to
the profit and loss account.
19
Accounting Policies Rewards to Panel Members
Rewards are due to panel members for completing surveys. However, the legal obligation only becomes payable in the form of
store vouchers when a panellist’s balance reaches £5 or €10. Rewards owing to panellists with balances over these amounts are
accrued for on the balance sheet. Reward balances for panellists with balances under these amounts are disclosed as a
contingent liability (note 18).
Pension contributions
The Company contributes to certain employee’s personal pension schemes which are part of the Company Stakeholder scheme.
The assets of these schemes are held separately from those of the Company in independently administered funds. The amount
charged against profit represents the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
Panel investment costs
The costs of the recruitment of members to the Group’s online panels are debited to deferred expenditure when incurred and
released to the profit and loss account on a monthly basis, over an estimated average active panel membership period of
12 months.

Current tax:
UK corporation tax on profits of the period – –
Factors affecting tax charge for period:
Profit/(loss) on ordinary activities before taxation 524 53
Profit/(loss) on ordinary activities multiplied by the standard rate of corporation 
tax of 19% (2004: 19%) 100 10
Tax losses (utilised)/not utilised 512 (10)
Tax relief in respect of share options exercised (612) –
Current tax charge for the period – –
The Group has losses of approximately £3,520,000 (2004: £857,000) available to be carried forward against future profits of the
same trade.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised for tax losses carried forward on the basis that it is not sufficiently certain that
circumstances will arise in which these amounts would be recovered. If a deferred tax asset was recognised, based on an
assumed tax rate of 19 per cent, this would amount to approximately £669,000 (2004: £161,000).
Corporation tax relief has been claimed for the differences between the market value of share options exercised, less the
amount paid for the shares by the employees.
7 Profit of parent company
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account of the parent company is not presented as
part of these financial statements. The parent company’s profit for the period amounted to £528,000.

Earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders
Dilutive effect of securities:
Share options 560,705
Diluted earnings per share 10,042,289 5.2p
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average
number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, determined in accordance with the provisions of FRS 14: ‘Earnings per
share’.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue on the assumption
of conversion of all the potentially dilutive ordinary shares, these being share options granted where the exercise price is less
than the average price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year.
The 2004 basic and diluted earnings per share of 0.7p have been calculated as £53,000 of profit dividend by the 7,845,679
weighted average shares in issue.

Notes to the Accounts 13 Financial instruments
The Company’s financial instruments principally comprise cash at bank and various items such as trade debtors and creditors
that arise directly from operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise money for the Company’s
operations. The operations of the Company generate cash and the planned growth in activities is cash generative.
The Company’s policy is to ensure that adequate cash is available and the Company does not trade in financial instruments and
has not entered into any derivative transactions.
The majority of the Company’s activities take place in the United Kingdom and consequently there is minimal exchange risk. In
some cases overseas clients are billed in their local currency, and some overseas suppliers invoice in local currency. At
31 October 2005 the Company had no material foreign currency exposures.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in respect of the disclosure of short term debtors and creditors.
The fair values of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities are not considered to be materially different from their book
values.
All of the Company’s financial liabilities are due within one year, and none of these liabilities is subject to interest.

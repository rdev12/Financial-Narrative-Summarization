Chairman’s statement 
Overview
I 
am pleased to report that HomeServe has 
delivered against all of the targets we set at 
the start of the year, including a 4% increase 
in customer numbers and a retention rate of 
82.7% in the UK and £6.1m adjusted operating 
profit
2
 in the USA. 
We now have over 68m affinity partner 
households worldwide and have grown our 
worldwide customer numbers by 14% to 4.9m. 
The continued development of our customer 
portfolio, together with increasing policies per 
customer and high and stable retention rates, 
has delivered another year of strong earnings 
growth in all of our established markets.
Results
In the year, underlying revenue
1
 was up 15% and 
adjusted operating profit
2
 up by 14% to £119.2m 
(2010: £104.4m). Adjusted profit before tax
2
 was 
up 16% to £117.1m (2010: £100.6m) and adjusted 
earnings per share
3
 up 17% to 25.9p (2010: 22.2p) 
reflecting the growth in customer numbers, 
increased income per customer and the strong 
retention performance in all regions.
Free cash flow
4
 was £86.1m, up from £26.3m 
in the prior year with net debt at the end of the 
year of £11.8m (2010: £52.9m). Our balance sheet 
remains strong and the business continues to 
be highly cash generative.
On a statutory basis, revenue increased by 
27% to £467.1m, profit before tax has increased 
by 3% to £104.8m and earnings per share has 
increased by 5% to 24.0p.
Business developments
In the UK, our core utility marketing campaigns, 
together with our customer growth initiatives, 
have delivered a 4% increase in customer 
numbers (2010: 2.4%) with both water and 
heating policies higher than a year ago.  
In addition, our customers remain loyal with  
our UK retention rate stable at 82.7% (2010: 
83.0%), providing continued high visibility of  
our future earnings. HomeServe 
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 4
In the USA we have achieved strong organic 
growth during the year with gross new policy 
sales of 0.45m, 55% higher than a year ago, 
and we continue to make good progress in 
signing new affinity partners and acquiring 
existing home emergency policy books. In 
addition to the agreements announced in April 
2011 with National Grid Energy Services and 
Southern California Gas, we signed new affinity 
agreements with two utilities representing 1m 
households. Since the year end we have also 
signed two further agreements representing 
0.15m households together with 10k existing 
policies. Our USA business now serves 0.9m 
customers holding 1.4m policies, up 57% and 
83% respectively on a year ago.
Doméo, our French joint venture, has delivered 
an 11% increase in customer numbers and 
our share of adjusted operating profit
2
 has 
increased by 44% to £8.2m. Gross new policy 
sales in the second half of the year were over 
10% higher than in the same period last year, 
with the new marketing initiatives introduced 
during the year delivering good results.
In Spain we now have 0.17m customers 
holding 0.22m policies, more than double the 
number a year ago. We have developed our 
sales channels during the year, introducing 
an outbound telesales operation and we 
are expanding our product range with the 
management of Indesit’s manufacturer 
warranty programme. 
We continue to invest in our New Markets 
operations. In SFG (our French warranty 
business), we are developing a post point of 
sale and manufacturer warranty business 
and have signed agreements with Indesit 
and Mistergooddeal during the year. We were 
also pleased to commence a 15 month test 
marketing agreement with Enel Energia in Italy. 
Across the world our membership businesses 
managed over 1.3m repairs, an increase of over 
13% over the past 12 months, with increasing 
customer satisfaction levels.
Shares and Dividend
On 2 August 2010 a 5 for 1 sub division of the 
Company’s share capital was implemented to 
improve the liquidity and marketability of the 
ordinary shares of the Company. 
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 7p  
per share bringing the total dividend for the  
year to 10.3p (2010: 8.8p). The dividend increase 
of 17% is consistent with our objective of 
increasing our dividend in line with adjusted 
earnings per share
3
.
People 
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank  
all of our people for their contribution to  
another excellent set of results. In particular, 
thank you to our engineers and call centre 
agents who worked so hard to maintain 
customer service levels during the difficult  
winter weather conditions experienced in  
a number of our operations.
In the UK our people have worked closely with 
the charity, Marie Curie Cancer Care, on a 
number of initiatives and we are making good 
progress towards achieving our target of raising 
£1m over 3 years.
Board
During the year we have continued to review 
the structure of the Board and took the decision 
to strengthen it with two new appointments. 
On 5 July we appointed Jonathan King, Chief 
Executive of HomeServe USA, as an Executive 
Director and on 23 November we appointed 
Stella David, Chief Executive Officer at William 
Grant & Sons, as a Non-Executive Director.  
I would like to formally welcome them both  
to the Board. HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 5
Overview
Summary 
We have delivered another excellent set of 
financial results whilst continuing to invest in 
growing the business. Whilst recognising that 
a number of global economic uncertainties 
remain, we are continuing to implement our 
clear and focused strategy, delivering growth in 
both our UK and International operations. 
Our ‘business to consumer’ membership 
business model is delivering excellent results. 
HomeServe remains well positioned for the 
future and we look forward to another year of 
strong growth.

our customers from the worry and 
inconvenience of home emergencies  
and repairs.
>  Our core product range provides 
cover to ensure that homeowners’  
utility services (water, heating, electric)

to their home or car, whilst in Spain  
we launched our Club product which 
gives customers priority access to our 
network of repair engineers and includes 
2 hours free labour.

Each of these international businesses trades 
profitably and delivered excellent growth in 
operating margins and adjusted operating 
profits

 in 2011.
We are also investing in our New Markets 
where we are building our French manufacturer 
warranty business, Société Francaise de 
Garantie (SFG), consistent with our UK warranty 
business, as well as utility based membership 
businesses in Belgium and Italy. 
Worldwide gross new policy sales increased  
by 18% to 2.9m (2010: 2.5m) which, combined 
with high stable retention rates, has driven  
total policy numbers up 15% to 11.4m  
(2010: 9.9m). Total customer numbers across 
all our businesses have increased by 14% to 
4.9m (2010: 4.3m) driven by particularly strong 
performances in both the UK and USA. 
H
omeServe’s vision is to be the first place 
people turn to for home emergencies 
and repairs. We are achieving this by 
providing a membership service which frees our 
customers from the worry and inconvenience of 
home emergencies and repairs. Our business 
model of building long-term relationships with 
business partners, leveraging our product 
development expertise, producing leading 
sales and marketing materials and delivering 
excellent customer service with high renewal 
rates continues to deliver strong returns for 
shareholders with growth in adjusted profit 
before tax

 and adjusted earnings per share

.
We continue to grow our UK business, with 
an increased customer base and income per 
customer whilst replicating this proven model 
internationally in the USA, Spain and, through 
our joint venture Doméo, in France.

Business review
Our International operations currently deliver a 
relatively small, but fast growing, proportion of the 
Group’s profit. In 2011, adjusted operating profit
2
 
from our established International operations in 
the USA, Doméo and Spain more than doubled 
to £16.0m. Our International adjusted operating 
profit
2
, including the investment we have made in 
our New Markets operations of £1.1m was £14.9m, 
a 71% increase over the past twelve months. 
The penetration of our International households 
has increased from 3.2% to 4.3% over the past 
year and we believe this can grow further in the 
future enabling us to significantly increase the 
contribution from our International businesses in 
the medium term.
Across the world our membership businesses 
managed over 1.3m repairs, an increase of over 
13% over the past 12 months. We have a high 
quality network of engineers all of whom are 
vetted and managed by experienced contractor 
managers. We manage the performance of 
our engineers using a series of performance 
indicators and customer surveys. During 2011 
over 94% of all customers who had a claim were 
satisfied with the service they received, higher 
than a year ago. 
The following sections report on the performance 
of each of our business segments. Since last year 
we have reviewed our segmental presentation 
and now provide separate disclosure relating to 
each of our established businesses (UK, USA, 
Spain and Doméo, our joint venture in France), 
with those businesses that we are currently 
developing now classified together as “New 
Markets”.

We are pleased to report that we have achieved 
our customer growth target in the UK with 
customer numbers of 3.0m, 4% higher than 
a year ago (2010: 2.9m). We achieved gross 
new policy sales of 1.8m (2010: 1.6m), with 
total policy numbers increasing by 6% to 7.5m 
(2010: 7.1m). The growth in customer and policy 
numbers reflects the continued success of our 
core utility marketing campaigns, the growth 
in our manufacturer warranty business, as well 
as the contribution from our customer growth 
initiatives, including ‘One Contact’, landlord 
products and financial services partners. 
We have had an excellent year in terms of 
retention with the rate remaining high at 82.7%, 
as a result of a number of ongoing initiatives. 
Our retention call centre agents’ productivity and 
effectiveness have improved, further reflecting 
increased staff tenure, better training and 
coaching as well as the development of new 
retention products and propositions.

‘Other’ policies which includes pest and home 
appliance cover are particularly popular with 
Combined policy holders. Combined policies, 
which enable customers to consolidate multiple 
elements of cover into a single policy, continue 
to grow, and now represent 21% (2010: 19%) of 
UK customers. On average a combined policy 
customer holds six policy elements.
The success of One Contact, our ‘pay on 
use’ service, in delivering new membership 
customers is now becoming evident with the 
number of emergencies repaired during the 
year more than doubling. The proportion of 
customers converted into full policy members 
has also increased, finishing the year at over 
80%. In 2012, we will focus on increasing the 
number of One Contact emergencies repaired 
whilst maintaining the high job to member 
conversion rate. 
Subsequent to the year end, we aired a new TV 
and radio advertising campaign in the Granada 
TV region, promoting the HomeServe brand 
and our ‘0800 247 999’ telephone number. 
Whilst the campaign is targeted at developing 
our One Contact service, our utility partners in 
the region are very supportive of the campaign 
as it increases awareness of HomeServe and 
therefore the likelihood of customers buying 
policies in the future. Initial analysis of call 
volumes and policy sales is showing a positive 
impact from the campaign.
Over the past year we have made good 
progress in developing and rolling out our 
customer growth initiatives in the UK:
> We have seen a good take-up of our 
landlord and flat policies which have been 
sold through a mix of marketing activity 
including outbound telephony and direct 
advertising under the HomeServe brand. 
Our growth in the number of customers and 
our strong retention performance is particularly 
pleasing given the continuing uncertain 
economic climate and the perceived increase in 
competition following a number of high profile 
media campaigns from both new and existing 
home emergency providers. 
Our customer service proposition of directly 
employed, franchised and sub-contract 
engineers is delivering improved customer 
service with 93% of customers satisfied. Our 
network of around 300 directly employed 
plumbers completed over 80% of our water 
related repairs over the past 12 months with 
92% of jobs completed at the first visit. The 
coldest winter in 100 years presented a number 
of challenges for our engineers and we were 
satisfied with the level of service we delivered 
during this period despite record levels of 
emergency calls. 
We are pleased to report that we have 
continued to grow the number of our core water 
related policies. Water utilities continue to be 
key partners to our UK business and we are 
delighted that we completed the re-signing of 
all our partners that were due to renew during 
the year. We have now renewed all of our water 
utility partners, most for the third time, with the 
majority now being on long-term contracts. 
Manufacturer warranties remain a key part 
of our business with core renewable policies 
(where we have a direct ongoing relationship 
with the customer) increasing by 30% to 
503k. Over the past twelve months we have 
commenced marketing and administrating 
Dyson’s manufacturer warranty scheme in the 
UK, and subsequent to the year end, in April 
2011, we signed a deal with Ferroli, an Italian 
boiler manufacturer, to take over management 
of their warranty programme. HomeServe

> We have also had a successful year with the 
sales of our home assistance membership 
policies through our partnerships with 
financial services companies. Marketing 
is primarily via telesales activity and this 
represents a cost effective form of customer 
acquisition. During the past year we have 
worked with Santander, Northern Rock and 
a UK credit card company and are planning 
to further increase our financial services 
partnerships in the future.
> We have also signed affinity relationships 
with GB Oils, NWF Fuels and Total Butler 
who are the major distributors of oil to UK 
households who use this as their main 
source of fuel. We are continuing to develop 
and test our oil boiler breakdown marketing 
to identify the best creative and channel in 
order to maximise sales with customers of 
these partners. 
Income per customer in the UK increased  
by 9% to £89 over the past 12 months. This 
reflects the strengthening of our customer 
relationships, with the number of policies  
per customer increasing to 2.52 (2010: 2.47),  
as well as an increase in policy prices together 
with enhanced cover. 
Business review
Underlying revenue
1
 in the UK increased by 
10% reflecting the growth in customer and  
policy numbers as well as an increase in  
income per customer. The underlying operating 
margin

 in the UK was stable and adjusted 
operating profit

 increased by 9% to £104.3m 
(2010: £95.7m). 
The legislation for the proposed transfer 
of private sewers and lateral drains from 
homeowners into the ownership of the utility 
companies is currently passing through 
Parliament. This bill will help provide clarification 
to homeowners as to who is responsible for 
the drainage in and around their property. 
We estimate that the majority of our drainage 
related emergencies occur either within the 
property or in the external drain both of which 
will remain the homeowners responsibility and 
therefore we believe the proposed change will 
not impact our products and services. In fact 
we believe the legislation and clarification of 
responsibilities between the homeowner and 
the utility may provide us with an opportunity  
for additional sales of water related services.
We have decided to cease operating through 
the low margin, point of sale furniture warranties 
channel as we focus on growing relationships 
with our core utility and manufacturer partner 
customer base. HomeServe

an 83% increase in policy numbers
 > Increasing momentum in signing new

During the year we have gained significant 
momentum in signing new partners and  
acquiring existing home emergency 
programmes. We announced new affinity 
relationships with Southern California Gas 
and Millennium Energy, neither of whom have 
previously operated a programme. Southern 
California Gas serves over 5m residential 
customers whilst Millennium Energy serves 0.6m 
households through its Tuscon Power subsidiary 
(0.4m) and Unisource Energy (0.2m) subsidiaries 
in Arizona. 
In addition, we completed the acquisition and 
successful integration of National Grid Energy 
Services (NGES) in August, which included 0.18m 
customers, and we also agreed the terms in 
March on which we would renew the existing 
0.06m home assistance customers of South 
Jersey Energy Services Plus as they become due 
for renewal from mid 2011.
We are also pleased to have reached two 
further agreements since the year end with 
Contra Costa and Middlesex Water, both water 
utilities. These two utilities service around 0.15m 
households across California, New Jersey and 
Delaware and the agreements will allow us to 
bill customers via their utility bill. We have also 
agreed to purchase Middlesex’s existing 10k 
home emergency policies.
We now have 21m affinity partner households in 
the USA with an average penetration rate of 4%. 
Whilst the overall penetration in the USA is lower 
than in the UK, there is significant variation by 
individual partner, with rates ranging from less 
than 1% with our newer partners up to around 
30% with one of our oldest water utility partners.
The penetration rate also varies by the type 
of utility. Of our 21m USA affinity partner 
households, 2m are water and 19m are energy 
(gas and electric) households. We have achieved 
an average penetration rate of 15% across our 
water partners so far and we continue to see 
significant potential to increase the average 
penetration rate in our energy partners, where 
the highest penetration rate is around 20% with 
South Jersey Energy Services Plus.
We also see good growth opportunities through 
the increased penetration of our existing affinity 
partners as well as deepening our relationships 
with these customers through increased cross-
sell activity.
At the same time, we are actively talking to new 
potential partners whose customers have not 
previously been offered home emergency cover 
as well as actively discussing opportunities to 
acquire existing programmes run, for example, 
by utilities. We estimate that there are around 
35 programmes currently operated by utilities 
and we believe that we can grow them at a 
significantly faster rate than the existing utilities, 
as we have evidenced with those previously  
run by California Water, United Water and  
First Energy.
2011 has seen a significant change in the size of 
our USA business with customer numbers up 
57% to 0.91m (2010: 0.58m), reflecting a strong 
increase in new customers as well as the 0.18m 
customers acquired from NGES. Gross policy 
sales (excluding policies acquired with NGES) 
were 0.45m an increase of 55% (2010: 0.29m). HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 17
Our marketing programmes in the USA are 
focused on direct mail with outbound telesales 
representing a smaller part of our overall 
marketing activity compared to the UK. We ran 
a number of campaigns across the autumn and 
winter months to NGES customers promoting 
policies including HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, 
Air Conditioning & Cooling), water heater and 
electrics and we launched our first marketing 
campaign promoting ‘interior gas’ cover to 
Southern California Gas customers at the end  
of the financial year.
As well as growing our affinity partner customers 
and policies, we are also seeing strong growth 
in the sale of our own ‘HomeServe USA’ branded 
policies in areas where we do not currently have 
an affinity partner. Our primary focus remains on 
expanding our affinity partner footprint, although 
sales through the HomeServe branded channel, 
which have slightly lower take-ups and lower first 
year retention rates, do represent a profitable 
channel for customer acquisition and a source  
of credentials to prospective new partners.
Our USA retention rate remains high at 81.8% 
(2010: 82.6%) with 70% of policies paid on their 
utility bill or by other continuous payment 
methods such as credit card or E-Z pay (a form  
of direct debit). 
Income per customer was up 22% to $85 in 
2011 reflecting an increase in the number of 
products per customer from 1.30 to 1.52 and 
the increasing proportion of higher net income 
NGES policies. The increased average number of 
policies held per customer reflects the success 
of our cross-selling campaigns as well as the 
higher policies per customer within the acquired 
NGES business.
Revenue in the USA was £52.6m, 105% higher 
than a year ago (2010: £25.7m) reflecting the 
strong growth in customer and policy numbers 
and the USA reported an adjusted operating 
profit
2
 of £6.1m (2010: £1.5m).
We continue to invest in both the infrastructure 
and people in our USA operations, with a 
particular focus on growing our business 
development, corporate development and 
marketing teams over the past year. We are 
also investing in our customer service capability 
and opened our second USA call centre, in 
Chattanooga, Tennessee, in November giving us 
initial capacity for a further 140 claims agents to 
manage our growing customer base as well as 
providing us with a back up for our existing call 
centre in Miami, Florida.

 up £2.5m to £8.2m, 
driven by strong renewal income
Doméo, our joint venture in France with Veolia, 
has reported strong growth in both customer and 
policy numbers over the past year. The number of 
customers has increased by 11% to 0.86m (2010: 
0.77m) with policies increasing by 15% to 2.2m 
(2010: 1.9m) over the same period. Our French 
customers are very insurance minded and this, 
combined with a high proportion of payments 
made by direct debit and a high standard of 
customer service, has ensured that our retention 
rate remains high at 88.4% (FY10: 88.3%).
Gross new policy sales were 0.5m (2010: 0.5m). 
Sales in the second half of the year of 0.34m were 
up over 10% on the same period in 2010 reflecting 
the successful implementation of a number of 
new initiatives last summer. The initiatives, which 
were developed by a joint UK and French team, 
included new marketing creatives, improved data 
selection and new pricing strategies and have all 
delivered good results demonstrating the benefit 
of sharing best practice across our operations.

A key focus for Doméo in 2012 is to continue to 
test initiatives to increase the activity between 
its call centre and that of its affinity partners. 
In addition, while we achieve good take-up 
rates both in and outside Veolia regions, we are 
continuing to discuss opportunities with new 
potential partners.
Income per customer increased by 5% to €93 
with the benefit from an increase in the number 
of policies per customer offset by initial pricing 
dilution from the successful new customer 
acquisition programme.
Doméo has increased its adjusted operating 
profit
2
 by 44%, with our 49% share contributing 
£8.2m (2010: £5.7m) to our Group result. The 
strong growth principally reflects the high

Spain
 > More than doubled the number of customers 
and policies
 > New outbound telesales operation delivering 
good results
 > Commenced management of Indesit’s 
manufacturer warranty programme
In Spain, despite the country’s difficult economic 
conditions, we have more than doubled the 
number of customers and policies to 0.17m and 
0.22m respectively, whilst gross new policy sales 
were 0.16m (2010: 0.05m).
The majority of our marketing activity over the 
past 12 months has been targeted at the Endesa 
customer base, with good take-up rates on both 
acquisition and cross-sell campaigns. During the 
latter part of the year we commenced mailings 
to Agbar customers and will be rolling out a full 
programme of campaigns over the coming year.
We have introduced a number of new marketing 
initiatives in Spain over the past 12 months.  
Our new outbound telesales operation has had 
particular success, selling Electrical wiring cover 
to Endesa’s gas customers and we have also 
trialled the use of utility bill marketing inserts 
with good take-up results.
We are making good progress in developing 
our product portfolio in Spain. In addition to our 
traditional electric and water policies, we are 
seeing good growth in our ‘Club’ product which 
gives members priority access to our repair 
network including two hours of free handy man 
labour. During the year we have also taken on 
the operation of Indesit’s manufacturer warranty 
programme in Spain, following the signing 
of a similar deal with SFG in France. We have 
seen good take-up rates from our initial ‘inbox’ 
registration card marketing activity and will be 
expanding the number of channels used over 
the coming year.
Our claims handling and repair network 
operation continues to support our growing 
membership business, as well as its existing 
insurance partners, and celebrated its tenth 
anniversary during the year. Revenue from the 
membership business has more than doubled 
as a result of increasing renewal income and 
this has contributed to Spain reporting an 
adjusted operating profit
2
 of £1.7m, significantly 
higher than the £0.4m reported last year.

In Belgium, while we have not yet found a 
suitable affinity partner, we are continuing 
discussions with a number of potential 
partners. 
In the first half of the year we opened our Milan 
office and agreed a 15 month test marketing 
agreement with Enel Energia, part of the Enel 
group, Italy’s largest energy company. We also 
signed an affinity partnership with Unicasa, an 
Italian property management company. 
We have undertaken a number of test mailings 
with these two partners promoting plumbing 
and drainage cover, gas supply pipe cover as 
well as electrical wiring cover, with take-ups 
in line with our expectations. We are planning 
to invest in additional marketing in the current 
financial year before reviewing the success of 
these agreements.
Our New Markets operations reported revenue 
of £9.9m (2010: £9.7m) and an adjusted 
operating loss
2
 of £1.1m (2010: adjusted 
operating profit
2
 £1.1m). The adjusted operating 
loss
2
 reflects the additional investment in 
infrastructure, people and test marketing 
programmes. We expect to further increase our 
investment in these countries in 2012, reflecting 
our confidence in their prospects as evidenced 
by the good take-up rates achieved in our test 
marketing activity in 2011. 
New markets
 > Good results from initial manufacturer 
warranty marketing in France
 > Test marketing in Italy with Enel is delivering 
good take-up rates 
 > Initial results give us confidence to increase 
investment in 2012
The success of our established international 
operations in the USA, Spain and Doméo in 
France demonstrates that the HomeServe 
business model is transferable to countries 
outside the UK and that such investment can 
create significant shareholder value. We are 
therefore investing in infrastructure, people and 
test marketing programmes in new businesses 
in Belgium, France (via our warranty business 
Société Francaise de Garantie (SFG)) and Italy. 
In SFG, our wholly owned warranty business 
based in France, we are investing in the 
development of a post-point of sale and 
manufacturer warranty operation, which in the 
medium term will reduce the concentration 
of the existing retail warranty customer base. 
During the year we announced two new 
partnerships to start selling warranties to the 
customers of Indesit and Mistergooddeal, a 
leading French online retailer. Initial marketing 
campaigns have delivered results in line 
with our expectations and we are planning 
additional investment in the coming year. HomeServe

Outlook and Summary
Our UK business has grown its customer 
numbers and delivered good growth in adjusted 
operating profit
2
 in 2011. In 2012 we are confident 
that we can continue to grow UK customer 
numbers by around 3% and maintain a robust 
operating margin.
Our International businesses already have 
around double the number of affinity partner 
households than the UK, although customer 
penetration and income per customer are 
currently lower. We are focused on improving 
our performance in our International businesses 
through the continued development of our 
product range and increased customer 
acquisition and cross-sell marketing 
programmes. We will also continue to target 
new affinity partners in each of our markets 
and expect the number of affinity partner 
households in the USA to exceed the UK over 
the coming years. We are planning for our 
established International businesses to continue 
to increase operating margins and achieve 
significant growth in adjusted operating profit
2
.
Finally, we will build on the success of our initial 
test marketing activities in our New Markets 
businesses by increasing the amount of 
investment in 2012 by around £3m as well as 
continuing to research opportunities in other 
new countries.
We are pleased to report an excellent set of 
financial results with strong adjusted earnings 
growth
3
 and a robust operational performance. 
Our UK business continues to deliver good 
growth with our established international 
businesses gaining momentum. Our business is 
highly cash generative and this has enabled us 
to reduce our net debt to £11.8m.
We have made a good start to the new financial 
year and expect to deliver another year of 
strong growth.

Segmental Results
During the year the Group has reviewed the way 
in which it presents its segmental information. 
We now report five operating segments, 
providing separate disclosures around our 
established businesses, being the UK, USA, 
Spain and Doméo (our joint venture in France), 
while aggregating those business that we are 
currently developing, now referred to as ‘New 
Markets’. 
The New Markets division therefore includes 
the results of our businesses in Belgium, SFG 
in France and Italy. The revenue and adjusted 
operating profit

 for each of these segments are 
set out in the table shown opposite.

Business review
The Group operating margin (adjusted 
operating profit/(loss)
2
 divided by revenue
1
) 
has reduced from 28.3% to 25.5%, as a result  
of the change in sub-contract revenue in the 
UK and the increased investment in our New 
Markets businesses. If the change in UK  
sub-contract revenue and the investment in 
our New Markets businesses were excluded, 
the underlying Group margin in our UK and 
established international businesses increased 
from 28.8% to 29.0%.
In 2012 we plan to maintain our UK operating 
margin while the margins in our established 
International businesses are expected to 
increase as their renewal income grows and we 
achieve economies of scale. We will continue to 
invest in our UK and established International 
businesses as well as significantly increasing 
the investment in our New Markets businesses.
UK
Our UK business reported revenue of £358.9m, 
an increase of 25% (underlying 10%), driven by 
a strong performance in renewal income, the 
continued high level of gross policy sales and 
the change in our contractual relationship with 
our principal underwriting partner in the UK.
From 1 April 2010 our UK financial results include 
the revenue and costs of repair jobs undertaken 
by sub-contract engineers, reflecting a change 
in HomeServe’s commercial relationship with 
its underwriter where we now provide a full 
repair service for our underwriter instead of 
the previous administration only service. This 
change, which has increased both revenue and 
costs by £41.7m in the current reporting period, 
only affects the UK and there is no impact on 
profits. Excluding the impact of this change 
underlying UK revenue increased by 10%.
Revenue in the UK business can be analysed 
as ‘net income’ (income per customer* no. of 
customers) of £267m, with the remaining income 
of £92m representing £66m of repair network 
revenue (including One Contact revenue), 
furniture warranty revenues of £8m, and other 
income of £18m including third party claims 
handling revenue.
The underlying UK operating margin
1
, which 
excludes £41.7m of revenue and operating 
costs relating to the jobs undertaken by our UK 
sub-contract workforce (2010: nil) has reduced 
from 33.2% to 32.9%. The reported UK operating 
margin reduced from 33.2% to 29.1%. 
The UK business continues to deliver good 
growth with adjusted operating profit

In the USA, the strong growth in the number of 
customers and policies combined with the high 
retention rate has resulted in revenue increasing 
by 105% (local currency 104%) to £52.6m. We 
continue to invest in the development of our 
USA business. In November 2010 we opened 
our second USA call centre, in Chattanooga, 
Tennessee, and currently have 73 agents servicing 
both sales and emergency repair calls. 
We have also strengthened our business 
development and corporate development teams 
as we continue to target new affinity partners 
and the acquisition of existing home emergency 
programmes. Our marketing activity in the USA 
continues to expand as we rollout programmes 
with new partners as well as introducing cross-
sell campaigns to existing customers.
The strong revenue growth driven by increasing 
renewal income and the integration of NGES 
customers has resulted in the USA operating 
margin doubling from 5.8% to 11.6% and an 
adjusted operating profit
2
 of £6.1m (2010: £1.5m).
Doméo
Our share in the French joint venture Doméo, 
has generated revenue of £32.3m, an increase 
of 8% (local currency 13%). The growth in revenue 
has been driven by an 11% increase in customer 
numbers partially offset by the introduction of 
discounted acquisition pricing. 
Doméo’s adjusted operating margin has 
increased from 19.0% to 25.4% principally driven 
by the growth in renewal income. Our share in the 
joint venture contributed an adjusted operating 
profit
2
 of £8.2m (2010: £5.7m). 
Spain
In Spain, revenue was £48.8m, £1.8m higher 
than last year (4% increase, 8% in local currency). 
Membership revenue more than doubled to 
£5.6m, although this was largely offset by a 
slight reduction in claims handling revenue. 
Claims handling revenue fell as a result of the 
average value of claims decreasing through 
improved network management in the first 
half of the year. The margin benefits from this 
initiative have been gaining momentum during 
the second half of the year. 
Spain’s operating margin has increased from 
0.8% to 3.5% driven by the growing membership 
renewal income and the improving operating 
margin in the claims handling business.
The growth in the membership renewal revenue 
has resulted in Spain reporting an adjusted 
operating profit
2
 of £1.7m, up £1.3m compared to 
the same period last year.
New Markets
Our New Markets reported revenue of £9.9m 
(2010: £9.7m) and an adjusted operating loss
2
 
of £1.1m (2010: adjusted operating profit
2
 £1.1m). 
This result reflects the investment in people, 
infrastructure and test marketing activity in our 
businesses in Belgium, SFG in France and Italy. 
During 2011 we opened our Italian office in Milan 
and started our test marketing programme with 
Enel Energia. We have also made good progress 
in developing our European manufacturer 
warranty business through SFG, with test 
marketing activity with Indesit.

Annual Report & Accounts 2011 26 Cash flow and financing
Our business model continues to be highly cash 
generative with cash generated by operations 
in 2011 amounting to £119.0m, representing a 
cash conversion ratio of 111% (2010: 93%). Free 
cash flow during the period was £86.1m (2010: 
£26.3m). 
In the year we had a working capital outflow of 
£5.0m reflecting the growth in policy numbers 
and an increase in the number of customers 
who have converted from an annual policy 
payment, to monthly instalments. 
The working capital outflow is lower than in 
previous years reflecting one-off benefits from 
a number of working capital management 
initiatives implemented during the year. 
During the year, we incurred net capital 
expenditure of £11.5m (2010: £25.5m) primarily 
in respect of information systems to support 
our growing membership businesses. Capital 
expenditure in the prior year included one-off 
payments to purchase the HomeServe USA 
trademark as well as additional access rights  
to an affinity partner’s customer database.
Net debt at 31 March 2011 was £11.8m (2010: 
£52.9m), a reduction of £41.1m over the 12 month 
period. In addition to reducing the Group’s 
net debt, free cash flow was used to finance 
acquisition expenditure of £16.2m (2010: £25.8m) 
and equity dividend payments of £31.3m (2010: 
£23.2m).

Business review Statutory profit before tax, after the amortisation 
of acquisition intangibles, tax on joint ventures 
and exceptional items was £104.8m (2010: 
£102.2m). Statutory profit before tax includes 
the amortisation of acquisition intangibles of 
£9.3m (2010: £6.5m) which principally relates 
to customer and other contracts held by the 
acquired entities at the date of acquisition. The 
increase compared to the comparative period 
reflects principally the impact of the National 
Grid Energy Services acquisition completed in 
August 2010.
For Doméo, our joint venture in France, the 
operating result is defined under IFRS as profit 
after tax and therefore a charge of £3.0m (2010: 
£2.0m) of joint venture tax is reported within 
statutory operating profit and statutory profit 
before tax.
Earnings per share
Adjusted earnings per share
3
 for the period 
increased by 17% from 22.2p to 25.9p. The 
increase in earnings per share is slightly higher 
than the 16% increase in adjusted profit before 
tax
2
 with the reduction in the corporation 
tax charge more than offsetting increases in 
the average number of shares in issue from 
317m to 321m and the tax rate applied to the 
amortisation of acquisition intangibles due  
to the increasing proportion relating to our  
USA business.
On a statutory basis, earnings per share 
increased by 5% to 24.0p. The statutory result 
also includes £10.2m of exceptional revenue in 
the prior year.

Loss for the year from discontinued operations — (42.0)
  
Profit for the year, being attributable to equity holders of the parent 76.9 30.7 Finance costs
The Group’s finance cost for the financial year 
was £2.1m (2010: £3.9m), £1.8m lower than in 
the same period last year. The reduction reflects 
both a lower level of debt throughout the period 
and a lower average interest rate.
Taxation
The tax charge in the financial year, prior to 
adjusting for tax on joint ventures, was £27.9m 
(2010: £29.5m), resulting in an effective rate of 
26.6% (2010: 28.9%).
In order to calculate an effective tax rate, 
that reflects the tax burden of the Group, it is 
necessary to take account of the effect of joint 
venture results on the Group’s profits and tax 
for the year. The earnings of our Doméo joint 
venture are shown net of tax within statutory 
profit before tax (in the table opposite). Adjusting 
the tax charge to include the tax relating to joint 
ventures (an adjusted tax charge of £30.9m) and 
similarly grossing up for the joint venture tax on 
the statutory profit before tax, the joint venture 
adjusted tax rate is 28.6% (2010: 30.3%). 
The reduction in the rate is primarily due to the 
availability of brought forward tax losses in 
international businesses which can be utilised 
as those businesses reach profitability.
We anticipate that the planned reduction in the 
headline rate of UK Corporation tax will offset 
the impact of higher effective tax rates on our 
increasing International profits resulting in a 
stable joint venture adjusted tax rate over the 
medium term.
Statutory and pro-forma reconciliations
The Group continues to believe that adjusted 
profit
2
 measures, which exclude the 
amortisation of acquisition intangibles, tax 
on joint ventures and exceptional items, are 
important performance indicators for monitoring 
the business.
This report therefore uses a number of pro-
forma measures to highlight the Group’s results 
excluding the above amounts. The table below 
provides a reconciliation between the statutory 
and pro-forma items.

The proposed final dividend of 7p per share 
together with the payment of the interim dividend 
of 3.3p per share brings the total dividend for the 
year to 10.3p (2010: 8.8p). The dividend increase of 
17% is consistent with our objective of increasing 
our dividend in line with adjusted earnings per 
share
3
. The final dividend, subject to shareholder 
approval, will be paid on 3 August 2011 to 
shareholders on the register on 1 July 2011. 
Foreign exchange impact
The financial performance of our international 
businesses and comparisons with the prior year 
are impacted by foreign exchange movements 
on translation. The total reported International 
adjusted operating profit
2
 of £14.9m was 
reduced by £0.5m as a result of foreign currency 
movements.
The impact of foreign exchange rate movements 
on the individual business is summarised in the 
table below.
Acquisitions
These financial results reflect a combination of 
organic growth and acquisitions. Acquisition 
spend during the period totalled £16.2m 
(2010: £25.5m), which reflects the purchase 
of National Grid Energy Services (£9.7m), the 
acquisition of South Jersey Energy Services 
Plus home emergency policies as they renew 
over the coming year (£1.8m) and £4.7m of 
deferred consideration in relation to acquisitions 
completed in prior periods.
Acquisitions of policy books enable HomeServe 
to accelerate its growth and penetration rate in 
a particular region. The price of policy books will 
vary depending on a number of factors including 
product economics, the current retention rate 
and the existing penetration rate together 
with the length and nature of the associated 
marketing agreement.

The Group’s business activities, together with 
the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in the 
Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s 
Review. This financial review also includes 
the headline financial results, cash flow and 
financing information as well as details on the 
principal risks and uncertainties.
The Directors confirm that, after reviewing the 
Group’s budget and cash flows, they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements.
Summary
I am pleased to report an excellent financial 
performance for HomeServe for the year driven 
by strong growth in the number of customers 
and policies.
The UK has delivered another good year 
with customer numbers up 4% and a robust 
underlying operating margin. Our established 
International businesses have more than 
doubled adjusted operating profit
2
 to £16.0m 
with increased customer and policy numbers 
and higher operating margins. We are also 
continuing to invest in our New Markets 
businesses and are seeing good results from 
our test marketing.
The business continues to generate strong 
levels of cash conversion and this combined with 
our strong balance sheet gives us significant 
flexibility to continue to implement both organic 
and acquisitive growth strategies. 
We believe HomeServe is well placed to continue 
to deliver further profitable growth this financial 
year and into the future.

Principal risks and uncertainties 
H
omeServe has a risk management 
process which provides a structured and 
consistent framework for identifying, 
assessing and responding to risks. These risks 
are assessed in relation to the Group’s business 
performance, financial condition, prospects, 
liquidity and results. Risk management operates 
at all levels throughout the Group, across 
geographies and business lines. 
Risks to HomeServe’s business are either 
specific to HomeServe’s business model, 
such as affinity partner relationships and 
underwriting, or more general, such as 
the impact of competition and regulatory 
compliance.
HomeServe has identified the following 
principal risks and uncertainties. These 
should be read in conjunction with the Chief 
Executive’s and Financial Reviews. Additional 
risks and uncertainties of which we are not 
currently aware or which we currently believe 
are immaterial may also adversely affect our 
business, financial condition, prospects, liquidity 
or results of operations in the future.
Risk Description Mitigation
Commercial 
relationships
Underpinning the success in 
HomeServe’s chosen markets are 
close commercial relationships 
(affinity partner relationships) with 
utility companies and household 
appliance manufacturers.  The loss 
of one of these relationships could 
impact the Group’s future customer 
and policy growth plans.
HomeServe has regular contact and reviews 
with the senior management of its affinity 
partners to ensure that it responds to their 
needs and delivers the service that they expect.
These partnerships are secured under long term 
contracts which increase the security of these 
relationships over the medium term.
In addition, there are a number of partnerships 
across the markets, mitigating, in part, the 
impact of losing any one of these relationships.
Customer 
loyalty/ 
retention
A key element of the Group’s 
business model is customer loyalty. 
Any reduction in the proportion of 
customers renewing their policies 
could significantly impact Group 
revenue.
The policy retention rate is a Key Performance 
Indicator in HomeServe’s businesses. Any 
variance to budget is carefully investigated to 
identify why customer behaviour is changing 
and to implement corrective action. 
The Group has a full range of tools available 
to manage retention rates including specific 
retention products and propositions.  There 
are also dedicated retention call centre agents 
who are trained and experienced in talking to 
customers who are considering not renewing 
their policy. HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 37
Business review
Risk Description Mitigation
Competition There are a number of businesses 
that provide services that are 
similar to those of the Group and 
could therefore compete in one 
or more of its chosen markets.  
Increased competition could affect 
HomeServe’s ability to meet its 
expectations and objectives for the 
business in terms of the number of 
customers, policies or the financial 
returns achieved.
The market and the activities of other 
participants are regularly reviewed to ensure 
that the strategies and offerings of current and 
potential competitors are fully understood.
Both qualitative and quantitative research is 
undertaken to ensure that the Group’s products 
and services continue to meet the needs of its 
customers whilst retaining a competitive position 
in the market.  
HomeServe believes that it has a compelling 
proposition for its customers providing them 
with real value. This helps reduce the effect of 
increased competition. 
Marketing 
effectiveness
A significant reduction in the 
response rates on direct marketing 
or telesales campaigns could have 
a significant impact on the Group’s 
customer and policy numbers.
The performance of each marketing campaign is 
regularly reviewed, with any significant deviation 
to the expected response rate quickly identified 
and remedial action taken for subsequent 
campaigns.
Exposure to 
legislation 
or regulatory 
reforms
The Group is subject to a 
broad spectrum of regulatory 
requirements in each of the 
markets in which it operates, 
particularly relating to product 
design, marketing materials, sales 
processes and data protection.  
Failure to comply with the regulatory 
requirements in any of its countries 
could result in HomeServe having 
to suspend either temporarily or 
permanently certain activities. 
Any changes in the legislative, 
regulatory or judicial environment in 
the countries in which it operates, 
or failure to comply with regulations 
may adversely affect its ability to 
deliver its growth expectations.
The Group has regulatory specialists and 
compliance teams within each of its businesses 
to help ensure that all aspects of the legislative 
regime in each territory are fully understood and 
adopted as required. 
The Group keeps up to date on current 
government policies through a range of external 
advisers and ensures products are designed, 
marketed and sold in accordance with relevant 
legal and regulatory requirements.  HomeServe 
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 38
Risk Description Mitigation
Availability of 
underwriters
The Group uses underwriters to 
minimise the impact of significant 
short term deviations in claims 
frequencies and costs.
The Group needs to ensure that 
policy pricing and claims frequency 
represent an acceptable risk that 
the underwriters are prepared 
to price.
The Group uses a number of underwriters, with 
the main partner in the UK being separate to 
those in Europe and the US.
The Group’s principal underwriters are party 
to medium term agreements, with the rates 
subject to regular review. In addition to this, the 
Group maintains relationships with a number 
of other underwriters and regularly reviews the 
market to ensure it understands current market 
rates and how these apply to its policies.
Quality of 
customer 
service
HomeServe’s reputation is heavily 
dependent on the quality of its 
customer service.  Any failure 
to meet its service standards or 
negative media coverage of poor 
service could have a detrimental 
impact on customer and policy 
numbers.
Processes have been established to ensure 
that any directly employed engineers or sub 
contractors meet minimum standards. These 
include criminal record checks and minimum 
qualification requirements.
Service levels provided by both our directly 
employed and sub-contract engineers are 
monitored through the use of customer 
telephone call backs after a repair has been 
completed.  Any failure by the engineer to 
adhere to processes or deliver the appropriate 
standard of service is addressed by the 
engineers’ line manager.
Dependence 
on recruitment 
and retention 
of skilled 
personnel
The ability of the Group to meet its 
growth expectations and compete 
effectively is in part dependent 
on the skills, experience and 
performance of its personnel.  
The inability to attract, motivate 
or retain key talent could affect 
the Group’s ability to service 
its customers and improve the 
performance of the business.
HomeServe’s employment policies, 
remuneration and benefits packages and 
long term incentive programmes are regularly 
reviewed and are designed to be competitive 
with other companies.
Employee surveys, performance reviews and 
regular communication of business activities are 
just some of the methods used to understand 
and respond to employees’ views and needs.
Processes are also in place to identify high 
performing individuals to ensure that they not 
only have fulfilling careers, but that as a Group 
we are able to actively manage succession 
planning. HomeServe

Risk Description Mitigation
Exposure to 
country and 
regional risk
As a result of its growing 
international footprint HomeServe 
is subject to increased economic, 
political and other risks associated 
with operating in overseas 
territories. 
A variety of factors, including 
changes in a specific country’s 
political, economic or regulatory 
requirements, as well as the 
potential for geographical turmoil 
including terrorism and war, could 
result in the loss of service.
The criteria for entering a new country includes 
a full assessment of the stability of its economy 
and political situation, together with a review 
of the manner and way in which business is 
conducted.
When entering a new country the Group 
generally does so on a small scale test basis. 
This low risk entry strategy minimises the 
likelihood of any loss. 
Financial 
strategy and 
treasury risk
The main financial risks are the 
availability of short and long-term 
funding to meet business needs, 
the risk of suppliers not paying 
monies owed and fluctuations in 
interest and foreign currency rates.
Interest rate risk
HomeServe’s policy is to manage its interest  
cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts. 
This is achieved by entering into interest rate 
swaps for certain periods, in which it agrees  
to exchange, at specified intervals, the  
difference between fixed and variable rate 
interest amounts calculated by reference to  
an agreed upon notional principal amount. 
These swaps are designated to hedge 
underlying debt obligations.
Credit risk
HomeServe trades only with creditworthy  
third parties and subsidiary undertakings.  
All customers who wish to trade on credit  
terms are reviewed for financial stability.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other 
financial assets, which comprise cash and cash 
equivalents, HomeServe’s exposure to credit risk 
arises from default of the counterparty.
The risk associated with cash and cash 
equivalents is managed by only depositing  
funds with reputable and creditworthy  
banking institutions. 
Liquidity risk
HomeServe manages liquidity risk by 
maintaining adequate reserves and banking 
facilities and continuously monitoring forecast 
and actual cash flows. HomeServe

These Corporate Responsibility principles are 
part of the way we operate on a daily basis 
and reflect in the way we deal with customers, 
employees, partners and the community.  
A Corporate Responsibility Committee, chaired 
by Jon Florsheim, was established in the 
UK in 2010 to govern and ensure successful 
implementation of our policy. A similar 
committee has also now been established in 
the USA, chaired by Jonathan King.
H
omeServe is committed to developing 
and implementing a successful 
Corporate Responsibility programme 
that benefits key stakeholders and utilises 
HomeServe’s core skills to make a sustainable 
difference to its communities. We believe  
that a successful business must also be  
a responsible business.
We aim to:
 > Achieve sustainable profits for our 
shareholders.
 > Build enduring relationships with key 
stakeholders, including our customers, 
partners and the community.
 > Value our employees.
 > Respect the environment.
 > Use our core skills to give something back to 
the communities we operate in.
Our business is centred on providing emergency 
services to people in their homes and our 
corporate responsibility objectives support this. 
Our key focus is around the following four areas:
1   Customers
 > Implement ethical, sustainable and 
responsible principles throughout the  
supply chain.
 > Identify future risks and opportunities and 
ensure the customer is at the centre of our 
business decisions.
 > Treat customers fairly throughout the 
customer experience; protecting the 
business’ reputation and ensuring customers 
trust the business to resolve their home 
emergency.

principles throughout its supply chain in all 
dealings with its goods and service providers. 
Employees
HomeServe’s business values support our 
vision, mission and strategy. In addition, 
the Company’s Leadership Characteristics, 
agreed in 2009, ensure that individuals 
hired or promoted into leadership positions 
display appropriate behaviours, as well as 
the necessary commercial and technical 
skills. These characteristics are now built into 
our Leadership Recruitment, Appraisal and 
Development programmes for leaders in all 
HomeServe’s businesses.
HomeServe has operated a Group wide 
Leadership Succession Planning process for 
two years, with the aim of retaining talent and 
increasing the level of internal appointments 
compared to external hires. This complements 
the Performance Management process and 
is overseen by the Executive Committee. From 
April 2011 HomeServe is implementing a Group 
Leadership Development Programme, designed 
in partnership with Cranfield University, which 
is closely aligned to business strategy and our 
Leadership Characteristics. Key elements of 
the Programme will be sponsored by Executive 
Committee members. 
We continue to operate a successful Graduate 
Recruitment Programme in the UK, and will 
launch similar programmes in our French and 
Spanish businesses in 2011. HomeServe actively 
continues to support trade apprenticeships in 
the UK, and following the success of last year’s 
programme will recruit a number of apprentices 
to its UK Plumbing and Drainage business 
this year. In 2011, around 10% of our employed 
Plumbing and Drainage Engineer workforce will 
be apprentices.
We continue to recognise the importance of 
effective communication with both managers 
and employees. In the UK, the Company 
has recently launched a new Internal 
Communications brand “Our House” as a focal 
point for all employee related communications. 
Employee surveys have been run in the UK 
and parts of Continental Europe, with results 
published and action plans agreed and 
communicated to employees. We continue 
to make effective use of the intranet, staff 
magazines and employee representative 
forums/works councils in all businesses, both to 
disseminate information and to receive feedback 
and ideas from employees regarding business 
strategy and performance.  HomeServe 
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 44
Health and safety
HomeServe continues to strive to manage 
health and safety successfully and where 
possible, deliver improvements in its 
performance. HomeServe’s strategy continues 
to be to ensure compliance with legal standards 
as a minimum, but where practicable, adopt 
good industry practice and share that practice 
across the businesses.
Risks
HomeServe has a variety of health and safety 
risks to manage. Transport and road risk,  
slips, trips and falls, manual handling and  
lone working represent some of the most 
common risks arising from our activities. 
HomeServe is committed to managing these 
risks in a balanced and proportionate way.  
All the businesses are required to have a 
suitable health and safety policy in place with  
a supporting management system underpinned 
by a robust risk assessment process, reflecting 
the risks within each particular business. 
Our services are often delivered via partnerships 
with contractors, franchisees and other 
suppliers. We work with these partners to 
ensure that our health and safety expectations 
are understood and met, and that the work they 
undertake on our behalf is managed as safely 
as is reasonably practicable.
Performance 
During the year, HomeServe has proactively 
worked on improving the arrangements in place 
to manage health and safety. We have reviewed 
and standardised our UK policy ensuring that 
arrangements are consistent across all sites. 
In the UK we have also continued to deliver 
training to our network management employees 
through the use of proprietary training packages 
– ‘IOSH Managing Safely’ and ‘IOSH Working 
Safely’. In 2011 we will be rolling out an internally 
developed computer based training package 
for our office based managers and other 
employees which will focus on providing an 
awareness of health and safety responsibilities 
and an overview of our health and safety policy 
arrangements. 
A key element for the effective management 
of health and safety within the organisation 
is the development of a culture in which line 
management actively demonstrates ownership 
of health and safety issues. HomeServe expects 
each of its businesses to ensure compliance 
with relevant health and safety legislation 
regardless of the country in which it is operating. 
The recently appointed global Head of Health 
& Safety works with the businesses to ensure 
that they meet local legal requirements as a 
minimum whilst at the same time meeting 
our own internal health and safety standards. 
Martin Bennett is the Main Board Director 
responsible for reporting on health and safety, 
but the Board as a whole remains responsible 
for health and safety issues across the Group.  HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 45
Corporate responsibility
Despite our continued efforts to improve our 
Health and Safety performance, the frequency 
of incidents is up on the previous year. Although 
process improvements may have led to better 
reporting of accidents there is clearly a need 
to ensure that successful health and safety 
management remains a continued priority  
for HomeServe, with particular emphasis  
being placed on the reduction in the overall 
accident rate.
Plans for 2011/12
We will continue to review our health and safety 
arrangements, with particular focus on our 
international businesses, ensuring that the 
arrangements we have in place are suitable and 
sufficient to safely manage the activities being 
performed.
Work is planned to improve the range of data 
and other information used for health and 
safety performance measurement so that a 
clearer overview, in a simple standard format, is 
available. This will provide greater visibility of the 
overall Health and Safety performance, enabling 
Directors to see where risks are well managed 
and where more work is needed.
We continue to focus on the three key risks 
identified as being significant and affecting 
most of HomeServe’s activities: driving and road 
risks, contractor and franchisee management 
and work station ergonomics. 
During the year the network management 
business in the UK has been awarded the 
RoSPA Gold award for its health and safety 
performance. This is the second year the 
network management business has entered 
the awards, building on last year’s Silver award. 
HomeServe at Home entered the award for the 
first time in the year, obtaining a Silver award. 
The scheme looks not only at accident records, 
but also entrants’ overarching health and safety 
management systems, including important 
practices such as strong leadership and 
workforce involvement. 
HomeServe has had limited contact with 
national health and safety enforcing 
authorities during the reporting period, with no 
prosecutions or other enforcement action being 
taken against the Company for breaches of 
health and safety regulations.
Accidents/incidents 
In the UK HomeServe had no fatalities, no 
defined major injuries and no dangerous 
occurrences during the year. However it did 
have a total of 21 defined over ‘3 day’ RIDDOR 
reportable lost time accidents, which is an 
increase of 7 over the previous year. 
In total during this period there were 135 
accidents recorded compared to 122 in 2009/10. 
Overall a total of 259 working days were lost as 
a result of work related accidents, an increase of 
7.9% over the 2009/10 figure of 240.
As in previous years, the main causes of the 
accidents or incidents were in respect of 
slips, trips and falls, cuts and bruises, manual 
handling or muscular strains. The overall lost 
time accident frequency rate per million hours 
worked is calculated as 12.1 compared with  
8.56 for the previous year. The accident incident 
rate for lost time reportable incidents per 1,000 
employees was 7.15, compared with a rate of 
4.85 the previous year and our severity rate 
 (lost time due to accidents per 1,000 hours 
worked) was 0.15 which was the same as the 
previous year. HomeServe 
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 46
Key Achievements in 2010/2011:
 > The launch of a Marie Curie Complete Cover 
Patient Policy  
In July 2010 we launched a unique free policy 
exclusively for Marie Curie patients. The policy 
covers practically every home emergency 
and repair, with call-out, labour, parts and 
VAT all included in the cover. To support the 
policy, HomeServe call centre employees and 
engineers have been specially trained on the 
sensitive needs of Marie Curie patients. To 
date, 311 policies have been activated which 
equates to £195,000 worth of free home 
emergency cover and HomeServe has carried 
out 170 jobs in patient’s homes. The policy will 
continue to be offered in 2011/12.  
 > Marie Curie’s Walk Ten, Supported by 
HomeServe  
HomeServe was delighted to be the headline 
sponsor of the first ever Walk Ten in 2010 
and we have renewed our sponsorship deal 
for 2011. Our sponsorship money (which 
contributes towards our £1 million target) 
helped Marie Curie turn their plans into 
reality and contributed to their advertising 
budget. In 2010 there were 12 walks, and in 
2011, there will be 20 walks held between 
July and September. Marie Curie supporters 
raised over £250,000 in sponsorship money 
from participating in the walks in 2010.  
HomeServe employees, family and friends 
also got involved in the walks either by 
putting their best foot forward or by 
volunteering on the event days.
 > Employee Fundraising Activities                                
HomeServe employees have been busy 
raising funds with sponsored marathons, 
fun runs, sky dives, cycling trips, cake bakes 
and dress-down days. Many HomeServe 
employees have also signed up to the 
Pennies for Patients Scheme, which enables 
staff to donate the odd pennies from their 
monthly pay, (up to 99p a month) directly to 
Marie Curie. 
Community
At HomeServe, we pride ourselves on  
being a caring and responsible company  
and in November 2009 we formed our first 
national charity partnership with Marie Curie 
Cancer Care. 
Employing more than 2,700 nurses, doctors and 
other healthcare professionals, Marie Curie 
provides free care to those with terminal cancer 
and other illnesses in their own homes. In the 
last year alone, Marie Curie provided care to 
more than 31,000 patients in the community  
and in their nine hospices.
Marie Curie nurses enable patients to 
spend their final weeks at home, in familiar 
surroundings with family close by. Alternatively, 
patients can stay at one of their warm and 
friendly hospices – instead of in the clinical and 
often daunting surroundings of a hospital.
In addition to helping the charity by raising 
funds, we are in a unique position to enhance 
Marie Curie’s home-based services by providing 
practical support to patients in their own  
homes through our network of tradesmen  
and engineers. 
HomeServe has pledged to donate £1 million to 
Marie Curie over the three years to March 2013. 
This target comprises employee fundraising and 
volunteering, customer donations, sponsorship 
and gift-in-kind contributions. By the end of the 
first year £333,333 has been donated, exactly 
one third of our pledge (£138,000 cash, which 
will pay for 6,900 hours of Marie Curie nursing 
care and £195,000 gift-in-kind). HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 47
Corporate responsibility
 > Volunteering  
Volunteering is promoted and encouraged 
by HomeServe and this year’s activities have 
included work to improve the grounds at 
Solihull Hospice, working in charity shops, 
marshalling at Walk Ten and collecting for the 
Great Daffodil Appeal.
 > Cause Related Marketing 
In addition to our employee fundraising  
and business donations, we recognise  
that our customers may also be interested 
in supporting Marie Curie. Therefore, we 
have now started to integrate ‘cause related 
marketing’ into our acquisition, cross sales 
and renewal marketing activity and we  
ran a number of tests and campaigns last 
year, generating awareness and funds for 
the charity. 
We also keep our customers regularly 
updated with our fundraising progress and 
activities via our customer magazine, mailing 
inserts, social media and website.
Our first full year with Marie Curie has proved 
very successful and we were honoured to be 
nominated by them for the prestigious Institute 
of Fundraising, Charity Partnership of the Year 
award. 
Other activities
In addition to our partnership with Marie Curie, 
HomeServe supports the Comic Relief appeal 
each year by opening donation lines in our call 
centre. More than 200 volunteers answered 
3,050 donation calls on Red Nose Day in March, 
raising over £100,000 to help vulnerable people 
in both the UK and Africa.
We continue to run an annual Youth Team 
Sponsorship Scheme and during the year 
awarded 24 grants to local youth teams linked 
to HomeServe employees. We also provide  
ad-hoc support to other charities throughout  
the year (in 2010/11 this included the Pakistani 
Flood Appeal and the Royal British Legion  
Poppy Appeal).
Environment
As part of HomeServe’s commitment to reduce its 
impact on the environment, a full environmental 
review of the business has commenced, 
facilitated by the Group Environmental Manager, 
and will continue over the next 12 months. 
The Environmental Policy has been reviewed 
during the year and in the UK, the Senior 
Management Team has signed up to an 
Environmental Commitment to ensure 
environmental improvements are achieved 
across the business. 
As part of the environmental review, the Group 
Environmental Manager has been working 
with key stakeholders to set the roadmap 
for HomeServe’s environmental journey. This 
roadmap comprises short, medium and long-
term environmental objectives, each supported 
by a full set of Key Performance Indicators. HomeServe 
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 48
Fleet initiatives and company cars
Due to the nature of the business, one of the 
largest elements of HomeServe’s carbon 
footprint results from fuel consumed by the 
commercial fleet. As a result, this is an area of 
particular focus and a number of initiatives have 
been implemented or will be implemented over 
the coming year including:
 > Monthly fleet review meetings with all the  
key stakeholders to ensure that data such  
as MPG and fuel purchased are reviewed  
on a regular basis and action taken to reduce 
the environmental and financial cost to  
the business. 
 > Use of the telematics system fitted in every 
van to monitor, amongst other measures,  
the speed and the distance travelled in any 
given period.
 > Publishing a league table of the commercial 
fleet drivers to show their individual fuel 
efficiency levels thereby encouraging 
employees to drive more efficiently. An 
award is presented to the employee with the 
highest miles per gallon in each area. 
 > Replacement of 60 of the Vauxhall Movano 
vans used in the network with Mercedes 
Sprinters with the latest Euro 5 compliant 
engines which incorporate Start/Stop 
technology. The new vans reduced our 
CO
2
 by 13g per kilometre, and overall, this 
programme resulted in a total saving of 
36,050 tonnes of CO
2
.
The company car list is reviewed on a regular 
basis. As new technology improves the fuel 
efficiency of new cars on the market, HomeServe 
will continue to improve the fuel efficiency of 
its company car fleet. The car with the highest 
carbon dioxide emission levels per kilometre 
vehicle is now 180g CO
2
 per km, as opposed to 
225g CO
2
 per km formerly. Employees can now 
select vehicles with emission levels as low as 
109g CO
2
 per km.
Environmental Management System
As part of HomeServe’s commitment to 
continuous improvement, the HomeServe 
Environmental Management System (EMS) will 
be reviewed and re-launched over the coming 
year. HomeServe believes that an EMS is 
essential and will help to: 
 > Improve the management of environmental 
impacts.
 > Set targets to reduce energy use, water use & 
waste to landfill.
 > Initiate and maintain procedures to improve 
efficiencies including:
• Environmentally friendly purchasing 
procedures;
• Preferred business travel option.
 > Define key responsibilities for achieving 
targets.
 > Monitor and measure environmental 
performance against key indicators. 
 > Regularly assess progress towards achieving 
set objectives.
 > Ensure due diligence and ongoing 
consideration of legal and other 
environmental requirements. 
 > Contribute to preferred employer status
 > Achieve cost savings.
The EMS will be externally audited in future, 
ultimately enabling HomeServe to achieve 
ISO14001 and demonstrate that we work to an 
accredited standard.
Environmental training 
Staff training and environmental awareness 
are essential to improving environmental 
performance. During the year a comprehensive 
training programme was launched in the UK for 
all key members of staff. The first phase of the 
programme targeted the HomeServe engineers 
and technicians and included topics such as; 
the importance of being an environmentally 
friendly company, pollution prevention, legal 
compliance, waste management and efficient 
driving. The next phase will involve job specific 
training for those whose roles have greatest 
environmental impact.  HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 49
Corporate responsibility
Recycling
HomeServe has worked hard with its waste 
sub-contractors and waste brokers to ensure 
that as little waste as possible ends up in 
landfill. In most cases, when general waste 
leaves a HomeServe site, it is sent to a mixed 
recycling facility where any recyclable material 
is removed. Currently, of the 49% of waste that 
leaves UK sites as general waste, only 17% 
actually ends up in landfill. Over the next year, 
HomeServe will be working on its internal waste 
systems to ensure it further implements the 
waste hierarchy that is, eliminate, reduce, reuse 
and recycle. This will ensure as much waste as 
possible is segregated on site and will improve 
the Company’s overall recycling rates. 
Reducing our paper consumption
Customer communication is a vital component 
of the HomeServe model but we recognise the 
need to reduce the environmental impact of our 
mailings. HomeServe uses a number of external 
suppliers to produce and distribute our mailings 
and we work closely with them to ensure they 
meet our minimum requirements and strive for 
continual improvement. Some key areas include 
ensuring:
 > All stock is FSC, FSC mixed or Recycled 
accredited.
 > All inks are alcohol free and/or vegetable  
or water based.
 > All printer waste is either recycled 
or disposed of in line with European 
management standards.
 > Compliance with PAS2020 and ISO14001 
across our entire supplier base (some 
suppliers are also carbon neutral).
 > Compliance with Royal Mail Responsible Mail 
and TNT Post’s Green Post entry level criteria.
HomeServe’s carbon footprint
As the HomeServe business grows outside the 
UK it is essential that we share best practice. 
Whilst the carbon footprint for 2010/11 below is 
for the UK operation, the Group Environmental 
Manager is working with other businesses to 
enable them to start analysing and reducing 
their carbon footprint. This will allow HomeServe 
to monitor, manage and reduce its overall 
carbon footprint and environmental impact. 
In the UK, HomeServe will be subject to the 
CRC (Carbon Reduction Commitment) Energy 
Efficiency Scheme.
The carbon footprint for HomeServe’s UK 
operation in 2010/11 was 11,488 tco2e.

”We are extremely grateful to HomeServe for 
offering our patients this cover. For patients and

jobs and maintenance. HomeServe is offering a 
practical solution for patients and families, which 
provides peace of mind at a difficult time.”

Annual Report & Accounts 2011 55
  
The Directors have pleasure in presenting their Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended  
31 March 2011.
Principal activities
During the year the Group was engaged in the provision of home emergency repairs. Details of the 
Group’s activities and a review of the business are set out in the Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s 
review and Financial review on pages 3 to 33.
Details of the key performance indicators used by the Directors to assist in the management of the 
business and to provide evidence of the achievement of its strategies are included on pages 10 and 11.
A description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group is shown on pages 36 to 39. 
Information relating to the environment and employees is included in the Corporate responsibility report. 
Financial results and dividends
The Group’s results are shown in the Group income statement on page 88. The Directors are 
recommending the payment on 3 August 2011 of a final dividend of 7.0p per ordinary share to 
shareholders on the register at the close of business on 1 July 2011 which, together with the net interim 
dividend of 3.3p per ordinary share paid on 4 January 2011, results in a total net dividend for the year of 
10.3p per share (2010: 44.0p which equates to 8.8p taking into account the share split). For further details 
of the dividend see note 12 to the financial statements.
Capital structure
Details of the authorised and issued share capital, together with details of the movements in the 
Company’s issued share capital during the year are shown in note 26. As agreed at the 2010 AGM, 
the Company’s shares were split on a 5 for 1 basis on 2 August 2010. There is one class of ordinary  
shares which carries no right to fixed income. Each share carries the right to one vote at a general  
meeting of the Company.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the transfer of shares, which are both 
governed by the general provisions of the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation. The Directors 
are not aware of any agreements between holders of the Company’s shares that may result in restrictions 
on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.
Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 38. No votes are cast in respect of the shares held 
in the Employee Benefit Trust and dividends are waived.
No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share capital and all issued shares are 
fully paid. Subject to the Companies Act 2006 and any relevant authority of the Company in general 
meeting, the Company has authority to issue new shares.
The AGM held in 2010 authorised the Directors to allot shares in the capital of the Company up to a 
maximum nominal amount of £2,712,036 (being approximately 35% of the then issued share capital) with 
a further authority to allot shares up to a maximum nominal value of £410,915 (being approximately 5% of 
the then issued share capital) as if statutory pre-emption rights did not apply.

Directors’ report
The authorities given to the Directors to allot shares at the 2010 AGM were granted for a period expiring 
at the 2011 AGM of the Company or 30 October 2011, if earlier. Similar resolutions will be put to the 
forthcoming AGM to renew this authority.
The 2010 AGM authorised the purchase by the Company of up to 32,873,165 ordinary shares (being 
approximately 10% of the then issued share capital) and this authority will remain available until the 
forthcoming AGM, when the granting of a similar authority will be proposed. No shares were purchased 
during the year and no shares are held in Treasury.
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the 
Company such as commercial contracts, bank loan agreements, property lease arrangements and 
employees’ share plans. None of these are considered to be significant in terms of their likely impact 
on the business of the Group as a whole. Furthermore, the Directors are not aware of any agreements 
between the Company and its Directors and employees that provide for compensation for loss of office  
or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.
Directors
The Directors who held office during the year were:  
JM Barry Gibson 
Richard Harpin 
Martin Bennett  
Jon Florsheim  
Jonathan King (appointed 5 July 2010) 
Ian Chippendale  
Stella David (appointed 23 November 2010) 
Mark Morris 
Andrew Sibbald 
In accordance with the new UK Corporate Governance Code, all the Directors will be offering themselves 
for election or re-election at the AGM. All of the Executive Directors serve under contracts of employment 
terminable on 12 months’ notice by either party. The Non-Executive Directors all serve under three year 
renewable letters of appointment with no liquidated damages.
In respect of the appointment and replacement of Directors, the Company is governed by its Articles of 
Association, the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Companies Act 2006 and related legislation. The 
Articles may be amended by special resolution of the shareholders. The powers of Directors are described 
in the Board’s terms of reference (which are available on request from the Company Secretary) and the 
Corporate governance report.
The beneficial interests of the Directors in the shares of the Company and the options held as at 31 March 
2011 and 24 May 2011 are set out in the Remuneration report. None of the Directors serving at the year end 
had a beneficial interest in the share capital of any subsidiary company.
The Company has made qualifying third party indemnity provisions for the benefit of its Directors which 
were in place during the year and remain in force at the date of this report. Governance

Employment policies
It is the Group’s policy that all persons should be considered for employment, training, career 
development and promotion on the basis of their abilities and aptitudes, regardless of physical ability, 
age, gender, sexual orientation, religion or ethnic origin. 
HomeServe plc and its subsidiaries apply employment policies that are fair and equitable for all 
employees and these ensure that entry into, and progression within the Group, are determined solely  
by application of job criteria and personal ability and competency.
Full and fair consideration (having regard to the person’s particular aptitudes and abilities) is given to 
applications for employment and the career development of disabled persons. HomeServe’s training  
and development policies also make it clear that it will take all steps practicable to ensure that employees 
who become disabled during the time they are employed by the Group are able to remain employed by 
the Group.
Employee involvement
HomeServe attaches considerable importance to ensuring that all its employees are provided with 
information concerning them as employees, particularly the economic and financial factors affecting its 
performance and the market in which it operates. Involvement of employees in the Group’s performance 
is also encouraged by the availability of performance-related bonuses as well as share option schemes, 
which are described in more detail elsewhere in this report. 
We continue to make effective use of intranets, staff magazines and employee representative forums 
both to disseminate information and to receive feedback and ideas from employees regarding business 
strategy and performance. Consultation between management and staff is an ongoing process and 
employees are consulted on issues directly affecting them as soon as is practicable.

HomeServe complied throughout the year with the provisions set out in the Combined Code published 
in July 2003 by the UK Financial Reporting Council as updated in June 2008 (‘the Code‘) save as where 
mentioned in this report.
The manner in which the Company applies the principles of good governance contained in the Code 
is described in the appropriate parts of this Annual Report and Accounts. Thus, the application by the 
Company of the Code’s principles relating to remuneration matters in the Remuneration report on pages 
66 to 82 should be read in conjunction with the statement below. A review of the Group’s position and 
prospects is set out in the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s review and the Financial review on 
pages 3 to 33.
The Board
The Board of Directors leads and controls the Company by holding up to ten meetings a year at which its 
current and forecast performance is reviewed and monitored. Regular reports on monthly performance 
and other matters of importance to the Group ensure that the Board is supplied in a timely manner with 
the information necessary to make informed judgements. In addition, the Board holds regular meetings 
at least annually, also attended by senior operational management, to devise and discuss the Company’s 
medium and long-term strategic focus and management development strategy. Regular formal and 
informal presentations are given and meetings held in order to inform Directors of issues of importance 
affecting the Group. Occasionally, meetings of the Board are held at the Company’s operating sites other 
than Walsall, in order to afford the Board, particularly the Non-Executive Directors, with the opportunity to 
meet with local management.
In accordance with the provisions of the new UK Corporate Governance Code, each Director is subject 
to election by the Company’s shareholders at the Annual General Meeting immediately following his 
appointment and is subject to re-election every year thereafter.
The Board has a Schedule of Matters specifically reserved to it for decision and has approved the written 
terms of reference of the various committees to which it has delegated its authority in certain matters. 
Matters reserved to the Board include the recommendation or approval of dividends, the approval of 
preliminary and interim financial statements, major financial commitments, the acquisitions of significant 
companies or businesses, appointments to the Board and its Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
committees, the Company’s future strategy and its internal controls. It also provides that the Board 
receives regular updates from the chairmen of its committees.
During the year the Board was led by Barry Gibson, the Chairman, who also served as a member of the 
Board’s Nomination, Remuneration and Audit Committees.
The Chairman’s responsibilities are clearly defined in a written specification agreed by the Board and 
which made clear the division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief Executive. They 
include the smooth running of the Board, effective communication between Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors and the general progress and long-term development of the Group. 
The Board has established a formal procedure for Directors wishing to seek independent legal and  
other professional advice and all members of the Board have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary.
Corporate governance HomeServe 
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 60
Corporate governance
The day-to-day running of HomeServe’s business is delegated to an Executive Committee which is led  
by Richard Harpin, Chief Executive. Other members of the Executive Committee include Jon Florsheim, 
Martin Bennett, Jonathan King and the Chief Executive of HomeServe Europe, Rachael Hughes.
During the year, in addition to the Chairman, four independent Non-Executive Directors (Messrs 
Chippendale, Morris and Sibbald and Mrs David) with extensive business, finance and marketing 
backgrounds, provided the Board with a breadth of experience and with independent judgement.  
Ian Chippendale served as the Company’s independent Senior Non-Executive Director. 
The Board actively encourages all Directors to deepen their knowledge of their roles and responsibilities 
and to gain a clear understanding of the Group and the environment in which it operates; and has 
adopted a formal policy on the induction and training of Directors. Newly appointed Board members are 
required to undergo an induction programme, which includes obtaining a thorough understanding of 
the Group’s various operations, and they have the opportunity to receive formal training from external 
providers if they wish. During the year, the Non-Executive Directors have met with various members of the 
Group’s management teams and external advisers. 
The Board has implemented a formal process for reviewing its own effectiveness, that of its Remuneration 
and Audit committees and its individual members. In addition, it continued to ensure that regular 
meetings of the Non-Executive Directors were held without the Executive Directors, and at least once a 
year, without the Chairman present, in order to evaluate his performance. The Board evaluation process, 
which was conducted by the Chairman and Company Secretary, was concluded in March 2011. Directors 
completed evaluation questionnaires and a formal written report summarising their views and containing 
recommendations to further improve the effectiveness of the Board was prepared and reviewed by the 
whole Board in March 2011. The Board concluded that it was operating effectively, although a number of 
recommendations for further improvement were approved.
The Board has noted the requirement in the new UK Corporate Governance Code that the evaluation 
of the Board should be externally facilitated at least every three years. The Board intends to conduct an 
externally facilitated review during 2011/12. 
Committees
The Board operates a number of committees to which it has delegated certain specific responsibilities 
and each of which has formally adopted terms of reference. These comprise the Nomination, Audit and 
Remuneration Committees. The terms of reference of each of the Board’s committees are available on 
request from the Company Secretary and are on the Company’s website. The terms of reference were 
reviewed during the year following the publication of updated guidance by the ICSA.
A Risk Committee, comprising the Executive Directors and other representatives of each business, 
operates across the Group and is chaired by Martin Bennett. Its terms of reference have been approved by 
the Board and its purpose is to establish the Group’s risk appetite, to evaluate the risk registers compiled 
by each of its businesses, to monitor the effectiveness of its action plans for the mitigation of those risks, 
and to report thereon to the Board, which retains responsibility for the overall evaluation of the Group’s risk 
management processes. Governance
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 61
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee, which makes recommendations to the Board on the appointment of 
Directors, is chaired by Barry Gibson with the other members being the independent Non-Executive 
Directors. This Committee met informally to consider the appointment of Jonathan King to the Board and 
also to consider the appointment of a further Non-Executive Director (a position that Stella David was 
appointed to in November 2010).  Following these informal meetings, recommendations were made to the 
Board and decisions taken by the Board as a whole.  
The Committee draws on the advice of such professional advisers as it considers necessary and did so 
during the year in respect of both the Executive and Non-Executive appointments made.  An external 
search consultancy was used in respect of the latter.
Its duties also include the review of the size, structure and composition of the Board, and succession 
planning for Directors and other senior managers. During the year, these duties were undertaken by the 
Board itself.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee was chaired by Mark Morris who comes from a strong financial background having 
worked in audit, business advisory and corporate finance before becoming a plc finance director. The 
Committee did not comply with the Code during the year as the Chairman, Barry Gibson, was a member 
along with Ian Chippendale. Since the year end, Andrew Sibbald has been appointed to the Audit 
Committee, replacing Barry Gibson.
The Committee meets regularly to review the preliminary and interim results before they are presented 
to the Board, to receive reports from the Company’s internal and external auditors and to make 
recommendations to the Board on accounting policies. Its primary duties include the monitoring, on behalf 
of the Board, of compliance with and the effectiveness of, the Company’s accounting and internal control 
systems. The Committee’s duties also include agreeing audit strategy, monitoring the scope and results 
of the Company’s annual audit and the independence and objectivity of its auditors. The internal and 
external auditors and the Chief Financial Officer are invited but are not entitled to attend all meetings. 
Where appropriate, other Executive Directors also attend meetings at the Chairman’s invitation. The 
external and internal auditors are provided with the opportunity to raise any matters or concerns that they 
may have, in the absence of the Executive Directors, whether at Committee meetings or, more informally 
outside of them.
The Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Board for a resolution to be put to 
the shareholders for their approval in general meeting for the appointment of the external auditors, the 
approval of their remuneration and their terms of engagement.
The Committee has implemented a policy relating to the use of the external auditors for non-audit 
services and monitors fees paid in respect of such services. This policy provides that the total fees payable 
to the auditor for non-audit related work in any financial year should not normally be more than 100% 
of the total fees payable in respect of audit and other services pursuant to legislation (principally fees 
in respect of the half year review). In addition any proposed spend over a predetermined limit must be 
approved by the Committee. Fees for non-audit related work in the year did not exceed the fees for audit 
and other services pursuant to legislation (principally the half year review). 
The Committee has also agreed and implemented a procedure for reviewing and assessing its own 
effectiveness and that of the internal and external audit process.  HomeServe

Remuneration Committee
The Committee was chaired throughout the year by Ian Chippendale. The Committee comprises only 
independent Non-Executive Directors, Barry Gibson and Mark Morris being its other members.
The Remuneration Committee’s responsibilities include determining the Group’s overall remuneration 
strategy and the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and other members of the Executive 
Committee, after having consulted with the Chief Executive and having received professional advice from 
remuneration consultants. The Committee is also responsible for approving the grant and exercise of 
executive long-term incentive arrangements. In determining remuneration policy, the Committee is free 
to obtain such professional advice as it sees fit, and regularly monitors both the policies of comparator 
companies and current market practice, in order to ensure that the packages provided are sufficient to 
attract and retain Executive Directors of the necessary quality.
The Committee has also agreed and implemented a procedure for reviewing and assessing its own 
effectiveness. The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is a matter for the Board. No Director is 
involved in determining his or her own remuneration.

Relationships with shareholders
The Board, on the Company’s behalf, recognises the need to maintain an active dialogue with its 
shareholders. The Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer meet regularly with institutional investors and 
analysts to discuss the Company’s performance and all shareholders have access to the Chairman and 
independent Senior Non-Executive Director, who are available to discuss any questions which investors 
may have in relation to the running of the Company. The Board encourages shareholders to attend the 
Annual General Meeting and is always willing to answer questions, either in the meeting itself or, more 
informally, afterwards. In addition, shareholders may contact HomeServe direct, either through its website 
or by telephoning its offices.
The Board also recognises the need to ensure that all Directors are fully aware of the views of major 
shareholders. Copies of all analysts’ research relating to the Company are circulated to Directors upon 
publication. The Board receive a monthly Investor Relations report which includes an analysis of the 
Company’s shareholder register as well as any feedback received from shareholders and analysts.
During the year the Board undertook a shareholder perception study to improve its understanding of 
the view of shareholders. Shareholder Perceptions, an independent third party company specialising in 
these studies, contacted a mix of existing and potential shareholders and asked a range of questions on 
strategy, financial performance and management strength. The results of the study were reviewed by the 
Board and incorporated into the Group’s strategic thinking. HomeServe 
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 64
Corporate governance
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in the Chairman’s statement and the Chief Executive’s review. 
Principal risks and uncertainties are detailed in the Financial review. In addition, the Financial review 
includes, amongst other things, cash flow and financing information.
The Directors confirm that, after reviewing the Group’s budget and projected cash flows, they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
accounts.
Internal controls
As required by the UK Listing Authority, the Company has complied throughout the year with the 
provisions of the Code relating to internal controls, having implemented the procedures necessary to 
comply with the guidance on internal control published in October 2005 (Turnbull Guidance) and to report 
in line with that guidance.
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such 
a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives 
and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
There is an established internal control framework in place, which is continually reviewed and updated 
taking into account the changing nature of the Group’s operations. This process has been in place for the 
whole of the year and up to the date of approval of this Annual Report and Accounts. 
The key elements of the system operated by the Group to identify, evaluate and manage significant risks 
include the following:
 > The Group’s management operates a formal process for identifying, managing and reporting on 
operational and financial risks faced by each of the Group’s businesses, whereby each of the risks 
identified is reviewed in detail by the Executive Directors on a regular basis. Weekly telephone meetings 
of the Executive Committee monitor its day-to-day performance, and full Executive Committee 
meetings are held at least eight times a year at which the Directors report on the progress of the 
companies or discipline for which they are responsible and share best practice. 
 > A clearly defined organisation structure is in place with clear lines of accountability and appropriate 
division of duties. The Group’s financial regulations specify authorisation limits for individual managers 
and for local boards of management, with all material transactions being approved by  
the Board. 
 >  Three year business plans, annual budgets and investment proposals for each business are formally 
prepared, reviewed and approved by the Board.
 > The Group has a dedicated Internal Audit function which reports directly to the Audit Committee and  
a formal audit plan is in place to address the key risks across the Group.
 > Consolidated financial results, including a comparison with budgets and forecasts, are reported to the 
Board on a monthly basis, with variances being identified and understood so that mitigating actions 
can be implemented, where appropriate. Governance
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 65
 > The consolidated accounts are reviewed by the Executive Directors and verified by the finance 
team. The accounts are then considered by the Audit Committee who make a recommendation in 
respect of their approval to the Board. The Board then review and approve the accounts prior to the 
announcement of the half year and annual results.
 > Appropriate treasury policies are in place.
 > The Company has adopted a formal ‘whistle blowing’ policy for employees, franchisees and  
sub-contractors who wish to raise any issues of concern relating to the Group’s activities on a 
confidential basis. 
 > A mechanism exists to extend the Group’s formal risk management processes to any significant new 
business acquired or established immediately upon acquisition or start-up. This is informed by the risk 
reviews completed as part of due diligence. In this way, the Board is able to confirm that the necessary 
process has been operated by the Group for the whole of the year.
 > The Risk Committee reviews a register summarising the significant risks faced by the businesses or  
the Group as a whole, the likelihood of those risks occurring and the steps being taken to minimise  
or otherwise manage those risks on a quarterly basis and updates the Audit Committee and the  
Board regularly.
As required by the Turnbull Guidance, the Board has carried out an annual assessment of the 
effectiveness of the system of internal controls. The processes applied by the Board include:
 > At the end of the year, the Executive Directors compile a report identifying the key risks faced by the 
Group. This report is considered by the Audit Committee and by the Board before the Annual Report 
and Accounts is approved.
 > The Group has an independent Internal Audit function which reviews the overall effectiveness of the 
risk management process for the key risks and reports independently to the Audit Committee.
 > At each meeting the Audit Committee reviews reports of the Executive Directors and the internal and 
external auditors, on any issues identified as having a potentially substantial impact on the results of 
the Group, or areas of control weakness.
 > The Risk Committee meets at least quarterly to assist the Audit Committee to monitor these risks, as 
well as to set the Group’s risk appetite and to evaluate in detail risk registers compiled by the Group’s 
businesses. The Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s system of managing 
financial risk and refers any risks it considers significant to the Board for its consideration.
 > At least twice a year, the Audit Committee reviews the work plans and results of each of the internal 
and external auditors.
 > The Audit Committee Chairman reports the outcome of all Audit Committee meetings to the Board, 
which also receives minutes of all such meetings. HomeServe

Remuneration report
This report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’) and 
Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
2008 and has been approved by the Board and the Remuneration Committee. The report also meets the 
relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board 
has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors’ remuneration. A resolution to approve 
the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
The Act requires the external auditors to report on certain parts of this report and to state whether, in 
their opinion, those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with it. The report has 
therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information 
Remuneration Committee
Role
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining and agreeing with the Board the pay, 
benefits and contractual arrangements for the Executive Directors of the Company and other members 
of the Executive Committee. It aims to develop and recommend strategies that drive performance and 
reward it appropriately. The Committee also has oversight of the long-term incentive schemes operated 
by the Company. In determining its policy, the Committee has paid regard to the principles and provisions 
of good governance contained in the Combined Code published in July 2003 by the UK Financial Reporting 
Council as updated in June 2008 (‘the Code‘). The Committee operates under the delegated authority of 
the Board and its terms of reference are available on request from the Company Secretary. 
Membership
The Committee was chaired throughout the year by Ian Chippendale. The other members of the 
Committee were Barry Gibson and Mark Morris. 
All of the members are independent Non-Executive Directors. The Board determined that the Chairman, 
Barry Gibson, should remain a member of the Committee taking account of the fact that he is considered 
to be independent and also that, as a former Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, his knowledge of 
the development of the remuneration policy and practices at HomeServe is invaluable. He takes no part in 
discussions relating to his own remuneration.

Annual Report & Accounts 2011 67
Advisers
During the year Hewitt New Bridge Street (’HNBS‘), a firm of independent remuneration consultants, 
served as advisers to the Committee. The Company also instructed HNBS to advise it on a limited number 
of remuneration matters concerning individuals below the Executive Committee during the year. Other 
than in relation to advice on remuneration, HNBS has no other connections with the Company. HNBS is a 
trading name of Aon Hewitt Ltd, the ultimate parent company of which is Aon Corporation. Aon Benfield 
(another Aon company) provides underwriting advice and services to HomeServe. The Remuneration 
Committee is comfortable that this does not present a conflict of interest.  The terms of engagement for 
HNBS are available on request from the Company Secretary.
The Committee has also received assistance from Richard Harpin, the Chief Executive and Anna Maughan, 
the Company Secretary, both of whom attended meetings of the Committee as required. Mr Harpin did 
not take part in discussions in respect of matters relating directly to his own remuneration. 
Remuneration policy
The Committee’s remuneration policy for the remuneration of Executive Directors and other senior 
executives is based on the following principles: 
 > to provide a remuneration package that is sufficient, but no more than necessary, to attract, retain and 
motivate high calibre executives;
 > to align rewards with the Group’s performance;
 > to reward good performance with remuneration that is in line with that payable by broadly 
comparable businesses i.e. high-growth companies of a similar size and those with similar operating 
characteristics;
 > to reward exceptional performance in such a way as to align the executives’ interests with those of the 
Company’s shareholders, with the potential to deliver above market levels of reward for outstanding 
performance.
To that end, the Committee structures executive remuneration in two distinct parts: fixed remuneration of 
basic salary, pension and benefits and variable performance-related remuneration in the form of a cash 
bonus and long-term incentive arrangements. Remuneration for Executive Directors is structured so that 
the variable pay element forms a significant portion of each Director’s package. 
The charts below demonstrate the balance between fixed and variable pay at ‘on-target’ and maximum 
performance levels, in the case of the long-term incentive arrangements assuming certain levels of share 
price growth. Maximum performance assumes the achievement of maximum bonus and full vesting of 
shares under the Company’s long-term incentive arrangements.

Annual Report & Accounts 2011 68
Remuneration report
They demonstrate the significant weighting of the package towards variable (performance-related) pay.  
In particular, the majority of Executive Directors’ total remuneration at the maximum performance level will 
derive from the Company’s long-term incentive arrangements, which are strongly aligned to shareholder 
value creation.  
The Committee has the discretion to take into account performance on environmental, social and 
governance matters when setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors. However, the Committee 
has chosen not to take these into specific account in setting performance targets for 2011/12 in the belief 
that the structures in place neither encourage nor reward inappropriate behaviour in this regard and that 
relevant operational controls relating to such matters are in place.
The Committee is satisfied that neither the structure of the remuneration packages, with the high 
weighting on variable pay, nor the performance measures targeted under the annual bonus and  
long-term incentives encourage inappropriate risk taking. The remuneration arrangements are designed 
so as to provide a strong alignment of interest between the executives and shareholders and to support 
the growth and performance aspirations of the Company and the Committee is satisfied that the current 
arrangements meet these objectives. Noting the best practice recommendations set out in the new  
UK Corporate Governance Code (effective for the 2011/12 financial year), the Committee has approved  
the introduction of a claw-back provision to future annual and long-term incentive awards.  
Key activities of the Remuneration Committee during the year
In line with its remit, the following key issues were discussed by the Committee during the year:
 > Review of salary levels for the Executive Directors and other members of the Executive Committee;
 > Agree the bonuses payable for the 2009/10 financial year;
 > Determination of the targets for the 2010/11 annual bonus plan;
 > Approval of the 2010 Remuneration report and review of the final outcome of the Annual General 
Meeting voting for the report; 
 > Approval of the performance targets and individual and aggregate award sizes to be granted under 
the 2008 LTIP;
 > Review of the performance targets and confirmation of the level of vesting of 2007 executive share 
option and deferred share bonus plan awards and approve vesting levels of other awards for ’good 
leavers‘ from the Company as appropriate;
 > Review of, and agreement to, all Director joining and leaving arrangements, covering all elements of 
their reward package;
 > Review of the remuneration arrangements for the Executive Directors and other members of the 
Executive Committee for 2011; and
 > Consideration of institutional investor guidelines on executive compensation. Governance

Remuneration report
Remuneration for Executive Directors
The main components of the remuneration package for Executive Directors are:
Basic salary
Basic salary for each Executive Director is determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account 
the roles, responsibilities, performance and experience of the individual. This is normally reviewed 
annually with any increase usually being effective from 1 April (unless responsibilities change). Salary 
levels are determined taking into account market data on salary levels for similar positions at comparable 
companies and pay and employment conditions of employees elsewhere in the Company. 
Following a review undertaken by HNBS in March 2009 the Committee determined that the top-half of the 
FTSE-250 was the most appropriate comparator group against which to benchmark salaries. HNBS updated 
their review in February 2011 using the top-half of the FTSE-250 as a comparator group (at the time of the 
review the Company was ranked 154th in the FTSE). Consideration was also given to the pay and conditions 
across the Group. It was agreed that the basic salaries of the Board and Executive Committee were 
positioned appropriately in respect of the benchmark but that an inflationary increase of 2½% be applied 
with effect from 1 April 2011. This was also the budgeted increase for the general workforce in the UK.
Current salaries are set out below:
Name of Director    2010/11 Salary  2011/12 Salary
R D Harpin    £510,000  £522,750
M Bennett    £306,000  £313,650
J Florsheim    £510,000  £522,750
J King     $575,252 $589,633
Annual bonus
The annual bonus is designed to drive and reward excellent short-term operating performance of the 
Company and encourage real year-on-year growth in profitability. No annual bonus is paid unless a very 
high level of profit performance is achieved. The maximum annual bonus for 2011/12 will be maintained at 
100% of basic salary (with the exception of Jon Florsheim whose maximum bonus potential is unchanged  
at 150% of salary). 
During the year, Executive Directors were able to earn up to 80% of bonus potential for Group financial 
performance, measured by profit before tax, amortisation and exceptional items. The remaining 20% of 
bonus potential was based on measurable personal targets, relating to the part of the business or the 
function for which the Director is responsible. This weighting differed for Jon Florsheim and Jonathan King 
who were able to earn a higher proportion of bonus potential based on targets specifically related to the 
performance of their respective divisions (the UK and the USA). 
For 2011/12 the maximum limits will remain the same as will the weighting between business and  
personal objectives. Provided their personal objectives are met in full, the normal ‘on-target‘ bonus payable 
to Executive Directors in any year is expected to be in the region of 60% of their basic salary (90% for  
Jon Florsheim).  Governance
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 71
Executive Directors’ bonuses are paid entirely in cash, though under the Long Term Incentive Plan adopted 
in 2008, Directors have the opportunity to invest part of their net bonus in shares. If they choose to do this, 
they may be awarded a matching award which is subject to a comparative Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) 
performance condition and an Earnings per Share (‘EPS’) target.
Long-term incentives
The Committee’s policy for the provision of long-term incentives to Executive Directors is to grant awards of 
performance shares (performance awards) and to provide them with the opportunity to voluntarily invest 
their annual bonus into a matching share arrangement (matching awards) under the Long Term Incentive 
Plan adopted in 2008 (the ‘2008 LTIP’). 
The maximum individual award limit under the 2008 LTIP is 200% of basic salary for performance awards 
and for matching awards is up to two shares for each share invested, based on a maximum investment of 
the net of tax equivalent of 75% of the maximum bonus potential. 
Consistent with the grant policy applied previously, the Committee intends to limit the size of performance 
share awards in 2011 to the Executive Directors to 150% of salary. Matching awards up to the maximum 
ratio of two shares for each invested share will continue to be granted. It should be noted that, under 
the plan rules, the executives may invest up to the lower of their actual bonus earned in the preceding 
financial year and 75% of their maximum bonus potential. In the event that actual bonuses are lower than 
25% of salary, executives may invest up to 25% of salary in shares from their own money. 
In 2010 the Committee conducted a review of the performance targets to be attached to awards under 
the LTIP. Following the review the Committee concluded that TSR remained an important performance 
condition and should be retained. However, in order to balance this measure with one which provides a 
stronger link to the long-term financial performance of the Company, the Committee decided that it would 
be appropriate to incorporate a stretching EPS target. The Committee considers that the use of both EPS 
and TSR creates a balance between internal financial and external relative stock market measures and 
both measures are aligned to shareholder value creation.
Accordingly, as last year, 50% of the award of performance and matching shares will be subject to TSR 
targets. 25% of any award subject to TSR will vest if HomeServe’s TSR performance is equal to the FTSE-250 
index, increasing on a straight line basis to 100% vesting where TSR performance exceeds the Index by an 
average of 15% per annum.
In determining the vesting of awards in any year under the TSR part of the award, the Committee will also 
take into account the underlying financial performance of the business. 
50% of the award will be subject to a target based on a range of EPS growth. 25% of any award subject to 
EPS will vest for average annual EPS growth of RPI + 4%, increasing in a straight line to 100% vesting where 
average annual EPS growth is RPI + 10%. 
For both conditions, performance will be measured over a period of three years.
The estimated fair value of LTIP awards granted in 2010 was 77% of the face value of the share at the time 
of grant.
Awards under the 2008 LTIP may be satisfied through a mixture of either market purchase or new issue 
shares. To the extent new issue shares are used, the 2008 LTIP will adhere to a 5% in 10 year dilution limit. HomeServe 
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 72
Remuneration report
Executive Directors may also participate in the Group’s Save As You Earn Scheme (where share options are 
exercisable after three or five years at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares at the time 
of grant). No performance criteria are attached to this scheme.
Benefits
Non-pension benefits comprise company car and fuel allowance and medical insurance. The range of 
benefits and their value are considered to be broadly in line with those provided to Executive Directors in 
similar companies in the FTSE-250. 
Shareholding guidelines
It is the Board’s policy that Executive Directors and certain members of the Company’s senior 
management build up and retain a minimum shareholding in the Company. Each Executive Director is 
encouraged to hold shares of at least equal value to his annual basic salary. 
Accordingly, if the holding guideline has not been fulfilled at the point of exercise of any option or the 
vesting of any other long-term incentive award, the Director must retain 50% of the net proceeds in the 
Company’s shares until the holding requirement is achieved. Details of the current shareholdings of the 
Executive Directors are provided on page 78. 
Service contracts
The Committee’s policy is to offer service contracts with notice periods of one year or less (other than in 
exceptional circumstances, where longer initial notice periods may be offered on appointment, and then 
reduced to one year over time).
All Executive Directors’ contracts of service are terminable on 12 months’ notice by either party. Further 
details of the Executive Directors’ contracts are summarised in the table below:
Name of Director    Date of contract
R D Harpin    18 January 2002
M Bennett    26 June 2009
J Florsheim    5 March 2007
J King      28 September 2010
The company may terminate the executive’s employment by making a payment equivalent to one year’s 
remuneration (excluding bonus in the case of Martin Bennett and Jonathan King). Notice periods and 
payments are not extendable in takeover situations. Governance
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 73
Pensions
Executive Directors currently participate in one of two pension schemes, the Water Companies Pension 
Scheme (WCPS) or the HomeServe Money Plan (HMP). The normal date of retirement for Executive Directors 
is at age 60. 
The WCPS is a funded, Inland Revenue approved occupational defined benefit scheme. Richard Harpin  
and Jonathan King were members of the WCPS during the year. In respect of these Directors, its main 
features are:
 > pension at normal retirement age of one-half of final pensionable salary and a tax free lump sum  
of one and a half times final pensionable salary on completion of 40 years’ service at an accrual rate of 
80ths plus 
3
/ 80ths cash;
 > life assurance of five times basic salary;
 > pension payable in the event of ill health; and spouse’s pension on death. 
Mr Harpin is a non-contributory member.
A notional earnings cap restricts the benefits provided to members of the WCPS. An unapproved pension 
payment, equal to 20% of the amount by which his basic salary exceeds the notional cap is paid annually. 
The notional cap is indexed in line with earnings inflation. For 2010/11 the notional cap was £122,792.
The HMP is a funded, Inland Revenue approved occupational defined contribution pension scheme.  
Jon Florsheim and Martin Bennett are members of the HMP. In respect of Martin Bennett, its main  
features are:
 > employer contributions of 20%;
 > life assurance of five times basic salary;
 > permanent health insurance; and
 > spouse’s pension on death.
In respect of Jon Florsheim, its main features are:
 > employer contributions of 8%;
 > life assurance of five times basic salary;
 > permanent health insurance; and
 > spouse’s pension on death.
Where the benefits provided to Executive Directors under the scheme are restricted as a result of the 
notional earnings cap described above, further provision is made by making a payment of 20% in cash of 
the amount by which his basic salary exceeds the cap in respect of Martin Bennett, and 8% into the HMP 
in respect of Jon Florsheim.
No changes were made to the pension arrangements following recent changes in the tax regime. HomeServe

Remuneration report
Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors serve under letters of appointment for periods of three years. Previously these 
letters included provisions in respect of liquidated damages limited to the payment of one year’s fee.  
This provision was removed in 2009/10. The Non-Executive Directors therefore have a notice period of 
three months but no liquidated damages are payable. 
Their fees are determined by the Executive Directors within the limits set by the Articles of Association and 
are based on information on fees paid in similar companies and the skills and expected time commitment 
of the individual concerned. Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to bonus payments or pension 
arrangements, nor do they participate in the Company’s long-term incentive plans. 
Details of their current three year appointments are as follows:
Name of Director    Date of contract
J M B Gibson    1 April 2010
I Chippendale    1 January 2010
S David    23 November 2010
A Sibbald    1 June 2010
M Morris    27 February 2009
The fees for the Non-Executive Directors were last reviewed in January 2010 with the changes being 
effective from 1 April 2010. During the year the base Board fee was £44,000 with a premium for 
Chairmanship of the Audit and Remuneration Committees of £8,500. Ian Chippendale received an 
additional fee of £5,000 for his role as Senior Independent Director and Barry Gibson received £200,000 
for his role as Chairman. No increase is proposed for 2011/12.

The transfer values disclosed above do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual Director. 
Instead they represent a potential liability of the pension scheme. The decrease in the transfer value in the

and indexation of pensions.

The DBP was introduced in 2005. Under its terms, Executive Directors were able to invest some or all of 
their annual bonus into shares and to defer receipt for three years. Matching shares could be earned if the 
TSR of the Company over a three year period exceeded the median of the FTSE-350 index of companies 
(excluding investment trusts). Mr Harpin elected to convert his vested award granted on 2 August 2005 
into a nil cost option at the end of the performance period. The option can be exercised at any time up 
until tenth anniversary of grant. 
The table below demonstrates the vesting of matching shares under the DBP according to TSR growth:
TSR¹ performance Matching ratio

 TSR is averaged over the three months prior to the beginning end of the performance period. 
At the end of the performance period for the 2007 awards, HomeServe’s TSR performance was ranked 
between median and upper decile against the constituents of the FTSE 350 Index. Accordingly 2.48 
matching shares vested for each invested share out of a maximum three matching shares for each 
invested share. The price of an ordinary share on 21 September 2010, the date on which the 2007 invested 
shares vested was £4.657. HomeServe

The market price of the Company’s shares on 25 June 2010, the date the awards were granted was 
£4.078. 
The performance conditions in respect of the 2008 LTIP awards granted in 2008 and 2009 are based 
exclusively on a TSR performance condition, an EPS target was added in 2010.  These conditions are 
described in the unaudited section of this report.
For awards granted in 2008 and 2009, as at 31 March 2011 the Company’s TSR performance was greater 
than the Index but less than 15% p.a. compound. If this level of performance was maintained until the end 
of the performance period, the awards would vest as follows: 2008 performance and matching awards, 
39% and 40% respectively and for the 2009 performance and matching awards, 71% and 67% respectively. HomeServe 
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 82
For awards granted in 2010, as at 31 March 2011 the Company’s TSR performance was below that of the 
FTSE-250 Index. If this level of performance was maintained until the end of the performance period, then 
this part of the performance or matching awards (50%) would not vest. The other 50% of the 2010 awards 
is subject to an EPS performance condition (RPI + 4% to 10% p.a.). Adjusted EPS grew by 11.6% above RPI in 
2010/11, if this performance was maintained until the end of the performance period, then 50% of this part 
of the award would vest (maximum 50%).  
General
The market price of the Company’s shares at 31 March 2011 was £4.443 (2010: £17.92 which is equivalent 
to £3.584 following the share split). During the year the price, adjusted to take into account the share split, 
ranged from £3.588 to £4.875.
The shares required for share options and awards under any of the long-term incentive schemes 
described above may be fulfilled by the purchase of shares in the market by the Company’s employee 
benefit trust (EBT). As beneficiaries under the EBT, the Directors are deemed to be interested in the shares 
held by the EBT which at 31 March 2011 amounted to 7,740,165 ordinary shares. Shares may also be fulfilled 
through newly issued shares, subject to the dilution limits within each scheme (fully compliant with 
investor guidelines).

Financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts, Remuneration report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law, the Directors are required to prepare the Group financial statements under International Financial 
Reporting Standards (’IFRSs‘) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and 
have also chosen to prepare the parent Company financial statements under IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union. Under company law, the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of 
the Company for that period.  In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 > properly select and apply accounting policies;
 > present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable information; and 
 > provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient 
to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the 
entity’s financial position and financial performance and make an assessment of the Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the Company’s transactions and that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We confirm to the best of our knowledge:
 > the Group financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
 > the management report (which comprises the Directors’ report and the review of the business set out 
in the Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s review and Financial review) includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.

Group independent auditor’s report
We have audited the Group financial statements of HomeServe plc for the year ended 31 March 2011 
which comprise the Group income statement, the Group statement of comprehensive income, the Group 
balance sheet, the Group statement of changes in equity, the Group cash flow statement and the related 
notes 1 to 41. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable 
law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no 
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities statement, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.  In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements.  
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
 > give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2011 and of its profit for the 
year then ended;
 > have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
 > have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 > the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the Group financial statements. Financial statements

 > the Directors’ statement contained within the Corporate Governance statement in relation to going

Notes to the financial statements
Year ended 31 March 2011
1. General information
HomeServe plc is a Company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act. The address 
of the registered office is Cable Drive, Walsall WS2 7BN.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with 
the policies set out in note 2.
2. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs, adopted by the European Union 
and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. 
Adoption of new or revised standards and accounting policies
In the current year, the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted in 
these financial statements.
The Group has adopted IFRS3 ’Business Combinations’ (revised 2008) and IAS27 ‘Consolidated and Separate 
Financial Statements’ (revised 2008). The most significant changes to the Group’s previous accounting 
policies for business combinations are that acquisition related costs, which previously would have been 
included in the cost of a business combination, are included in operating costs as they are incurred.
The revised standards have been applied to the acquisitions in the current year, as described in note 33.
Any adjustments to contingent consideration for acquisitions made prior to 31 March 2010 which result in an 
adjustment to goodwill continue to be accounted for under IFRS3 (2004) and IAS27 (2005).
IFRIC17 ‘Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners’, IFRS2 (amended) ‘Group Cash-settled Share-based 
Payment Transactions’ and ‘Improvements to IFRSs (2009)’ have also been adopted in the year but their 
adoption has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements.
Standards in issue but not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements the following Standards and Interpretations, 
which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective:
IFRS9  Financial Instruments
IAS24 (revised Nov 2009) Related Party Disclosures
Amendments to IAS12 (Dec 2010) Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets
Amendments to IFRS7 (Oct 2010) Disclosures – Transfers of Financial Assets
Amendments to IFRIC14 (Nov 2009) Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement
IFRIC19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments
Improvements to IFRSs (May 2010)
The implementation of IFRS9 which the Group expects to adopt for the year beginning on 1 April 2013 will 
impact both the measurement and disclosures of Financial Instruments.
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the other Standards and Interpretations listed above will 
have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of 
financial instruments, and on a going concern basis as set out in the Corporate governance statement. 
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled 
by the Company made up to 31 March each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to 
govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. HomeServe 
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 94
Notes to the financial statements
Year ended 31 March 2011
2. Significant accounting policies (continued) 
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair 
values at the date of acquisition. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are 
included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective 
date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting 
policies used into line with those used by the Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and 
expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The 
consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) 
of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related 
costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a 
contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes in 
such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period 
adjustments (see below). All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration 
classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs. Changes in the fair 
value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which 
the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is 
incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period (see below), or 
additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts 
recognised as of that date. 
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete 
information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a 
maximum of one year.
Any adjustments to contingent consideration for acquisitions made prior to 31 March 2010 which result in an 
adjustment to goodwill continue to be accounted for under IFRS3 (2004) and IAS27 (2005).
Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised at cost as an asset at the date control is acquired 
(the acquisition date).  Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred over 
the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if there is an 
indication that it may be impaired. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and 
is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating 
unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash generating unit and then to the other assets of the unit 
pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for 
goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary or joint venture, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the 
determination of the profit or loss on disposal. Financial statements
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 95
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous 
UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves 
under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent 
profit or loss on disposal.
Investments in joint ventures
The Group’s share of results of joint ventures is included in the consolidated income statement using the 
equity method of accounting. The Group’s share of their net assets is included in the consolidated balance 
sheet, including associated goodwill. Based on the guidance of IAS28 ‘Investments in Associates’, provision 
for the Group’s share of the joint venture losses is not recognised if the recognition of such losses reduces 
the Group’s share of the joint venture’s net assets below zero where there is no recourse to the Group to 
fund these losses.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts 
receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT, Insurance 
Premium Tax and other sales related taxes.
Revenue recorded by the Group includes commissions receivable in the Group’s role as an intermediary in the 
policy sale and administration process. Any third-party costs incurred on behalf of the principal that are 
rechargeable under the contractual arrangement, or where the Group’s role is only as an intermediary in the 
cash collection process, are not included in revenue. Consequently, on the sale of a policy, gross revenue 
consists of only a component of the overall policy price, representing the commission receivable for the 
marketing and sale of the policy, stated net of sales related taxes.
Where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more separate arrangements that can be provided to 
customers either on a stand-alone basis or as an optional extra, revenue is recognised for each element as if it 
were an individual contract. Accordingly, revenue is recognised on the sale of a policy except where an 
obligation exists to provide future services, typically claims handling and policy administration services. In these 
situations, a proportion of revenue, sufficient to cover future claims handling costs and margin, is deferred over 
the life of the policy, as deferred income. The assessment of future claims handling takes account of the 
expected numbers of claims and the estimated cost of handling those claims, which are validated through 
experience of historical actual costs. 
The deferred revenue is released over the expected profile of anticipated claims over the policy period.  
The deferral also includes a profit element to recognise the performance of these services in the future.
Revenue on sales of franchises is recognised when the obligations to the franchisee are complete. Revenue 
on the sale of new franchise licences is recognised upon the signing of the related franchise agreement. 
These franchise fees are non-refundable and primarily relate to initial set-up services.
Repair revenue relates to repairs undertaken on behalf of underwriters subject to separate contractual 
arrangements. Such revenue is recognised on completion of the repair.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at 
the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The 
corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease 
payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve 
a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
relevant lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also 
spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term. HomeServe 
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 96
Notes to the financial statements
Year ended 31 March 2011
2. Significant accounting policies (continued) 
Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on 
the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. 
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange 
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average 
exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly. Exchange movements, if any, 
are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such cumulative exchange 
movements are recognised as income or expense in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and 
liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after charging all operating costs and after the share of results of joint ventures 
(net of tax) but before investment income and finance costs.
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For defined benefit retirement schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit 
credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and 
losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are recognised outside the income 
statement and presented in the statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and is 
otherwise amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value 
of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present 
value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. The Group’s liability for current tax is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the 
computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax 
liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in 
subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of 
the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. Financial statements
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 97
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the 
asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is 
settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when 
it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with 
in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax 
assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land, over their estimated useful 
lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:
Buildings  25-50 years
Furniture, fixtures and equipment  7 years
Computer equipment  3-7 years
Motor vehicles  3 years (with 25% residual value)
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as 
owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking or business are stated at their fair 
value and are amortised over their useful lives, using the straight-line method, as follows:
Customer relationships  3-15 years
Customer databases  3-10 years
Franchise assets  3-15 years
Trademarks and similar access rights, acquired on an exclusive use basis from third party commercial 
partners, are also treated as intangible assets. These assets are recorded at cost and amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the length of the contractual agreement up to a maximum of 20 years.
Computer software and the related licences are stated at cost and amortised over their useful lives of three 
to seven years.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets 
to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any 
such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent 
of the impairment loss, if any. Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from 
other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the 
asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, 
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the assets for which 
the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying 
amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.  
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately. HomeServe 
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 98
Notes to the financial statements
Year ended 31 March 2011
2. Significant accounting policies (continued) 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit 
is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount 
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been 
recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised as income immediately.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, 
where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the 
inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is measured on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. Net 
realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to 
be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective 
items where appropriate.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes 
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are classified either ‘at fair value 
through profit or loss (FVTPL)’ or ‘loans and receivables’. The classification depends on the nature and purpose 
of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.  Financial liabilities are classified as 
either financial liabilities ‘at FVTPL’ or ‘other financial liabilities’.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at amortised cost as reduced by appropriate 
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid 
investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual 
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets 
of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are stated at amortised cost and are recorded at the proceeds received, 
net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct 
issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest method and are added to the 
carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, as cash flow hedges. At the 
inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument 
and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge 
and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging 
relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow 
hedges are deferred in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately  
in the income statement and is included within finance costs. When a forecast transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in the 
income statement. Financial statements
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 99
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item is also 
recognised in the income statement in the same line as the recognised hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument 
expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or 
loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is 
ultimately recognised in the income statement.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at amortised cost.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past 
event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the 
consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks 
and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated  
to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows. When some or  
all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a 
receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount 
of the receivable can be measured reliably.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS2 Share-Based Payments. In accordance with the transitional 
provision, IFRS2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested 
as of 1 April 2005. 
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based 
payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the 
equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on 
the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. The Group also provides employees with the ability  
to purchase the Group’s ordinary shares at a discount to the current market value through Save As You  
Earn schemes. 
The Group also issues cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees. For cash-settled share-
based payments, a liability is recognised for the services acquired, measured initially at the fair value of the 
liability. At each balance sheet date, until the liability is settled, the fair value of the liability is remeasured with 
any changes in fair value recognised in the profit or loss for the year.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model or Monte Carlo Simulation models depending on the 
type of scheme.
Own shares reserve
Shares of the parent Company that are purchased by the HomeServe plc Employee Benefit Trust are held at 
cost and shown as a deduction in equity. Cost comprises consideration paid, including directly attributable 
costs. The shares are held to satisfy obligations under the share option schemes. HomeServe

3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the directors are required to 
make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are 
not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical 
experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period,  
or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Revenue recognition
An appropriate proportion of revenue, sufficient to cover future costs and margin, is deferred to future periods 
when the Group has obligations extending to future periods. As a result, judgement is required in assessing 
the extent and associated costs of fulfilling those future obligations. The Group uses historical experience and 
forecast activity levels in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognise in the current period and 
how much to defer to future periods. 
An assessment is also made of any factors that are likely to materially affect the economic benefits which will 
flow to the Group such as policy cancellations. To the extent that economic benefits are not expected to flow to 
the Group, the value of that revenue is not recognised. The Group uses historical experience in determining the 
appropriate amount of revenue to recognise.
Valuation of acquisition intangible assets
Acquisitions may result in customer relationships and customer databases being recognised as intangible 
assets. These are valued using the excess earnings method. In applying this methodology certain key 
judgements and estimates are required to be made in respect of future cash flows together with an 
appropriate discount factor for the purpose of determining the present value of those cash flows.
Impairment of goodwill and acquisition intangible assets
The annual impairment assessment in respect of goodwill and acquisition intangibles requires estimates of 
the value in use (or fair value less costs to sell) of cash-generating units to which goodwill and acquisition 
intangibles have been allocated. As a result, estimates of future cash flows are required, together with an 
appropriate discount factor for the purpose of determining the present value of those cash flows. The 
carrying value of goodwill is £192,080,000 (2010 restated: £188,431,000). The carrying value of acquisition 
intangibles is £37,157,000 (2010: £27,931,000). Following the annual impairment review, no impairment 
charge has been recorded against goodwill or acquisition intangibles in either year. As set out in note 14, 
reasonably possible changes in respect of commercial outcomes around sales volumes, prices, margins 
and discount rates can impact the recoverable value.
Pensions
The Group participates in a defined benefit retirement scheme for certain employees. The scheme assets 
and liabilities are valued by an independent qualified actuary using the assumptions summarised in note 
39. As required by IAS19, the value of the defined benefit obligation has been measured using the projected 
unit credit method which requires the use of judgement and estimation.
4. Revenue
From 1 April 2010 the UK financial results include the revenue and costs of repair jobs undertaken by 
sub-contract engineers. This reflects a change in the Group’s commercial relationship with its underwriter 
where it now provides a full repair service to underwriters instead of the previous repair administration 
service. This change has increased both revenue and costs by £41,700,000 in the current year; it only affects 
the UK and there is no impact on profits. Financial statements

5. Business and geographical segments
Segment revenues and results 
IFRS8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the 
Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, who is considered to be the Chief 
Executive, to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance. The internal reporting of 
the Group has changed during the year such that all established businesses are reviewed individually, and 
all other new operations are reviewed collectively as ‘New Markets’. Prior year presentation has been 
restated to reflect this new segmental analysis. 
Inter-segment revenue is charged at prevailing market prices. Segment profit/loss represents the result  
of each segment including allocating costs associated with head office and shared functions, but before 
allocating investment income, finance costs and tax. This is the measure reported to the Group’s Chief 
Executive for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance. 
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in Significant 
Accounting Policies except in relation to our joint venture, Doméo, in France where the following 
adjustments are made for segmental reporting purposes: (a) revenue is included in Total Revenue and 
(b) shareholder fees from Doméo are added back, and Group cost allocations are deducted in arriving  
at segmental operating profit.

11. Tax (continued)
On 23 March 2011 the Government announced that the main rate of Corporation Tax would reduce to  
26% with effect from 1 April 2011, with subsequent 1% reductions per annum to reach 23% with effect from  
1 April 2014. The change to 26% took statutory effect when it was approved by the House of Commons on  
29 March 2011, therefore the reduction had been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and has 
been reflected in the financial statements for deferred tax purposes.
The subsequent proposed reductions have not been substantively enacted. The effect of these tax rate 
changes on the deferred tax balance will be accounted for in the period in which the tax rate reductions are 
substantively enacted.

14. Goodwill (continued)
During the year, the contingent consideration payable on the 2009 acquisition of SPT (Belgium) was reduced 
by £1,755,000. Goodwill on the acquisition has been reduced accordingly, with the goodwill and contingent 
consideration being restated in the comparative period.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at acquisition to the cash generating units (’CGUs‘) 
that are expected to benefit from that business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill has been 
allocated as follows:
        (restated)

       £000 £000
UK        154,656 154,567

United States of America       4,180 —
        192,080 188,431
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill 
might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions 
for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, growth rates and expected changes 
to selling prices and direct costs during the period. Management estimate the Group discount rate using a 
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and adjust, if necessary,  
to the risks specific to the CGUs. The growth rates are based on detailed business plans. Changes in selling 
prices and direct costs are based on expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares an annual cash flow forecast derived from the most recent financial budgets approved 
by the Directors and extrapolates the annual cash flow using estimated long-term growth rates of between 
2% and 2.5% (2010: 2.5%) representing long-term growth rates based on respective country GDP rates. The 
pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for all CGUs is 9% (2010: 11.2%). 
Management has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each CGU’s carrying value, the 
key assumptions are as noted above. Management believes that there are no reasonably possible changes 
to the key assumptions in the next year which would result in the carrying amount of goodwill exceeding 
the recoverable amount. This view is based upon inherently judgemental assumptions, however, takes 
account of the headroom in management’s internal growth targets verses the conservative growth 
estimates used in the impairment review.  Financial statements

Trade receivables
The Group has provided fully for those receivable balances that it does not expect to recover. This 
assessment has been undertaken by reviewing the status of all significant balances that are past due and 
involves assessing both the reason for non-payment and the credit worthiness of the counterparty.
Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, there is no significant concentration of credit risk, 
with exposure spread across a large number of counterparties and customers. There are no customers who 
represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £6,832,000 (2010: 
£4,176,000) which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been  
a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable. The Group does not hold 
any collateral over these balances. The average age of receivables not impaired is 38 days (2010: 40 days). HomeServe

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality 
of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration 
of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated. Accordingly, the Directors 
believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.

91 days +       1,033 1,285
        1,285 2,335
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair 
value.
Other receivables
As part of its activities, the Group serves as an intermediary, whereby it is responsible for the collection of 
cash on behalf of third parties. Other receivables mainly represent those amounts to be collected from 
policyholders, but to be remitted to third parties for obligations such as the cost of underwriting and 
Insurance Premium Tax. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to individual receivables being small 
and spread across a diverse policyholder base. In addition, overall balance sheet exposure is mitigated as 
defaults on these receivables can, in the most part, be offset against the corresponding payable included  
in ’Other creditors’.
Cash balances and cash equivalents
Cash balances and cash equivalents of £16,101,000 (2010: £25,409,000) comprise cash held by the Group 
and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. The carrying amount of 
these assets approximates to their fair value. Financial statements

21. Derivative financial instruments
During the year ended 31 March 2008, the Group entered into an interest rate swap arrangement with a 
notional value of £50,000,000. The interest rate swap was used to hedge loans subject to variable interest 
rates linked to LIBOR, with a fixed interest rate. The interest rate swap expired during the year ended 31 
March 2010. Further details are set out in note 41.
22. Bank and other loans

The weighted average interest rates paid were as follows:
Revolving credit facilities       1.1 3.5
Loan notes       — 0.5
All the Group’s revolving credit facilities are unsecured. The carrying amount of the Group’s borrowings 
approximates to their fair value.
The other principal features of the Group’s borrowings are as follows:
 > The Group has revolving credit facilities with a number of banks totalling £150,000,000 (2010: 
£150,000,000). The revolving credit facility was taken out on 20 December 2007 and has a term of 
five years.
 > The covenants associated with the credit facilities are ‘net debt to EBITDA of less than 3.5 times’ and 
‘interest cover greater than 4 times operating profit before amortisation’. The Group has complied with 
all covenant requirements in the current and prior year.
 > Loan notes are repayable on demand, subject to a minimum initial maturity of six months.
 > All of the Group’s borrowings are currently at floating rates at margins of between 0.1% and 1% above 
LIBOR, thus exposing the Group to cash flow and interest rate risk.
At 31 March 2011, the Group had available £122,076,000 (2010: £72,000,000) of undrawn committed 
borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met. HomeServe

Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset. The following is the analysis of the deferred tax 
balances (after offset) for financial reporting purposes:
       2011 2010
    UK Spain USA £000 £000

Net deferred tax asset    1,763 1,018 2,791 5,572 2,937
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £23,735,000 (2010: £26,800,000) available 
for offset against future profits and which can be carried forward indefinitely. A deferred tax asset of 
£3,809,000 (2010: £2,318,000) has been recognised in respect of these losses based on estimates of 
budgeted profits in the forthcoming year. Deferred tax has not been recognised on the remainder of these 
losses due to the uncertainty over the timing of future recovery.  
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in joint ventures are not material.

costs. The average credit period taken for trade purchases is 52 days (2010: 49 days).
Deferred income represents revenue where an obligation exists to provide future services. An appropriate 
proportion of monies received in advance are treated as deferred income and recognised over the relevant 
period. Financial statements

33. Business combinations
On 12 August 2010, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Keyspan Energy Solutions LLC 
and National Grid Energy Services (New England) LLC (both trading as National Grid Energy Services).  
Together these companies provide home emergency and repair contracts to 183,000 customers. The 
acquisition accelerates the current strategy of HomeServe USA of offering utility branded service contracts, 
in a transaction which brings both existing contracts and the opportunity to add new contracts in previously 
un-marketed National Grid territories. This will give HomeServe USA marketing access to an additional  
5m residential households. The acquisition also brings a US centre of excellence in repair management to 
the Group. The deferred consideration relates to a part of the overall deal value deferred to future periods.
On 8 March 2011, the Group entered into an agreement with South Jersey Energy Services Plus (“SJESP”). 
SJESP services residential and light commercial heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, provides 
plumbing repair services, and provides repair services under service contracts for appliances in New Jersey.  
These services are provided to in excess of 59,000 customers and include in excess of 125,000 distinct 
service contracts with those customers. The Group acquired the exclusive right to acquire these customer 
relationships, and to renew all existing and new customer contracts. The deferred consideration includes 
amounts dependent upon the retention and transfer of the customer relationships to the Group and other 
amounts deferred to future periods.

33. Business combinations (continued) 
National Grid Energy Services
The provisional fair value adjustments recognised on the acquisition of National Grid Energy Services relate 
to the best estimate of provisions against assets, the recognition of additional liabilities as at the 
acquisition date and the recognition of intangible assets on acquisition. Goodwill of £4,282,000 arose from 
the acquisition (£39,000 increase from the £4,243,000 disclosed in the Condensed Consolidated financial 
statements for the six months ended 30 September 2010, due principally to an update to the assessment  
of liabilities on acquisition).
The goodwill arising on the excess of consideration over the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired 
represents the expectation of synergy savings and efficiencies. The goodwill and intangible assets are 
expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
The acquisition contributed £16,022,000 in revenue and a profit before acquisition amortisation of 
£2,990,000 (profit of £1,913,000 post acquisition amortisation) since acquisition on 12 August 2010. It is not 
practicable to disclose the revenue and profit before tax between 1 April 2010 and 12 August 2010 because 
the acquired companies operated a number of other businesses, which were discontinued during that 
period by the vendor. Costs in respect of the acquisition of the business, relating to legal and financial 
advisory services, were not significant during the year and were expensed to operating results.
South Jersey Energy Services Plus
The acquisition of SJESP results in intangible assets relating to the exclusive access to customer and 
marketing databases. As the consideration relates principally to the acquisition of these exclusive access 
rights, no goodwill arises. The intangibles assets are expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Due to the timing of the acquisition, there was no significant contribution to the Group’s results for the year.  
It is not practicable to disclose the revenue and profit before tax between 1 April 2010 and 8 March 2011 
because the acquired business was subsumed in the vendor’s other activities and therefore this information 
is not available. Costs in respect of the acquisition of the business, relating to legal and financial advisory 
services, were not significant during the year and were expensed to operating results.
In addition to the net cash outflow arising on the acquisitions above of £11,548,000, contingent and deferred 
consideration of £4,685,000 was paid relating to current and prior period acquisitions; and additional 
goodwill of £89,000 was recognised in respect of adjustments to consideration relating to other prior 
acquisitions.
34. Discontinued operations
In the prior year, the Group exited from its Emergency Services Division through the disposal of a number  
of businesses and the closure of the Property Repairs business, resulting in a 2010 reported loss of 
£42,025,000. In the current year there was no profit or loss.  
During the year, the discontinued operations had a net cash inflow of £1,824,000 (2010: outflow of 
£17,705,000) in respect of operating cash flows, paid £nil (2010: £962,000) in respect of investing activities 
and paid £nil (2010: £nil) in respect of financing activities. Financial statements

disclosed in note 16.
38. Share-based payments
During the year ended 31 March 2011, the Group had five (2010: six) share-based payment arrangements, 
which are described below:
i) Executive Share Option Plan (‘ESOP’)
The ESOP provides for a grant price equal to the closing quoted market price of the Company’s shares on 
the day before the date of grant. The vesting period is three years and is dependent upon the real increase 
in Earnings Per Share over the vesting period. In addition, since 2006, vesting has also been dependant 
upon a share price target. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of 
grant, the options expire. 
ii) 2005 Key Executive Incentive Plan (‘KEIP’)
The KEIP provides for a grant price equal to the closing quoted market price of the Company’s shares on the 
day before the date of grant. The awards vest in two tranches, the first being between three and four years 
from the date of grant and the second being on the second anniversary of the vesting of the first tranche. 
The number of awards vesting was dependent upon the Profit Before Tax of the Group for the year ended 
31 March 2008 and was subject to a minimum share price criteria during the year ending 31 March 2009. 
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
iii) Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
The LTIP provides for the grant of performance and matching awards. The vesting period is three years and 
for the awards granted in 2008 and 2009 vesting is dependent upon the Total Shareholder Return 
performance of the Group over the relevant performance period. From 2010, 50% of the award is dependent 
upon Total Shareholder Return and 50% is subject to a target based on Earnings per Share growth.  If the 
awards remain unexercised after a period of one year from vesting, they expire. Financial statements
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 121
iv) Deferred Bonus Plan (‘DBP’)
The Deferred Bonus Plan enables the individual to defer receipt of their annual cash bonus (up to a 
maximum of 100%) and to invest an equivalent amount in the ordinary share capital of the Company. 
The deferred bonus may be matched by the Company dependent upon the Company’s relative Total 
Shareholder Return over a three year period, up to a maximum of 300% of the deferred amount for upper 
decile performance. The shares cannot normally be exercised for three years and lapse if not exercised 
within 10 years from the date of grant.
v) Save As You Earn Scheme (‘SAYE’)
The SAYE is open to all UK employees and provides for an exercise price equal to the closing quoted market 
price on the day before the date of grant, less a discretionary discount. The options can be exercised during 
a six month period following the completion of either a three or five year savings period.

The figures in the table relate to the number of deferred options only.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 
£4.59 (2010: £3.25).
The estimated fair values are calculated by applying a Black-Scholes option pricing model for the ESOP and 
SAYE and Monte Carlo simulations for the KEIP, LTIP and Deferred Bonus Plan. The assumptions used in the 
models (which are comparable to the prior year) are as follows:
Input Assumption
Share price  Price at date of grant
Exercise price  Per scheme rules
Expected volatility 20% – 45%
Option life  Per scheme rules
Expected dividends  Based on historic dividend yield
Risk free interest rate 3.8% – 5.2%
Levels of early exercises and lapses are estimated using historical averages. Volatility is calculated by 
looking at the historical share price movements prior to the date of grant over a period of time 
commensurate with the remaining term for each award.  
The Group recognised total expenses of £2,899,000 (2010: £2,397,000) related to equity-settled, share-
based payment transactions and total expenses of £45,000 (2010: £nil) related to cash-settled share-based 
payment transactions. Financial statements

39. Retirement benefit schemes
Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme for all qualifying employees.  
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees. 
Where there are employees who leave the scheme prior to the contributions fully vesting, the contributions 
paid by the Group are forfeited by the employee.
The total cost charged to income of £2,723,000 (2010: £2,484,000) represents contributions payable to these 
schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans. At 31 March 2011, contributions of 
£249,000 (2010: £nil) due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit scheme
The Group participates in a defined benefit scheme, the Water Companies Pension Scheme, for qualifying 
employees. This is a sectionalised scheme and the Group participates in the HomeServe plc Section of the 
Scheme. The Section funds are administered by the trustees and are independent of the Group’s finances. 
Contributions are paid to the Section in accordance with the recommendations of an independent actuarial 
adviser. 
The results of the actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2008 were updated to 31 March 2011 by an independent 
qualified actuary in accordance with IAS19. As required by IAS19, the value of the defined benefit obligation 
and the current service cost have been measured using the projected unit credit method.
In July 2010, the government announced its intention that future revaluation pension increase orders would 
be measured by the Consumer Prices Index, rather than the Retail Prices Index. The impact of this change 
on the benefits provided by the Section has been reflected in the Company’s assumptions and an actuarial 
gain of £2,331,000 has been recognised as a result. This amount is included within the actuarial gains 
recognised outside profit and loss in other comprehensive income in the figures below.
        Valuation at
       2011 2010
Key assumptions used:
Discount rate at 31 March       5.6% 5.6%
Consumer price inflation       3.0% n/a
Retail price inflation       3.7% 3.9%
Expected rate of salary increases       5.2% 5.4%
Future pension increases       3.0% 3.9%
Expected rate of return on scheme assets at 31 March     7.8% 8.0%
Life expectancy of male aged 60 at balance sheet date         26.5 yrs 26.4 yrs
Pensions accounting entries are subject to judgement and volatility, as the assets are largely linked to the 
equity market, whereas the present value of the obligation is linked to yields on AA-rated corporate bonds.
As an indication, all other things being equal:
 > an increase in the discount rate of 0.1% would lead to a reduction in the value placed on the obligations 
of the Section of approximately £0.4m; and
 > a 5% rise in the value of the Section’s return seeking portfolio would improve the balance sheet position 
by approximately £0.8m.
Amounts recognised in income in respect of the defined benefit scheme are as follows:
       2011 2010
       £000 £000
Current service cost       171 263
Interest cost       1,145 861
Expected return on scheme assets       (1,263) (820)
Past service cost       — 316
Recognised in operating costs       53 620
The actual return on scheme assets was a gain of £1,201,000 (2010: gain of £4,807,000). HomeServe

At 31 March       17,838 16,174
Note – ‘benefits paid’ represents an inflow into the Section as a result of transfer payments received.
The amount recognised outside the income statement in the statement of comprehensive income for 2011 is 
a gain of £3,656,000 (2010: loss of £2,664,000). The cumulative amount recognised outside profit and loss at 
31 March 2011 is a loss of £658,000. 
The analysis of the scheme assets and the expected rate of return at the balance sheet date was 
as follows:
 Expected return Fair value of assets
     2011 2010 2011 2010
     % % £000 £000
Equity instruments     7.8 8.0 13,150 15,326

Other assets     4.3 4.5 1,508 848
        17,838 16,174
The overall expected rate of return on assets for the financial year ending 31 March 2011 was 7.8% per 
annum (2010: 8.0% per annum). This rate is derived by taking the weighted average of the long-term 
expected rate of return on each of the asset classes that the Section was invested in at 31 March 2010.  Financial statements

 – other creditors – loan notes
All principal financial instruments are stated at amortised cost.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group are able to continue as going  
concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the appropriate balance of debt and equity. 
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 22,  
cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued 
capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 26 to 32 and the Group Statement of Changes 
in Equity.

Group has complied with all such arrangements throughout the current and preceding year. 
On 30 July 2010, shareholders of HomeServe plc approved a 5 for 1 split of the Company’s shares which was 
effective on 2 August 2010. The purpose of the sub-division was to improve the liquidity and marketability of 
the ordinary shares of the Company by reducing the market price of an ordinary share and increasing the 
number of shares in issue.

cash equivalents. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s 
operations. The Group also has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade 
payables, derivatives and loans to joint ventures which arise directly from its operations.
Financial risk management is overseen by the Board according to objectives, targets and policies set by the 
Board. Treasury risk management, including management of currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity 
risk is carried out by a central Group Treasury function in accordance with objectives, targets and policies

In addition to the other financial assets and liabilities set out above in ‘Principal financial instruments’ and 
disclosed in notes 20, 22 and 24, the Group had derivative instruments in the prior year in designated 
hedge accounting relationships. The interest rate swap expired during the year ended 31 March 2010. Financial statements
HomeServe  
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 127
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, 
credit risk and liquidity risk.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long-term 
debt requirements with floating interest rates. The Group’s policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of 
fixed and variable rate debts. To manage this, the Group enters into interest rate swaps for certain periods, in 
which the Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate 
interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. These swaps are 
designated to hedge underlying debt obligations.
The maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual maturities is provided in the table 
below. Interest is payable on the bank overdraft and revolving credit facilities. Deferred and contingent 
consideration payments are stated on the basis of expected cash outflows before discounting. 
The actual payment profile of ‘Other creditors’ is dependent upon the collection of the corresponding  
’Other receivables’ from policyholders. These amounts principally relate to underwriting, which are collected 
from policyholders and remitted to underwriters following cash collection. Therefore, the actual cash flows 
may differ from those presented, but will not result in the acceleration of the settlement of the liability.

Foreign currency risk
The Group has exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies where it has investments in overseas 
operations which are affected by foreign exchange movements.
The carrying amount of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities 
at the year end are as follows:

Credit risk
The Group trades only with creditworthy third parties. It is the Group’s policy that, with the exception of 
our policy membership customers, customers who wish to trade on credit terms are reviewed for 
financial stability.
The majority of the Group’s trade receivables consist of a large number of individual members and hence for 
these balances the Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to a single counterparty. As a 
result, the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not considered to be significant.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash 
equivalents and investment in joint ventures, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the 
counterparty.
The Group manages the risk associated with cash and cash equivalents through depositing funds only with 
reputable and creditworthy banking institutions. The risk associated with the investment in joint ventures is 
mitigated through the close management and regular review of the performance of the assets.
The Group has a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of the above receivables and instruments.
Liquidity risk
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Group’s Board which sets the framework 
for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management 
requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities and 
continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows. Included in note 22 are details of the undrawn 
facilities that are available to the Group to further reduce liquidity risk.
With the exception of deferred and contingent consideration, all of the Group’s financial liabilities are due for 
payment within two years, based on contractual payment terms. Financial statements

Company independent auditor’s report
We have audited the parent Company financial statements of HomeServe plc for the year ended 
31 March 2011 which comprise the Company statement of comprehensive income, the Company balance 
sheet, the Company statement of changes in equity, the Company cash flow statement and the related 
notes 42 to 56. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and 
applied in accordance with the provision of Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.  
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions 
we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for  
the preparation of the parent Company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for 
Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies, we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on the financial statements
In our opinion the parent Company financial statements:
 > give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2011;
 > have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied 
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 > have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 > the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006; and
 > the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the parent Company financial statements. HomeServe

audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
 > the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be 
audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 > certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 > we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Trade receivables
The Company has a policy for providing fully for those receivable balances that it does not expect to recover. 
This assessment has been undertaken by reviewing the status of all significant balances that are past due 
and involves assessing both the reason for non-payment and the credit worthiness of the counterparty.
Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, there is no significant concentration of credit risk, 
with exposure spread across a large number of subsidiary undertakings.
Included in the Company’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £nil (2010: £nil) 
which are past due at the reporting date for which the Company has not provided as there has not been  
a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable. The Company does 
not hold any collateral over these balances. The average age of receivables not impaired is 30 days 
(2010: 30 days).

Balance at 31 March       45,546 157,880
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Company considers any change in the credit 
quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The 
concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large.
No allowance for doubtful debts is considered necessary based on prior experience and the Directors’ 
assessment of the current economic environment.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their  
fair value.
Cash balances and cash equivalents
Cash balances and cash equivalents of £107,308,000 (2010: £50,663,000) comprise cash held by the 
Company and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. The carrying 
amount of these assets approximates to their fair value. HomeServe

 The figures in the table relate to the number of deferred options only.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 
£4.68 (2010: £3.47).
The estimated fair values are calculated by applying a Black-Scholes option pricing model for the ESOP and 
SAYE and Monte Carlo simulations for the KEIP, LTIP and Deferred Bonus Plan. The assumptions used in the 
models are set out in note 38.
The Company recognised total expenses of £1,021,000 (2010: £796,000) related to equity-settled share-
based payment transactions and total expenses of £45,000 (2010: £nil) related to cash-settled share-based

Principal financial instruments
The principal financial instruments used by the Company from which financial instrument risk arises are  
as follows:
– cash and cash equivalents 
– bank overdrafts and revolving credit facilities 
– trade receivables
– inter-company receivables and payables 
– other receivables 
– trade payables
– other creditors
All principal financial instruments are stated at amortised cost.
Capital risk management
The Company manages its capital to ensure that it is able to continue as a going concern while maximising 
the return to stakeholders through the appropriate balance of debt and equity. The capital structure of the 
Company consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 49, cash and cash equivalents 
and equity comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 52 and 55 and 
the Company Statement of Changes in Equity.
The table below presents quantitative data for the components the Company manages as capital:

On 30 July 2010, shareholders of HomeServe plc approved a 5 for 1 split of the Company’s shares which was 
effective on 2 August 2010. The purpose of the sub-division was to improve the liquidity and marketability of 
the ordinary shares of the Company by reducing the market price of an ordinary share and increasing the 
number of shares in issue.
Financial risk management objectives
The Company’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans and overdrafts. The main purpose of 
these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Company’s operations. The Company also has 
various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from 
its operations.
The main risks arising from the Company’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, credit risk and 
liquidity risk. HomeServe

56. Financial instruments (continued)
Interest rate risk
The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s 
long-term debt requirements with floating interest rates. The Company’s policy is to manage its interest 
cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts. To manage this, the Company enters into interest rate 
swaps for certain periods, in which the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference 
between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional 
principal amount. These swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt obligations.
The maturity profile of the Company’s financial liabilities is provided in the table below. Interest is payable 
on the bank overdraft and revolving credit facilities.

It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Company’s policy that no trading in financial 
instruments shall be undertaken.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change of 10% increase in interest 
rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Company’s profit before tax (through the impact on 
floating rate borrowings).

Increase in profit before tax (£000)       4 161
Credit risk
The Company trades only with creditworthy third parties and subsidiary undertakings. It is the Company’s 
policy that customers who wish to trade on credit terms are reviewed for financial stability.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Company, which comprise cash and 
cash equivalents the Company’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
The Company manages the risk associated with cash and cash equivalents through depositing funds only 
with reputable and creditworthy banking institutions. The Company has a maximum exposure equal to the 
carrying amount of the above receivables and instruments.
Liquidity risk
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Company’s Board which sets the 
framework for the management of the Company’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity 
management requirements. The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and 
banking facilities and continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows. Included in note 22 are 
details of the undrawn facilities that are available to the Company and the Group to further reduce 
liquidity risk.
All of the Company’s financial liabilities are due for payment within two years, based on contractual 
payment terms. Financial statements

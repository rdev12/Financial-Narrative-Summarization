Results 
t he Group’s record results for the year ended 
30 September 2013 demonstrate its position 
as a leading provider of multidisciplinary 
Engineering Services supporting critical 
uK infrastructure. t he Engineering Services 
business achieved strong growth in revenue, 
operating profit and forward order book.
Group operating profit prior to exceptional 
items and amortisation was up 9% to £1 1.2m 
(2012: £10.3m) on Group pre-exceptional 
revenue of £334.6m (2012: £337.4m). 
Group operating margin improved to 3.4% 
(2012: 3.0%). Earnings per share prior 
to exceptional items and amortisation 
increased by 7% to 14.81p (201 2: 13.90p) 
with basic earnings per share on 
continuing activities increasing 
by 25% to 14.85p (2012: 11.87p). 
t here have been a number of exceptional 
items during the year. t he net impact 
of these items in the year is a profit 
before taxation of £0.5m. An amortisation 
charge of £0.5m has also been recognised 
offsetting the exceptional profit. Full 
details of these items are set out in 
Note 3 of the financial statements.
t he Engineering Services business 
has progressed well with a 9% increase 
in revenue to £232.4m (2012: £214.1m), 
together with a 10% increase in operating 
profit to £10.6m (201 2: £9.6m). Operating 
margin improved to 4.6% (2012: 4.5%).  
t he Specialist Building activity remained 
focused on selective niche markets in the 
South with operating margin improving to 
2.0% (2012: 1.7%). As expected, operating 
profit was maintained at £2. 1m (201 2: £2. 1m) 
on revenue of £102.5m (201 2: £1 23. 1m). 
t he Group’s contracted order book 
at 30 September 2013 stood at £416m 
(2012: £331m), a 26% increase, with 
the Engineering Services order book 
up 28% to £301m (2012: £235m). 
Cash performance has been strong and 
I am pleased to report that the Group has 
returned to a year end net cash position 
of £2.8m (2012: net debt £5.5m). t his 
improvement has come through a strong 
working capital performance combined 
with the benefit of the sale of land at 
Rugby which has been recorded as 
an exceptional item.
Much of the cash generated from the 
Rugby sale was redeployed in acquiring 
l ewis Civil Engineering l imited (“l ewis”) 
for a cash consideration including costs 
of £8.2m. l ewis, which is based near 
Cardiff, specialises in the construction and 
maintenance of infrastructure and assets 
within the water industry. l ewis has revenue 
of approximately £25m per annum with an 
operating profit margin of circa 5%. It is 
a well respected brand in its region and 
market with clients including Wessex Water 
and Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water. It provides its 
services through framework agreements 
and employs 175 highly skilled personnel. 
l ewis’s financial performance is expected 
to be both cash generative and accretive 
to Renew’s Engineering Services operating 
margin in the 2013/14 financial year.
  Engineering Services up 
9% in revenue to £232.4m 
(2012: £214.1m).
  t he Group’s contracted 
order book at 30 September 
2013 stood at £4 16m (201 2: 
£331m), a 26% increase, with 
the Engineering Services 
order book up 28% to 
£301m (2012: £235m). 
  t he Group has returned to 
a net cash position of £2.8m 
(2012: net debt £5.5m).
  l ewis Civil Engineering 
acquired for £8.2m in cash.
  Full year dividend increased 
by 14%.

06 Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Dividend
t he Board is proposing a final dividend 
of 2.50p per share, increasing the full year 
dividend by 14% to 3.60p (2012: 3.15p). 
t he dividend will be paid on 3 March 2014 
to shareholders on the register as at 
31 January 2014. t he Board intends to 
continue to grow dividends progressively.
Outlook
t he Group enters the 2013/14 financial year 
in a strong position. In Specialist Building 
the Group operates in two discrete market 
sectors that have strong fundamentals 
and in which we have particular experience 
and expertise. In Engineering Services, the 
Group is expanding its position as a leading 
provider of engineering support services 
in the uK’s Energy, Environmental and 
Infrastructure markets. t hese markets 
are mainly regulated and the critical assets 
are maintained by programmes of essential 
non-discretionary spending. t he Group 
continues to focus its activities on these 
programmes which provide both good 
visibility of future opportunities and 
sustainable earnings streams. 
It remains the Board’s strategy to 
grow the business, both organically 
and by selective acquisitions, developing 
Renew’s position as a leading medium 
sized engineering support services group. 
t he Board’s ambition is to grow Group 
revenue to over £500m, an achievement 
which continues to be likely to require 
further acquisitions. t he Board continues 
to set challenging performance targets 
and believes that over the next three 
years the Group can increase its 
Engineering Services business operating 
margins to 5% whilst maintaining Specialist 
Building performance in line with that 
currently being achieved. t he Group’s 
successful acquisition record combined 
with these strong results and net cash 
position, together with the record forward 
order book indicate that Renew is well 
placed to achieve these targets.

a provider of multidisciplinary integrated 
engineering support services to critical 
uK infrastructure. Our Specialist Building 
activities have increased operating

sustainable markets in the South.
Engineering Services
Operating in the Energy, Environmental 
and Infrastructure markets, Renew 
undertakes essential asset support 
providing maintenance and renewal 
services through its directly employed 
multidisciplinary workforce operating from 
local, independently branded businesses.
Revenue in Engineering Services grew 
by 9%, including organic growth of 6%, 
to £232.4m (2012: £214.1m) and now 
accounts for 70% of Group revenue 
(201 2: 63%) and 84% of Group operating 
profit (2012: 82%). Operating margin 
improved to 4.6% (2012: 4.5%).
t he Engineering Services order book 
has seen strong growth of 28% to £301m 
(2012: £235m), securing 83% of 2014 
budget revenue (2013: 66%). t his growth

with Energy up 7% to £133m (201 2: £1 24m), 
Environmental up 79% to £59m (2012:

£109m (2012: £78m).
t he Group continues to deliver its strategy 
of growing its Engineering Services business 
both organically and through selective 
earnings enhancing acquisitions. In the year 
under review, the Group acquired l ewis Civil 
Engineering l imited based near Cardiff. 
l ewis, which specialises in deep sewer and 
water main pipelines, waste water treatment 
and general water utility infrastructure 
works, further strengthens the Group’s 
position in the Water sector adding 
two leading utility businesses as major 
clients in the Environmental market.
Energy
t he Group operates in the nuclear, 
traditional and renewable power generation 
sectors nationally providing planned and 
reactive maintenance and asset renewal 
support for a range of clients mainly through 
long standing framework agreements.
t he Group focuses its activity in the 
nuclear sector with the majority of work 
continuing to be undertaken across the 
Nuclear Decommissioning Authority’s 
(“NDA”) estate where we are active on 
nine sites that command around 70% 
of the NDA’s £3bn annual expenditure. 
Work is concentrated at the Sellafield site 
on which the Group has been operational 
for over sixty years and where the Group 
provides engineering support for the 
care and maintenance of operational 
plant associated with waste treatment or 
processing, decommissioning, demolition 
and clean-up of redundant facilities. 
Sellafield continues to be allocated 
55% of the NDA’s annual budget.
Our position as the leading provider 
of mechanical and electrical services at 
Sellafield and the integrated service offering 
through our subsidiary businesses helped 
the Group achieve a 16% increase in our 
secured nuclear order book to £126m 
(2012: £109m). During the year, the Group 
became the first contractor to receive supply 
chain accreditation for service provision 
at the Sellafield site in recognition of our 
performance to the highest quality nuclear 
standards. Our continued attention to our 
safety performance was also recognised 
when we received the 2013 Sellafield 
Resident Engineers Safety Award for 
‘Outstanding Safety performance’. 
Work at Sellafield continues to be 
undertaken on the Multi Discipline Site

Summary
B W May Chief Executive
08 Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 £280m over a four year period. As one of 
the three participants on the framework, 
we continue to be aligned with the largest 
area of spend, delivering production 
operations support work packages. 
One of the major areas of work at Sellafield 
is in high hazard risk reduction and includes 
the Evaporator D scheme, currently the 
uK’s largest nuclear programme. Revenues 
on this project are now expected to exceed 
£60m over its three year duration with 
completion due in 2015. t he £26m four 
year Decommissioning and Bulk Sludge 
Retrievals framework has also experienced 
a substantial increase in scope during the 
period. Work also continues on the £58m 
four year Site Wide Asset Care framework.
We continue to support Sellafield’s 
major projects programmes and are 
the sole mechanical and electrical 
supply chain partner on the fifteen 
year £1.1bn Infrastructure Strategic 
Alliance framework.
Elsewhere in the Energy market, the 
Group provides long term engineering 
support at five of the uK’s traditional 
power generation sites through seven 
framework agreements. t he ongoing 
maintenance and support of these 
sites is critical in ensuring provision 
of the uK’s future energy needs. 
In renewables, we have increased our service 
offering in the wind energy sector where 
we were commissioned by E.On to carry out 
a range of challenging repair works which 
successfully brought a number of turbines 
back on line on a remote site in Scotland. 
We are also engaged to supply a range of 
highly engineered components to one of 
the uK’s largest offshore windfarms for 
the same client. Hydro generation schemes 
are also providing a number of opportunities 
with projects for Scottish and Welsh Water 
on track to commence in 2014 through 
our frameworks with these clients.
The Group’s priority remains the safety of 
our employees and those working with us. 
Our commitment to this can be seen in the 
significant 92% reduction in our Accident 
Incidence Rate over the last 8 years. 
Engineering Services performance
The development of our Engineering Services business has created a platform 
of sustainable revenue generated from over 60 framework agreements with 
major clients, most of which operate in regulated markets.

sites, which also have consents to develop, 
will present opportunities for Renew. An 
established and proven track record of 
service delivery to the highest standards 
within this highly regulated sector will be 
a prerequisite to participation. t he Group 
has demonstrated its attainment of the 
necessary standards over many years 
and continues to be involved in supporting 
proposals for elements of the requirements 
at Hinkley point, including the manufacture 
and supply of high integrity fabricated 
steel components which will be required 
early in the construction phase.

t he Group continues to provide operational 
support and maintenance to the water 
infrastructure, flood alleviation, river and 
coastal defence, land remediation and 
engineering renovation sectors where 
much of the work is undertaken through 
long term framework agreements with 
repeat clients.
Our progress in the Water sector has been 
enhanced by the acquisition of l ewis Civil 
Engineering l imited (“l ewis”). Our work for 
Northumbrian Water, Wessex Water and 
Welsh Water includes sewer maintenance, 
clean and waste water rehabilitation, 
strategic mains maintenance and general 
utility infrastructure services under 
the regulated AMp5 programme.
For Northumbrian Water, Seymour has 
been appointed a preferred supplier to 
deliver a number of accelerated flood 
prevention schemes in addition to having 
been awarded their third out of four trunk 
Mains Cleaning projects and continuing 
to provide maintenance support under 
seven frameworks. 
For Wessex Water, l ewis is sole supplier on 
the Networks 1 framework under their AMp5 
investment programme. For Welsh Water, 
l ewis has positions on the pressurised 
pipelines and Major Civil Engineering 
projects frameworks. l ewis also adds 
a particular specialism to the Group with 
their expertise in trenchless technology. 
In l and Remediation, work continues 
for long standing client National Grid 
under a number of established national 
remediation framework agreements. t he 
National Contaminated l and Remediation 
Contractor’s framework delivered the 
award of a major remediation scheme for 
Blackpool Council. Recent project awards 
for Scotia Gas Networks have led to a 
five year framework appointment. 
During the year, the Group has been 
appointed to the Environment Agency’s 
minor works frameworks across all of its 
regions. t he Group is the only contractor 
to have achieved this nationwide position.
In the Engineering Renovation sector, the 
Group has recently commenced work on a 
£9m project at the palace of Westminster. 
t his contract is associated with the repair 
and restoration of the cast iron roofs at 
this World Heritage Site where the Group 
has previously completed work on a similar 
project on the Speaker’s Court section of 
the roof. t his award provides continuity with 
a long established client in a market sector

10 Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Group has carried out all of the restoration 
work on both the undercroft and roof during 
the redevelopment of St pancras Station, 
together with work on many of the country’s 
principal glasshouse structures including 
Kibble palace and Wentworth House.
Infrastructure
t he Group operates mainly in the Rail 
sector delivering off-track asset renewal 
and refurbishment as well as a wide range 
of planned and reactive maintenance 
services critical to keeping the rail 
network operational.
For our largest client, Network Rail, 
we remain the sole provider of engineering 
maintenance services nationally which we 
deliver under both the Building and Civils 
Delivery partnership (“BCDp”) and Asset 
Management (“AM”) frameworks. In addition 
to ongoing engineering support our local 
delivery teams respond nationally across 
the rail network providing 24 hour 
emergency services. 
We have seen a substantial increase 
in activity during the year across our 
entire work portfolio. t his increase is 
attributable to the responsiveness of 
our local teams which are aligned closely 
with the operational structure of Network 
Rail. During the year, we have carried out 
approximately 4,000 separate instructions 
in AM and been awarded almost 100 
projects in BCDp.
t he Group’s specialist skills in tunnel 
and shaft refurbishment provide a 
differentiator in this market and were 
further enhanced in the year with the 
formation of our National tunnel Delivery 
team. We have recently been awarded 
the £12m Holme tunnel project which 
has now started on site, together with 
further works to reline the crown of 
Whiteball tunnel.
Our increased activity in Rail is reflected 
in a 36% uplift in our forward order book to 
£101m (201 2: £7 4m). t he recently announced 
funding plan for Network Rail over the next 
five years provides excellent visibility of 
future work opportunities in the Rail sector.
Specialist Building
Specialist Building activity remains 
focused on the High Quality Residential 
and New Build Affordable Housing markets 
in the South. Specialist Building showed 
an increased operating margin of 2.0% 
(2012: 1.7%) through maintaining an 
operating profit of £2.1m (2012: £2.1m) 
on revenue of £102.5m (2012: £123.1m). 
Our Specialist Building order book has 
grown by 20% to £115m (2012: £96m) 
and although we anticipate delivering 
growth in revenue during 2013/14, our 
focus in this segment will remain on 
delivering a consistent level of operating 
profit. t he Group has specific expertise 
in these niche markets as well as many 
years’ experience which combined with our 
strong relationships provides a sustainable 
environment for future opportunities. 
In the High Quality Residential market in 
l ondon and the Home Counties we remain 
a leading quality provider. Our extensive 
experience and expertise in innovative 
temporary works engineering solutions 
when carrying out complex structural 
remodelling and extending properties 
below ground provides a key differentiator. 
Over £60m of new opportunities have been 
secured in this strong market which has 
good visibility of future opportunities and 
the business has all of its budget revenue 
for 2013/14 already contracted. 
t he demand for New Build Affordable 
Housing remains high and the Group has 
established relationships with many of 
the leading Housing Associations in the 
South providing access to an advertised 
spend of £700m per annum for the next 
three years. Over £50m of awards have 
been contracted during the year including 
further projects for peabody, One Housing 
Group and Notting Hill Housing securing 76% 
of the business’ 2013/14 budget revenue.
People
t he Group’s priority remains the safety of 
our employees and those working with us. 
Our commitment to this can be seen in the 
significant 92% reduction in our Accident 
Incidence Rate over the last eight years. 
t he Group has a number of safety related 
initiatives in place and is particularly 
focused on ensuring that all incidents, 
not only those which result in reportable 
accidents, are recorded and analysed to 
ensure all possible lessons are learned.
t he Group’s strong results are a testament 
to the skills and commitment of all our 
employees. t he Board would like to express 
its gratitude for this ongoing effort which is 
vital to the continued success of the Group.

afte R tax, exceptional items and 
amoR tisation, the pR ofit foR the 
yea R f Rom continuing ope Rations 
was £8.9m .
Results
Group revenue from ongoing operations 
was £334.6m (201 2: £337 .4m) with a profit 
before tax of £10.7m (201 2: £10.0m) prior 
to exceptional items and amortisation 
charges and the loss from the discontinued 
operation. A tax charge of £1.8m (2012: 
£1.7m) resulted in a profit after tax for 
the year of £8.9m (2012: £8.3m) prior 
to exceptional items and amortisation 
charges and the loss from the discontinued 
operation. After tax, exceptional items 
and amortisation, the profit for the year 
from continuing operations was £8.9m 
(2012: £7.1m).
Exceptional items
A number of exceptional items have been 
recognised during the year, the most notable 
of which was the realisation of land at Rugby 
which recorded exceptional revenue of 
£14.4m and a gain of £9.2m. 
In the uSA, the Group has three remaining 
property assets where delays due to 
economic conditions have led to detailed 
planning and zoning agreements expiring. 
Outline permissions remain, however 
forthcoming changes to state and county 
regulations will require new applications to 
be made with the expectation of reductions 
in allowable building density. t he Board 
commissioned an independent review 
of the Group’s u S property assets and 
decided to write down the carrying value 
of two of these assets in the light of these 
new requirements and current market 
conditions by $8m (£4.9m).
In relation to the running down of certain 
regional non-specialist building activities, 
revenue of £1m and losses of £2.8m were 
recorded together with £0.3m of redundancy 
costs. t hese losses are due primarily to 
the insolvency of certain subcontractors. 
A charge of £0.5m has been made following 
costs arising from exceptional storm 
damage on a Specialist Building contract. 
Costs incurred with the acquisition 
of l ewis Civil Engineering l imited 
amounted to £0.2m. 
In total, exceptional items amounted 
to revenue of £15.4m and a gain of 
£0.5m. Additionally, £0.5m (201 2: £0.5m) 
of amortisation charges relating to the Amco 
acquisition were incurred. Amortisation 
charges relating to the l ewis acquisition 
will commence from 1 October 2013.
Discontinued operation
In 2012, the Board decided to close the 
business of C&A pumps l td. It had become 
increasingly difficult for this small business 
to trade profitably following changes to 
Water industry framework arrangements 
in AMp5. C&A was accounted for as a 
discontinued operation in the year to 
30 September 201 2 and in 2013 a further 
loss of £0.3m has been recorded due to 
writing off work in progress and debtors 
which have proven to be irrecoverable. 
Cash 
In 2011, the Group arranged a £15m 
three year term loan to fund the acquisition 
of Amco, also using £7 .2m of its own cash 
resources. During the year, £5.0m of 
repayments have been made reducing 
the loan balance to £2.5m at the year end. 
t he cash inflow of £9.2m from the sale of 
the Rugby land was largely deployed in the 
£8.2m cost of acquiring l ewis. together with 
improved working capital, this cash inflow 
has led to our reporting a cash balance of 
£5.3m (201 2: £2.0m) at the year end. As a 
result, the Group’s net cash position as at 
30 September 2013 was £2.8m (201 2: net 
debt of £5.5m). t he Group has complied 
with the covenants associated with this 
loan throughout the year. 
  t he Group recorded 
profit before tax of £10.7m 
(2012: £10.0m) prior to 
exceptional items and 
amortisation charges. 
  t he Group’s outstanding term 
loan has been reduced to 
£2.5m (201 2: £7 .5m).
  t he rate of corporation 
tax payable in each of the 
next few years is expected 
to remain below the 
headline rate. 
Summary
12 Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Pension schemes
t he IAS 19 valuation of the l ovell pension 
Scheme, which was closed to new members 
in 2000, has resulted in an increase in the 
accounting deficit to £2.8m (2012: £0.4m) 
after accounting for deferred taxation. 
In 201 1, the Board, in conjunction with the 
trustees of the l ovell Scheme, completed 
a buy-in of part of the pensioner liabilities 
of the scheme. t his measure, which was 
completed without any further cash 
contribution to the scheme by the Group, 
has reduced the risks associated with those 
liabilities and, at the year end, the annuities 
purchased represented 33% of the scheme’s 
total liabilities. In accordance with the 
scheme specific funding requirements of 
the pensions Act 2005 and, following the 
triennial valuation of the scheme which was 
carried out as at 31 March 201 2, the Board 
has an agreement with the trustees of the 
scheme on the level of future contributions 
which are currently approximately £3.2m per 
annum inclusive of costs. t he next triennial 
valuation is due as at 31 March 2015. 
t he IAS 19 valuation of the Amco pension 
Scheme shows a surplus of £0.8m (201 2: 
£1.4m) after accounting for deferred 
taxation. In 2013, the Board, in conjunction 
with the trustees of the Amco Scheme, 
completed a buy-in of part of the pensioner 
liabilities of the scheme. t his measure, 
which was completed without any further 
cash contribution to the scheme by the 
Group, has reduced the risks associated 
with those liabilities and, at the year end, the 
annuities purchased represented 55% of the 
scheme’s total liabilities. In accordance with 
the scheme specific funding requirements 
of the pensions Act 2005 and, following the 
triennial valuation of the scheme which 
was carried out as at 31 December 2010, 
the Board has an agreement with the 
trustees of the scheme on the level of 
future contributions which are currently 
£0.3m per annum inclusive of costs. t he 
next triennial valuation will be carried 
out as at 31 December 2013. 
Due to the impact of actuarial losses 
measured in these schemes in the year, 
most of which relates to adopting actuarial 
assumptions which assume increased 
life expectancy of scheme members, 
£5.5m (201 2: £2.6m), net of deferred tax, 
has been charged to the statement of 
comprehensive income, reducing the 
Group’s net assets accordingly. 
Taxation
A deferred tax asset included in non-current 
assets of £3.1m (2012: £2.9m) is carried in 
the balance sheet, which principally relates 
to the likely future utilisation of tax losses. 
A deferred tax liability related to the Amco 
defined benefit pension scheme of £0.2m 
(2012: £0.4m) is shown in non-current 
liabilities. t he remaining deferred tax liability 
of £0.8m (201 2: £0.6m) relates to fair value 
adjustments arising on acquisitions.
t he uK tax charge on profits for the year 
is £0.8m (2012: £0.3m). t he deferred tax 
charge of £1.0m (2012: £1.2m) is 
attributable primarily to the defined 
benefit pension schemes. t he total tax 
charge for the year of £1.8m (2012: £1.3m) 
represents an effective Group tax rate of 
17% (2012: 16%). Only the £0.8m current 
year charge is payable in cash. t he Group 
has material tax losses to carry forward 
and the rate of corporation tax payable in 
each of the next few years is expected to 
remain below the headline rate.
Distributable profits
t he distributable profits of Renew 
Holdings plc stood at £20.5m (2012: 
£1 1.2m) enabling the Board to recommend 
a final dividend of 2.5p (2012: 2.1p) per 
share bringing the total for the year to 
3.6p (2012: 3.15p), an increase of 14.3%.

Safety
The Group’s priority remains the safe working of its employees and those who work with us.
Whilst our aim is always to strive to 
achieve no accidents, we further improved 
our safety performance in the year alongside 
the continued development of a responsible 
safety culture. 2013 saw a record reduction 
in the Group’s Accident Incidence Rate 
which is now at its lowest ever figure, 
an improvement of 92% over the last 
eight years. 
A number of our businesses continue 
to be accredited and approved with 
various health and safety schemes 
including the Contractors Health and 
Safety Assessment Scheme or CHAS, 
Constructionline and SAFEContractor.
Our businesses' initiatives reflect the 
unique characteristics and challenges 
of the markets in which they operate, 
with the Renew Safety and Environmental 
Management Group coordinating safety 
activities across the Group. One of the 
most challenging areas of work is in the 
nuclear environment where the Group, 
through its subsidiary Shepley Engineers, 
has undertaken over 4 million man hours 
of operations and it is now more than 
4 years since a lost time event at Sellafield. 
Elsewhere AMCO Engineering has achieved 
10 years without a l ost t ime Accident 
on Magnox nuclear sites as well as 
achieving a similar milestone of fourteen 
years without a l ost t ime Accident on 
E ON uK sites, which cover a diverse 
blend of coal, gas, wind and CHp 
generation stations.
We continue to implement initiatives to 
support our safety culture and ensure 
safety remains at the forefront of our 
working practices. Examples include 
promotion of the behavioural safety 
programme in the workplace alongside 
our robust systems and management. 
A variety of Group safety initiatives are 
undertaken including cross business 
safety audits, tool box talks and warning 
card systems. Each of our businesses 
also implements safety schemes which 
reflect the environment in which they 
operate. Walter l illy and Amco also 
present annual safety awards designed 
to raise awareness of new initiatives 
across the businesses. Walter l illy also runs 
an occupational health scheme where 
posters and other literature help raise 
awareness. 
Environment and sustainability
Commitment to the environment includes accreditation for all our subsidiary 
businesses to the ISO 14001 standard demonstrating their commitment to 
closely monitoring the impact of their operations on the environment. 
Consideration of the environment and 
the impact of any work we undertake 
begins in the planning stages of our work. 
Schemes designed to encourage our 
employees and subcontractors to adopt 
sound environmental understanding and 
practices use a mixture of training and 
awareness programmes. One example 
is Amco’s established ‘carbon strategy’ 
which looks to reduce emissions both 
on site and in the office through initiatives 
such as the hire, lease and procurement 
of more efficient plant, equipment and 
motor vehicles, and through the use 
of energy from renewable sources 
in their offices.
Our ability to deliver sustainable 
schemes on site benefits from the 
Group’s specialist skills including land 
remediation techniques which were 
recognised when v HE, as part of a 
team alongside National Grid, won the 
Constructing Excellence 2012 Cl :AIRE 
Award for the Best u se of the Waste Code 
of practice. t he Cl :AIRE Award was 
presented for the uK’s first multiple site 
“Hub and Cluster” project where 
contaminated waste from four separate 
former gas manufacturing stations in the 
North West was remediated at a single 
‘Hub’ site.

towards achieving 
environmental 
objectives.
28 Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Employment and training
An integral part of developing our business is providing a range of training and 
employment opportunities through our subsidiary businesses in the form of 
apprenticeship schemes, scholarships and work experience in partnership 
with the local communities in which we operate.
Walter Lilly and Seymour are training 
providers to the Engineering Construction 
Industry Training Board delivering their 
Supervisory Management Training and 
Development programme. Other examples 
include Amco’s ongoing Graduate Training 
Programme approved by the Institute of 
Civil Engineering which was introduced 
last year and has a number of trainees 
registered as well as a bespoke supervisor 
development programme. 
Shepley Engineers continues to invest 
significantly in its craft apprenticeship 
training programme which supports 
over 50 trainees. Amco Engineering also 
invests in craft apprenticeship schemes 
to ensure that the traditional electrical 
and mechanical engineering skills base 
is maintained for the future.
Allenbuild has seen further success through 
its mentor and trainee programme “Achieve 
with Allenbuild”, which provides placements, 
trainee positions and employment.
Community engagement and charitable giving
Ensuring our work leaves a positive impact on the communities in which we operate 
is a key part of our operations on site.
Consideration of those affected by 
our works is paramount and clear 
communication as well as work to engage 
the local community is undertaken where 
possible. Recent recognition of such 
work included an award for Seymour at 
Northumbrian Water’s “Going the Extra 
Mile Awards” in the Customer 
Focus category. The awards scheme 
recognises excellence in delivery by 
organisations, teams or individuals that 
have gone the extra mile. 
Britannia continues to support The 
Milestone School in Gloucester as one 
of its nominated charities with a variety 
of initiatives including earlier this year 
when work was undertaken to construct 
a new outdoor soft surface learning area 
which was integrated into their existing 
Sensory Garden. Britannia also supports 
Gear Projects, a charity which helps 
homeless and vulnerable people 
in the Gloucester area.
Many of our businesses participate in 
fundraising events for their chosen charities. 
For the third year running employees at 
Walter Lilly took part in the Cyclothon UK 
event at Brands Hatch where they 
achieved a silver award. The event is a 1 2 
hour endurance challenge raising money for 
a variety of charitable causes. Seymour 
supports its local hospice and lifeboat 
station with employees undertaking a 
range of fundraising activities in the year. 
Shepley Engineers continues to support 
the Calvert Trust on a range of projects, 
the Lake District charity provides outdoor 
activity adventure holidays for all ages 
and abilities. 
Amco took part in Breast Cancer 
Campaign’s “Wear it Pink” day and 
Shepley Engineers works with West 
Cumbria’s “Hospice at Home” as well as 
pledging support to other local Cumbrian 
causes in the year. Many other charities, 
both national and local, were supported 
throughout the year including the British 
Heart Foundation, The Guide Dogs, The 
Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the 
Yorkshire Air Ambulance, the Bradford 
Toy Library and Ilkley Candlelighters.

Directors’ report
The Directors present their report and the audited accounts for the year ended 30 September 2013.
Principal activities
For the year ended 30 September 2013 the principal activity of the Group was as contractors in Engineering Services and Specialist 
Building. The main activities are carried out in the United Kingdom with some development activities in the USA. More details of these 
activities, the year’s trading and future developments are contained in the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review, the 
Review of Operations and the Financial Review. A list of the principal operating subsidiaries of the Group as at 30 September 2013 
appears on page 74.
Results and dividends
The Group profit for the year was £8,597,000 (2012: £4,741,000). The Directors recommend the payment of a final dividend on the 
Ordinary Shares of 2.50p (2012: 2.10p) giving a total for the year of 3.60p (2012: 3.15p).
Business review
Information that fulfils the business review requirements applicable to the Group can be found in this report, the Chief Executive’s 
Review and the Review of Operations and is incorporated into this report by cross reference.
Key performance indicators
The Directors have established a number of key performance indicators which they use to measure and monitor the performance of 
the Group in a number of different areas. These measures are set out in the tables below. The Engineering Services segment targets 
have been established as part of the Board’s drive to grow both revenue and profitability in that segment of the business. The safety 
record improvement target is set annually and achievement of this target is an essential component of the bonus scheme for each 
Director and senior manager within the Group.

Principal risks and uncertainties
This Annual Report contains certain forward looking statements. These statements are made by the Directors in good faith, based 
on the information available to them up to the time of approval of this report. Actual results may differ to those expressed in such 
statements, depending on a variety of factors. These factors include customer acceptance of the Group’s services, levels of demand 
in the market, restrictions to market access, competitive pressure on pricing or additional costs, failure to retain or recruit key 
personnel and overall economic conditions.
A risk inherent in the contracting industry occurs in the nature, timing and contractual conditions which exist at the time of contract 
procurement. To mitigate these risks, the Group has a system of pre-contract and pre-tender risk assessment whereby senior 
management, including the Executive Directors where appropriate, review and advise on specific issues arising in the contract 
procurement process. The Group also seeks to limit its risks by specialising in certain markets where it has extensive experience 
and a particular skills base.
The Group has two closed final salary pension schemes, details of which are disclosed in Note 24. Should the actuarial deficit 
relating to one or both of these schemes materially deteriorate then the Group could be required to make substantial payments 
into the schemes in accordance with the requirements of the Pensions Act 1995. The Group has taken steps to mitigate this risk by 
working with the schemes’ Trustees to develop liability matching investment strategies. These have included both schemes entering 
into annuity policies which match the liabilities in respect of certain of the schemes’ beneficiaries. At 30 September 2013, these 
policies are equivalent to 35% of the combined scheme liabilities. 
Derivatives and other financial instruments
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, cash and short-term deposits and obligations under finance 
leases. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has various 
other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations. It is, and has been 
throughout the period under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken. The main risks 
arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk.
Interest rate risk
Interest bearing assets comprise cash and bank deposits and earn interest at floating rates. The Group’s bank loan and overdraft 
facility bear interest at floating rates.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy is to ensure availability of operating funds by maintaining an appropriate cash balance in both current and 
deposit accounts and, when necessary, to establish appropriate levels of borrowing facilities to provide short-term flexibility.
Foreign currency risk
As a result of the investment in operations in the United States, movements in the US dollar/sterling exchange rate could materially 
affect the Group’s and the Company’s balance sheet. As at 30 September 2013, £4,325,000 (2012: £9,506,000) of the Group’s net 
assets are denominated in foreign currency. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments in its management of foreign 
currency risk.
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances, cash, amounts recoverable on contracts and trade receivables, 
which represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its amounts recoverable on contracts and trade receivables.
Credit risk is managed by monitoring the aggregate amount and duration of exposure to any one customer depending upon their 
credit rating. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts, estimated by the Group’s 
management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Payment of creditors
The Group recognises the importance of good relationships with its suppliers and sub-contractors and has established 
the following payment policy:
(a) agree payment terms in advance of any commitment being entered into;
(b) ensure suppliers are made aware of these terms by inclusion of the terms of payment on the order or contract; and
(c)  ensure that payments are made in accordance with the terms of the contract or order providing that the presented 
documentation is complete and accurate.
The Group’s average creditor days during the year were 35 days (2012: 42 days).
Donations
Charitable donations made by the Group during the year amounted to £49,243 (2012: £34,606). 
The Group made no political donations during the year (2012: £nil). 32 Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Directors’ report continued
Employees
The Directors recognise the need for communication with employees at every level. All employees have access to a copy of the 
Annual Report and Accounts which, together with staff briefings, internal notice-board statements and newsletters, keeps them 
informed of the Group’s progress. The Group produces a quarterly in-house publication, Renews, which provides information to 
its employees about the activities and performance of the Group.
The Group continues to be committed to the health, safety and welfare of its employees and to observe the terms of the Health 
and Safety at Work Act 1974, and all other relevant regulatory and legislative requirements.
It is the policy of the Group that there shall be no discrimination or less favourable treatment of employees, workers or job applicants 
in respect of race, colour, ethnic or national origins, religious beliefs, sex, sexual orientation, disability, political beliefs, age or marital 
status. Full consideration will be given to suitable applications for employment from disabled persons, where they have the necessary 
abilities and skills for that position, and wherever possible to re-train employees who become disabled, so that they can continue 
their employment in another position. Renew and its subsidiaries engage, promote and train staff on the basis of their capabilities, 
qualifications and experience, without discrimination, giving all employees an equal opportunity to progress within the Group.
Health and safety management
B W May continues as the designated Board Director of Health and Safety with Group responsibility for safety and environmental 
management. Health, safety and environmental management issues and reports are reviewed at every Group Board meeting 
with the Head of Department in attendance when necessary.
The Executive Management Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive, discusses and progresses policy, legislative changes, 
best practice, training needs, inspections, audits (internal and external), performance measurement and statistical information. 
All topics are discussed with a specific focus on improvement. 
Control at business level remains with subsidiary Managing Directors who are required to appoint a Director who is responsible for 
safety and environmental matters. Health, safety and environmental issues are discussed as the first agenda item at monthly Board 
meetings. Each business safety and environmental meeting encourages open communication between all employees and is a key part 
of the Group’s efforts to gather and disseminate good practice for inclusion in business-based management systems. Minimum safety 
and environmental standards are contained within bespoke business Safety and Environmental Management Systems. This system 
is based on Group activities and provides specific standards, procedures, information, forms and advice which accommodate changes 
in legislation expected during the coming financial year. Management advice is provided by the Group Health, Safety and Environmental 
Department consisting of the Group Health, Safety and Environmental Director, an administrator and regional Group Safety and 
Environmental Advisors. 
Certain Group companies employ their own specialist advisors who liaise directly with the Group HSE Director on common issues. 
The Group maintains its membership with the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents and locally based construction safety groups. 
All safety and environmental department personnel hold membership with the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health. Attendance 
on the five day Construction Industry Training Board Site Safety Management Training Scheme continues to be a requirement for all 
construction management personnel, with a two day refresher required every five years. A one day Directors and Senior Managers course 
is available internally and is used to introduce new systems and detail changes to construction legislation. Short duration ‘tool box talks’ 
and ‘safety briefings’ are used to enhance the knowledge and competence of supervisory management. 
Group policy requires each business to report and record all injuries, diseases and dangerous occurrences, regardless of severity. 
An incident database is maintained to collate this information and provide statistical data allowing performance to be measured 
and determine system amendment and future training requirements. A system of Safety and Environmental Alerts ensures lessons 
learnt and changes to working practices are rapidly transmitted to our workforce, businesses and their contractors. The Accident 
Incidence Rate (“AIR”) for the year ended 30 September 2013, measured on the standard base line of 100,000 persons at work, 
is a key area where the Group measures its performance.

Directors’ remuneration report
The Directors present the Directors’ Remuneration Report (the “Remuneration Report”) for the financial year ended 30 September 2013.
As an AIM listed company, Renew is not required to prepare the Report in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
Regulations 2002 or the recently enacted Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013 (together “the Regulations”). However, the Directors recognise the importance and support the principles of 
the Regulations and would normally seek to follow them to the extent considered relevant for an AIM listed company. However the 
Regulations are new and market practice as to the extent to which AIM companies will follow these Regulations has not yet evolved. 
There are improved disclosures in the report presented below and the Remuneration Committee will continue to monitor market 
practice to ensure that, in future, this report will include disclosures at least as good as market practice for AIM companies. 
The Auditor is not required to report to the shareholders on the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Remuneration Committee
On his appointment as a Director on 1 June 2011, D M Forbes assumed the Chairmanship of the Remuneration Committee which 
also comprises R J Harrison and J Bishop. The Committee held four meetings during the financial year to discuss remuneration 
arrangements. 
The Remuneration Committee’s terms of reference include:
(a)  to determine and agree with the Board the framework and policy for the remuneration packages, including bonuses, incentive 
payments and share options or share awards, of the Executive Directors and members of the Executive Management;
(b)   to review and approve the design of all share incentive plans and performance related pay schemes for approval by the Board 
and shareholders as applicable;
(c)  to determine targets and awards made under share incentive plans and performance related pay schemes;
(d) to determine the policy for, and scope of, pension arrangements for each Executive Director and other senior executives; and
(e)  to ensure contractual terms and payments made on termination are fair to the individual and the Company and that failure 
is not rewarded. 
Non-executive Directors do not have any personal interest in the matters to be decided by the Committee other than as shareholders, 
nor any potential conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in the running of the Company. 
The Executive Directors and other senior personnel may be invited to attend meetings when appropriate to provide advice. However, 
no Director is present or takes part in discussions concerning his own remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The Company’s remuneration policy is that the remuneration package of the Executive Directors should be sufficiently competitive 
to attract, retain and motivate Directors to achieve the Company’s objectives, without making excessive payments. The remuneration 
and employment terms of the Executive Directors are determined by the Committee by comparison with salaries paid and terms agreed 
with Directors in similar companies in the same sector and of a similar size and after a review of the performance of the individual.
It is the aim of the Committee to reward Executive Directors competitively and on the broad principle that they should be in the range 
of median to upper quartile of remuneration paid to senior management of comparable public companies. For guidance, the Committee 
refers to published survey data. The Board determines the terms and conditions of non-executive Directors. 
There are four main elements to the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and other senior executives:
•	 basic	salary,	including	benefits;
•	 annual	bonus	awards;
•	 equity	incentive	plans;	and
•	 pension	arrangements.
Basic salary
Basic salaries are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee, and adjusted where the Committee believes that adjustments 
are appropriate to reflect performance, changed responsibilities and/or market conditions.
Other benefits for Executive Directors include car allowances and certain medical cover for the Director and immediate family. 
The Company also has a permanent health insurance policy to provide cover for the Executive Directors.
Annual bonus awards
The Company provides a bonus incentive scheme for Directors and senior executives of the operating companies, linked to the 
performance of the business for which they are responsible. All performance criteria are subject to approval by the Remuneration 
Committee before payment is made. At the beginning of each year, the Remuneration Committee sets targets for operating profit 
before exceptional items for the Group. If the Group meets those targets then the executive directors receive an annual bonus equal 
to 50 per cent of their salary. The level of over and under performance causes the level of annual bonus to vary with the maximum 
bonus of 100 percent of salary being paid if the performance exceeds the target by 30 per cent. The Remuneration Committee make 
such adjustments to the target and or results to remove distortions such as acquisitions, disposals and other items as they believe 
are justified.
Equity incentive plans
The Remuneration Committee has ceased to use the Renew Holdings plc 2004 Executive Share Option Scheme (“ESOS”) and implemented 
a new long term incentive plan (“LTIP”) which was approved at an Extraordinary General Meeting (“EGM”) held on 25 January 2012. 
The LTIP has been designed so as to comply with ABI guidelines in all material respects. The Remuneration Committee does not intend 
to grant any further options under the ESOS which has been terminated save in respect of options previously granted under it. 35 Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
The performance criteria to be achieved by the Company in respect of the LTIP are as follows:
Vesting of one half of the options is dependent on absolute growth in the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’), and the other 
half dependent on the Company’s TSR performance as compared to the TSR achieved by other companies in a comparator group 
of companies selected by the Remuneration Committee. All TSR calculations are based on the average of the opening and closing 
share price over a 30 day period prior to the commencement and end of the performance period. 
The absolute TSR growth target requires the Company’s TSR over the three year performance period to have grown by more than 
25%. For TSR growth between 25% and 100%, the half of the option which is subject to the absolute TSR growth target vests on a 
straight-line basis from nil vesting at 25% growth, to 100% vesting at 100% growth. There is no vesting if TSR growth is 25% or less.
In the event of a material correction of any accounts of the Company used to assess satisfaction of any performance conditions, or in the 
event of a participant’s gross misconduct, options may be reduced, adjusted or cancelled as determined by the Remuneration Committee. 
To the extent that options have already been exercised, the Remuneration Committee may (having considered all the circumstances) 
require the participant to return any shares received, or the amounts of any proceeds of the sale of such shares (net of tax).
There are 400,000 options outstanding under the LTIP which may be exercised between 2 March 2015 and 1 March 2022 and a further 
400,000 options which may be exercised between 21 December 2015 and 20 December 2022.
The ESOS was approved at an EGM held on 11 March 2004. There are 114,280 options outstanding under the scheme all of which 
have now vested and may be exercised between now and 6 June 2016. 
The Renew Savings Related Share Option Scheme was also approved at the EGM on 11 March 2004. There are no options outstanding 
under this scheme. The Company’s policy to grant options or awards under the above schemes is at the Remuneration Committee’s 
discretion as and when considered appropriate.
Pension arrangements
The Group has established individual stakeholder plans for each employee who elects to join into which the Group makes contributions; 
B W May and J Samuel receive a sum equivalent to 10% of their basic salary in lieu of pension contributions from the Company.
Following the adoption of new Articles of Association at the AGM on 28 January 2009, the restriction on the retirement age of the 
Executive Directors was removed. 
Service contracts and letters of appointment
The Company’s policy is for all of the Directors to have twelve month rolling service contracts that provide for a twelve month notice 
period. The fees of non-executive Directors are determined by the full Board within the limits set out in the Articles of Association. 
The non-executive Directors are not eligible for bonuses, pension benefits, share options or other benefits. The Directors are 
indemnified to the full extent permitted by statute under the Articles of Association.
The service contracts of the Directors, who served during the year ended 30 September 2013, include the following terms:
Directors Executive/Non-executive Date of contract Unexpired term Notice period (months)

Corporate governance
As an AIM listed company, Renew is not required to follow the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”), as set out in 
the Financial Services Authority’s Listing Rules. The Directors, however, recognise the importance of, and accordingly support, the principles 
of good corporate governance as contained within the Code. The Directors normally seek to follow the Code to the extent considered relevant 
for an AIM listed company but are unable to achieve compliance with the Code in a number of areas this year, primarily because of 
the lack of independent non-executive Directors. These matters are explained in further detail in the sections below.
The Board of Directors
The Board currently comprises the Chief Executive Officer, the non-executive Chairman, one Executive Director and two independent 
non-executive Directors. Brief biographies of the Directors are given on pages 32 and 33. The Company is not compliant with the 
requirement of the Code that more than half of the Board should be comprised of independent non-executive Directors because, 
although the Board believes that he acts as an independent director, Mr Harrison is not regarded as such by the Code due to the period 
in 2004/2005 when he acted as Executive Chairman. 
The composition of the Board is reviewed regularly. Appropriate training, briefings and induction are available to all Directors on 
appointment and subsequently as necessary, taking into account existing qualifications and experience. New Directors are subject 
to election by shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment. 
The Board met formally ten times in the year with all Directors in attendance. Committee meetings dealing with the daily business 
of the Company were held as necessary. The Board receives written and oral reports from the Executive Directors ensuring matters 
are considered fully and enabling Directors to discharge their duties properly. There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for the 
Board’s decision ensuring the maintenance of control over strategic, financial and operational matters. In addition, procedures are 
in place for the Directors to seek independent professional advice, if necessary, at the Company’s expense.
Board committees
The Board operates with a number of Board Committees. J Bishop, the senior independent non-executive Director, acts as Chairman 
of the Audit Committee and D M Forbes, an independent non-executive Director, acts as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. 
The Nominations Committee is chaired by R J Harrison. 
The Board delegates clearly defined powers to its Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees. Each of the Board’s 
Committees has carefully drafted terms of reference. 
The Remuneration Committee, which comprises all of the non-executive Directors, determines and agrees with the Board the 
framework and policy of executive remuneration packages, including bonuses, incentive payments, share options or awards and 
pension arrangements. Further information concerning the Remuneration Committee is set out in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on pages 34 to 36. 
The Nominations Committee, which comprises the entire Board, monitors the composition of the Board and recommends the 
appointment of new Directors. The Nominations Committee, with all Directors present, has held two meetings during the year 
to discuss nomination matters.
The Nominations Committee terms of reference include:
(a) to review the structure, size and composition of the Board;
(b) to consider succession planning for Directors and senior executives;
(c) to identify and nominate, for approval by the Board, suitable candidates to fill Board vacancies; and
(d)  to make recommendations to the Board on the contents of letters of appointment, Directors’ duties, re-appointment 
or re-election of Directors upon conclusion of a specified term or retirement by rotation.
The Audit Committee has held three meetings to consider Audit Committee business. The Audit Committee consists of all three 
non-executive Directors. The Executive Directors are invited to attend Audit Committee meetings but at least two meetings are held 
each year with the external Auditor at which the Executive Directors are not present. The Audit Committee considers the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the risk management and control systems of the Group, and reports the results to the Board. It reviews the scope and 
results of the external audit, its cost effectiveness and the objectivity of the Auditor. The Audit Committee monitors the non-audit work 
performed by the Auditor to help ensure that the independence of the Auditor is maintained. The Audit Committee also reviews the 
interim statement, the preliminary announcement and accounting policies. 
The Board forms a General Purposes Committee from time it time as it deems necessary. This Committee comprises the 
two Executive Directors and considers individual business matters, which have been specifically delegated to it by the Board.

Corporate governance continued
Internal controls
Throughout the financial year ended 30 September 2013 and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts, the 
Group has fully complied with the relevant provisions of the Code and the Turnbull guidance. The Directors acknowledge that they 
have overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing and monitoring its effectiveness. The system 
of internal control is designed to manage and mitigate, rather than eliminate, the risks to which the Group is exposed and therefore 
provides a reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against a company failing to meet its business objectives or against material 
misstatement or loss. Consequently, the Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing 
significant risks faced by the Group and that it is regularly reviewed by the Board. 
The Group operates a risk management process, which is embedded in normal management and governance processes. There is a system 
of self-examination of risk areas and controls by subsidiaries and departments within the Group. Where significant risks are identified, the 
probability of those risks occurring, their potential impact and the plans for managing and mitigating each of those risks is reported. The 
Group operates a series of controls which include the annual strategic planning and budgeting process, short-term cash monitoring achieved 
by means of weekly forecasts which are compared against budget and previous forecasts, clearly defined capital investment guidelines and 
levels of authority and a clear organisational structure within which individuals’ responsibilities are identified and monitored. These results 
and processes are monitored, updated, reviewed and considered by the Board. The Group has established a series of minimum standards 
in a number of financial and operational areas with which each business within the Group must comply. Group management monitors and 
reviews compliance with these requirements on a periodic basis. Due to the size and nature of the Group, the Board does not consider that 
a separate internal audit function is necessary. For the last six years and including 2013, the Group has carried out a programme of internal 
audit conducted by the Group Commercial Director and by members of the various subsidiaries’ finance teams. This system of peer review 
promotes best practice as well as ensuring that Group minimum requirements as to procedures and internal controls are being complied 
with. The reports from these internal audits are made available both to the Board and to the external Auditor.
Going concern
The Directors have reviewed the budgets and forecasts prepared by the Group and its trading subsidiaries and consider that at 
the time of approving the financial statements, there is a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements.
Directors’ remuneration
The Company’s policy on the remuneration of Executive Directors, and information relating to the Directors’ remuneration and their 
interests in share options, is included in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Directors’ and officers’ indemnity
The Articles of Association provide that each Director or other officer or Auditor of the Company shall be indemnified by the 
Company against losses, costs and expenses he may sustain or incur in connection with the performance of his duties of office, 
to the fullest extent permitted by law.
Shareholder relationships
Members of the Board have dialogue with individual shareholders during the year. In addition to the Annual and Interim Report 
and Accounts, the Chairman addresses shareholders at the AGM and invites questions to any members of the Board. 
The AGM is normally attended by all Directors and provides an opportunity for communication with those shareholders attending. 
Notice of the AGM is given to shareholders at least 21 days in advance and separate resolutions are proposed on each substantially 
separate issue. Where resolutions at the AGM are dealt with by show of hands, the results of proxy votes for and against are 
still announced. 
Financial and other information about the Group is available on the Company’s website: www.renewholdings.com, from which 
shareholders can also access their shareholding details via a link to the website of Capita Asset Services.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM will be held on 29 January 2014, the Notice for which accompanies this Report and Accounts. The Notice contains special 
business relating to the renewal of the Board’s power to allot equity shares together with other special resolutions proposing 
amendments to service requirements and resolution amendments to bring the Articles of Association into line with modern 
practice. Brief details of the purpose and effect of the proposed resolutions are enclosed with the Notice of AGM. 
Shareholders should complete the proxy form accompanying this document in accordance with the notes contained in the Notice of AGM.
Approval
The Board approved the Corporate Governance Report on 26 November 2013.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the Annual Report and financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and parent company financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. As required 
by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance 
with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group 
and parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
•	select	suitable	accounting	policies	and	then	apply	them	consistently;
•	make	judgements	and	estimates	that	are	reasonable	and	prudent;
•	for	the	Group	financial	statements,	state	whether	they	have	been	prepared	in	accordance	with	IFRSs	as	adopted	by	the	EU;
•		 for	the	parent	company	financial	statements,	state	whether	applicable	UK	Accounting	Standards	have	been	followed,	subject	
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
•		 prepare	the	financial	statements	on	the	going	concern	basis	unless	it	is	inappropriate	to	presume	that	the	Group	and	the	parent	
company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to 
ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps 
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.  Accounts

Independent auditor’s report to the members of Renew holdings plc
We have audited the financial statements of Renew Holdings plc for the year ended 30 September 2013 set out on pages 43 to 74. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU. The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and UK Accounting Standards (UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice). 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or 
for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 39, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit, 
and express an opinion on, the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.

at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate.

and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;

is consistent with the financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception

1 Accounting policies
Presentation of consolidated financial statements
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”) as adopted by the EU (“adopted IFRSs”). The financial statements are presented in sterling since this is the currency 
in which the majority of the Group’s transactions are denominated.
Accounting estimates and judgements
In the preparation of these financial statements the Board has made certain judgements and estimates which impact the 
measurement of various assets and liabilities in the Group balance sheet, the value of transactions recorded in the Group income 
statement and the movements in equity as shown in the Group statement of changes in equity. The actual financial outcomes may 
ultimately differ from that which is indicated by these judgements and estimates. Estimates and judgements are reviewed by 
management and the Board on an ongoing basis and changes which may arise in them are reflected in the financial statements 
for the period in which such changes are made.
The Board has determined that the following areas are those in which estimates and judgements have been made and where 
material impacts could arise in the financial statements were such estimates and judgements to be varied.
a) Accounting for construction contracts in accordance with IAS 11 “Construction Contracts” 
IAS 11 requires management to estimate the total expected costs on a contract and the stage of contract completion in order to 
determine both the revenue and profit to be recognised in an accounting period. The Group has control and review procedures in 
place to monitor, and evaluate regularly, the estimates being made to ensure that they are consistent and appropriate. This includes 
reviewing the independent certification of the value of work done, the progress of work against contracted timescales and the costs 
incurred against plan.
b) Impairment of goodwill in accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets”
In accordance with IAS 36, goodwill is tested annually for impairment by comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the 
recoverable amount which is determined by an estimation of the value in use of the related cash generating unit to which the 
goodwill is attributed. The calculation of the value in use requires estimates to be made of the future cash flows of the cash 
generating unit and the timescale over which they will arise. Estimated growth rates and discount factors are also used in the 
calculation to estimate the net present value of the cash flows. More information is given in Note 9 to these financial statements.
c) Accounting for the defined benefit pension schemes in accordance with IAS 19 “Employee benefits”
The independent actuaries calculate the Group’s liability in respect of the defined benefit schemes. The actuaries make assumptions as 
to discount rates, salary escalations, expected returns on scheme assets, future pension increases, mortality rates applicable to members 
and future rates of inflation. These assumptions are made under the Board’s direction. The Board determines the appropriateness of these 
assumptions by benchmarking them against those used by other schemes and by taking advice from the independent actuaries. If the actual 
experience of the schemes is different from the assumptions used then the pension liability may differ from that shown in these financial 
statements. More information is given in Note 24 to these financial statements.
d) Accounting for provisions in accordance with IAS 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets”
The Group makes provisions where the Board determines that liabilities exist but where judgements have to be made as to the 
quantification of such liabilities. A provision has been made for onerous lease contracts in respect of property leases where the 
Board has determined that the expected economic benefits to be derived from the leases are less than the unavoidable cost 
of meeting the Group’s obligations under the lease contract. This arises where the Group is the head lessee for a property lease 
contract where the property is not used by the Group and where the Group has not been able to sublet the property or has only 
been able to do so on terms which are less favourable than those of the head lease.
e) Accounting for deferred taxation in accordance with IAS 12 “Income Taxes”
The Group provides for deferred taxation using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax assets are recognised in respect 
of tax losses where the Directors believe that it is probable that future profits will be relieved by the benefit of tax losses brought 
forward. The Board considers the likely utilisation of such losses by reviewing budgets and medium term plans for each taxable 
entity within the Group. If the actual profits earned by the Group’s taxable entities is different from the budgets and forecasts 
used then the value of such deferred tax assets may differ from that shown in these financial statements.
(i) basis of accounting and preparation
The accounts have been prepared on the going concern basis and in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the 
historical cost convention. In determining that the going concern basis is appropriate the Directors have reviewed budgets, including 
cashflow forecasts, and concluded that Group has adequate cash resources to continue trading for the foreseeable future.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted for use in the EU. The Group 
has applied all accounting standards and interpretations issued by the IASB and International Financial Reporting Committee 
relevant to its operations and which are effective in respect of these financial statements.
(ii) basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings. The results and net assets 
of undertakings acquired are included in the Group income statement and balance sheet using the acquisition method of 
accounting. The results of undertakings acquired/disposed of are included from the date the Group obtains/loses control.
(iii) Revenue
Revenue, which excludes intra-group revenue and Value Added Tax, comprises:
 - value of work executed during the year on construction contracts based on monthly valuations; and
 - sales of developments and land which are recorded upon legal completion. Notes to the accounts continued

1 Accounting policies continued
(iv) Construction contracts
Contract revenue includes the initial amount agreed in the contract plus any variations in contract work, claims and incentive 
payments to the extent that it is probable that they will result in revenue and can be measured reliably. Contract revenue and 
expenses are recognised in accordance with the stage of completion of the contract. The stage of completion is determined 
by surveys of work performed. Contract costs incurred that relate to future activities are deferred and recognised as amounts 
recoverable on contracts. When it is probable that the total contract costs will exceed contract revenue, the expected loss 
is recognised as an expense immediately. To the extent that progress billings exceed costs incurred plus recognised profits 
(less recognised losses) they are recognised as amounts due to construction contract customers.
(v) Segment reporting
The operating segments are based on the components that the Board, the Group’s principal decision-making body (the Chief 
Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”)), monitors in making decisions about operating matters. Such components are identified on 
the basis of information that is provided internally in the form of monthly management account reporting, budgets and forecasts 
to formulate allocation of resource to segments and assess performance. Revenue from reportable segments is measured on a 
basis consistent with the income statement. Revenue is principally generated from within the UK, the Group’s country of domicile. 
Segment results show the contribution directly attributable to each segment in arriving at the Group’s operating profit. Segment 
assets and liabilities comprise those assets and liabilities directly attributable to each segment. Group eliminations represent 
such consolidation adjustments that are necessary to determine the Group’s assets and liabilities.
(vi) Intangible assets
a)  Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of 
the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly-controlled entity at the date of 
acquisition. Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is tested for impairment annually, or on such other occasions that events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
  On disposal of a subsidiary undertaking, the attributable amount of unamortised goodwill which has not been subject 
to impairment is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal. 
b)  Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. The cost of other intangible assets is 
amortised over their expected useful lives. These intangibles relate to customer relationships and contractual rights and are amortised 
over the period over which the Board has determined that future cash flows are likely to arise from these relationships and rights.
(vii) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost less provision for impairment if required. Depreciation is provided on all 
property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land. Provision is made at rates calculated to write off the cost of each asset, 
less estimated residual value, evenly over its expected useful life as follows:
Group occupied property
Freehold land and buildings  - no depreciation charge
Long leasehold land and buildings - shorter of fifty years and period of lease
Plant, vehicles & equipment  - three to ten years
(viii) Impairments
Goodwill arising on acquisitions and other assets that have an indefinite useful life and are therefore not subject to amortisation, 
are reviewed at least annually for impairment. Other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment 
whenever there is any indication that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If the recoverable amount of any asset 
is less than its carrying amount, a loss on impairment is recognised. Recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value of the asset less 
any costs which would be incurred in selling the asset and its value in use. Value in use is assessed by discounting the estimated future 
cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. For this purpose, assets are grouped into cash generating units which represent the 
lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows. Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed in future 
accounting periods. Reversals of other impairment losses are recognised in income when they arise.
(ix) Inventories
Inventories comprise developments, land held for development and raw materials and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Cost includes appropriate attributable overheads and excludes interest. Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete 
slow moving and defective inventories.
(x) Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are initially recognised at their fair value and then at amortised cost.
(xi) Trade payables
Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at their fair value and then at amortised cost.
(xii) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement comprise cash at bank and in hand, including bank deposits with original 
maturities of less than three months, net of bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are included within borrowings within current 
liabilities in the balance sheet.
(xiii) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and where 
it is probable that an outflow will be required to settle that obligation and where the amount can be reliably estimated. 49 Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
1 Accounting policies continued
(xiv) Leasing commitments
Assets held under finance leases, where substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership of an asset have been transferred to 
the Group, are capitalised and are depreciated in accordance with the depreciation policy for the relevant class of asset or the lease 
term if shorter. The interest element of the rental obligation is charged to the income statement and represents a constant proportion 
of the balance of capital repayments outstanding. Rentals under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
(xv) Defined benefit pension schemes
Pension scheme assets are measured using market values. Pension scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit 
actuarial method and are discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency 
to the liability. Any increase in the present value of liabilities within the Group’s defined benefit schemes expected to arise from 
employee service in the period is charged to operating profit. The expected return on the schemes’ assets and the increase during 
the period in the present value of the schemes’ liabilities arising from the passage of time are included in other finance income. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income. Pension scheme surpluses, to the 
extent they are considered recoverable, or deficits are recognised in full and presented on the face of the Group balance sheet.
(xvi) Defined contribution pension plans
Contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the income statement as incurred.
(xvii) Taxation
The tax charge is composed of current tax and deferred tax, calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date. Current tax and deferred tax are charged or credited to the income statement, except when 
they relate to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the relevant tax is also dealt with in equity.
Current tax is based on the profit for the year. Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences 
arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. 
Deferred tax on such assets and liabilities is not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition (other than in 
a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group 
intends to settle its current assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
(xviii) Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The income statements of 
overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the average rate of exchange ruling throughout the financial year. The balance sheets 
of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising 
from this policy and arising on the retranslation of the opening net assets are taken directly to reserves. All other exchange differences 
are taken to the income statement.
(xix) Financial instruments
Financial assets are divided into the following categories: trade receivables and financial assets at fair value. The Board assigns financial 
assets to each category on initial recognition dependant on the purpose for which the asset was acquired. The categorisation of these 
assets is reconsidered at each reporting date at which a choice of categorisation or accounting treatment is available. All financial assets 
are recognised whenever the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. All such assets are initially 
recognised at fair value. Derecognition of such assets occurs when the Group’s right to receive cash flows from the asset ceases or the 
rights and rewards of ownership have been transferred. All such assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually. Interest and other 
cash flows which arise from holding a financial asset is recognised in the income statement in accordance with IAS39. Financial assets 
at fair value include assets classified as held for trading, and changes in fair value are recognised through the income statement. 
Trade receivables are non-derivative financial assets with expected receipts which are not quoted in an active market and they arise when 
the Group provides goods or services. A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective 
evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have 
had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset. An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at 
amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying value amount, and the present value of the estimated cash flows 
discounted at the original effective interest rate. All impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. Financial liabilities 
are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. All interest related charges 
are recognised as an expense in the income statement. Bank loans and hire purchase liabilities are entered into to provide financing 
for the Group’s operations and are recognised as funds are received. Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost.
(xx) Share based payments
IFRS 2 “Share Based Payment” requires a fair value to be established for any equity settled share based payments. Fair value has been 
independently measured using either a Black Scholes or a Monte Carlo valuation model as was deemed appropriate by the Directors 
for the relevant options’ conditions. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity settled share based payments is expensed 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Directors’ estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
(xxi) Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the 
profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding 
in the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprise share options granted 
to employees.  Notes to the accounts continued
50 Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
1 Accounting policies continued
(xxii) Rental income
Rental income from property is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives 
granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income, over the term of the lease. 
(xxiii) Finance income and expense
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and gains on hedging instruments that are recognised in income or 
expense. Interest income is recognised as it accrues in income or expense, using the effective interest method. Finance expenses 
comprise interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions and losses on hedging instruments that are 
recognised in income or expense. All borrowing costs are recognised in income or expense using the effective interest method. 
2 Segmental analysis
The Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) is responsible for the overall resource allocation and performance assessment of the 
Group. The Board approves major capital expenditure and its authority is required prior to the Group entering into any development 
projects. The Board assesses the performance of the Group and its progress against the strategic plan through monitoring of key 
performance indicators. The Board also determines key financing decisions such as raising equity, all loan or bank borrowing 
arrangements and the granting of security over the Group’s assets. As such the Group considers that the Board is the CODM.
Operating segments have been identified based on the internal reporting information provided to the CODM. From such information 
Engineering Services and Specialist Building have been determined to represent operating segments. Following the identification 
of the operating segments the Group has assessed the similarity of the characteristics of the operating segments. Given the different 
performance targets and markets operated within each operating segment it is not appropriate to aggregate the operating segments 
for reporting purposes and therefore both of the identified operating segments are disclosed as reportable segments. The information 
received by the CODM shows results both pre and post exceptional items. The Group had one customer within the Engineering Services 
sector which represented 31. 1% (201 2: 21.4%) of Group revenue. No other customer represented more than 10% of the Group’s revenue.
These segments are:
Engineering Services, which comprises the Group’s engineering activities which are characterised by the use of the Group’s skilled 
engineering workforce, supplemented by specialist subcontractors where appropriate, in a range of civil, mechanical and electrical 
engineering applications and;
Specialist Building, which comprises the Group’s building activities which are characterised by the use of a supply chain of subcontractors 
to carry out building works under the control of the Group as principal contractor and;
Central activities, which include the sale of land for development, the leasing and sub-leasing of some UK properties and the 
provision of central services to the operating subsidiaries.

The Board has determined that certain charges to the income statement should be separately identified for better understanding 
of the Group’s results. 
During the year the Group has incurred £272,000 (2012: £1,120,000) of exceptional redundancy and restructuring costs in closing 
a regional non-specialist building office. Additionally revenue of £1,028,000 was recorded and provisions amounting to £2,767,000 
have been made against old building contracts in previously closed regional non-specialist building offices, primarily resulting 
from the insolvency of certain subcontractors which arose in the year. 
A Specialist Building subsidiary has recognised a charge in respect of costs arising from exceptional storm damage resulting 
in a charge of £500,000. 
On 9 August 2013 the Company acquired Lewis Civil Engineering Ltd and incurred £196,000 of costs associated with the acquisition. 
On 21 August 2013 the Company sold 71 acres of land near Rugby for a gross sum of £14,384,000 resulting in a profit of £9,190,000. 
As a result of changes to detailed planning and zoning agreements in respect of land owned by the Group in the USA, the Board 
has written down the carrying value of these assets by £4,919,000. 
The Board has also separately identified the charge of £500,000 (201 2: £500,000) for the amortisation of the fair value ascribed to certain 
intangible assets, other than goodwill, arising from the acquisition of Amco Group Holdings Ltd. Further details are given in Note 9.

The Group has available further unused UK tax losses of £48m (2012: £61m) to carry forward against future taxable profits. The Group 
also has unused USA tax losses of $16m (£10.2m) (2012: $16m (£9.9m)) to carry forward against future taxable profits in the USA. 
A substantial element of these losses relates to activities which are not forecast to generate the level of profits needed to utilise 
these losses. A deferred tax asset has been provided to the extent considered reasonable by the Directors, where recovery is expected 
to be recognisable within the foreseeable future. The unrecognised deferred tax asset in respect of these losses amounts to £11.6m 
(2012: £16.3m).

Goodwill of £6,142,000 was acquired on the acquisition of Lewis Civil Engineering Ltd (“Lewis”) and will be reviewed for impairment 
one year after the acquisition and then on an ongoing basis as required by IFRS 3.
Amortisation charges in respect of intangible assets with a finite life are recorded within administrative expenses in the income 
statement. The amortisation policy is disclosed in the accounting policies and approximates to a period of six years.
Amortisation charges in respect of intangible assets arising from the acquisition of Lewis will commence from 1 October 2013.
In order to test goodwill for impairment the Group performs value in use calculations by preparing cash flow forecasts for each cash 
generating unit derived from the most recent financial budgets and strategic plans approved by management going forward three 
years, and then extrapolates cash flows based on conservative estimated growth rates which do not exceed GDP growth in the longer 
term according to management’s view of longer term prospects for each cash generating unit. The cash generating units are deemed to 
be the subsidiaries to which the goodwill relates. Management used growth rates deemed to be appropriate to each cash generating 
unit after reviewing the particular market conditions related to the sector in which the cash generating unit operates. The growth 
rate of 3% per annum has been used. The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 8% as the Board considers the rate appropriate 
in the current financial market as an approximation to the cost of funds to the Group. The calculation shows that there is substantial 
headroom, and the impairment calculations are not particularly sensitive to changes in the discount rate applied. Notes to the accounts continued

date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the Group believes that 
the amounts are still considered recoverable since there is no objective evidence that these financial assets are impaired. The 
Group does not hold any collateral over these balances. The average age of these receivables is 328 days (2012: 350 days).

term is 3 years (2012: 3 years). For the year ended 30 September 2013, the average effective borrowing rate was 3% (2012: 3%). 
Interest rates are fixed at the contract date. All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangement has been entered 
into for contingent rental payments.
All lease obligations are denominated in sterling. The fair value of the Group’s lease obligations approximates to their carrying 
amount. The Group’s obligations under finance leases are secured on the asset to which the lease relates. Notes to the accounts continued

The sterling interest bearing liabilities accrue interest at a rate which is linked to the lender’s base rate or LIBOR.
The maturity of the fixed rate financial liabilities is disclosed in Note 17 . The fixed rate liabilities have a weighted average period of 3 years 
(201 2: 3 years).
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
There are no material differences between fair value and the book value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities.
Financial risks
The Group has exposure to a number of financial risks through the conduct of its operations. Risk management is governed by the 
Group’s operational policies, guidelines and authorisation procedures which are outlined in the Corporate Governance statement. 
The key financial risks resulting from financial instruments are credit, liquidity, currency and market risk.  59 Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
19 Other financial instruments continued
Financial risks continued
a) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of loss if a customer fails to meet its financial obligations and results primarily from the Group’s trade and 
other receivables. The degree to which the Group is exposed to this risk depends on the individual financial situation of each specific 
customer. The Group does not have any risk from a concentration of trade or other receivables in any customer or group of customers. 
The Group assesses the credit worthiness of every customer prior to entering into any contract and requires appropriate evidence of 
financial capability on a case by case basis. The Group reviews trade and other receivables for impairment on a regular basis and 
information relating to the ageing of receivables is provided in Note 12.
b) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Board is responsible for 
ensuring that the Group has sufficient liquidity to meet its financial liabilities as they fall due and does so by monitoring cashflow 
forecasts and budgets. The Board has considered the cashflow forecasts for the next twelve months which show that the Group 
expects to operate within its working capital facilities throughout the year.
The Board aims to maintain a strong capital base so as to ensure investor and market confidence and to sustain the future of the 
business. The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to equity holders of the Company as disclosed in Note 20 
and reserves as disclosed in Note 21. The Group arranges loans and short term overdraft facilities and hire purchase facilities as the 
Board deems necessary. The Group does not have any derivative or non-derivative financial liabilities other than those disclosed in 
Notes 15 to 17 and the retirement benefit obligations disclosed in Note 24. An analysis of the maturity profile for finance lease 
liabilities is given in Note 17.
c) Currency risk
The only exposure of the Group to currency risk (i.e. exposure to gains or losses on foreign exchange which would be recognised in the 
income statement) is in respect of the unhedged portion of an inter-company loan. At 30 September 2013 the unhedged portion of the 
inter-company loan was $771,000 (2012: $270,000). The dollar closing exchange rate was $1.62: £1 (2012: $1.61: £1) resulting in a foreign 
exchange loss of £23,000 (2012: £12,000) being charged to finance costs. Consequently, to the extent that the inter-company loan is not 
fully hedged, the income statement may be impacted by exchange rate movements. Exchange rate movement on translation of Lovell 
America, Inc.’s net assets are charged to the cumulative translation adjustment within total equity. The exchange loss arising on the 
translation of Lovell America Inc.’s net assets was £24,000. The total equity statement would be impacted by £63,000 for each $0.01 
movement in exchange rates.
All functional currencies of the Group operations are denominated in sterling, with the exception of the US operations whose 
functional currency is the US dollar.
d) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices will affect the Group’s income or the carrying amount of its holding of financial 
instruments. The principal risk relates to interest rates where the Group’s risk is limited to the rates applying to its interest bearing 
short-term deposits and its bank loan. A reduction in market interest rates could lead to a reduction in the Group’s interest income 
and a reduction in its interest costs. Consequently a 1% decrease in market interest rates would reduce annual finance costs by 
£10,000 for every £1m of outstanding loan.
The Group’s hire purchase financial liabilities are all at fixed rates of interest.

Share options
Renew Holdings 2004 Executive Share Option Scheme
The Group operates a share option scheme, the Renew Holdings 2004 Executive Share Option Scheme. The scheme has both an 
Approved and Unapproved element. The difference between the two elements is that the Approved scheme has the advantage 
of certain HMRC approved tax benefits.
Both elements have the same general terms and conditions. Options issued under the scheme must be held for three years before 
they can vest and become exercisable. They must be exercised within ten years from the date of grant.
All options granted under the Unapproved element have vested and have been exercised.
Vesting of options is dependant on the achievement of certain performance criteria which are established by the Remuneration 
Committee at the point of grant. 114,280 of the options granted under the Approved element in the 2006 financial year have vested. 
These are the only remaining options outstanding under the scheme.
The scheme does not permit retesting of performance conditions and if the performance criteria are not achieved then the options 
will lapse.
The number of options in issue and their exercise price is given in Note 21.  Notes to the accounts continued

Renew Holdings plc Long Term Incentive Plan
At the Annual General Meeting held on 25 January 2012 the shareholders approved a new long term incentive plan (“LTIP”) which 
replaced the Renew Holdings plc 2004 Executive Share Option Scheme as the Directors believed that the LTIP was a more effective 
method of aligning executive and shareholder interests.
On 2 March 2012, the Company granted options to subscribe for 400,000 Ordinary Shares pursuant to the LTIP. On 20 December 2012 
options to subscribe for a further 400,000 Ordinary Shares were granted.
The options are exercisable at a nominal cost from 2 March 2015 in respect of those granted on 2 March 201 2 and from 20 December 2015 
in respect of those granted on 20 December 2012, subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria.
Vesting of one half of the options is dependant on absolute growth in the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’), and the other 
half is dependant on the Company’s TSR performance as compared to the TSR achieved by other companies in a comparator group 
of twelve companies selected by the Remuneration Committee. All TSR calculations are based on the average of the opening and 
closing share price over a thirty day period prior to the commencement and the end of the performance period.
The absolute TSR growth target requires the Company’s TSR over the three year performance period to grow by more than 25%. For 
TSR growth between 25% and 100%, the half of the option which is subject to the absolute TSR growth target vests on a straight-line 
basis from nil vesting at 25% growth, to 100% vesting at 100% growth. There will be no vesting if TSR growth is 25% or less.
The comparator group TSR performance target measures the Company’s TSR over the three year performance period against the TSR 
of a group of twelve companies selected by the Remuneration Committee. If the Company’s TSR performance falls below the median 
performance of the comparator group then the options lapse forthwith. If the Company is ranked within the top decile of the comparator 
group the options shall vest in full. If the Company’s TSR performance is ranked between the median position and the top decile of the 
comparator group then the options shall vest on a straight line basis from nil, at or below the median position, to 100% at the top decile.

Share based payments reserve
Renew Holdings 2004 Executive Share Option Scheme
IFRS 2 “Share Based Payment” requires a fair value to be established for any equity settled share based payments. Fair value has been 
independently measured by Baker Tilly, Chartered Accountants, using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value determined at 
the grant date of the equity settled share based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the 
Board’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Nil has been charged (2012: £30,000 credited) to administrative expenses.
1,504,741 options were exercised during the year (2012: Nil). The value per option represents the fair value of the option less the 
consideration payable.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the share price since the Company listed on AIM in 2001.
The risk free rate of return has been derived from the Bank of England’s yield curve taking the spot rate for a maturity of 36 months. 
This period has been selected as being the minimum period over which the options could remain extant. 61 Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

period, based on the Board’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
£101,000 has been charged (2012: £36,000) to administrative expenses. There is no impact on net assets since an equivalent amount 
has been credited to the share based payments reserve. No options were exercised during the year. The value per option represents 
the fair value of the option less the consideration payable.
The expected volatility has been calculated based on weekly historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the three years prior to the 
date of grant. The risk free rate of return has been based on the yields available on three year UK government bonds as at the date of grant.

24 Employee benefits: Retirement benefit obligations
Defined benefit pension schemes
The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes, the Lovell Pension Scheme and the Amco Pension Scheme. Both schemes 
have been closed to new members and to further benefits accrual for several years.
IAS 19 “Employee benefits”
The Directors have adopted the accounting required by IAS 19 with effect from the transition date. The Directors have discussed the 
assumptions used in determining the actuarial valuations set out below with independent pensions advisors and have determined 
that they are appropriate. The Lovell scheme’s valuation at 30 September 2013 shows a deficit of £3,545,000 based on the assumptions 
set out below. The Amco scheme shows a surplus of £962,000 based on the assumptions used in its valuation which are similar to 
those used for the Lovell scheme except where the Directors, in consultation with the scheme’s advisors, consider it appropriate to 
vary them due to the different characteristics of the Amco scheme and its membership profile. The Directors have determined that 
it is appropriate to recognise this surplus as, having reviewed the rules of the Amco scheme, they are of the view that the employer, 
Amalgamated Construction Ltd, has an unconditional right to that surplus.
The following disclosures required by IAS 19 have been based on the most recent actuarial valuation as at 30 September 2013 
carried out by Lane Clark & Peacock LLP, Consulting Actuaries, in respect of the Lovell scheme and Capita Employee Benefits 
(Consulting) Ltd in respect of the Amco scheme using the following assumptions:

Increases in deferred pensions 2.2% 2.7% 3.2%
The mortality tables adopted for the valuation of the Lovell scheme are the S1NA tables with future improvements in line with the 
Continuing Mortality Investigations 2010 model with long term improvement rates of 1% per annum for both males and females. 
The Directors believe that this analysis provides a more reliable estimate of the mortality characteristics of the scheme’s membership. 
Under these assumptions, a 60 year old male pensioner is forecast to live for a further 26.6 years and the life expectancy of a male 
aged 60 in 2033 is 28.2 years.
The mortality tables adopted for the valuation of the Amco scheme are the S1PA Mortality tables based on the mortality 
experience of pension scheme members with projected longevity improvements and with an additional allowance for future 
longevity improvements known as the long cohort adjustment. The Directors believe that this analysis provides a more reliable 
estimate of the mortality characteristics of the scheme’s membership. Under these assumptions, a 65 year old male pensioner 
is forecast to live for a further 23.7 years and the life expectancy of a male aged 65 in 2033 is 25.8 years.

Fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition
In accordance with IFRS3, the Board will review the fair value of assets and liabilities using information available up to 12 months 
after the date of acquisition.
Goodwill impairment review
The Board has reviewed the goodwill arising on acquisition for impairment as required by IFRS3. No such impairment was identified.
The current year end of Lewis is 31 July and this will be changed to 30 September in due course to bring it into line with that of the Group. 
If the acquisition of Lewis had occurred on 1 October 2012, Group revenue would have been approximately £358m and profit for 
the year ended 30 September 2013 would have been approximately £9m. 67 Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Notes to the company accounts
A Accounting policies
(i) basis of accounting
The accounts have been prepared on the going concern basis and in accordance with UK applicable accounting standards under the 
historical cost convention. In determining that the going concern basis is appropriate the Directors have reviewed budgets, including 
cashflow forecasts, and concluded that Company has adequate cash resources to continue trading for the foreseeable future.
A summary of the more important Company accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, is set out below:
(ii) Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost less provision for impairment.
(iii) Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are recorded at cost or valuation for certain properties, less provision for impairment if required. Depreciation 
is provided on all tangible fixed assets, other than freehold land. Provision is made at rates calculated to write off the cost of each 
asset, less estimated residual value, evenly over its expected useful life as follows:
Freehold land and buildings – no depreciation charge
Long leasehold land – shorter of fifty years and 
and buildings  – period of lease
Plant, vehicles & equipment  – three to ten years
(iv) Leasing commitments
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
(v) Share based payments
FRS 20 “Share Based Payments” requires a fair value to be established for any equity settled share based payments. Fair value 
has been independently measured using either a Black Scholes or a Monte Carlo valuation model as was deemed appropriate by the 
Directors for the relevant options’ conditions. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity settled share based payments 
is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Directors’ estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
(vi) Deferred taxation
The payment of taxation is deferred or accelerated because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for 
accounting and taxation purposes. Full provision for deferred taxation is made under the liability method, without discounting, 
on timing differences that have arisen, but not reversed by the balance sheet date, unless such provision is not permitted by 
FRS 19 “Deferred Tax”.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered. In accordance 
with FRS 19 deferred tax is not provided for on:
a) revaluation gains on land and buildings, unless there is a binding agreement to sell them at the balance sheet date: 
b) gains on the sale of non-monetary assets, if the taxable gain will probably be rolled over; 
c) fair value adjustment gains to fixed assets and stock to uplift prices to those ruling when an acquisition is made; and 
d) extra tax payable if the overseas retained profits of subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates are remitted in the future. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for taxable losses relating to trading to the extent that those losses are expected 
to be recoverable within the foreseeable future.
(vii) Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction or at the contracted rate if the 
transaction is covered by a forward exchange contract. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate. Exchange 
differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
(viii) Defined benefit pension scheme
The Company has adopted the requirements of FRS 17 “Retirement Benefits”. The Directors have determined that it is not possible 
to allocate the assets and liabilities of the scheme between the various Group companies. Accordingly the scheme is not accounted 
for in the Company’s balance sheet. However, any increase in the present value of liabilities within the defined benefit scheme 
expected to arise from employee service in the period is charged to operating profit in respect of the Company’s employees.
(ix) Defined contribution pension plans
Contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
(x) Dividends
Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately 
authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company. Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed 
in the notes to the financial statements.
(xi) Stocks and work in progress
Stocks comprise land held for development and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes appropriate 
attributable overheads and excludes interest. Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow moving and defective stocks. 69 Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
B Profit and loss account 
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account. The profit 
after taxation for the financial year dealt with in the accounts of the Company was £11,226,000 (2012: £1,402,000).
The audit fee charged within the profit and loss account amounted to £51,000 (2012: £54,000).

30 September 2013. This will be accounted for in the 2013/14 financial year.

The holders of Ordinary Shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share 
at meetings of the Company.
During the year 1,504,741 Ordinary Shares were issued at par value following the exercise of options under the Unapproved 
element of the Renew Holdings plc Executive Share Option Scheme (2012: Nil).
Share options
Renew Holdings 2004 Executive Share Option Scheme
The Company operates a share option scheme, the Renew Holdings 2004 Executive Share Option Scheme. The scheme has both 
an Approved and Unapproved element. The difference between the two elements is that the Approved scheme has the advantage 
of certain HMRC approved tax benefits.
Both elements have the same general terms and conditions. Options issued under the scheme must be held for three years before 
they can vest and become exercisable. They must be exercised within ten years from the date of grant.
All options granted under the Unapproved element have vested and have been exercised.
Vesting of options is dependant on the achievement of certain performance criteria which are established by the Remuneration 
Committee at the point of grant. 114,280 of the options granted under the Approved element in the 2006 financial year have vested. 
These are the only remaining options outstanding under the scheme.
The scheme does not permit retesting of performance conditions and if the performance criteria are not achieved then the options 
will lapse.
The number of options in issue and their exercise price is given in Note M.
Renew Holdings plc Long Term Incentive Plan
At the Annual General Meeting held on 25 January 2012 the shareholders approved a new long term incentive plan (“LTIP”) which 
replaced the Renew Holdings plc 2004 Executive Share Option Scheme as the Directors believed that the LTIP was a more effective 
method of aligning executive and shareholder interests.
On 2 March 2012, the Company granted options to subscribe for 400,000 Ordinary Shares pursuant to the LTIP. On 20 December 2012 
options to subscribe for a further 400,000 Ordinary Shares were granted.
The options are exercisable at a nominal cost from 2 March 2015 in respect of those granted on 2 March 201 2 and from 20 December 2015 
in respect of those granted on 20 December 2012, subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria.
Vesting of one half of the options is dependant on absolute growth in the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’), and the other 
half is dependant on the Company’s TSR performance as compared to the TSR achieved by other companies in a comparator group 
of twelve companies selected by the Remuneration Committee. All TSR calculations are based on the average of the opening and 
closing share price over a thirty day period prior to the commencement and the end of the performance period.
The absolute TSR growth target requires the Company’s TSR over the three year performance period to grow by more than 25%. For 
TSR growth between 25% and 100%, the half of the option which is subject to the absolute TSR growth target vests on a straight-line 
basis from nil vesting at 25% growth, to 100% vesting at 100% growth. There will be no vesting if TSR growth is 25% or less.
The comparator group TSR performance target measures the Company’s TSR over the three year performance period against 
the TSR of a group of twelve companies selected by the Remuneration Committee. If the Company’s TSR performance falls below the 
median performance of the comparator group then the options lapse forthwith. If the Company is ranked within the top decile 
of the comparator group the options shall vest in full. If the Company’s TSR performance is ranked between the median position 
and the top decile of the comparator group then the options shall vest on a straight line basis from nil, at or below the median 
position, to 100% at the top decile. 72 Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Share based payments reserve
FRS 20 “Share Based Payment” requires a fair value to be established for any equity settled share based payments. Fair value 
has been independently measured by Baker Tilly, Chartered Accountants, using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value 
determined at the grant date of the equity settled share based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on the Board’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Nil has been charged (2012: £30,000 credited) to administrative expenses.
1,504,741 options were exercised during the year (2012: Nil). The value per option represents the fair value of the option less 
the consideration payable.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the share price since the Company listed on AIM in 2001.
The risk free rate of return has been derived from the Bank of England’s yield curve taking the spot rate for a maturity of 36 months. 
This period has been selected as being the minimum period over which the options could remain extant.
Options granted under the Renew Holdings 2004 Executive Share Option Scheme over the Company’s Ordinary Shares at 30 September 2013 
were as follows:
Date of grant 7 June 2006
Awards outstanding at 30 September 2013
- Directors 114,280
Exercise price and price at date of grant 52.5p
Maximum option life 10 years
Assumed option life for purposes of valuation 3 years

Dividend yield 1.0%
Risk free interest rate 4.67%
Value per option 20.5p
The outstanding options have vested in full but have not yet been exercised. 
Renew Holdings plc Long Term Incentive Plan
Fair value has been independently measured by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP using a Monte Carlo model methodology.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity settled share based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period, based on the Board’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
£101,000 has been charged (2012: £36,000) to administrative expenses. There is no impact on net assets since an equivalent amount 
has been credited to the share based payments reserve. No options were exercised during the year. The value per option represents 
the fair value of the option less the consideration payable.
The expected volatility has been calculated based on weekly historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the three years 
prior to the date of grant. The risk free rate of return has been based on the yields available on three year UK government bonds 
as at the date of grant. 73 Renew Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Boiler room fraud 
In recent years many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence 
concerning investment matters. These are typically from overseas based “brokers” who target UK shareholders, offering to sell them 
what turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments. These operations are commonly known as “boiler rooms”. 
Shareholders are advised to be wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports. 
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
•		 	 Check	that	they	are	properly	authorised	by	the	FCA	by	visiting	www.fca.org.uk/register/
•		 	 Report	the	matter	to	the	FCA	by	calling	0800	111	6768
If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. 
The FCA can be contacted by completing an online form at www.fca.org.uk/scams. More detailed information on this or similar 
activity can be found on the FCA website www.fca.org.uk. Amco

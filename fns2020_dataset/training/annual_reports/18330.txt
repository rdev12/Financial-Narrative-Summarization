Chairman's Statement
PERFORMANCE
I am delighted to report another year of 
excellent performance by DS Smith. We 
have delivered strong growth in volumes, 
profits, margins and returns, in a market 
that is still tough. 
I am particularly pleased with the way that 
the business has continued to re-shape. 
Since the acquisition of SCA Packaging in 
July 2012, which transformed the business 
into a genuinely pan-European business, the 
principal focus has been on integration and 
the delivery of substantial synergies. With 
that programme complete, over the last 12 
months DS Smith has acquired businesses in 
Italy, Spain, and in the high growth region of 
south eastern Europe. These businesses are 
focused on our core enterprise of recycled 
packaging. We have also been investing in 
new sites, such as those for the plastics 
business in both the US and Europe. At the 
same time, some non-core businesses have 
been disposed of, releasing capital that can 
be deployed elsewhere.
While we have done this, we have continued 
to deliver on our key performance indicators, 
with our margin now at the top end of our 
target range. I am delighted to confirm that 
this medium-term target is now being raised 
by 100 basis points, reflecting both the 
performance of the business and also  
our aspiration for the future. 
DIVIDEND
The Board considers the dividend to be  
an important component of shareholder 
returns and, as such, has a policy to deliver  
a progressive dividend, where dividend 
cover is between 2.0 and 2.5 times, through 
the cycle. For the year 2014/15, the Board 
recommends a final dividend of 7 .7 pence, 
which together with the interim dividend  
of 3.7 pence gives a total dividend for  
the year of 11.4 pence per share (2013/14: 
10.0 pence per share). This represents an 
increase of 14 per cent on the prior year and 
cover of 2.1 times in relation to earnings per 
share (before amortisation and exceptional 
items) (adjusted EPS), in line with our policy. 
Looking back over the past five years I am 
particularly proud of the consistent growth 
and returns to shareholders. Adjusted  
EPS has grown at an average rate of 34  
per cent each year, with the dividend per 
share growing similarly at 29 per cent.  
T otal shareholder return, which is a measure 
combining growth in the share price with the 
benefit of dividends, has grown 343 per cent, 
considerably out-stripping the FTSE 250 at 
93 per cent over the same five year period. 
OUTLOOK
As usual, on behalf of the Board, I would  
like to thank all my colleagues throughout  
DS Smith for their dedication and hard work 
over the past year. That commitment has 
resulted in the great results for the year, 
and the growth in market share that we are 
seeing across our business. We see significant 
opportunities for the business in the coming 
year and are confident of future success.

Chief Executive's Q&A
We are leading change  
by providing innovative 
packaging solutions.
You joined DS Smith as CEO in May 
2010 — over five years ago. What 
has been achieved in that time?
The business has changed a great deal  
over the last five years, but there remains 
plenty of opportunities and a lot more to do. 
At the time I joined, DS Smith was principally 
an Anglo-French business, with substantial 
paper mills, a large business in office  
products supply and margins of 4.5 per cent.  
I set out a simple strategy, focused on our 
customers, to design and manufacture 
recycled packaging with the high quality, 
service and innovation that customers  
want. The goal of that strategy was to 
improve our financial performance and  
the consistency of our returns. 
This idea was summed up in the key pillars 
of our strategy — to delight our customers, 
to realise the potential of our people, to 
double the size and profitability of the 
business, and to lead the way in recycling. 
Five years on, we have done a huge amount. 
We have made a number of acquisitions,  
so that the corrugated business is now 
genuinely pan-European, in 27 countries. 
We have also disposed of parts of the 
business that did not fit. In financial terms, 
since 2009/10 we have doubled revenues,  
close to doubled our 2010 margins and 
nearly tripled our earnings per share.
We have achieved this by winning market 
share, which is the most significant test of 
whether you offer an attractive proposition 
Miles Roberts
Group Chief Executive  Strategic Report 5

to customers. We have invested in employee 
programmes to engage everyone in the 
organisation. We have also invested in  
our recycling business as well as our own 
corporate sustainability. 
  See p 20 for more about our key 
performance indicators
Does that mean that everything  
is done?
DS Smith is leading change in the industry, 
not just within our own organisation. The 
changes are driven by our customers and 
their customers’ changing needs, which  
we see as continuing to evolve, so I believe 
there is a great deal further forward for  
DS Smith to travel, as we continue to invest 
in our business. 
The business is cash generative, which 
means that we have choices on how to  
invest for further growth. We are investing 
significantly in our plants and adding  
new technology to produce high quality 
packaging, for example display units. We  
are investing in rolling out design centres 
across Europe so that all our customers  
have a centre within easy reach where we 
can develop innovative solutions for them. 
In Europe, while we have a network of 
plants that broadly cover the full region, 
there are areas where we would like a 
greater presence. 
There is also the challenge of integrating 
the businesses we have acquired recently 
— Andopack in Spain, for example, and the 
Duropack businesses in south eastern 
Europe. Making the acquisition is just the 
start — we then bring in our ways of working, 
our innovation, links to our design centres 
— in order to make the acquired businesses 
as successful as possible.
Is bigger always better in  
the corrugated industry?
The scale of DS Smith gives us some  
clear advantages versus our competitors. 
First, we are able to offer solutions to  
large customers across Europe. That is 
something that can only be achieved with  
a pan-European manufacturing network  
like ours. Large pan-European customers 
are realising that it is more efficient for  
them to have only a small number of 
corrugated suppliers rather than many, 
because we can offer consistency and 
quality that is otherwise difficult to achieve. 
Second, we have the size to be able to  
invest in innovation and research, with  
the benefit shared across the business.  
For example, we have invested substantially 
in the quality of the paper we manufacture,  
to allow us to build the best possible 
corrugated boxes. I believe that, in the  
case of DS Smith, scale and quality of 
business therefore go hand-in-hand.
When you talk about “leading 
change” in the industry, what  
does that mean? 
We put our customers at the heart of our 
operation and focus on what is important  
to them and delivers value for them. 
Corrugated boxes fulfil a role far wider than 
just transit. Packaging touches many points 
in the supply chain — so it is important how 
easily it works on our customers’ packaging 
lines, how it can be used to maximise the 
transit logistics, and then, at the end, how 
the packaging helps our customers sell more 
too, by presenting the product in a way that 
attracts the attention of the consumer and 
is easy to shop. Good retail-ready packaging 
(packaging that is used in a store) can save 
the retailers money too — by reducing 
shelf-stacking time. 
At DS Smith we think that this whole  
supply cycle is important, and that to  
make packaging that fulfils the needs  
of our customer , you need the skills to  
address all these areas, in innovation,  
design and manufacturing. This is a big 
change for the industry and we are proud  
to lead this change in becoming more 
customer focused.
  See p 18 for more about how we  
analyse the supply cycle

Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Chief Executive's Q&A continued
Why are you changing your return 
on sales target in your financial  
key performance indicators (KPIs)? 
This year we have delivered a return on 
sales margin of 8.8 per cent, near the top  
of our range of 7 to 9 per cent. The Board 
now believes we can achieve an additional 
100 basis points, in the medium-term.  
This increase reflects two changes to our 
business. First is the quality of our whole 
offering, from innovation, design and 
manufacture, adding more value across  
the whole supply chain for our customers. 
Second is the scale of our business, which 
means, among other things, that the costs 
and benefits of innovation, research and 
design are shared. 
  See p 20 for more about our KPIs 
Consumer behaviour has changed 
significantly over the last few 
years, with more products bought 
on-line for example. Is this an 
opportunity or a threat to DS Smith?
We see the changing consumer and retail 
trends as an opportunity. More and more  
is expected of the humble corrugated box 
and packaging now needs to be adaptable  
to different retail environments from 
supermarkets, a convenience store, a 
discounter, to an on-line distributor. Each  
has slightly different requirements, which 
means complexity. We provide solutions  
for these challenges. We have teams  
who work on smart designs for each  
format, and these solutions are shared 
throughout the organisation. That gives  
us a commercial advantage.
  See p 11 for more about packaging  
for different retail channels 
The returns for shareholders have 
been excellent over the last five 
years – how has the business’s 
success benefited employees?
Employees are our key asset. We have  
made health and safety a top priority and 
have seen a 46 per cent drop in our lost-time 
accident rate over the last five years. We 
have a programme called OWN IT! that aims 
to help our employees understand how  
their own targets and actions contribute  
to the performance of the business as a 
whole. At the same time we encourage 
share ownership among our employees,  
and in 2014 launched an award-winning  
SAYE scheme across 23 countries. 
I am also proud of the work that DS Smith  
is undertaking, through our Charitable 
Foundation, to reach out to both new 
employees and potential employees. In  
the last 12 months we have entered into  
a partnership with Nestlé in its Alliance 4 
YOUth programme — to give opportunities  
to young people across Europe to get that 
all-important first job or work experience. 
We are now also entering our third year of 
sponsoring 17 and 18-year-olds interested  
in engineering, through the Arkwright 
Scholarship programme. 
What does the circular  
economy mean to DS Smith?
We are proud to be the largest recycler of 
paper and corrugated board in the UK, and 
with a substantial position in that market  
in Europe. Not only is it a good business,  
but it provides an essential service to the 
economy, as there are not enough trees  
for paper only to be made from new fibre.  
As well as providing an essential, reliable 
collection service for our customers, we  
will work with them to make sure that they 
are recovering all their used paper and 
corrugated board, rather than sending it to 
landfill. That makes sense for them, for us, 
and is a benefit to the whole environment.
Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Looking at the past year,  
what are you most proud of?
I am proud of how the business balance  
has delivered another good set of financial 
results, despite difficult economic conditions. 
That has come from excellent work by  
our commercial teams throughout the 
organisation, working to design and 
manufacture the best packaging possible. 
We have further developed the shape  
of the business with both acquisitions and 
disposals, and invested in our own assets 
and network at the same time. This has all 
been delivered thanks to our employees 
each one of whom takes responsibility for 
delivering their part of our plan each year  
— I am grateful to them all.

Consumer behaviour and  
the retail environment  
are changing.
Consumers are changing the way that they shop.
They are now making more frequent shopping trips, for 
example an estimated 55 per cent of consumers now go 
grocery shopping three or more times per week. Consumers 
most commonly don’t have a detailed shopping list, instead 
choosing while in the store. While the economy is recovering, 
shoppers remain very cost conscious. It is expected that large 
stores will become less important while discount, convenience 
and on-line retailers grow. For example, convenience, discount 
and on-line retailers are forecast to grow from 31 per cent to  
43 per cent of the UK market by 2020.
Well designed packaging is essential to driving sales  
in this environment.
• Good packaging will be easily identifiable in the back-of-
store, driving on-shelf availability.
• Well designed packaging makes the product easy to identify 
and to pick from the shelf.
• Attractive packaging is important in driving brand visibility 
and in-store purchasing decisions.
• Display packaging is commonly used to support promotions.

R equ i rements for  
packaging are ch angi ng. 
Supermarkets —large box displays 
required for volume
Discounters — high quality 
packaging required, often with 
different variants in one box
Packaging is no longer  
one-size-fits-all. 
Packaging needs to fulfil its purpose of transporting  
and protecting its product. It also needs to drive availability, 
accessibility and visibility in a range of store settings — large 
store, convenience store, discounters, plus picking for on-line 
delivery and wholesale distributors. 
Supermarkets require large unit sizes to deal with the volume 
being purchased, while convenience stores require narrow 
units in order to maximise availability. Discounters require  
very high quality packaging, with a single unit containing  
a range of brand variants, in order to maximise efficiency  
in stacking shelves. 
For any branded product, its presentation at the retailer  
is key, so packaging must support and enhance the brand 
proposition. Retail-ready packaging achieves this through  
the quality of materials and printing, the interaction  
between the primary product and the outer packaging,  
and the prominence of the brand logo.

We create innovative 
solutions for changing 
customer needs. 
DS Smith provides solutions based  
on our insight, innovation, design and 
manufacturing expertise. Our overall 
aim is to create packaging that reduces 
costs, drives sales and manages risk.
For example, for Ritter Sport chocolate, we have designed a 
display case that can be automatically filled and stacked, rather 
than stacked and assembled by hand, and can be configured  
for either a quarter or a half-sized pallet. The construction is 
modular, allowing for different size displays while keeping the 
construction simple. This makes it ideal for a range of store 
sizes while reducing costs for the manufacturer. The display  
is a highly attractive unit which complements the branding  
of the primary product — the bars of chocolate — matching  
the colours and supporting the quality of the brand.  14 Strategic Report

Our business model is focused  
on packaging. We bring insight  
and innovation, and use this to 
design the optimum packaging  
for our customers’ supply chains, 
and manufacture it to the  
highest standard. 
To support the production of high quality 
corrugated packaging, we manufacture 
paper and in turn have a recycling business 
to source fibre for this activity. We design 
and manufacture specialised paper grades 
to produce the best packaging possible.
We also design and manufacture certain types 
of speciality plastic packaging, in particular 
plastic bags and taps for bag-in-box packaging 
and rigid crates for bottled liquids. 
Unless otherwise specified, all data 
regarding our operations, including sites, 
volumes and employee numbers include  
the Duropack business, acquired on  
31 May 2015.
OUR BUSINESSES
DS Smith designs and 
manufactures corrugated 
packaging. We focus 
particularly on packaging  
for fast-moving consumer 
goods, such as grocery 
products, which need large 
volumes of high quality 
packaging to complement 
branded products with 
requirements changing 
frequently.
The remainder of our 
business is for industrial 
products, other consumer 
products and other uses, 
such as packaging for  
on-line deliveries. Industrial 
packaging is often very high 
precision and involves 
complex designs.
We source used paper and old 
corrugated cases (OCC) from 
both retailers and traders. 
The fibre is principally used 
by our own paper mills to 
make recycled paper, with 
the remainder sold to other 
paper manufacturers in both 
Europe and globally. We also 
offer a full recycling service 
to cover other materials such 
as glass and metals, which we 
then recycle in partnership 
with subcontractors.  
DS Smith is different to other 
recyclate collectors because 
we do not operate landfill 
sites — our sole focus is on 
recycling, with a target of 
helping our customers 
achieve zero waste. In 
2014/15, we expanded our 
operations by taking our 
ownership of Italmaceri to 
100 per cent. The acquisition 
of Duropack on 31 May 2015  
has further increased our 
recycling capabilities in  
south eastern Europe.
DS Smith manufactures 
recycled paper, principally 
corrugated case material 
(CCM) or testliner, which is 
the paper used to make 
corrugated board. We also 
make some other grades  
of paper, such as core board 
and plasterboard liner. The 
majority of the CCM that we 
make is used by our own 
packaging business, with the 
remainder sold externally.  
All other grades are sold 
externally. The acquisition  
of Duropack on 31 May 2015  
has added a further two 
testliner mills, both in  
south eastern Europe.
DS Smith has two parts  
to its plastics business:
Flexible packaging  
and dispensing
DS Smith designs and 
manufactures plastic  
bags and taps and fitments  
for use in bag-in-box 
packaging for liquids.  
Our products are used for 
transportation of beverages, 
concentrates, chemicals and 
pharmaceuticals. Bag-and-
tap solutions can be used  
for industrial containers,  
for dispensing beverages  
in restaurants or as an 
end-product, such as a wine 
box. Our flexible packaging 
business operates globally.
Rigid packaging
We design and manufacture 
rigid plastic packaging 
products for the transit  
of beverages, healthcare 
products, automotive 
products and in retail. This 
business operates in Europe.

HOW WE CREATE VALUE 
We seek to help our customers reduce  
their costs, sell more, and manage their risk. 
We are able to do this through our skills in 
innovation, design and manufacture, and 
insight into consumer behaviour in the retail 
environment. We are able to invest in the 
skills necessary to deliver this due to our 
scale, and we offer our solutions on a 
pan-European basis. 
We work with our customers, analysing 
every point where packaging interacts with 
their activities, and considering how it might 
be optimised. For example, we optimise  
the box strength for stacking in a lorry,  
and optimise the design for speed on the 
packing line, on to how easily it can be 
opened and displayed once in store. We also 
look at how packaging works best once on  
a retailer’s shelf, in order to drive sales and 
improve the handling costs for the retailer. 
Once a box is used, it then needs to be easily 
recycled, and the journey begins again.
To achieve this, we employ a range of skills. 
We start with analysing what the customer 
needs from the packaging in terms of 
physical performance across the supply 
chain, and we design suitable packaging 
based on that specification. Our paper 
business works in close collaboration with 
our corrugated packaging business to 
develop high performance paper that best 
suits the needs of the packaging designers 
and the manufacturing process. We also 
work with our customers and supply our 
own insight on how packaging can maximise 
sales by maximising availability within store, 
through brand visibility and ease of use. 
We describe this approach as “Supply  
Cycle Thinking”.
  See p 18 for more on supply cycle thinking
Our scale gives us a commercial advantage 
and allows us to deliver this quality of 
service sustainably. Our ability to provide 
pan-European solutions, via our extensive 
manufacturing base, is a key differentiator 
compared to many competitors. We work 
with leading FMCG and industrial customers 
to supply packaging to their own network  
of factories, with guarantees for service 
and quality that apply across the business. 
For example, our customers know that the 
packaging for their branded product will  
be in precisely the correct specified colour, 
whether it has been manufactured in the 
UK, Spain, Sweden or Romania. This is all 
part of our strategic commitment to delight 
our customers.
Our scale also allows us to invest in research, 
innovation and design, for example our 
network of design centres. The benefit and 
costs are then shared across the business. 
We are therefore able to offer a high 
standard of product while maintaining 
competitive pricing. This is key to our 
success with customers, as demonstrated 
by our consistent volume growth ahead of 
market growth.

At the same time, the paper mills are highly 
focused on their operational excellence.  
We have a “LEAN team” programme of 
highly skilled engineers who work with all 
the sites in turn to ensure that best practice 
is shared and implemented. This ensures we 
maximise profitability by minimising costs.
 
 Plastic Packaging
24 manufacturing sites in 
Europe, New Zealand,  
Thailand and the US
Sales offices in Belgium, 
France, UK and the US
Head office in the US
c. 2,100 employees
HOW WE CREATE VALUE 
Specialist plastic packaging solutions  
are designed in close collaboration with 
customers and frequently include 
intellectual property. The design of taps  
and fitments for liquids are often specific  
to the type of liquid, in order to optimise 
filling and dispensing. We own hundreds of 
patents covering our designs and products. 
Once we have a design that fulfils our 
customers’ requirements, we are able to 
manufacture on a large scale and distribute 
the product globally, as the product is light 
and readily transportable. Our rigid plastic 
products are manufactured in Europe for 
the European market, in scale operations 
principally focused in Bulgaria and Slovakia. 
Our flexible plastic products are manufactured 
in New Zealand, Thailand and the US and  
are distributed globally.
 Recycling
Operates in Croatia, France,

17 depots and 24 offices
c. 5.4 million tonnes fibre 
collected per annum
c. 900 employees
#1 market share for  
collection of OCC in the UK
HOW WE CREATE VALUE 
Our core business is the collection of  
used materials, principally OCC and other 
fibre, providing a recycling service to our 
customers. In addition, we offer a range  
of value-added services, such as recycling 
and environmental audits and consultancy 
to help customers manage their materials 
most efficiently, with the aim of achieving 
zero waste. This is not only a worthwhile 
environmental target; it typically means 
that better value can be achieved on the 
used fibre, though developing systems  
to maximise recovery and segregation,  
as appropriate. 
The recycling business is profitable 
independent of the other elements of  
the DS Smith business. We buy the fibre  
we collect, typically with reference to the 
market price of fibre, adjusted to reflect  
the collection service provided. The fibre  
is aggregated and sorted, and then used  
in DS Smith’s paper mills or sold to third 
party mills or exporters. 
Our recycling business supports our paper 
operations by providing them with the fibre 
required, with a consistent and well defined 
quality, which in turn enables our paper  
mills to produce paper with precisely the 
performance characteristics required by the 
packaging business. Our recycling business 
also supports our corrugated packaging 
business by helping retailers get best  
value from their used corrugated material, 
driving the use of corrugated packaging 
over other packaging materials.

HOW WE CREATE VALUE 
Our paper business is an essential partner  
to our packaging business. We seek to 
integrate the businesses as much as 
practicable, with the paper operations 
focused on producing the paper required  
by packaging, to the correct quality standard 
and consistency. The majority of our testliner 
is used by the DS Smith packaging business. 
The remainder of our testliner and all our 
other grades of paper are sold externally.  
We seek to compete on the quality of our 
product, while our scale and efficiency  
means that we remain cost competitive. 
We undertake joint research and development 
of paper in collaboration with our packaging 
operations to achieve the optimal result.  
We have increased our production of papers 
particularly suited to high quality packaging, 
such as white-top grades. 18 Strategic Report

OUR CUSTOMER SUPPLY CYCLE
DS Smith is a supply  
cycle strategist.
‘Supply chain’ only tells half  
the story and misses the bigger 
picture. For everything that  
goes one way in the chain, 
something moves the other  
way too. It’s a Supply Cycle.
Traceability, emissions… the biggest 
challenges of a supply chain are actually 
circular. When you start thinking about  
the whole cycle, you’re seeing the whole 
picture. Your thinking becomes more 
joined-up. More efficient. More integrated.
DRIVEN BY INNOVATION
We’re driven by anticipating and solving  
our customers’ problems. By using our 
expertise from design to production  
and supply to recycling, we can offer high 
quality, innovative solutions and great 
service that looks at the whole of their 
packaging needs, not just one part.
We call this Supply Cycle Thinking,  
it is a unified approach for every area of  
our business and it makes our customers’ 
lives easier by creating simplicity in 
otherwise complicated supply chains.

Definition
Proportion of orders fulfilled on-time, 
in-full, across all businesses.
Why is it a KPI?
This measures our commitment 
to high standards of service to 
customers. It is part of our aim 
to provide “more than a box”.
Performance
Service levels have remained 
relatively flat year-on-year. We  
remain committed to improving 
service and quality.
Definition
The number of lost-time accidents 
(LTAs) per million hours worked.
Why is it a KPI?
Safety is our highest priority. We  
aim to provide employees with a safe, 
productive and rewarding workplace. 
Performance
We are very pleased to have achieved 
a further 13 per cent reduction in  
AFR. We have also reduced our 
number of LTAs by 15 per cent. 182 
sites achieved our target of no LTAs  
in the year. We continue to strive to 
achieve this across the whole Group.
Definition
Volume of corrugated box products  
sold (excluding the effect of acquisitions 
and disposals) measured by area.
Why is it a KPI?
We target volume growth above  
GDP because we expect the market  
to favour recycled packaging and 
because we aim to win market share 
by delivering value to our customers 
across their supply chain.
Performance
For 2014/15, GDP for our regions, 
weighted by our sales in those regions, 
was 1.3 per cent (Source: Eurostat).
We are pleased to have delivered  
box volume growth of 3.1 per cent, 
which out-performs our target and 
the market. This has been achieved by 
growth in all our reporting regions, with 
particularly strong growth in Central 
Europe and Italy, a region in which  
we have expanded with the addition 
of Duropack on 31 May 2015.
Definition
Earnings before interest, tax, 
amortisation and exceptional  
items as a percentage of revenue.
Why is it a KPI?
The margin we achieve is a reflection 
of the value we deliver to our 
customers and our ability to charge 
for that value. It is also driven by our 
scale. A higher margin makes the 
profit more robust to adverse events. 
As set out in the Chief Executive’s 
Review, the Board has decided to 
raise this target by an additional  
100 basis points for the year  
2015/16 and onwards.
Performance
The business has achieved margin 
growth of 130 bps on a constant 
currency basis, or 120 bps on a 
reported basis, resulting in a  
margin at the top end of the  
historic target range. 
Definition
Earnings before interest, tax, 
amortisation and exceptional items  
as a percentage of average capital 
employed over the 12 month period.
Why is it a KPI?
Our target of 12–15 per cent, to be 
delivered throughout the economic 
cycle, is above our cost of capital. 
ROACE is a key measure of financial 
success and sustainability. ROACE 
reflects the returns available for 
investment in the business and 
servicing debt and equity. All 
investments and acquisition 
opportunities are assessed  
with reference to this target.
Performance
We have delivered further 
improvement on ROACE to 
 14.6 per cent, reflecting both  
the growth in profitability and  
an on-going disciplined approach  
to capital shown in the continued 
reduction in our working capital.
Definition
Net debt calculated at average  
FX rates for the year, over earnings 
before interest, tax, depreciation, 
amortisation and exceptional items 
for the preceding 12 month period.
Why is it a KPI?
Net debt/EBITDA is a key measure 
of balance sheet strength and 
financial stability.
Performance
The group has deleveraged in the  
year to under 1.5 times EBITDA, 
comfortably in our target range.  
This frees up capital to invest in  
the business. The acquisition of 
Duropack for €305 million and the 
disposal of StePac for US$31 million 
took place after the year-end.
Definition
Free cash flow before tax, net 
interest, growth capex, pension 
payments and exceptional cash 
flows as a percentage of earnings 
before interest, tax, amortisation 
and exceptional items.
Why is it a KPI?
We focus on cash conversion as part 
of our focus on capital management. 
The target of 120 per cent conversion 
was set five years ago, in the context 
of a business with high levels of 
working capital and immature cash 
control. Working capital as a percentage 
of revenue is now 2.7 per cent and the 
business is more mature. The Board 
have therefore decided to change the 
target to 100 per cent, for the year 
2015/16 and onwards. 
Performance
Cash conversion has remained  
in line with the target.
Definition
Total CO

material efficiency programmes.
Performance
CO

environmental performance
We have identified a number of key performance indicators to measure value creation, quantify our social 
impact and benchmark customer service. We have set testing medium-term targets. We aim to satisfy our 
four key stakeholders — customers, employees, shareholders and the environment — because we believe 
that this is the way to build a sustainable business.

Chief Executive's Review
We have momentum behind 
developing our business 
portfolio to enhance the 
quality of the business.
OVERVIEW
In the financial year 2014/15, DS Smith  
has again delivered strong underlying growth 
in volumes, margins, profits, returns and 
dividends, with all metrics well in line with  
our medium-term financial targets. At the 
same time as gaining market share through 
organic growth, we have delivered a series  
of acquisitions and disposals this year which 
help to focus the business on recycled 
packaging, and expand our geographic 
footprint and customer offering. We have 
also delivered against our non-financial  
key performance indicators, with further 
improvements in health and safety and  
in our environmental impact, reflecting  
our strategy of having a sustainable  
business model. 
Corrugated box volumes have increased  
by 3.1 per cent year-on-year, on a like-for-
like basis, with an acceleration in H2. All 
regions demonstrated positive progress, 
with particularly good growth in Central 
Europe and Italy. This is materially ahead  
of both our target of volume growth of  
GDP +1 per cent and the overall corrugated 
market in Europe, demonstrating how 
customers are continuing to move to  
DS Smith, reflecting our strength in 
innovation and design and the ability  
to deliver a pan-European solution for  
their packaging requirements. 
Miles Roberts
Group Chief Executive  Strategic Report 23
dssmith.com
In a market where the needs of consumers, 
retailers and our customers are constantly 
changing, we continue to focus on developing 
innovative solutions for our customers and  
the roll-out of our performance packaging 
programme. This utilises our unique proprietary 
technology , in order to provide high quality 
packaging for our customers on a consistent 
basis in the most cost -effective way.
For the full-year period, revenues increased 
by 1 per cent on a constant currency basis, 
despite a slight reduction from the net 
impact of acquisitions and disposals. 
Reported revenues reduced by 5 per cent 
due to foreign exchange (FX) translation  
of non-sterling revenues. Adjusted 
operating profit increased by 17 per cent  
on a constant currency basis to £335 million 
(9 per cent on a reported basis), driven by 
the contribution from the volume growth, 
our focus on higher value-added product 
and services to customers, together  
with the benefit of synergies from the  
SCA Packaging acquisition, where we  
have delivered the expected, final tranche 
of €40 million of synergies in the period. 
We have continued our strategy to  
licence certain of our technologies in a 
number of geographies worldwide. During 
the period, we entered into an agreement 
with Georgia-Pacific Corrugated LLC (GP), a 
major packaging company in North America, 
whereby GP licenses our technology for 
real-time monitoring and measurement of 
the quality and performance of packaging. 
We have an ongoing programme of opening 
our Impact and Packright design centres, 
where we bring together our innovation  
and design expertise to develop the best 
packaging solutions. The strength of our 
business model lies in our scale, as the 
design centres share expertise and a 
database of designs, which means 
customers receive the best solutions,  
while the cost of development is shared.  
To date we have rolled out 17 new or 
refurbished centres, which combined  
with existing design centres means  
we have 30 such centres across Europe.  
We expect to extend this to over 40 by  
the end of the 2015/16 financial year. 
Earnings per share increased by 24 per cent 
on a constant currency basis to 24.5 pence 
(14 per cent on a reported basis) (2013/14: 
21.4 pence). This result follows four prior 
years of consistent growth, with the 5-year 
compound annual growth rate for reported 
EPS being 34 per cent. 
The Board considers the dividend to be  
an important component of shareholder 
returns and, as such, has a policy to deliver  
a progressive dividend, where dividend 
cover is between 2.0 and 2.5 times, through 
the cycle. For the year 2014/15, the Board 
recommends a final dividend of 7 .7 pence, 
which together with the interim dividend of 
3.7 pence gives a total dividend for the year 
of 11.4 pence per share (2013/14: 10.0 pence 
per share). This represents an increase of  
14 per cent on the prior year and cover of  
2.1 times in relation to earnings per share 
(before amortisation and exceptional items). 
IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF THE 
BUSINESS BY INVESTMENT AND 
RESHAPING THE ASSET PORTFOLIO
DS Smith is ambitious to improve the quality 
and scale of our business. Scale is important 
as it allows us to invest in innovation and 
design, with the benefit shared throughout 
the business and across our customers.  
This results in a business that is able to  
lead the market in quality and innovation 
while remaining competitive on price and 
providing a full geographic reach, which 
together underpin our improvement in 
driving margins and returns. Allied to this  
is a focus on increasing the value-added 
products and services to our customers.
We have made significant further steps this 
year to expand our scale and improve the 
quality of the business through organic 
investment, acquisitions, and disposals. 
We increased our interest in Italmaceri,  
a recycling business in Italy, from 50 to  
100 per cent in July 2014, and bought a 
plastics manufacturing site in Croatia  
in September 2014. 
In November 2014 we acquired Andopack,  
a corrugated packaging business in  
Spain. We have been delighted with the  
customer reaction and the performance  
of the business, with volume growth 
significantly ahead of the Group average.
Since the year end we have completed  
our acquisition of Duropack, a corrugated 
packaging business with a market leading 
position in south eastern Europe. The 
reaction from customers and employees  
has been very positive and we look forward 
to integrating the business into the Group. 
  See p 19-21 for more information on our 
strategy and key performance indicators. 24 Strategic Report
Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Chief Executive's Review continued
During the year we have also acquired a  
small packaging consultancy business, 
serving global customers with operations  
in Europe, US and Asia. This expands our 
global reach and increases our capabilities in 
the analysis of packaging and its interaction 
with supply chains. We are adding additional 
capability in the US to offer greater packaging 
design consultancy and procurement 
services, on the back of existing customer 
contracts and strong demand for our services 
beyond Europe. We are very pleased with the 
positive reaction from our global customers 
to this new initiative. 
We have made a number of disposals of 
businesses that were not core to the 
Group’s strategy, including a Foams business 
in Scandinavia, in September 2014, and 
StePac, a specialist modified atmosphere 
packaging business, in May 2015, after the 
year end. We have also disposed of a paper 
mill at Nantes, France, in line with our 
strategy to reduce non-integrated paper 
manufacturing. 
We have continued to invest in our assets 
ahead of depreciation, with net capex of 
£149 million (2013/14: £156 million). 
Approximately three quarters of this 
expenditure has been in the corrugated 
packaging business, with growth 
expenditure focused on the regions  
where there is the greatest opportunity.  
For example, in the year, approximately a 
third of the growth capex in the packaging 
business was spent in Central Europe, with 
investment in our sites in Poland, Hungary, 
Czech Republic and Romania. 
DELIVERING ON OUR MEDIUM-TERM 
TARGETS AND KEY PERFORMANCE 
INDICATORS
We have made progress against our key 
performance indicators over the full-year 
with substantial improvement in our 
metrics. As set out above, corrugated box 
volumes grew by 3.1 per cent. This exceeded 
our target of GDP+1 per cent, with year-on-
year GDP growth, weighted by our sales in 
the markets in which we operate, estimated 
at 1.3 per cent (Source: Eurostat) resulting in 
a target of 2.3 per cent. We have delivered 
this growth across all our regions with a 
particularly strong contribution from Central 
Europe and Italy, which has benefited from 
our investment in the region as well as good 
growth in the markets. This performance 
reinforces our confidence in our investment 
in the Duropack business, which expands 
our geographic reach in the region, with the 
new business expected to increase our 
corrugated volumes in the region by circa 
one third. As a consequence of our strong 
volume growth, DS Smith has gained market 
share across Europe, where the overall 
corrugated packaging market has shown 
volume growth of 1.5 per cent (Source: 
FEFCO, May 2014 – April 2015).
Adjusted return on sales has increased by 
130 basis points on a constant currency 
basis to 8.8 per cent, at the upper end  
of our target range of 7 to 9 per cent, 
reflecting the improvement in profitability 
from our focus on higher value-added 
products and services, operational gearing 
and the final year of cost synergies from  
the acquisition of SCA Packaging, that have 
been achieved over the year as anticipated
Return on average capital employed has 
improved by 160 basis points to 14.6 per

upper end of our medium-term target  
range of 12 to 15 per cent and significantly 
above our cost of capital. The improvement 
is driven by our improved profitability  
and our continual focus on tight capital 
allocation and management within the 
business, including working capital, which 
has shown further improvement this year. 
Return on average capital employed is our 
primary financial measure of success, and  
is measured and calculated on a monthly 
basis. All senior management have part  
of their remuneration package linked  
to this measure. 
Net debt has decreased to £651 million 
(2013/14: £827 million) while net debt/
EBITDA (calculated in accordance with  
our banking covenant requirements) was 
1.49 times (2013/14: 1.96 times), in line  
with our medium-term financial KPI of  
a ratio of 2.0 times or below and reflecting 
ongoing tight cash management and  
control throughout the business. 
During the year the Group generated free 
cash flow of £307 million (2013/14: £140 
million). Cash conversion was 127 per cent,  
in line with our target. 
DS Smith is committed to providing all 
employees with a safe and productive 
working environment. We are pleased to 
report a further substantial improvement  
in our safety record, with our accident 
frequency rate reduced a further 13 per cent 
from 4.79 to 4.16, reflecting our ongoing 
commitment to best practice in health  
and safety. Our target is for zero accidents, 
which we are pleased to report that 182 
sites achieved this year, up from 138 in 
2013/14. We continue to strive to achieve 
zero accidents for the Group as a whole.
The Group has a target for customer service 
of 97 per cent on-time, in-full deliveries.  
In the year we achieved 92 per cent, broadly 
similar to the level achieved in the prior year. 
Standards of service, quality and innovation 
are key to our differentiation in the market. 
We are investing significantly in these areas, 
from design centres throughout Europe, to 
the roll-out of our performance packaging 
methodology, in order to continue to lead 
the industry in this field. 
DS Smith is part of the sustainable economy, 
with our principal product of corrugated 
packaging fully recyclable, and substantially 
constructed from recycled material, as are 
many of our plastic packaging products. Our 
Recycling business works with customers 
across Europe to improve their recycling 
operations and overall environmental 
performance. We have invested in improved 
environmental tracking systems with far 
more detail now available, as set out in 
greater detail in our Sustainability Report 
2015. CO

 equivalent emissions, relative  
to production, have reduced by 2 per cent,  
and we are on target to achieve our 2010 
commitment to a 20 per cent reduction  
by 2020. 
UPDATED MEDIUM-TERM  
TARGETS AND FINANCIAL KEY 
PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
We believe that scale brings benefits for 
customers and for our shareholders. Five 
years ago, for the year ended 30 April 2010, 
DS Smith reported a return on sales of  
4.5 per cent. In December 2010 the Board 
set a medium-term target of 6–8 per cent, 
and raised that to 7–9 per cent following the 
disposal of Spicers in 2011. Having achieved 
a full-year return on sales of 8.8 per cent 
this year, near the top of that range, the 
Board consider it appropriate to raise this 
sustainable medium-term target by an 
additional 100 basis points. 
In relation to cash conversion, the target 
level of 120 per cent was also set in 2010, 
when, inter alia, working capital was a 
substantially higher proportion of revenue 
than its current level of 2.7 per cent.  
The Board therefore believes that the 
appropriate cash conversion ratio for the 
business going forward, having achieved 
the target of 120 per cent or above for the 
prior five years, is 100 per cent or above. 
This reflects the structural working capital 
reductions achieved and the maturity of  
the current business. 
OUTLOOK
The current year has started well, with 
momentum in volumes continuing. We also 
have momentum behind developing our 
business portfolio to improve the quality of 
our business. We have been delighted with 
the positive customer reaction to our recent 
acquisitions. The progress we continue to 
make with global customers, together with 
the opportunities we see for growth as we 
expand our international reach and offering, 
gives us confidence to increase our medium-
term margin target by 100 basis points, and, 
notwithstanding the continued challenging 
market environment, we remain excited 
about the prospects for the business.

The UK has seen modest volume growth in a competitive market 
environment and challenging retail landscape. Revenues have fallen 
by 3 per cent, in part reflecting reduced external sales from recycling. 
The UK business has been leading the development of our 
performance packaging processes, requiring close collaboration 
between our paper and our packaging operations, with this rolled 
out throughout the UK. Profitability has improved by £17 million 
through a combination of improvements in both the packaging  
and the paper operations, resulting in a significant uplift of 210  
basis points to our margin. In packaging, we have focused on  
higher value-added contracts, driving the performance packaging 
initiatives, and the delivery of cost initiatives. In our paper 
operations, we saw an improved performance from the Kemsley  
mill in Kent in the first half of the year, where applying best practice 
from our European mills has resulted in an improvement in efficiency 
and profitability of this site. In the second half of the year there was 
some adverse impact to the business from the increased strength 
of sterling on trading from the UK to continental Europe.

businesses. Adjusted operating profit grew by 8 per cent on a 
constant currency basis with a 90 basis point increase in margin, 
reflecting organic profit development as the investments made in the 
business in 2013/14 were put into service. In the flexible packaging 
segment of the business, continued double digit growth of the 
beverage dispensing tap business in the US was partially offset by  
the gradual start-up of new facilities in Europe. Demand for flexible 
packaging continues to grow through new product offerings and new 
markets served, in addition to a better service offering in Europe. 
The rigid transit packaging segment, based in Europe, had a very 
strong year. Revenue increased by 8 per cent over the prior year on

OVERVIEW
The Group’s strong performance in 2014/15 
was achieved against an ongoing backdrop of 
challenging economic and market conditions, 
particularly in continental Europe, where the 
euro has weakened by around 13 per cent 
and deflation has appeared in a number of 
our markets. The SCA Packaging business  
has now been fully integrated and the 
strength of our business model is a reflection 
of the efforts made by the whole team  
and the traction that this is having with  
our customers. This year we responded  
to customer demand and acquired the 
Andopack business in Spain in order  
to establish a manufacturing presence  
and position to grow from in the Iberian 
Peninsula. Shortly after the year end we 
completed the acquisition of the Duropack 
group of companies in south eastern Europe 
which has an established market leading 
position in these high growth economies.  
In addition, we have continued to actively 
manage our asset base by disposing of a 
Foams business in Scandinavia, a paper mill  
in Nantes, France and the StePac business  
in Israel, which completed shortly after the 
year end. The disposals represent businesses 
which we have determined will either not 
grow further without significant investment 
or do not have natural synergies with our core 
portfolio and we can reinvest the proceeds  
in higher returning investments such as 
restructuring our manufacturing footprint  
in Germany and the UK, or relocating our 
European Flexible Plastics business to 
eastern Europe. During the year the Group 
refinanced the SCA Packaging acquisition 
finance, obtained an investment grade credit 
rating from Standard and Poor 's (BBB-Stable) 
and agreed with pension trustees to maintain 
contributions at current levels following the 
triennial valuation.

TRADING RESULTS
All numbers within this review are based on 
continuing operations before amortisation 
and exceptional items, with any comment 
and comparable analysis based on constant 
currency, unless otherwise stated. 
Group revenue of £3,820 million was 5 per 
cent lower than the prior year (2013/14: 
£4,035 million) with exchange effects, 
particularly the weakening of the euro 
throughout the year, having a significant 
impact (£236 million). On a like-for-like 
constant currency basis, after adjusting  
for acquisitions and disposals, underlying 
revenue grew by £29 million, up 1 per cent.
The growth in revenue was underpinned  
by corrugated box volume growth across 
Europe of 3.1 per cent, partially offset  
by the effects of lower paper prices, 
particularly in the first half of the year. 
Plastics revenue declined by 2 per cent  
as the restructuring of the Flexibles 
business was implemented and a platform 
for future growth was established.
Adjusted operating profit rose by 9 per cent 
to £335 million (2013/14: £307 million),  
17 per cent on a constant currency basis, 
with exchange effects estimated to have  
an impact of about £21 million. Whilst the 
business has benefitted from the balance of 
the SCA Packaging synergies of €40 million, 
or £31 million, bringing the total delivered  
to €120 million, as previously announced, it  
has also been impacted by deflation in a few 
markets. Input cost benefits were balanced 
by sales price reductions, with organic 
growth in corrugated box volumes 
contributing the majority of the further 
improvement in profit.
Amortisation for the year was £46 million 
(2013/14: £51 million). Depreciation of £117 
million is slightly lower than the prior year 
(2013/14: £123 million) due to the impact  
of foreign exchange. New investments in 
machinery have increased depreciation and 
maintenance costs by around £13 million; 
these have been partially offset by a 
reduction from the finalisation of the  
SCA Packaging fair value work which 
culminated in a comprehensive review  
of asset lives on a consistent basis, which 
had a c. £7 million impact.
The Group’s measures of return on sales  
and return on average capital employed 
have seen improvements in the current  
year and both are towards the top end of 
their target ranges. Return on sales is 8.8 
per cent (target range of 7-9 per cent), 
whilst return on average capital employed  
is 14.6 per cent (target range of 12-15 per 
cent). As noted earlier, return on average 
capital employed is significantly above  
the Group cost of capital. The Board has 
reviewed the medium-term targets and  
has decided to raise the return on sales 
target by 100 basis point whilst retaining 
the return on average capital employed 
range as it is, to reflect the short-term 
impact which results from the acquisition  
of new businesses. 
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
Exceptional items before tax and share  
of results of associates were £44 million 
(2013/14: £38 million).
Exceptional items comprise of restructuring 
initiatives totalling £47 million, which have 
been concentrated in UK and German 
Packaging businesses, and on the 
infrastructure necessary to support  
the Group’s growth and development.  
These costs have been partially offset  
by utilisation of provisions made on the  
SCA Packaging acquisition. Acquisition  
and disposal activity has generated a 
further £4 million of exceptional costs.  
This charge also includes costs incurred  
in respect of the post-balance sheet date 
acquisition of Duropack. 
Gains on the disposal of the Scandinavian 
Foam business and the step-up acquisition 
of the Italian recycling business amounted 
to £6 million, and were offset by the loss  
on disposal of the Nantes mill of £9 million 
and other costs of £2 million. 
Unamortised finance costs amounting  
to £4 million relating to the refinancing  
of the SCA Packaging acquisition finance.
Exchange losses on the Ukrainian associate 
of £7 million, as the Hryvian weakened 
against the US dollar (the currency in  
which the associate's debt is denominated), 
have been recognised as exceptional.
In 2015/16, exceptional costs of £40 million 
are expected to be incurred, principally 
relating to the acquisition and integration of 
Duropack and other one-off restructuring 
projects in our packaging business.
INTEREST, TAX AND EARNINGS  
PER SHARE
Net interest expense before exceptionals 
has reduced from £41 million in 2013/14

On 10 July 2014 the 50 per cent of  
Italmaceri not previously owned was 
acquired. The Italmaceri recycling business 
operates in northern Italy with annual 
volumes of approximately 500k tonnes.  
On 9 September 2014 Kaplast, an injection-
moulding business in Croatia, was acquired, 
to expand the returnable transit packaging 
element of the Plastics business. On  
6 November 2014, the acquisition of 
Andopack, a corrugated manufacturing 
business in Spain, was completed for  
£39 million (including acquired debt of  
£28 million). The business operates from  
a single well-invested site with considerable 
scope to grow the business by serving the 
Group's pan-European customers based in 
this large market. 
On 2 September 2014 the Scandinavian 
Foams business, which the Group had 
acquired as part of the SCA Packaging 
acquisition, was disposed of for £22 million, 
realising a gain of £3 million.
Following the binding offer received on  
20 November 2014, the small paper mill  
in Nantes, France with annual capacity  
of c. 60k tonnes of testliner was disposed  
of, with a loss on disposal of £9 million.  
This disposal was in-line with our strategy  
to increase our “short” paper position. 
Subsequent to the year end, on 31 May 2015, 
the acquisition of Duropack, a recycled 
corrugated packaging business with 
market-leading positions across south 
eastern Europe, was completed for €305 
million, including debt acquired of €100 
million, subject to post-closing working 
capital adjustments.
On 18 May 2015, the Group completed  
the sale of StePac, a specialist modified 
atmosphere packaging business based  
in Israel, for US$31 million, subject to 
post-closing working capital adjustments.
Adjusted earnings per share were  
24.5 pence (2013/14: 21.4 pence), an  
increase of 14 per cent. T otal earnings per 
share were 16.6 pence (2013/14: 15.0 pence).
DIVIDEND
The proposed final dividend is 7 .7 pence 
(2013/14: 6.8 pence), giving a total dividend 
for the year of 11.4 pence (2013/14: 10.0 
pence). Dividend cover before amortisation 
and exceptional items was 2.1 times in 
2014/15 (2013/14: 2.1 times).
ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS
The Group's strategic aim is to grow its 
consumer packaging businesses to meet the 
requirements of its major customers. The 
focus on the overall “short” paper position 
remains, with ongoing investment in paper 
mills which produce high quality lightweight 
papers and further reduction in exposure to 
those that do not. Acquisition and disposal 
activity has intensified in the year, with 
three acquisitions and two disposals. Since 
the year end a further acquisition and 
disposal have been completed.
as further working capital initiatives have 
delivered results. The employment benefit 
net finance expense was £6 million  
(2013/14: £7 million). 
Profit before tax (excluding amortisation, 
exceptional items and share of profit of 
associates) was £297 million (2013/14:  
£259 million), an increase of 15 per cent  
on a reported basis.
The share of the results of equity  
accounted investments includes the 
previously described exceptional exchange 
loss of £7 million on US dollar denominated 
debt in the Ukrainian associate.
The Group’s effective tax rate, excluding 
amortisation, exceptional items and 
associates was 23 per cent, consistent  
with the prior year. The exceptional tax  
credit was £10 million. 
Reported profit after tax after amortisation 
and exceptional items was £156 million 
(2013/14: £144 million).

The covenant calculations exclude from the 
income statement exceptional items and 
any interest arising from the defined benefit 
pension schemes. The calculation of net 
assets excludes the net asset or liability 
arising from the defined benefit pension 
schemes. At 30 April 2015, the Group had 
substantial headroom under its covenants; 
the most sensitive covenant is net debt to 
EBITDA and this had an EBITDA headroom  
of £243 million.
ENERGY COSTS
Energy continued to be a significant cost  
for the Group in 2014/15. The Group’s  
total costs for gas, electricity and diesel 
decreased from £241 million in 2013/14  
to £187 million in 2014/15, a 22 per cent 
decrease, with the benefits of capital 
invested in CHP facilities, currency 
translation, lower prices and energy 
efficiency initiatives all contributing.  
The Group continues to manage the risks 
associated with its purchases of energy 
through its Energy Procurement Group.  
By hedging energy costs with suppliers  
and financial institutions we aim to reduce 
the volatility of energy costs and to provide 
the Group with a degree of certainty over 
future energy costs. Given the significant 
reduction in spot natural gas prices, 
particularly last summer, the hedging 
strategy removed opportunities to benefit 
from the lowest possible prices. 
CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND 
TREASURY MANAGEMENT
The Group funds its operations from the 
following sources of capital: operating  
cash flow, borrowings, finance and 
operating leases, shareholders’ equity and, 
where appropriate, disposals of non-core 
businesses. The Group’s objective is to 
achieve a capital structure that results in an 
appropriate cost of capital whilst providing 
flexibility in short and medium-term funding 
so as to accommodate material investments 
of £28 million comprised Andopack, 
Italmaceri and the Kaplast businesses. 
The dividend pay-out was £94 million, 
reflecting the payment in 2014/15 of the 
interim and final dividend for 2013/14. 
T otal Group cash inflow for the year was  
£154 million, compared to an outflow of  
£27 million in the prior year. Net debt acquired 
was £30 million. Exchange and other 
movements reduced net debt by £52 million.
STATEMENT OF  
FINANCIAL POSITION
Shareholders’ funds of £1,018 million at  
30 April 2015 have reduced from £1,131 
million at 30 April 2014, principally due  
to exchange losses, actuarial losses and 
dividends, partially offset by retained  
profit for the year. Profit attributable to 
shareholders was £156 million (2013/14: 
£141 million) and dividends of £94 million 
(2013/14: £74 million) were paid during the 
year. In addition, actuarial losses of £65 
million from the Group’s employee benefit 
schemes were charged to reserves. Other 
items recognised directly in reserves include 
currency translation losses of £105 million, 
favourable movements on cash flow hedges 
of £5 million and the related tax charge of 
£12 million. 
At 30 April 2015, the Group’s net debt was 
£651 million (30 April 2014: £827 million). 
The Group improved its net debt to earnings 
before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation (EBITDA) ratio from 1.96 times 
at 30 April 2014 to 1.49 times at 30 April 
2015 and complied with all the covenants  
in its financing agreements. The Group’s 
financial covenants for the syndicated 
committed bank facilities specify an  
CASH FLOW
Net debt ended the year significantly lower 
than the prior year at £651 million (30 April 
2014: £827 million). Working capital 
management continues to be a major focus 
for the business. The current year inflow of 
£101 million reflects a continuation of tight 
working capital management, particularly  
of trade receivables and trade payables.  
A number of inventory reduction initiatives 
have commenced, the results of which 
should flow through over the next 12 
months. The structuring of the Group's debt 
to be aligned with the currency of operations 
benefited net debt by £68 million driven 
mainly by the weaker euro. The business has 
continued to invest in capital expenditure 
with net costs (after disposal proceeds of 
£18 million) of £149 million (2013/14: £156 
million). The Group strikes a balance between 
expenditure on asset renewal/replacement 
and investment in growth and efficiency, 
with the latter amounting to about 52 per 
cent of the total expenditure. Disposals 
included £6 million of surplus property assets 
(2013/14: £3 million) realising profits of £6 
million (2013/14: £5 million).
Net interest payments of £34 million were 
£9 million lower than the prior year and 
were broadly in line with the net finance 
expense. Tax paid of £28 million was 
significantly lower than the prior year 
(2013/14: £55 million) primarily due to 
refunds secured in a number of regions and 
a greater focus on the timing of payments. 
Cash costs of exceptional items amounted 
to £49 million representing the cash 
investment in restructuring and 
infrastructure. Disposals of businesses 
realised £18 million, whilst acquisitions

or acquisitions. The Group also aims to 
maintain a strong balance sheet and to 
provide continuity of financing by having  
a range of maturities and borrowings  
from a variety of sources, supported  
by its investment grade credit rating. 
The Group’s overall treasury objectives are 
to ensure that sufficient funds are available 
for the Group to carry out its strategy and  
to manage certain financial risks to which 
the Group is exposed.
The Group regularly reviews the level of 
cash and debt facilities required to fund its 
activities. At 30 April 2015, the Group’s 
committed borrowing facilities totalled  
c. £1.4 billion of which £649 million were 
undrawn. Total gross borrowings at 30 April 
2015 were £783 million. At 30 April 2015, 
the Group’s committed borrowing facilities 
had a weighted-average maturity of  
4.6 years (30 April 2014: 3.3 years).
During the year the Group refinanced its 
committed bank borrowing facilities. The 
syndicated term loan facility, under which 
€380 million was outstanding at 30 April 
2014, was repaid on 23 May 2014, and 
replaced with a €300 million syndicated bank 
term loan facility maturing in May 2017 . In 
addition, on the same date, the £610 million 
syndicated revolving credit facility was 
repaid and replaced with a £800 million 
syndicated bank revolving credit facility 
maturing in 2019, but with options to extend 
this facility to 2021. Since the year end the 
maturity of this facility has been extended to 
May 2020. The year-on-year interest saving, 
assuming the previous facilities were fully 
drawn at all times is £5 million.
The Group also obtained an investment 
grade credit rating from Standard and Poor's 
(BBB-Stable) which reflects the strong credit 
metrics of the Group and the financial 
discipline of management. This credit rating 
allows the Group to issue investment grade 
bonds in the public debt markets.
IMPAIRMENT
When applying IAS 36 (Impairment of 
Assets), the Group compares the carrying 
amounts of goodwill and intangible assets 
with the higher of their net realisable value 
and their value-in-use to determine 
whether an impairment exists. The value-in-
use is calculated by discounting the future 
cash flows expected to be generated by the 
assets or group of assets being tested for 
impairment. During April 2015 tests were 
undertaken to determine whether there 
had been any impairment to the balance 
sheet carrying values of goodwill and other 
intangible assets. The key assumptions 
behind the calculations are based on the 
regional long-term growth rates and a 
pre-tax discount rate of 9.5 per cent 
combined with the appropriate country 
risk premiums. No impairments were 
identified as a result of the testing.
The net book value of goodwill and other 
intangibles at 30 April 2015 was £855 
million (30 April 2014: £961 million).
PENSIONS
IAS 19 (Employee Benefits), requires the 
Group to make assumptions including,  
but not limited to, rates of inflation,  
discount rates and current and future  
life expectancies. The use of different 
assumptions could have a material effect on 
the accounting values of the relevant assets 
and liabilities, which in turn could result in  
a change to the cost of such liabilities as 
recognised in the income statement over 
time. The assumptions involved are subject 
to periodic review. 
The Group’s principal funded, defined 
benefit pension scheme is in the UK and is 
closed to future accrual. The Group also 
operates various local post-retirement and 
other employee benefit arrangements for 
overseas operations, as well as a small UK 
unfunded scheme. The aggregate gross 
assets of the schemes at 30 April 2015 were 
£1,002 million and the gross liabilities at  
30 April 2015 were £1,202 million, resulting 
in the recognition of a gross balance sheet 
deficit of £200 million (30 April 2014: £151 
million), a net deficit of £152 million (30 April 
2014: £111 million) after a deferred tax asset 
of £48 million (30 April 2014: £40 million).
A triennial valuation of the main UK scheme 
was carried out at 30 April 2013 at which 
point the Group agreed to maintain cash 
contributions at £16 million per annum.  
Cash contributions into the Group pension 
schemes were £17 million in 2014/15 
(2013/14: £19 million), principally  
comprising £16 million in respect of  
the agreed contributions to the pension 
scheme deficit (for the future financing  
of the pension scheme) and are included  
in cash generated from operations. 
The increase in the gross balance sheet 
deficit of £49 million is principally attributable 
to a decrease in the discount rate. The main 
factor behind this decrease is the fall in 
corporate bond yields over the period.

Sustainability
SUSTAINABILITY AT DS SMITH 
The past year has been transformative in 
regard to DS Smith's capabilities in the 
sustainability sphere. Our business model 
has long been based on providing inherently 
sustainable packaging solutions for our 
customers; something we feel necessary 
for good corporate citizenship. Over the 
previous 12 months, we have aligned our 
activity and engagement more closely with 
the requirements of our customers, and we 
have recognised that as a B2B supplier to 
some of the world's most famous brands  
we have an opportunity to aid them achieve 
their environmental objectives and social 
purpose. We continue to emphasise the  
role that recycling has to play within a 
sustainable supply cycle. Our core business 
remains the design and manufacture of 
recycled packaging for consumer goods.  
We measure and report the direct 
environmental impacts of our factories and 
production facilities, however we are now 
better able to assess our indirect impacts: 
upstream through our sourcing activities, 
and downstream in the way our customers 
utilise our products and the way consumers 
dispose of them. We have expanded our 
capacity to work with our customers to 
reduce the carbon footprints of their 
products throughout their supply cycle by 
ensuring the right packaging solution is 
provided to them. We have also expanded 
our capacity to provide bespoke reporting 
on the role our products play in their supply 
cycles — both positive and negative —  
and in 2014 we published our inaugural 
Sustainability Report.
  For an in-depth analysis of our material 
issues, and our environmental performance 
and policies, refer to our website  
dssmith.com/company/sustainability/
OUR PRINCIPLES 
We remain committed to conducting  
our business in a responsible manner.  
We believe that delighting our customers 
and ensuring our employees operate in a 
safe and productive workplace is the only 
sustainable route to the long-term creation 
of value for our shareholders. DS Smith 
subscribes to a number of international 
standards and guidelines relevant to 
corporate responsibility and business 
conduct, including:
• United Nations Global Compact;
• United Nations Declaration of Human 
Rights and the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child;
• International Labour Organisation eight 
Fundamental Conventions; and
• Organisation for Economic Co-operation 
and Development Guidelines for 
Multinational Enterprises.
In addition, DS Smith has reported its 
greenhouse gas emissions and climate 
change risks to CDP since 2006, and in 
February 2015 it became a corporate 
member of SEDEX.
SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE 
The Board considers risks arising from 
sustainability issues as one of the key risks 
to the Group’s operations. It ensures that 
the Group has in place effective policies and 
procedures for managing any significant 
sustainability risks and it receives regular 
reports on performance. The Group Chief 
Executive is responsible for sustainability 
issues. The Group Sustainability Committee 
oversees the management of these 
processes, and establishes targets and 
strategies for sustainability risks and 
opportunities. Through the Group 
Management Team, policy is communicated 
to the heads of each business unit, and 
compliance with these policies is monitored 
throughout the year.
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT 
AND REGULATION 
The Group has a governance structure in 
place to consider carbon emissions, energy 
usage, water consumption, waste and 
product responsibility. Each production site 
is required to implement an environmental 
management system which is appropriate 
to its level of activity. At present, 119 
manufacturing sites have an ISO 14001 
certification. The Energy Efficiency Directive 
2012/27/EU has led to many production 
sites in a number of regions pursuing the  
ISO 50001 certification for energy 
management. We are evaluating whether 
the benefits of such a programme extend 
beyond compliance, and if proven to be 
effective we will widen the scope of this 
initiative to all regions. Each production site 
that converts or trades in wood fibre or 
other wood derivative products is mandated 
to pursue a recognised certification 
programme leading to a chain of custody for 
responsible fibre sourcing. Once complete, 
this will result in 100 per cent of relevant 
production sites holding a certification  
from a credible external body.
FTSE Group confirms that DS Smith  
has been independently assessed 
according to the FTSE4Good criteria,  
and has satisfied the requirements to 
remain a constituent of the FTSE4Good 
Index Series. Companies in the 
FTSE4Good Index Series have met 
stringent environmental, social and 
governance criteria, and  are positioned 
to capitalise on the benefits of 
responsible business practice.

With the exception of one effluent spillage 
at our Clay Cross site on 3 February 2015, 
which resulted in a warning letter from the 
United Kingdom Environment Agency on 30 
March 2015, no other major environmental 
incidents or incidents of significant impact 
reportable to local or national authorities,  
or incidents potentially resulting in legal 
prosecution have been reported for the 
period of this report.
OUR ENVIRONMENTAL TARGETS 
For 2014/15, our environmental targets 
have remained unchanged. Relative to 
production, we aim to:
• Reduce our CO
2
 equivalent (CO
2
 e) 
emissions from fossil fuels by 20 per cent 
over the 10 years to 2020;
• Reduce our water usage in our paper 
mills by 20 per cent over the 10 years  
to 2020; and
• Reduce the amount of production rejects 
sent to landfill by 20 per cent over the  
10 years to 2020.
These targets are supported by ongoing 
action plans. Since 2013, we have 
incorporated additional greenhouse gases 
in our data in accordance with statutory 
requirements, and now express this target 
in terms of CO
2
e. We are pleased to have 
achieved a reduction in our overall CO
2
e 
emissions per tonne. Our scope 1 emissions 
have increased as a consequence of our 
acquisition of the Combined Heat and Power 
(CHP) installation at our paper mill in Italy, 
which resulted in a corresponding drop in 
scope 2 emissions. Another consequence  
of this has been a greater power generation 
capacity, and a resultant increase in exports 
of electricity to the grid, which have also 
contributed to an overall reduction in 
absolute emissions apportioned to internal 
production. The large impact of the CHP 
installations at our paper mills masks the 
many improvements across our packaging 
and plastics plants which are of a smaller 
scale but are nevertheless important. Of the 
155 sites where a year-on-year comparison  
is possible, 102 have achieved reductions  
in absolute scope 1 emissions. This is the 
consequence of greater production 
efficiency and continued investments  
in more efficient boilers. Analysis of our 
performance in reducing scope 2 emissions 
tells a similar story, with 79 sites achieving 
an absolute reduction. This has largely been 
driven by initiatives to replace halogen 
lighting with LED lighting. 
The figure for total production volume,  
used to normalise our total emissions, water 
and waste figures, has reduced slightly since 
the previous year. This is primarily due to 
consolidation of our assets and a shift in 
business mix. A number of recycling depots 
were closed during 2014, and this has 
outweighed increases in production in our 
packaging and paper making businesses. As a 
result, our emissions per tonne figure is lower 
than the improvement in absolute values.
This has also affected the amount of 
effluent water we have discharged. In 
absolute terms, there was an increase due 
to record production across a number of 
paper mills, but the overall denominator of  
all production across the Group results in a 
worsened figure for our target, taken on a 
like-for-like basis. As indicated last year, this 
particular target is becoming less relevant as 
we focus more closely on the role water and 
steam play as carriers and stores of thermal 
energy. Future efforts will concentrate on 
reducing water throughput per tonne of 
production, and in the coming year this is 
likely to result in a recalibrated target.
As our business mix across Europe 
continues to evolve, the impact of those 
operations which still rely on landfill will 
become even further diluted, and our 
original waste to landfill target will 
increasingly also lose its relevance  
at a Group level. For this reason, in our 
Sustainability Report we will publish 
absolute values, by country, and establish 
site-specific targets to achieve zero waste 
to landfill in a timeframe that is feasible 
based on local waste management capacity 
and legislative requirements.
ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE 
INDICATORS 
We collect environmental data on a monthly 
basis, and report this data for the previous 
calendar year in order to align with the 
generally accepted practice of industry 
peers and external stakeholders. This  
aids sector and industry benchmarking. 
Emissions figures given in this report are 
therefore all on a calendar year basis. The 
environmental performance data table 
overleaf displays the data for calendar year 
2014 together with the data previously 
reported for calendar year 2013.
DS SMITH CHARITABLE FOUNDATION
DS Smith is proud to have established the DS Smith Charitable Foundation. The purpose 
of the Charitable Foundation is to support with donations, charities with values aligned 
to those of DS Smith, in particular, charities that support the environment. As a large 
employer with a responsibility to the communities in which we operate, the Charitable 
Foundation also supports charities which help train young people and assist them into work.

Methodology 
1  DS Smith collects and reports environmental data in accordance with the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP), to the extent that this is practicable.
2  The figures reported above include data from all the Group’s wholly-owned or majority-owned manufacturing operations. Of the 89 sites whose production process requires fossil fuels  
(paper mills, corrugating plants and foam plants), actual consumption figures were available for all sites. The total figures also include emissions data from a further 81 smaller production 
facilities that use only grid electricity.
3  T h e C O 2 and CO 2 e emissions were calculated using the UK Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs 2014 emissions factors. The factors used for converting grid electricity reflect  
the mix of fuels used for electricity generation in each country.
4  Scope 3 emissions, from sources external to DS Smith but involved in the supply chains for the Group’s products and services, are not included.
5  The waste figures relate to waste generated by our operations; they do not include waste collected from third-parties as a raw material by our recycling operations.
6  Production is defined as sum of the production output in tonnes from each site whose energy, waste and water consumption is reported above.
7  The combined heat and power plant that supplies Witzenhausen with steam is fired predominantly by biogenic fuels. The emission factor for this site has been estimated as 92.019 kg/MWh of CO 2 e.
Verification Statement from Bureau Veritas UK Ltd 
Bureau Veritas UK has been commissioned by DS Smith Plc. (DS Smith) for the seventh year to provide an independent 
opinion on the Environmental Performance Indicators presented on this page of its 2015 Annual Report. Having completed 
a process of assessment including site visits, document review and interrogation of associated management and reporting 
systems, Bureau Veritas concludes that there is no evidence to suggest that the data presented here is not a fair and 
accurate representation of DS Smith’s performance. 
DS Smith should be commended on its approach to consistent data collection and the work which has been undertaken this year to 
ensure that there is a good understanding of associated processes across the company both at a Group and a site level. It remains  
clear that DS Smith is constantly looking to improve its internal processes and has proactively engaged in the verification process.

T o achieve our strategic goal to 
realise the potential of our people, 
we are committed to creating a 
working environment where our 
people are proud and able to do 
their best. 
A clear and primary focus of these efforts  
is on making sure that our people are safe  
at work and you will find more information 
on our Health and Safety initiatives and 
performance in the next section. 
In addition to safety, we focus our efforts  
to create this working environment in three 
main areas:
Engaging our people in what we are 
trying to achieve as a business
OWN IT!
Over the past four years, teams throughout 
DS Smith have used the OWN IT! programme 
as a vehicle to discuss the strategy and our 
ambition to become a leader in our industry. 
During 2014/15 we have supplemented our 
employee communications offering in order 
to keep people updated on our progress  
and aims. This has included the continued 
development of our intranet platform both 
in the quality of content and its accessibility 
for employees who do not work on 
computers every day. 
As well as looking at what we want to 
achieve as a business, OWN IT! also provides 
tools to the business to facilitate discussions 
about how we are going to achieve those 
ambitions, making particular reference to our 
corporate values: Be Caring, Be Challenging, 
Be T rusted, Be Responsive and Be T enacious. 
As a consequence, the values have been built 
into the performance management process 
to enable employees to understand how 
they are expected to behave and how  
they can improve in the way they work. 
CORPORATE SOCIAL 
RESPONSIBILITY
We have also taken steps, as a leading 
company, to demonstrate what our 
corporate values mean to the 
communities in which we operate  
and the wider world:
Be caring
We have held open days at 91 sites 
across the globe and invited friends, 
family and neighbours to visit our 
production sites to understand better 
what we do and to experience  
our corporate culture first hand.
Be responsive
We have been responsive to the major 
issue of youth unemployment in Europe 
by joining the Alliance for YOUth, initiated 
by Nestlé. As a partner in the alliance  
we are increasing the level of support 
and opportunity we offer young people 
through CV clinics and work experience.
Be challenging
We have been challenging to the way 
green spaces have been treated in  
our local communities. Through our 
sponsorship and volunteering as part  
of the Keep Britain Tidy ‘Green Flag 
award’ we are clearing, maintaining  
and recognising the best green spaces 
whether urban or rural, especially  
those close to our own operations.

Embracing differing opinions and 
finding the best way forward
Employee Survey
In October 2014 we ran our third Group-
wide employee survey, asking our 
colleagues to share their views on their  
role, their workplace and their managers. 
With a response rate of 81 per cent there 
was strong participation in the process  
from our employees. The extensive data 
obtained from this survey is invaluable for 
the prioritisation of our activities and 
measurement of our initiatives.
The main areas for improvement which  
we are focusing on are:
• Performance Management: the 
completion of quality performance 
appraisals, at least once a year, for all 
employees is mandatory and should  
be supplemented by regular informal 
feedback (both positive and constructive 
challenge) from line managers.
• Communication: building on our existing 
employee engagement activities under 
the banner of OWN IT!, we seek to 
continue the development of skills, 
channels and our culture to allow the 
open exchange of ideas and information 
between individuals and teams.
• Recognition: we are working on  
solutions to improve the identification, 
encouragement and reinforcement  
of exemplary behaviours and high 
performance throughout the business.
These areas for improvement will be the 
main priorities in the coming 12 months but 
we will be adopting a balanced approach and 
following up on all the topics covered in the 
survey, collecting feedback through pulse 
surveys and providing quarterly updates  
to our people on actions taken. 
Diversity
The employee survey is a formal exercise to 
bring together the diverse opinions of all our 
employees on a range of topics. However, 
we recognise and value the importance of 
diverse thinking in our workforce at all times 
to strengthen our decision making and 
creative processes so that we can provide 
innovative solutions to our customers. 
DS Smith is an equal opportunities employer 
and is firmly committed to both the principle 
and realisation of equality as set out in our 
Code of Conduct. Recruiting for talent within 
an equal opportunity environment, we also 
take good care of the complementarity of 
profiles that will form our teams, and whilst 
personalities are all individual, we strive to 
ensure that people’s own values will be 
consistent with the DS Smith values.
Involving our people in developing 
themselves and the business
A fundamental element of the workplace 
experience that we are creating is the 
involvement of people in developing 
solutions and not just identifying problems. 
Engaging Managers Programme
Feedback from the business informed  
us that our managers needed more  
support to fulfil the people management 
responsibilities within their role. As a 
consequence, a course was developed  
by our in-house HR teams to provide that 
support to managers throughout DS Smith. 
The "Engaging Managers" programme is 
focused on understanding and role 
modelling the values, communication  
skills and emotional intelligence; it equips 
managers with the framework to review 
situations and make decisions about the 
right course of action, not just follow a 
playbook. Having been thoroughly tested 
with focus groups of line managers from 
around DS Smith, internal trainers and 
facilitators have been trained to deliver  
the course covering diverse languages, 
cultural and business groups. The end result 
is a course that drives engagement of the 
managers themselves, equips them to 
engage their teams and builds the corporate 
culture around our values. We will be rolling 
this out over the next two years, helping to 
ensure representation is strong for the 
most under-represented groups in our 
senior management.

HEALTHY HEARTS
Since DS Smith launched the “Healthy 
Heart Mark” employee campaign in the  
UK in January 2014, over 1,300 employees 
have received an individual lifestyle check 
providing workers with the opportunity  
to have their blood pressure, cholesterol 
levels, BMI and waist measurements 
checked and ask questions about their 
lifestyle habits.
In addition, four sites have already  
been presented with Bronze Awards  
in recognition of their efforts by Heart 
Research UK. To achieve the Bronze 
Award, sites have to demonstrate that 
they are promoting and educating their 
employees on the benefits of making  
the right lifestyle choices. 
There are many initiatives being run  
at all the UK packaging sites but here  
are a few of them: 
• At Belper they offer “healthy options” 
within their canteen and all sites now 
offer free fruit one day per week. 
• Our Lockerbie site is running a  
Weight Loss Club.
• At our site in Crumlin they have placed 
“Fit to Work” notices around the site  
to highlight the benefits of different 
activities such as taking the stairs  
or walking to see a colleague rather 
than e-mailing.
• Hosting a DS Smith UK six-a-side 
football tournament — the Healthy 
Heart Cup!
The initiative is going from strength  
to strength and we are committed to 
supporting our employees to achieve 
sustained improvements in their  
heart health. 
HEALTH AND SAFETY
The safety of our people remains a 
cornerstone of our business. We seek to 
improve our performance continuously  
as a Group and strive to ensure that our 
colleagues and the public are kept safe. 
Health and Safety  
Key Performance Indicators
2014/15 2013/14 Variance
Total LTAs 146 171 (15%)
AFR 4.16 4.79 (13%)
Definition: 
Lost Time Accident (LTA): number of accidents resulting in 
lost time of one shift or more.
Accident Frequency Rate (AFR): number of LTAs per million 
hours worked.
We are delighted to report another year 
where our key safety measures of LTAs  
and of AFR, have both continued to improve. 
This has been the result of a programme  
of continuous improvement and the high 
priority assigned to safe working practices. 
Our goal is for zero accidents. Any accident 
which causes injury and suffering is one too 
many. We are committed to achieving a zero 
accident culture and recognise that more 
work needs to be done on improving our 
sites, reducing risks and raising our safety 
awareness. We believe that this target, 
although challenging, is achievable. Our 
Benelux region had no LTAs for the whole 
year (having had six in the prior financial 
year) and 182 sites had no LTAs in the  
year, up from 132 in the prior year. It is our 
challenge to extend this to the full Group.
The Group Health and Safety Director  
leads the Safety Leadership Group (SLG), 
which coordinates Group policy and best 
practice from the various parts of the 
organisation and further raises the visibility 
of safety within the organisation. The  
SLG meets monthly to review major LTAs/
high potential severity incidents, thus 
further improving the level of challenge  
on accident investigation. 
The SLG has also set up working groups on 
specific topics such as machine guarding  
and workplace transport and is working to 
identify and share best practice across the 
Group. It has also revised the safety incident 
definitions and is in the process of revising 
the Group’s safety policies. 
Going forward the business will continue  
to set stretching safety key performance 
indicators to act as milestones to a zero 
accident culture. These are tracked and 
reported monthly to the Group Management 
Team, with quarterly reports to the Board  
as in previous years. The established 
Divisional safety audits will continue with 
support from external consultants as well 
as internal specialists. These audits assist 
the sites in reducing risks and establish 
greater consistency within the Group.

Principal Risks
Providing better  
risk insight each year .
RISKS AND OUR BUSINESS MODEL
DS Smith has clear risk management 
objectives and an established strategy  
to deliver on these through its core, 
risk-managed processes. At a strategic  
level our risk management objectives are  
to identify the Group’s principal risks and  
to formulate actions to ensure that the 
Group’s Corporate Plan and strategic 
priorities are aligned with the Group’s 
appetite for, and ability to tolerate,  
these risks over a rolling five year period.
Risk identification and assessment is an 
integral part of our corporate planning 
process, with the objective that the Board 
continues to have improved visibility of the 
Group’s principal risks and uncertainties,  
the consequences of those risks and the 
controls in place to manage them.
The Group recognises it is subject to many 
general risks such as changes in socio-
economic conditions, political, financial, 
general regulatory and legislative changes 
including events that the Group cannot 
influence, but whose effect can impact on 
its ability to deliver on the Corporate Plan. 
The risks we face, in the markets we choose 
to operate in, do not change significantly 
from year to year, but their influence on our 
Corporate Plan can vary in magnitude and 
frequency and this influences the way we 
seek to reduce or exploit risks in the pursuit 
of our objectives. The relative influences of 
each principal risk on our Corporate Plan are 
reflected in the Board’s current view on the 
risk trends and are categorised as stable, 
increasing or decreasing; as shown in  
Figure 1.

Increasing Risk
In 2015, consideration of our critical risks  
as well as our strategic priorities resulted in 
the inclusion of one additional risk classified 
within the context of European economic 
uncertainty (most notably Eurozone 
deflationary risks) and the separation of 
acquisition and market consolidation risks 
into two distinct risk categories.
A summary of the Group’s principal risks  
and uncertainties that are inherent to  
our business model and that can directly 
impact the successful execution of the 
Group’s strategy are shown in the following 
schedule. They are regularly monitored by 
the Board and the General Management 
Team (GMT) in terms of how they are 
managed and the mitigation strategies 
adopted to build greater resilience against 
risks that could disrupt achievement of  
our strategic priorities.

MANAGING OUR CONNECTED RISKS RISK APPETITE AND TOLERANCE
The principal risks within our business 
model reflect the Group’s view that risks, by 
their very nature, also bring the potential for 
reward, and that whilst there are some risks 
that the Group chooses to avoid, there are 
other risks that we choose to manage and 
others that the Group actively accepts and 
seeks in pursuit of our strategic priorities 
and targets. The Group heat map is a way of 
presenting how we balance risk and reward 
within the defined criteria of the Group risk 
appetite and tolerance statements. This 
allows the Group to take certain risks where 
it has management know-how, experience 
and the operational skill to manage them 
and thereby ensure the Group can deliver  
on its Corporate Plan.
RISK MANAGEMENT 
EFFECTIVENESS
Our risk management process considers  
our principal risks within the context of a 
“portfolio” of connected risks. Members  
of our GMT take a lead sponsorship role in 
assessing each risk portfolio so that there 
remains a close connection between the 
potential disruption that could be caused  
by one or more of these risks transpiring  
and how our operations can adapt to avoid, 
manage or react to the consequences of 
changing events. The overall intention of 
our risk management efforts is to minimise 
the impact of any prolonged adverse risk 
materialising in our Corporate Plan period.
Our process, as defined last year in our 
Annual Report, remained in force during  
2015 with Group risks being considered by 
the GMT , and risk dashboards maintained  
and reviewed by the Group, each Division, 
and, in the case of Packaging, each region. 
These risk dashboards are the result of input 
and challenge undertaken by the senior 
executives throughout the Group. They are 
maintained and revised by considering not 
only the risks that have the potential to 
disrupt the Group’s planned targets but  
also the potential opportunities available. 
We continue to recognise the significant 
interdependencies between our principal 
risks. Our connections diagram (Figure 2)
highlights how the Group considers the 
consequences of one risk as a potential 
trigger of, or influence on another. By 
understanding the relationships between 
our key risks, the Group considers it is better 
placed to ensure that the strategy and the 
measures taken to manage the delivery  
of plan targets are robust and facilitates 
stronger GMT and Division-level discussions 
on risk and the appropriateness of our 
current controls.

Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Introduction to Corporate Governance
Changing governance needs.
DEAR SHAREHOLDERS 
The need for good governance has been 
highlighted frequently in the last year as 
board effectiveness and reputational risk 
continue to exercise the headline writers. 
No company can ever say it has the 'perfect 
Board' but we all know what 'good' looks  
like. Good governance is fundamental to  
the way we do business. We believe it is  
our governance structure that supports  
our ability to become the leading provider  
of corrugated packaging in Europe.
To build a strong, successful and enduring 
business, we must have policies, processes 
and systems in place which achieve the  
right balance between our stakeholders  
and our own short, medium and long-term 
objectives. We must provide acceptable 
returns to our investors, but our capacity  
to do this is underpinned by a strong and 
mutually beneficial relationship with all  
of our stakeholders. This includes our 
employees, customers, suppliers, regulators 
and the communities in which we operate.
In the following pages, we have outlined  
our approach to governance and explained 
some of the challenges and how we dealt 
with them. Significant changes have been 
made to the requirements to manage and 
report risk, which apply to listed companies 
for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 October 2014. Although these changes  
do not formally apply to DS Smith's Annual 
Report until next year, we have already 
begun addressing them, as you will see  
on pages 39 to 43. 
Having the right culture is crucially 
important to enable us to create a working 
environment where our people are proud 
and able to do their best. As part of that, this 
year we refreshed our Data Protection and 
Social Media policies and rolled them out 
across all our sites. These policies sit in our 
governance framework, which includes our 
Operating Framework and Code of Conduct 
together with our values. The Operating 
Framework is key to the way we work with 
our colleagues and with our customers  
and suppliers. 
The Directors have stated on page 79  
that they consider the Annual Report  
and Accounts, taken as a whole, to be  
fair, balanced and understandable. The 
processes which support the Directors’ 
confidence in making this statement are 
long established and embedded into our 
business. The Audit Committee considered 
the criteria for a fair, balanced and 
understandable Annual Report. With this  
in mind, the Audit Committee reviewed  
the processes supporting the compilation 
and assurance of the report, in relation to 
financial and non-financial management 
information. Our external Auditor reviews 
the narrative sections of the Annual Report 
and Accounts to identify any material 
inconsistencies with the financial 
statements. The Directors received  
drafts of the Annual Report and Accounts 
and reviewed them at the April and June 
Board meetings in 2015.
I am pleased to confirm that the Company has 
complied in full with the Code throughout 
this financial year. I can assure you that I,  
and all the Board, are committed to ensuring 
that DS Smith operates to the highest 
standards of corporate governance.

GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  
AND COMPLIANCE
Our governance framework, which is  
shaped by the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the Code), the Companies Act 2006 
and secondary legislation, sets out 
standards of good practice in relation  
to board leadership and effectiveness, 
remuneration, accountability and relations 
with shareholders. The Company has 
complied throughout the financial year  
with all the provisions of the 2012 version  
of the Code. 
A schematic of the Group’s annual reporting 
framework is shown opposite.
ROUTINE PROCESSES
The Group annual reporting framework is 
designed to ensure that the Group and the 
individual businesses have a clear in-year 
plan aligned to the corporate strategy. 
Results are closely monitored monthly and 
compared with the agreed budget and the 
prior year. This ensures that management  
is quickly aware of issues as they emerge 
and corrective actions can be implemented 
efficiently when required. As part of the 
monthly reporting process, businesses are

BOARD EVALUATION LIFE CYCLE EFFECTIVENESS
The Board carried out an externally 
facilitated appraisal of its performance and 
that of the Chairman, the Board Committees 
and the individual Directors between March 
and June 2015, led by Margaret Exley from 
SCT Consultants (neither of who provided 
any other services to the Company during 
the year). The evaluation consisted of a 
questionnaire survey of all members of  
the Board, interviews with each of them, 
observation of the Board at a normal Board 
meeting and an analysis of a variety of 
documents, including Board packs. The 
review this year investigated a variety of 
aspects associated with Board effectiveness, 
being mindful of the work that is being done 
on best practice amongst Boards, and in 
particular the latest guidance for Boards 
from the Financial Reporting Council drawn 
up as the Code and its recent updates and 
advice. The feedback was collated into a 
report and presented to the Board for 
discussion and the outcomes and action 
plan are outlined in the table on page 52.  
All Directors and the Company Secretary 
participated in the exercise. Next year,  
in accordance with the Board’s policy,  
the review will be carried out internally.
The evaluation found that the Board of  
DS Smith has real strengths in its clarity  
of role, strategy formulation, performance 
oversight, investment appraisal, stakeholder 
engagement and Board behaviours. There is 
more to do in rounding out the performance 
metrics and creating a robust talent pipeline 
but Board members recognise these 
requirements and are working on developing 
these aspects of their work.
As the Board evolves, it needs to broaden  
its membership to keep pace with the 
developing shape of the business, bringing 
on to the Board new members with 
industrial/manufacturing experience as  
well as a deeper international knowledge.
The strategy formulation process is 
considered to be sound, evidence-based 
and well executed through the corporate 
plan and budget. It is recommended that a 
more explicit strategy implementation plan 
with milestones and measures covering the 
various aspects of the strategic development 
of the Group be developed.
The Board receives very good quality 
information to oversee performance.  
Board discussions are focussed on the  
right aspects of developing performance 
and Board members are fully engaged in 
driving performance. An over-arching set  
of key performance indicators and a more 
rounded set of measures will enhance the 
very good work in this area.
Risk management processes are sound  
and much good work has been done on this 
over recent years including a strong focus 
on embedding effective risk management 
processes into the day-to-day culture of  
DS Smith. The Board should from time to 
time stand back from the process, consider 
its broader view of risk, and identify  
a few areas for deeper consideration 
through the year ahead.
Board papers are of a high standard and 
Board business is well managed. Time  
is managed effectively in meetings and 
actions assigned and followed through. 
Members could more proactively shape 
agendas and, in meetings, should ensure  
a good balance of inputs.
The Board committees are well chaired, 
their agendas reflect the developing needs 
of the business, they engage well with the 
full Board and decisions are made effectively 
and followed through. Committee chairmen 
take full responsibility for their work and are 
active leaders of the committees. 52 Governance
Annual Report & Accounts 2015
BOARD EVALUATION – ACTIONS AND OUTCOMES
Area Actions from 2014/15 Areas for consideration in 2015/16
Board role and 
composition
• A more formal annual agenda was developed for the Nomination 
Committee, to ensure that executive succession planning, diversity  
and internal support are properly considered.
• Over time the Board should consider seeking to  
re-balance towards industrial, manufacturing and 
international experience.
• The Board should consider holding a session on the 
strategic talent requirements of the business, to  
provide the basis for shaping the talent strategy.
Effectiveness
• Training sessions were arranged for Directors, in particular the 
members of the Audit and Remuneration Committees.
• The membership of the Board committees was discussed. It was  
agreed that no changes were currently necessary but that this  
should be kept under review. 
• The Board should consider establishing a more explicit 
strategy implementation plan with milestones and 
measures which will enable the Board to be absolutely  
sure that the strategy is being implemented to time and 
quality as agreed.
• The Board should consider developing performance 
reporting to include a broader set of lead and lag  
indicators of overall performance, with an overview of  
the key indicators.
• The Board should consider conducting an annual 
‘zero-based’ discussion on risk, building into the Board’s 
agenda some ‘deep dive’ sessions on areas of risk.
Relations with 
stakeholders
• A programme of shareholder consultation meetings was held. • The Board should consider a potential prototype for 
broader stakeholder engagement, including sources  
of data, and objectives for key stakeholders with 
accountabilities identified.
Board 
behaviours and 
Committees
• The programme of more structured discussions at Board dinners, 
involving external contributors and other senior executives,  
was continued. 
• Support for the various Board Committees, including the formal  
training sessions mentioned above, was reviewed to ensure that  
each Committee was getting the right level of help and assistance.
• The Board should continue to ensure the timeliness  
of the distribution of Board papers and that all agreed 
actions have time-scales where appropriate. 
• Members should ‘self-regulate’ to ensure balanced input  
to discussions.
• Ways to improve informal communication between Board 
meetings, especially from the committee chairs and the 
Chairman, should be reviewed.
The independence of the non-Executive 
Directors was considered as part of the 
annual Board effectiveness review. The 
non-Executive Directors bring a strong 
independent oversight to the Board and 
following this year’s review the Board 
considers that all of the non-Executive 
Directors continue to demonstrate their 
independence. Biographical details of each 
Director can be found on pages 46 to 47 .
Conflicts
As part of our annual review process,  
during the Board meeting in April 2015 we 
reviewed and reconsidered all situations 
entered in the conflicts register. Each of the 
Directors in office reviews their individual 
position regularly and new Directors review 
their individual positions prior to joining  
the Board. As a routine item, Directors are 
asked, at the start of each Board meeting,  
to declare any interests that might conflict 
with the agenda items under discussion. 
The Company has also put procedures in 
place via the Company Secretary whereby 
the Directors can notify any future conflicts 
or potential conflicts of interest that may 
arise so that the Board can consider whether 
authorisation is appropriate. Any such 
notifications are reviewed at the next Board 
meeting and, if considered appropriate, 
authorised. Directors do not participate in 
the discussion, or vote regarding their own 
conflicts. If authorised, any conflicts are 
entered in the conflicts register.
Each Director has access to all information 
relating to the Group and to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary (who  
is responsible for ensuring that Board 
procedures are followed) and, as required, 
external advice at the expense of the Group. 
Following this evaluation, the Board 
recommends the re-election of all the 
Directors at the 2015 Annual General 
Meeting (AGM).
In addition to formal Board meetings, the 
Chairman and Executive Directors maintain 
regular contact with all Directors and hold 
informal meetings with non-Executive 
Directors to discuss issues affecting the 
Company. Individual Directors are encouraged 
to make site visits during the year. 
SITE VISITS 
In addition to the site visits which formed 
part of the induction programme (see case 
study on page 55), in July 2014 Miles Roberts 
and Jonathan Nicholls visited the CHP plant 
Directors' Governance Report continued  Governance 53

in Lucca, Italy for its open day. Guided site 
tours were organised for both mill and 
power plant. Open days offer the chance  
for employees to share their daily work  
with families and allow the community to 
learn more about the activities that happen 
each day on our sites.
In January 2015, Miles Roberts and Jonathan 
Nicholls visited the Ghent factory in Belgium. 
They were given an overview of the 
business in the Benelux region and the 
recent investments there. During the 
factory tour, Miles and Jonathan were given 
an explanation about the progression in  
both structure and productivity and the 
important focal points such as waste, 
quality and services.
Jonathan Nicholls also visited the Livingston 
factory in the UK in January 2015. He met 
with the managing director of UK Packaging 
for a presentation and discussion about 
business strategy for UK Packaging.
Site visits provide invaluable insight into  
the business for Directors.
OTHER BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has delegated certain powers, 
mainly of a routine nature, to the General 
Purposes Committee, which comprises  
RISK GOVERNANCE – READY TO LOOK AHEAD
The Group continues to maintain rigorous procedures for understanding and managing its strategic risks. We recognise that risks, and  
the way we manage their potential consequences, are part of our day-to-day thinking and key to accomplishing our strategic priorities.
Our risk management framework and the processes we put in place last year are operating well and serve to identify, assess and consider 
the possible remedies and responses to the principal risks and uncertainties the Group faces. The Group continues to improve the 
management of its key risks and to hold a strong position to absorb the financial and operational impact should those risks materialise.  
In doing so, the Board is encouraged by the continuing work across the Group and its Divisions and the investments being made in risk 
management and to see the growing interest and skills of our employees in this area.
The Group’s risk and governance framework addresses two objectives:
• Ensures the Group’s most significant risk exposures are 
understood and managed in accordance with an agreed  
level of risk appetite and risk tolerance.
• Ensures regular reporting of both risk exposures  
and the operating effectiveness of the controls.
The Board The Audit Committee The Group The Divisions
• Considers and defines the 
nature and level of risk that 
the Group is prepared to 
accept in order to deliver  
its business strategies. 
• The Board is responsible for 
maintaining the Group’s risk 
management systems and 
regularly reviews the Group’s 
key risks. 
• Annually, the Board reviews 
and approves the internal 
statements on risk appetite 
and tolerance in relation to 
the Group’s principal risks  
and its strategic objectives.
• Annually reviews the 
adequacy and effectiveness 
of our risk management 
system in relation to the  
key risks and uncertainties 
and their influence on  
the strategic priorities  
of the Group.
• Continues to advocate  
the use of the General 
Management Team (GMT) as 
the Group’s risk committee. It 
is essential that the GMT fully 
understands what risks could 
affect the delivery of our 
Corporate Plan. The GMT is 
responsible for identifying, 
reviewing, evaluating and 
determining the actions 
necessary to manage the 
principal threats to and 
opportunities of Group 
objectives. It has the 
authority to prioritise risk 
related resources and set 
action plans in relation to  
the management of key risks. 
Each Division presents its  
risk management plans  
and resources to the GMT 
annually for critique and 
challenge for the proper 
allocation of resource. 
• Continue to identify, assess, 
prioritise and manage risks  
on a daily basis as a source  
of sustainable business 
opportunity and competitive 
advantage. The responsibility 
for designing, operating, 
monitoring and maintaining 
effective risk management is 
delegated to the management 
of each Division. Divisional 
management teams apply 
judgement in the evaluation  
of the risks they face to 
achieve their objectives.  
They determine which risks 
are considered acceptable  
and assess the consequences 
of those risks while ensuring 
the costs of the relevant 
controls are proportionate  
to the benefits provided. 54 Governance

RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
We aim to provide balanced, clear and 
transparent communications which allow 
our shareholders to understand how we see 
our prospects and the market environments 
in which we operate. 
The Company has a programme of regular 
meetings, site visits, results briefings and 
trading updates with its institutional 
shareholders, equity analysts and investors, 
which provide opportunities to discuss the 
progress of the business. All presentations 
given to institutional shareholders are made 
available on our website, www.dssmith.com, 
along with press releases, transcripts,  
audio files and current and historic Annual 
Reports. The Board also receives feedback 
from major shareholders following the  
full and half-year results. Together, the 
Chairman, the Executive Directors, the 
Group Communications Director and the 
Head of Investor Relations ensure the  
Board is briefed on shareholders’ views,  
such that any issues or concerns are fully 
understood and considered by the Board. 
In order to assist in developing an 
understanding of the views of major 
shareholders, periodically the Company 
commissions a survey of investors 
undertaken by external consultants.  
The results of the survey are presented  
to the Board. 
The Senior Independent Director is  
available to discuss with shareholders  
any major issues that cannot be resolved 
through normal channels.
The AGM is used as an opportunity to 
communicate with private shareholders, 
including a short presentation on the 
business and current trading position,  
as well as an opportunity for questions  
from investors to the Chairman of the  
Board and the chairmen of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees. All Directors 
make themselves available to meet 
shareholders after the formal business  
of the meeting. To ensure compliance with 
the Code, separate resolutions are proposed 
on each discrete subject. All Directors will 
retire and stand for re-election this year.
To reflect the voting preferences of all

INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board has overall responsibility for the 
Group’s system of internal control, including 
financial, operational and compliance 
controls, and risk management systems,  
and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a 
system, however, can only be designed to 
manage rather than to eliminate risk and 
therefore can provide only reasonable and 
not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. In accordance  
with the Turnbull guidance, the Company  
has in place the procedures necessary to  
ensure that there is an ongoing process  
for identifying, evaluating and managing 
the significant risks to the Group. These 
procedures have been in place throughout 
the year under review and up to the date of 
the approval of these financial statements. 
Our risk governance process, including  
how it is reviewed by the Board and the 
operation of the Group Risk Committee,  
is described in more detail on page 53.
The Board determines the objectives  
and broad policies of the Group. It meets 
regularly and there is a schedule of  
matters which are required to be brought  
to it for decision. The Board has delegated 
to management the responsibility for 
establishing a system of internal control 
appropriate to the business environments  
in which the Group operates. Key elements 
of this system include:
• a clearly defined divisional organisation 
structure for monitoring the conduct and 
operations of individual business units; 
• clear delegation of authority throughout 
the Group, starting with the matters 
reserved for the Board;
• a formal process for ensuring that key 
risks affecting all the Group’s operations 
are identified and assessed on a regular 
basis, together with the controls in place 
to mitigate those risks. Risk consideration 
is embedded in decision-making 
processes. The most significant risks  
are periodically reported to the Board 
and considered by it. The risk process is 
reviewed by the Audit Committee;
• the preparation and review of 
comprehensive annual divisional and 
Group budgets and an annual review  
and approval by the Board of the 
corporate strategy;
• the monthly reporting of actual results 
and their review against budget, forecasts 
(including bank covenant headroom) and 
the previous year, with explanations 
obtained for all significant variances;
• an Operating Framework laying down 
common control procedures and policies 
to apply throughout the Group. This 
includes clearly defined policies for 
capital expenditure and investment, 
including appropriate authorisation 
levels, with larger capital projects, 
acquisitions and disposals requiring 
Board approval;
• regular formal meetings between 
 the Group Chief Executive, the  
Group Finance Director and divisional 
management to discuss strategic, 
operational and financial issues; and  Governance 55

DIRECTOR INDUCTION
On appointment, new Directors are given appropriate induction training, tailored to their specific needs, taking into account their 
individual qualifications and experience.
An induction programme for Ian Griffiths and Louise Smalley, who joined in June 2014, included the provision of information on the 
Group’s strategy, key risks and policies and procedures, individual time with the Chairman, Group Chief Executive, Group Finance  
Director, Company Secretary and key advisors, site visits to major business units and an opportunity to meet major shareholders. 
" The induction process was very well structured and gave an introduction to all parts of the business, both with the  
central functions and opportunities to visit the business units. I received briefings from members of the executive  
team on key areas of the business including the internal audit function, the key risks facing the business, site visits  
and a briefing in respect of the corporate governance framework within which the Company operates."
" I particularly appreciated the chance to review the business strategy and to discuss with management the key issues  
and opportunities. I was impressed on my visit to the Impact and Innovation Centre when I was able to see how these  
plans are implemented and how they are able to delight their customers."
Ian Griffiths
" My induction programme took account of my experience and background. My meetings with the executive team and 
independent advisors focused on a number of core functions which allowed me to explore the strategic and financial 
priorities of the Group. My visit to the Fordham and Kemsley sites gave me a good perspective on how management 
operationalise strategy. I enjoyed meeting key talent within DS Smith, and the opportunity to deepen my understanding  
of key business issues and opportunities."

the risk identification and management 
processes identified above. 
DIVIDENDS 
An interim dividend of 3.7 pence net per 
ordinary share was paid on 1 May 2015 and 
the Directors recommend a final dividend  
of 7 .7 pence net per ordinary share which, 
together with the interim dividend,

to 11.4 pence (2013/14: 10.0 pence). Subject 
to approval of shareholders at the AGM to  
be held on 8 September 2015, the final 
dividend will be paid on 2 November 2015  
to shareholders on the register at the close 
of business on 2 October 2015.

Operating Review and Financial Review 
sections of this Annual Report and 
Accounts. The Group’s liquidity and funding 
arrangements are described in notes 18  
and 20 to the financial statements, as well 
as in the capital structure and treasury 
management section of the Strategic 
Report, and the Directors consider that  
the Group has significant covenant and 
liquidity headroom in its borrowing  
facilities for the foreseeable future.
After reviewing the Company’s expenditure 
commitments, current financial projections 
and expected future cash flows (with 
appropriate sensitivities applied), together 
with the available cash resources and 
undrawn committed borrowing facilities,  
the Directors have considered that adequate 
resources exist for the Company to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, the Directors continue  
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the financial statements.

Audit Committee
DEAR SHAREHOLDERS 
The Audit Committee’s work in the current year has been informed both by developments 
within the Group, including the increase in acquisition and divestment activities, and by  
high profile external events in corporate reporting.
Against this backdrop, the Committee has continued to conduct its usual oversight of 
financial results, internal audit reviews and the management of risk across the Group. 
Meetings are scheduled directly around or before the end of the half and full-year, as well as 
before the publication of the associated half and full-year financial reports, so as to ensure 
the Committee is informed fully, and on a timely basis, on areas of significant risks and 
judgement. The Committee has continued to monitor the evolution of the Group’s financial 
reporting and control framework as well as overseeing the risk management programme.
The UK Corporate Governance Code 2012 (the Code) requires the Board to confirm that the 
Annual Report presents a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy. Under its Terms of Reference, following a 
request from the Board, the Committee undertook procedures to advise on this matter, 
described in more detail on page 60.
Jonathan Nicholls
Chairman of the Audit Committee
Under its terms of reference, the  
Audit Committee is empowered to  
seek independent external advice but  
did not do so during the year.
SIGNIFICANT MATTERS 
CONSIDERED IN 2014/15
In 2014/15, the Audit Committee’s work  
on significant accounting and financial 
reporting issues included a focus on the  
key areas outlined as follows:
Classification
The Group has continued to initiate future 
work to restructure the business to evolve 
and optimise the operational footprint and 
the support infrastructure. The costs of 
these programmes, together with other 
elements of income and cost (including 
acquisition costs, impairments and gains or 
losses on business disposals), are classified 
as exceptional because of their nature, 
incidence or size. The Directors believe  
that such a classification assists in the 
understanding of the underlying trading 
and financial results of the Group. 
Key responsibilities
• The accounting principles, policies  
and practices adopted in the  
Group’s accounts.
• External financial reporting and 
associated announcements.
• The appointment, independence, 
effectiveness and remuneration  
of the Group’s external Auditor.
• The resourcing, plans and 
effectiveness of Internal Audit 
performed on behalf of the Group  
by a major accountancy firm (currently 
KPMG), which is independent from  
the Group’s external Auditor.
• The adequacy and effectiveness of 
the internal control environment.
• The Group's risk management 
processes and performance.
• Review of matters relating to fraud and 
reports under the "Speak Up!" policy.
• The Group’s compliance with the Code.

Taxation 
Taxation represents a significant cost to  
the business both in cash and accounting 
terms. The Group is exposed to differing  
tax regimes and risks, and these affect the 
carrying values of tax balances (including 
deferred tax) and the resultant income 
statement charges. The Audit Committee 
reviewed the tax charge, including the 
underlying tax effect, the appropriateness 
of tax provisions recognised, and the risks 
associated with them.
Working capital
The Group operates from a large number  
of locations, particularly in Europe, and,  
as a consequence, has exposures to  
the carrying values of working capital, 
particularly inventory and trade debtors. 
The Group has operating procedures and 
financial controls to manage these balances 
and accounting policies to ensure that the 
carrying values are supportable. The Audit 
Committee reviews these policies and 
procedures to validate their appropriateness 
to the evolving nature of the Group’s 
business, paying particular attention  
to policies that have been expanded  
to address new circumstances. These 
assessments take place on a continuous 
basis throughout the year. 
In addition to these key areas, the Audit 
Committee considered the Group's 
accounting response to its own 
development through, for example, 
acquisitions and disposals. The Audit 
Committee also addressed external  
events in corporate reporting including,  
The Audit Committee has reviewed  
the appropriateness of the income and  
costs included in, and excluded from, 
exceptional items by challenging and  
seeking explanations from management. 
The Audit Committee reviewed reports 
prepared by management and the external 
Auditor. This work is a recurring agenda item 
in all Audit Committee meetings where the 
Audit Committee reviews reports prepared 
by management. The external Auditor 
reports on these matters at the half and  
full-year. The Audit Committee is satisfied 
with the resulting presentation.
Goodwill
The Group has significant goodwill and 
intangible fixed asset balances. Goodwill is 
subject to mandatory impairment testing, 
which is conducted at both the half-year  
and the year end. Intangible fixed assets, 
tangible fixed assets and other investments 
(such as associates) are subject to testing 
when there are indications of impairment.  
In undertaking the impairment testing, 
goodwill is allocated to the appropriate 
operating segments and the resulting 
carrying values are compared to the 
relevant value in use. The Audit Committee 
has reviewed the results of these tests, 
including an assessment of the robustness 
of the processes, the assumptions 
underpinning the values in use, and the 
appropriate sensitivities to changes in the 
assumptions. The impairment work, and  
the Audit Committee’s review thereon,  
also considered the carrying values of the 
individual cash generating units within the 
operating segments with their values in use.
in particular, supplier and customer  
rebates through routine reporting  
and specific internal audit work.
AUDIT EFFECTIVENESS
The Audit Committee meets with the 
external Auditor to determine annually 
their qualifications, expertise, resources, 
independence, objectivity and effectiveness. 
In addition, the performance of the external 
and Internal Audit functions is evaluated. 
The Audit Committee receives written 
confirmation from the external Auditor  
as to any relationships that might have a 
bearing on their independence, whether 
they consider themselves independent 
within the meaning of the UK regulatory 
and professional requirements, and on 
their quality control processes and ethical 
standards. The independence of the 
external Auditor was confirmed as part  
of the 2013/14 tender process discussed  
on page 61.
In addition, in order to ensure the 
independence and objectivity of the  
Auditor, the Audit Committee maintains  
and regularly reviews the Auditor 
Independence Policy which covers services 
which may be provided by, and fees paid  
to, auditors. The audit fee negotiations  
are approved by the Audit Committee.  
The Audit Committee is satisfied with 
Deloitte’s independence and effectiveness. 
Under professional standards, the partner 
responsible for the audit is generally 
changed every five years; the most recent 
rotation took place in the prior financial year. 
Key activities in 2014/15 Key priorities in 2015/16
Significant accounting and financial reporting issues:
• Classification and presentation of exceptional items.
• The carrying values of goodwill, tangible and intangible fixed assets.
• Taxation.
• Adequacy of working capital.
Other recurring responsibilities:
• Effectiveness of the external Auditor and recommendation on reappointment. 
• Internal audit reports. 
• Review of risk management framework and reporting thereon. 
• Review of systems of internal control.

in September 2014. 60 Governance
Annual Report & Accounts 2015
NON-AUDIT FEES
The policy on the supply of non-audit 
services by external auditors is as follows: 
The Group should not employ the Auditor  
to provide non-audit services where either 
the nature of the work or the extent of  
such services might impair the Auditor’s 
independence or objectivity. The external 
Auditor is permitted to undertake some 
non-audit services, providing it has the  
skill, competence and integrity to carry out 
the work in the best interests of the Group, 
on, for example, advisory services and  
due diligence activities associated with 
potential acquisitions and disposals and 
major changes in accounting regulations.
There are no contractual restrictions on the 
Group with regard to Deloitte’s appointment.
The Audit Committee is able to monitor the 
effectiveness of the external Auditor both 
through direct assessment and through 
recurring activities. The Audit Committee 
Chairman meets with the lead engagement 
partner regularly and individual committee 
members are encouraged to, and do, meet 
privately with Deloitte. The 2013/14 audit 
was subject to a review by the Financial 
Reporting Council’s audit quality review 
team, and required only limited improvements. 
The recommendations from the review have 
been acted upon.

were 25% of the annual Group audit fee

AUDIT TENDER POLICY
In 2013/14, the Company carried out a competitive tender for the role of Statutory Auditor. 
Following the tender process, Deloitte LLP were reappointed. Deloitte were first appointed 
as external Auditor to the Group companies in 2006. The lead audit partner rotates every 
five years and Ian Waller, the current lead audit partner, has been in post since 2013/14. 
The Committee's policy is that the role of external Auditor will be put out to tender at  
least every 10 years in line with the EU and Competition Commission (now Competition  
and Markets Authority) rules or at other times should specific circumstances require this.
OPERATION OF THE AUDIT 
COMMITTEE
During the year, the Audit Committee  
met four times and met privately with the 
external Auditor after each meeting. The 
Chairman of the Audit Committee also held 
separate private meetings during the year 
with the external Auditor, representatives 
from Internal Audit and the Group Finance 
Director and his team. The Audit Committee 
received sufficient, reliable and timely 
information from management to enable it to 
fulfil its responsibilities. The Audit Committee 
is satisfied that the Group’s executive 
compensation arrangements do not prejudice 
robust controls and good stewardship.
In addition to the Audit Committee 
members, the Chairman, the Group Chief 
Executive, the Group Finance Director, 
representatives from Internal Audit and  
the Group Financial Controller attend parts 
of these meetings by invitation. The Board 
is satisfied that Jonathan Nicholls and the 
members of the Audit Committee have both 
current and relevant financial experience

Nomination Committee
Board diversity
We have made good progress refreshing  
the Board during the year, which has 
resulted in an increase in the proportion of 
female directors on the Board, from 12.5% 
in 2013/14 to 25% in 2014/15. Our current 
Board gender and experience split is shown 
on page 47 .
We remain committed to at least maintaining 
this level of female representation in the 
medium term, while ensuring that diversity in 
its broadest sense remains a central feature 
of the Board. The Committee will continue  
to consider diversity when recommending 
any future Board appointments. Final 
appointments will always be made on merit. 
Despite the progress that has been made, 
the Committee is conscious that the increase 
in the proportion of women on our Board  
has been driven by the appointment of  
non-Executive Directors. The Board remains 
Key responsibilities
• Reinforcing the cultural and  
expertise diversity in the Board’s 
composition, and maintain  
ongoing succession plans.
• Considering ways to improve  
diversity in the pipeline for  
senior management roles.
• Further strengthening of the  
senior management team.
• Reviewing the Group’s talent 
management process.

DEAR SHAREHOLDERS 
The Nomination Committee has an important role to play in ensuring the Board has  
the right balance of experience and skills to support our strategy. 
The Committee keeps under review and evaluates the composition of the Board and  
its Committees to maintain the appropriate balance of skills, knowledge, experience  
and independence to ensure their continued effectiveness. Appropriate succession  
plans for the non-Executive Directors, Executive Directors and the Group’s senior 
management are also kept under review.

Developing the future
We will continue to report annually against 
these objectives and other initiatives taking 
place within the Company which promote 
gender and other forms of diversity.
The Board has made some significant 
progress against the key policy objectives 
during the year, as highlighted above.  
During the year, the business has continued 
to embrace all forms of diversity with the 
introduction or continuation of a number  
of initiatives:
• The annual Board evaluation process 
includes an assessment of the Board’s 
diversity including gender, helping the 
Board to consider objectively its 
composition and effectiveness.
• A number of programmes to help people 
in our communities. DS Smith is one of 
the founder members of the Nestlé 
Alliance for YOUth, an alliance of leading 
companies in Europe which recognise 
that youth unemployment is a major 
social and economic issue and are 
committed to helping solve it.
Developing the senior  
management pipeline
Strengthening the pipeline of executive 
talent in the Company has remained a key 
focus during the year. We are continuing  
to learn and build on existing programmes 
while introducing new initiatives to build, 
broaden and develop the significant talent 
which exists across the business.
Details of key initiatives include:
• A comprehensive talent review 
presented to the Board annually, 
mapping successional candidates  
and opportunities across all senior  
roles within the business.
• The Leadership Development 
Programme identifies and works with  
key senior talent across the business  
to broaden their skill set and experience 
to ensure that they are well placed  
for future opportunities. This has  
been encouraged through greater 
boardroom exposure and participation  
in mentoring programmes.

Remuneration Committee
DEAR SHAREHOLDERS 
I am pleased to be able to write to you this year, to demonstrate the continued alignment  
of the interests of the Executive Directors with shareholders through the implementation 
of our remuneration policy, approved by shareholders at the AGM last year, and to show  
how this is closely linked to the Group's performance. 
Linking remuneration with strategy
DS Smith has continued to deliver sustainable returns and growth for its shareholders.  
We have achieved this by focusing on delivering our key strategic goals, incentivised by  
our remuneration policy, as this is key to maximising long–term returns to shareholders. 
 
Strategic priorities
To delight our 
customers
To realise the 
potential of  
our people
To double the size 
and profitability  
of our business
To lead the way  
in recycling
Alignment with our strategy Alignment with our shareholders
This is supported by the inclusion of 
the drivers of return on average capital 
employed (ROACE) and earnings per  
share (EPS) growth within our variable 
remuneration. Stretching performance 
targets incentivise the delivery of our goals 
and the creation of shareholder value.
Managing our costs, cash flows and  
capital are the other elements of our 
strategic focus. Profitability forms a  
major part of the measurement in both  
the annual bonus and the share–based 
incentive plans. 
Employees at all levels are encouraged to 
have an interest in the Company’s shares 
through both direct shareholdings and 
through our award-winning Sharesave  
Plan, which had a take-up rate in the UK  
of 53%. For our more senior employees, 
their interests are aligned to shareholders 
through their shareholding requirements  
and through our share–based incentive 
plans. Employees at all levels have an interest 
in the performance of the share price.
The market assessment of our share 
performance is reflected in total 
shareholder return (TSR).
Key responsibilities
• Ensuring the Group’s remuneration 
arrangements support its strategy, 
align with its values and drive 
performance.
• Maintaining a competitive 
remuneration policy appropriate  
to the business environment of  
the countries in which we operate, 
thereby ensuring we can attract  
and retain talented individuals.
• Aligning senior executives’ 
remuneration with the interests  
of long–term shareholders while 
ensuring that remuneration is fair  
but not excessive. 
• Making recommendations to  
the Board in respect of the  
Chairman’s fees.
• Setting targets for the  
performance–related elements  
of remuneration packages.
• Oversight of our overall policy for 
senior management remuneration 
and of our employee share plans.
• Ensuring appropriate independent 
advisors are appointed to provide 
relevant advice and guidance to  
the Remuneration Committee.

These results demonstrate that once again our experienced management team has  
driven significant performance improvements during the year.
DS Smith's strategy to deliver long-term sustainable and profitable growth remains paramount 
and our remuneration policy is designed to support this strategy. The Company’s continued 
strong financial performance and consistent year-on-year incremental improvement in  
key financial measures demonstrate the importance of management’s continuing focus  
on delivering against a clear strategy supported by a remuneration policy which provides  
an appropriate balance between fixed and variable pay.  Governance 65
dssmith.com
Aligning remuneration policy with Group values
DS Smith is founded on the following values:
 
Be caring
 
Be challenging
 
Be trusted
 Be responsive
  
Be tenacious
The Remuneration Committee believes that these values underpin 
our approach to remuneration. The Remuneration Committee cares 
about aligning performance with reward.
The Committee understands the trust placed in it by shareholders not 
to reward failure. Challenging performance conditions, which are aligned 
with the strategic objectives of the Group, have to be met before our 
share-based incentive plans can vest. This ensures that when the 
strategic objectives are met, an appropriate level of remuneration 
follows. Our incentive plans have recovery and withholding provisions.
Last year, the Committee was responsive, engaging extensively 
with our major shareholders and their representative bodies 
regarding our remuneration policy. We also received feedback  
and views from shareholders on matters related to remuneration 
during the year. Shareholders do not speak with a single voice  
and, as a Committee, we have to be challenging and balance 
individual perspectives with our overall responsibility to ensure  
that remuneration arrangements enable us to attract and retain 
talented employees to deliver sustainable shareholder returns. 
In the interests of the Group, we have reviewed the effectiveness  
of the application of our remuneration policy to date and continue  
to be satisfied that the overall approach provides good alignment  
of executive behaviour with shareholder interests and does not 
encourage excessive risk taking. The executives have been tenacious 
in achieving sustainable returns and growth for shareholders.
Approach for 2015/16
We have set out in this report the key elements of the implementation 
in 2014/15 of the shareholder -approved remuneration policy. Having 
simplified our remuneration policy last year , the Share Matching Plan 
(SMP) has been discontinued and no further awards will be made under 
th SMP . Full details of the policy can be found in our 2013/14 Annual 
Report available on our website. 
The Committee has reviewed the operation of our remuneration 
policy for 2015/16 and has concluded that the policy should be 
implemented on an unchanged basis. The following key decisions 
were taken during the year:
• The Group Chief Executive's salary will be increased by 2.5%, 
in line with the average increase for the workforce generally. 
• In line with our stated policy to move the Group Finance 
Director's salary to a mid-market level over time and subject to 
satisfactory performance, his salary will be increased by 5%. 
• These increases will take effect from 1 August 2015. 
• The fee payable to the non-Executive Chairman will be increased 
by 2.5% and the non-Executive Directors' base fees by 2.5%.
• Targets for the 2015/16 annual bonus plan have been set in  
line with the financial plan. Due to their commercial sensitivity, 
they are not disclosed within this report, but will be disclosed 
retrospectively in next year's report to the extent that they  
do not remain commercially sensitive.
• Under the Performance Share Plan (PSP), the Committee has 
considered the performance conditions and has determined that 
an equal mix of EPS, TSR and ROACE remains appropriate and 
these are fully disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
• Shares that vest under the PSP awarded this year to Executive 
Directors must be retained for a further two years before they 
can be sold.
The annual report on remuneration explains how our policy has 
been implemented during the year under review and, alongside this 
letter, will be subject to an advisory vote at our AGM (resolution 3). 
We hope that you will support it.

• Implemented the policy, approved by shareholders 
at the 2014 AGM, during the year under review.
• As the Group’s business, its markets and the executive remuneration landscape continue  
to evolve, the Committee will continue to review the approach to remuneration to ensure  
that it remains appropriate and highly relevant. We recognise the need to continue to attract 
management with skills and experience which reflect current and future developments in the 
markets in which the Group's businesses operate. 
• The Committee will continue its regular dialogue with shareholders and will hold meetings  
with the largest investors to listen to their views and feedback. 66 Governance

REMUNERATION POLICY
Introduction
The policy, which was explained in detail on page 60 to 65 in  
the 2013/14 Annual Report (a copy of which can be found on the 
Group’s website www.dssmith.com/investors/annual-reports/)  
was approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2014 and took effect 
from 17 September 2014. The Committee believes that the policy 
strikes the right balance between providing clarity on its intentions 
and retaining flexibility to deal with the unexpected over the next 
two years. We set out in this report the key elements of our policy  
to allow cross-reference against its operation in the year. This is 
unchanged from last year, other than the salary increases for the 
Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director effective from  
1 August 2015, and the section headed 'Reward Scenarios' has  
been updated for the Executive Directors' 2015/16 salaries.
Element, purpose  
& link to strategy Operation and performance metrics Opportunity
Basic salary 
To help recruit and retain 
key senior executives.
To provide a mid–market 
salary relative to comparable 
companies, in terms of size 
and complexity.
Normally reviewed by the Committee annually and fixed for the  
12 months commencing 1 August.
The Committee takes into account:
• role, competence and performance;
• average change in broader workforce salary; and
• total organisational salary budgets.
Salaries are benchmarked against similar roles within a selected group  
of UK businesses of similar size with substantial overseas operations.
Salaries will normally be increased in line with 
increases for the workforce in general/increases  
for senior management/inflation unless there  
has been an increase in the scope, responsibility  
or complexity of the role, when increases may  
be higher. Phased higher increases may also be 
awarded to new Executive Directors who were  
hired at a discount to the market level to bring  
the salary to the desired mid–market positioning, 
subject to individual performance.
The aim is to position salaries around the  
mid–market level, although higher salaries  
may be paid, if necessary, in cases of external 
recruitment or retention.
Annual bonus
To incentivise executives  
to achieve specific, 
predetermined objectives 
during a one–year period. 
To reward ongoing  
delivery and contribution  
to strategic initiatives. 
Deferred proportion of 
bonus, awarded in shares, 
provides a retention 
element and additional 
alignment of interests  
with shareholders.
Targets are set annually and relate to areas of the business over which 
 the executive has particular control.
Bonus payouts are determined by the Committee after the year end,  
based on performance against predetermined objectives, at least the  
vast majority of which are financial.
Up to half of the bonus is paid in cash and the balance is deferred into shares.
The deferred bonus shares vest after three years and are paid together  
with an amount equal to the value of dividends payable on the vested  
shares during the deferral period. The deferred element is subject to 
forfeiture for 'bad leavers' who depart prior to vesting.
The annual bonus plans are not contractual and bonuses under the  
plans are not eligible for inclusion in the calculation of the participating 
executives’ pension plan arrangements.
Clawback provisions apply to the annual bonus plan and the deferred bonus 
shares so that individuals are liable to repay/forfeit some or all of their bonus  
if there is a material misstatement of results or if there is serious misconduct.
Maximum bonus potential of 200% of base salary 
(which will apply to the Group Chief Executive, with 
the Group Finance Director having an opportunity  
of 150% of base salary), with target bonus being  
one half of the maximum. Bonus starts to be earned 
at the threshold level (below which 0% is payable).
Pension
To remain competitive  
in the marketplace  
and provide income  
in retirement.
Executive Directors can elect to either:
• participate in the Group’s Registered Defined Contribution Plan  
(DC Plan), with life cover equal to four times basic salary; or
• receive a salary supplement; or
• a combination of the above.
Members of the DC Plan are required to contribute a minimum of 3%  
of their basic salary to qualify for matching employer contributions,  
with higher levels of employer contributions payable if members pay  
a higher contribution.
Maximum: 30% of base salary (including a maximum 
DC Plan contribution). Future appointments to the 
Board would have a maximum of 25% of base salary.  Governance 67

& link to strategy Operation and performance metrics Opportunity
Benefits
To help retain employees 
and remain competitive  
in the marketplace.
Directors receive a car allowance, income protection insurance, life cover  
and medical insurance. Additional benefits (including a relocation allowance) 
may be provided from time to time where they are in line with market practice.
Benefit levels may be increased in line with market 
levels and to ensure they remain competitive and 
valued by the recipient. However, as the cost of the 
provision of benefits can vary without any change in 
the level of provisions, no maximum is predetermined.
Performance  
Share Plan (PSP)
To incentivise Executive 
Directors to achieve  
returns for shareholders 
over a longer timeframe.
To help retain executives 
and align their interests 
with shareholders through 
building a shareholding in 
the Company.
Awards of nil–cost options are made annually with vesting dependent on the 
achievement of performance conditions over the three subsequent years. 
Awards will vest, subject to performance, on the third anniversary of grant 
and will be subject to an additional two–year holding period post vesting 
during which time awarded shares may not be sold (other than for tax).
The Committee reviews the quantum of awards annually to ensure that  
they are in line with market levels and appropriate given the performance  
of the individual and the Company.
Vesting of awards is based on:
i.  the Company’s Total Shareholder Return performance measured over  
no less than three years against a peer group of companies selected by  
the Committee as at the start of the performance period. The vesting scale 
is median to upper quartile of the group of companies, with nothing vesting 
for below median performance; and
ii.  internal audited financial measures of performance (e.g. Earnings Per 
Share, Return on Average Capital Employed) selected by the Committee 
over a period of no less than three financial years.
Dividend equivalents arising over the period between the grant date  
and the vesting date will be paid in cash or shares.
Clawback provisions apply to the PSP so that individuals are liable to  
repay/forfeit some or all of their shares if there is a material misstatement  
of results or if there is serious misconduct.
Maximum annual awards: 225% of base salary (which 
will apply to the Group Chief Executive, with the Group 
Finance Director having an opportunity of having a 
maximum opportunity of 175% of base salary). 
25% of the relevant part of the award will vest for 
achieving threshold performance, increasing to full 
vesting for the achievement of maximum performance.
Share ownership 
guidelines
To further align the 
interests of executives  
with those of shareholders.
Executive Directors are expected to maintain a shareholding in the 
Company’s shares as a multiple of their base salary within five years of 
appointment (Group Chief Executive 225%, Group Finance Director 175%).  
To achieve this, Executive Directors are expected to retain at least 50% of 
shares (net of tax) which vest under the Company’s share plans until the 
share ownership guidelines are met.
Non–Executive Directors are expected to build up and then maintain  
a shareholding that is equivalent to a percentage of their annual fee  
(50%) from the Company within two years of their date of appointment.
None.
All employee  
share plan
Encourages long–term 
shareholding in the 
Company.
Executive Directors have the opportunity to participate in the UK or 
international Sharesave plans on the same terms as other eligible employees. 
The UK plan is operated on an ‘equal terms basis’ to secure approved UK 
HMRC tax status. There are no performance conditions applicable to awards.
Following recent UK HMRC changes to the limits,  
the maximum participation level is now £500 per 
month (or local currency equivalent). This limit is 
subject to change in line with the UK HMRC limit  
from time to time. 68 Governance

The charts illustrate the remuneration policy from 1 August 2015. The charts are indicative as share price movement and dividend  
accrual have been excluded. Assumptions made for each scenario are as follows:
• Minimum: fixed remuneration only (i.e. latest known salary, benefits and pension).
• Target: fixed remuneration plus half of maximum annual bonus opportunity plus 25% vesting of performance shares.  
Note that the Company does not have a stated target for its financial measures or incentive payouts.
• Maximum: fixed remuneration plus maximum annual bonus opportunity plus 100% vesting of performance shares.
Service contracts and payment for loss of office 
The Committee’s policy is that the notice periods for Executive Directors appointed in future will not exceed one year. Service contracts  
may be terminated without notice and without payment or compensation, except for sums earned up to the date of cessation, on the 
occurrence of certain events, such as gross misconduct. The Committee’s normal policy on termination is to make phased compensatory 
payments and to reduce or stop such payments to former Executive Directors where they receive remuneration from other employment 
during the notice period (where this is consistent with local employment legislation and market practice). Termination payments will not 
exceed contractual entitlements. For future Directors’ contracts, if the Company exercises its right to make a payment in lieu of notice 
(PILON), these such payments will not exceed an amount equal to basic salary for any unexpired notice period.

1  Any such termination payment may be made in a lump sum or in monthly instalments from the termination date. These monthly payments will be reduced to take account of any alternative 
employment or consultancy income during the period over which such instalments are payable.
In the case of a “good leaver”:
• annual cash bonus will be paid out, subject to Company performance, on the normal payment date unless the Committee determines 
that the payment will be made early on the date of cessation of employment. The payout will be reduced on a pro–rata basis to reflect 
the proportion of the performance period served;
• deferred bonus shares will vest in full on the date of cessation of employment; and
Remuneration Committee continued  Governance 69
dssmith.com
• PSP and SMP awards will vest, subject to performance, on the normal vesting date unless the Committee determines that the awards 
will vest early on the date of cessation of employment (in exceptional circumstances only). Awards will be reduced on a pro–rata basis.
For all other leavers:
• all performance–related elements of pay will lapse immediately.
For all leavers, the Committee may also determine to make a payment in reimbursement of a reasonable level of legal fees in connection 
with a settlement agreement.
Recruitment (and appointment) policy
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms of the Company’s approved 
remuneration policy in force at the time of appointment.
In exceptional circumstances, the Committee may offer additional cash or share–based elements. Any such payments would be for  
the specific purpose of recruiting an Executive Director key to the operation of the Group. They would not exceed what is felt to be  
a fair estimate of remuneration lost when leaving the former employer and would reflect (as far as possible) the nature and time  
horizons attaching to that remuneration and the impact of any performance conditions. Shareholders will be informed of any such 
payments on appointment.
In the case of an internal executive appointment, any variable salary element awarded in respect of the prior role would be allowed  
to pay out according to its existing terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment. In addition, any other ongoing 
remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment would continue.

Determination of annual bonus (audited)
Annual bonus payments were determined with reference to performance over the financial year ended 30 April 2015. The bonus vested on 
a straight–line basis of 95% – 105% of the budget as approved by the Board, split 50/50 between budgeted ROACE (14.0%) and budgeted 
earnings before tax and amortisation (EBTA) (£285 million). In assessing the actual performance achieved the Committee assesses and  
may make an adjustment for the impact of events that were not envisaged in the budget. These might include, for example, acquisitions 
and disposals, changes to accounting standards, and ensuring the same exchange rates are used for actual and budget performance. The 
bonus was calculated using EBTA of £311 million and ROACE of 14.4%. No element of the annual bonus is guaranteed.
The annual bonus is designed to drive the achievement of the Group’s annual financial and strategic business targets. The annual bonus 
opportunity is based on a formal review of performance against stretching financial targets.

The annual bonus plan for the Executive Directors and other senior executives is operated as shown in the policy table on page 66. Bonus 
results are determined by the Committee after the year end, based on performance against targets. Bonus awards are measured against 
the achievement of Group objectives. Maximum bonus for 2014/15 is shown above for the Executive Directors and is generally between 
70% and 100% for the other most senior executives.
In the event of an acquisition in the year, the Committee will assess whether the financial performance of the acquired business should be 
included and targets adjusted accordingly or simply excluded. Adjustments to targets will continue to be disclosed in the relevant Directors' 
Remuneration Report.

The Committee's policy is that no adjustments for exchange rate movements are made to EPS or ROACE over the three year performance 
period as the Committee feels that these are of a long-term nature and fluctuations are more likely to average out over the three years.

Awards granted during the year
On 30 July 2014, PSP awards were granted to the Executive Directors. The share price on the date of grant was £2.675. The Group Chief 
Executive's award was 150% of base salary and the Group Finance Director's award was 125% of base salary. Awards normally vest three 
years after grant, to the extent that the applicable performance conditions have been satisfied. 
As detailed last year, the PSP award levels this year will be 200% of base salary for the Group Chief Executive and 175% of base salary  
for the Group Finance Director. These award levels reflect the discontinuation of the SMP . Under the PSP , the Committee has the power  
to vary the metrics used each year and their relative weightings. It also has the power to review the specific targets for each award to 
ensure that they remain appropriate, but the new targets must be at least as challenging in the circumstances as the original targets  
were when they were set.
In the event of an acquisition in the three year performance period, the Committee will assess whether the financial performance of the 
acquired business should be included and targets adjusted accordingly. The financial performance of a business being disposed of may  
be excluded from the Group's financial performance and the targets adjusted accordingly. Adjustments to targets will continue to be 
disclosed in the relevant year's Directors' Remuneration Report.
The targets for historical awards granted under PSP and the SMP are set out below:

2012 PSP award: 50% based on relative TSR, 25% based on average adjusted EPS and 25% based on average adjusted ROACE. The 
performance period for this award ended on 30 April 2015. Details of the performance conditions of this award and the number of shares  
to vest are set out above.
2013 and 2014 PSP award: 50% based on relative TSR, 25% based on average adjusted EPS and 25% based on average adjusted ROACE. 
25% of the award vests for achieving threshold performance, increasing on a straight–line basis to full vesting for maximum performance.
Share Matching Plan
The awards made in 2012, 2013 and 2014 to the Executive Directors were in respect of 75% of salary (calculated based on the maximum 
matching ratio of 1.5:1 on the first 50% of salary worth of shares awarded under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP)). No further awards 
will be made under the SMP .
Matching awards normally vest three years after grant, to the extent that the applicable performance conditions have been satisfied and 
the related DSBP award has not lapsed, and provided the participant is still employed within the Group. If a DSBP award lapses before the 
vesting of the related matching award, then that matching award will lapse at the same time. The performance period for the 2012 award 
ended on 30 April 2015. Details of the performance conditions of this award and the number of shares to vest are set out above.

ALL –EMPLOYEE SHARE PLAN
We believe that our Sharesave Plan (SAYE) is a valuable way of aligning our employees with those of our long–term shareholders. Executive 
Directors are eligible (along with all employees of the Company and participating subsidiaries of the Group) to participate in the SAYE. We 
were very pleased to win the Ifs ProShare's Best International Share Plan award and Global Equity Organization's Best Plan Effectiveness 
award for our SAYE. These awards recognise our commitment to delivering opportunity for all of our employees to participate in a plan  
that allows employees across our businesses to be engaged with the strategic direction and to share in the financial success of DS Smith.
Options are granted under the SAYE (which is an HMRC tax–advantaged plan in the UK) to participants who have contracted to save up  
to the equivalent of £250 per month over a period of three years (two years in the US and four years in France) at a discount of up of 20% 
(15% in the US) to the average closing mid–market price of the Group’s shares on the three dealing days prior to invitation (20 day average 
to the day before grant in France and the mid–market average on the day of grant in the US). In common with most plans of this type, there 
are no performance conditions applicable to options granted under the SAYE. Details of Directors’ interests in the SAYE are as follows:

EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS 
The Board supports Executive Directors taking up appointments outside the Company to broaden their knowledge and experience.  
Each Executive Director is permitted to accept one non-Executive appointment from which they may retain any fee (or in exceptional 
circumstances two appointments). Any external appointment must not conflict with a Director’s duties and commitments to DS Smith.
Miles Roberts was appointed a non-Executive Director of Poundland Group plc on 30 October 2014 and retained fees of £23,340 for  
the period from appointment to 30 April 2015. Adrian Marsh does not currently have any external appointments.
PAYMENTS TO PAST DIRECTORS OR FOR LOSS OF OFFICE (AUDITED)
No payments were made to past Executive Directors during the year ended 30 April 2015 (2013/14: Nil). No payments were made in  
respect of loss of office during the year ended 30 April 2015 (2013/14: Nil).
PENSION AND OTHER BENEFITS
Miles Roberts receives an annual pension allowance of 30% of basic salary, in lieu of pension benefits. This payment is not considered  
to be salary for the purpose of calculating any bonus payment.
Adrian Marsh elected to pay contributions at a level that qualifies for a Company contribution of 20% or he can receive an equivalent  
cash supplement. This payment is not pensionable and is not considered to be salary for the purpose of calculating any bonus payment.
Other benefits:
As previously disclosed, Adrian Marsh was reimbursed £30,000 for his relocation expenses in the year under review. This payment was  
in line with the head office relocation policy rules (that apply to all employees) and the payment is subject to clawback if he should leave 
within two years.
Other benefits include car allowance, taxable fuel, income protection, life and health cover.

As disclosed previously, in order to facilitate the recruitment of Miles Roberts in 2010, and to ensure that his interests were directly and 
immediately aligned with those of the Company’s shareholders, the Company granted conditional share awards principally as compensation 
for lost entitlements to bonus, deferred share awards and long–term share incentive awards relating to his previous employer, McBride plc. 
The Substitute Share Bonus Award was made as compensation for loss of his share bonus entitlement with his previous employer for  
the year 2009/10 as a result of his recruitment by the Company. The value of shares awarded reflects the proportion of the period of  
12 calendar months beginning on 1 July 2009 during which he was actively employed by McBride plc and was based on an assessment  
of the likely bonus which would have become payable to him had he remained employed by McBride plc. The award vested in full and 
became exercisable on 1 September 2013. 76 Governance

Review of past performance – total shareholder return graph
The following graph illustrates the Company’s TSR performance since 1 May 2009, relative to the FTSE 250 Index. The Company  
is a member of the FTSE 250 Index and, accordingly, this index is considered to be the most appropriate comparator group for this  
purpose. This graph looks at the value, by 30 April 2015, of £100 invested in DS Smith over the last six financial years compared  
with that of £100 invested in the FTSE 250 Index. The other points plotted are the values at intervening financial year ends.
Remuneration of the Chief Executive
The table below shows the total remuneration figure for the Chief Executive during each of those financial years. The total remuneration

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE GOVERNANCE
The Board is ultimately accountable for executive remuneration but 
delegates responsibility to the Committee. The Committee’s principal 
function is to support the Group’s strategy by ensuring that its 
delivery is supported by the Company’s overall remuneration policy, 
as described above. It also determines the specific remuneration 
package, including service contracts and pension arrangements,  
for each Executive Director and our most senior executives.
All members of the Committee are independent non–Executive 
Directors, which we see as fundamental in ensuring Executive 
Directors’ and senior executives’ remuneration is set by people  
who are independent and have no personal financial interest, other 
than as shareholders, in the matters discussed. The members of  
the Committee have no personal financial interest, other than as 
shareholders of the Company, in the matters to be decided by the 
Committee, no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross–
directorships and no day–to–day involvement in running the 
business. The Committee consults with the Group Chief Executive, 
who may attend meetings of the Committee, although he is not 
involved in deciding his own remuneration. The Committee is 
assisted by the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary  
and the Group Human Resources Director. No–one is allowed to 
participate in any matter directly concerning the details of their  
own remuneration or conditions of service.
New Bridge Street (a brand of Aon Hewitt Limited) has been 
appointed by the Committee to provide advice on the remuneration 
of Executive Directors and other senior executives. New Bridge 
Street also provides advice to the Company in connection with  
the operation of the Company’s share–based incentive plans.  
New Bridge Street is a signatory to the Code of Conduct for  
remuneration consultants and a member of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group. Neither New Bridge Street nor any other part  
of Aon Hewitt provided any other services to the Company during  
the year. The total fees in respect of its services to the Committee 
during the year were £59,445.
This Report has been prepared in accordance with the Large and 
Medium–Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013 and the Listing Rules of the UK 
Listing Authority. The Board, in conjunction with the Committee, 
has taken the necessary steps to ensure that the Company  
complies with the provisions of the Code which relate to Directors’ 
remuneration. The Committee confirms that throughout the year  
it has complied with governance rules and best practice provisions.
The Regulations require the Auditor to report to shareholders on  
the audited information within this Report and to state whether, in 
their opinion, the relevant sections have been prepared in accordance 
with the Act. The Auditor’s opinion is set out in the Auditor’s Report 
and we have clearly marked the audited sections of the Report.
Prior to the 2014 AGM, a number of shareholders expressed 
concerns with certain aspects of the Company's remuneration. 
These concerns centred on the increase to variable opportunity  
for Miles Roberts which the Committee proposed instead of 
increasing his salary to the market median. They also included  
the relocation payment made to Miles Roberts as an 'allowance'.  
This was a payment against expenses incurred and so one-off  
in nature, not ongoing. Prior to the publication of the report,  
further dialogue was held with our major shareholders and  
their representative bodies. The Committee has noted the  
concerns expressed by these shareholders and will have regard to 
these in the future when considering future remuneration policy.

Annual Report & Accounts 2015
IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICY FOR 2015/16
Base salaries
In determining base salaries for 2015/16, the Remuneration 
Committee has taken into consideration, particularly, the 
experience, performance, and the internal and external relative 
positioning for total reward of the individuals, and has also taken 
into account the average budgeted increase in base salaries of  
the Group’s workforce in 2015/16. Salaries are being increased  
from 1 August 2015 as follows:
Salaries effective from:
1 August 2014 1 August 2015
Miles Roberts £685,000 £702,000 
Adrian Marsh £420,000 £441,000
Annual bonus
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for 2015/16 will remain 
unchanged at 200% and 150% of salary for the Group Chief 
Executive and Group Finance Director respectively. The target 
bonus will also remain at the same level as a percentage of salary  
at half of the maximum. 
For 2015/16, the annual bonus plan will comprise two discrete 
elements for the Executive Directors:
• 50% on EBTA performance; and
• 50% on ROACE performance.
The targets are challenging relative to the 2015/16 business plan 
and show growth over 2014/15. They are deemed by the Committee 
to be commercially sensitive so will be disclosed retrospectively 
(along with performance against them) in next year’s remuneration 
report to the extent that they do not remain commercially sensitive 
at that time.
Long–term incentives
As explained in last year's report, linked to the discontinuation of  
the SMP , the PSP opportunity for the Group Chief Executive would 
increase to 225% of salary, phased over two years. The award to  
be made in July 2015 will be at 200% of salary for the Group Chief 
Executive. The award to be made to the Group Finance Director  
will be at 175% of salary. The Committee will continue to review  
the award level to ensure it remains appropriate. The awards will 
continue to be granted as nil–cost options.
The PSP will continue to be subject to three performance measures: 
relative TSR, EPS and ROACE with equal weighting on each element. 
The respective targets for the 2015 award will be:
% vesting as Relative TSR
1
Average EPS

1  Relative TSR performance measured over three years against a group of 44 companies 
within the Industrial Goods & Services Supersector within the FTSE 250 as at the start  
of the performance period.
2  Average adjusted EPS, as disclosed in the Annual Report, over the forthcoming three 
financial years, commencing with the financial year starting immediately prior to the award.
3  Average adjusted ROACE over the forthcoming three financial years, commencing with the 
financial year starting immediately prior to the award.
4  Targets may be adjusted by the Committee (for example, to reflect the impact of 
acquisitions and disposals) to ensure that the conditions achieve their original purpose.
5  The adjusted EPS/ROACE for all three years will be added up, divided by three and compared 
to the targets above. For a growing business these targets are more demanding than if only 
the third year's performance is compared to these targets.
These targets will require management to deliver a strong, 
sustainable performance over the three year period.

The Directors are responsible for 
 preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance  
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law, the Directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and Article  
4 of the IAS Regulation and have chosen  
to prepare the parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law). Under 
company law, the Directors must not approve 
the accounts unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state  
of affairs of the Company and of the profit  
or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing the parent Company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies  
and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting 
Standards have been followed, subject  
to any material departures disclosed  
and explained in the financial 
statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on  
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the relevant financial 
reporting framework, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
• the management report, which is 
incorporated into the Directors’ Report, 
includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and  
the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.
In addition, we confirm that the Annual 
Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the performance, strategy and 
business model of the Company.
By Order of the Board
Miles Roberts
Group Chief Executive 24 June 2015
Adrian Marsh
Group Finance Director 24 June 2015
In preparing the Group financial statements, 
International Accounting Standard 1 
requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply  
accounting policies;
• present information, including 
accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures  
when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact  
of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial 
position and financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose  
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies  
Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps  
for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

GOING CONCERN 
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement on page 56 that the Group is a going concern. We confirm that: 
 we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate; and 
 we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT 
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources  
in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team: 
 Risk  How the scope of our audit responded to the risk 
 
Classification and presentation  
of exceptional items 
The presentation and consistency of costs and income 
within exceptional items is a key determinant in the 
assessment of the quality of the Group’s underlying 
earnings. Management judgement is required in 
determining whether an item is exceptional. For the  
year ended 30 April 2015, the Group incurred exceptional 
and acquisition related costs of £51 million. Refer to note 
4 for details of the exceptional items in the year. 
 
Exceptional items have been evaluated as to their nature in order to assess whether their classification 
and presentation are in line with the Group’s accounting policy and guidance from the Financial 
Reporting Council. The quantification of such items has been assessed by agreeing to supporting  
source documentation. We have reviewed management’s application of the policy for consistency  
with previous accounting periods.  
 
We also assessed whether the disclosures within the financial statements in note 4 provide sufficient 
detail for the reader to understand the nature of these items. 
 
 
Tax 
The value of the tax provisions recorded in respect  
of a number of uncertain tax positions require 
judgements in respect of the likely outcome of 
negotiations with various tax authorities. Refer to  
note 1(u) for management’s process for estimating  
and recording tax provisions. 
 
We worked with our tax audit specialists including those in required local jurisdictions to challenge 
the estimates and judgements made by management when calculating the income tax payable in  
each territory and the associated provisions held. We reviewed the correspondence with the taxation 
authorities in significant locations, as well as reviewing the support or opinions received from external 
counsel or other advisors where management has utilised such opinions to appraise the likely outcome 
of technical tax treatments and assessing the reasonableness of the provisions made. 
 
Carrying value of goodwill, tangible and 
intangible assets and investment balances 
The key assumptions used in the assessment of the 
carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets are 
determined with reference to judgemental factors  
such as the projected cash flows, discount rate and 
perpetuity growth rates. As at the year end, the Group 
held an aggregate of £2,214 million of goodwill, tangible 
and intangible assets and investments. Refer to  
notes 1(i), 10, 11 and 12 for details of these balances. 
 
We assessed the assumptions used in the impairment model, specifically the cash flow projections, 
discount rates and perpetuity growth rates. Our procedures included challenging forecast cash flows 
with reference to historical trading performance, benchmarking assumptions, such as the perpetual 
growth rate and discount rate, to external macro-economic and market data and consulting with our 
valuation specialists. 
 
Additionally, we considered the likelihood of change in management’s assumptions and assessed  
the sensitivity of management’s base case impairment review to a change in the key assumptions  
both individually and collectively. 
 
 
Adequacy of working capital provisions 
Management judgement is required in determining  
the appropriate level of provision to be held in respect  
of non-recoverable trade receivables and inventories.  
At the year end, the Group held trade receivables  
of £424 million (net of £26 million provision) and 
inventories of £256 million (net of £22 million provision). 
Refer to notes 14 and 15 for details of these balances. 
 
 
We evaluated management’s assumptions used in calculating the bad debt provision and checked the 
calculations supporting the amount of provision including testing the integrity of the ageing reports 
used as a basis to calculate the provisions. In order to assess the reasonableness of the provision, we 
reviewed the ageing of receivables in comparison to previous years, reviewed the level of bad debt  
write offs in the current year and the prior year and checked the recoverability of outstanding debtors 
through examination of subsequent cash receipts. 
 
We assessed the reasonableness of the recorded level of inventory provision with reference to ageing  
of inventories and the level of inventory written off during the year. We evaluated the appropriateness 
of the percentages applied and tested the integrity of the inventory ageing analysis. We compared the 
actual sales value of a sample of inventory items to their book value to ascertain that the carrying value 
of inventories does not exceed their net realisable value. We evaluated the adequacy of provision for 
damaged stock during our observation of annual and perpetual inventory counts. 
Last year our report included one other risk which is not included in our report this year: SCA Packaging acquisition accounting. The risk of any further  
fair value adjustments arising since acquisition is no longer considered to be material to the Group financial statements. 
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the Audit Committee discussed on page 58. 
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and not to express  
an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the risks described above,  
and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.  82 Financial Statements

OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY 
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably 
knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results  
of our work. 
We determined materiality for the Group to be £12 million (2013/14: £10 million), which is approximately 5% (2013/14: 5%) of profit before tax and  
exceptional items. We exclude the effect of exceptional items to provide a stable basis for materiality, as these items are expected to be volatile year  
on year. Refer to note 4 for details of exceptional items. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £240,000 (2013/14: £200,000),  
as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee  
on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.  
Audits of all components are performed at a materiality level up to 50% of Group materiality. 
AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT 
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls and assessing the risks  
of material misstatement at the Group level.  
Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at seven components located in the United Kingdom, France, 
Germany, Italy and Netherlands which was consistent with the prior year. The component auditors provided an audit clearance to the Senior statutory 
auditor for each component. These seven components represent the principal business units within the Group’s key reportable segments and accordingly 
provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. The Group audit team takes an  
active part in the conduct of the audits at these seven components and follows a programme of planned site visits that is designed to ensure that the  
Senior statutory auditor or another senior member of the Group audit team visits each of the full scope components or attends close out meetings.  
This year, the Group audit team visited all of the full scope components or attended close out meetings. These components accounted for 51% of revenue 
and 52% of profit before tax and exceptional items. 
For the remaining locations the component auditor provided reporting to the Senior statutory auditor on the significant risks and material balances.  
In line with our programme of rotational visits, senior members of our audit team visited four components located in Denmark, United States, Spain  
and Slovakia. These remaining locations accounted for 43% of revenue and 42% of profit before tax and exceptional items. 
Where no visits were carried out, the Senior statutory auditor or another senior member of the Group audit team held discussions with the local audit partner 
in the current year. 
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no 
significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit or audit of significant 
risks and material balances. 
OPINION ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006 
In our opinion: 
 the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and 
 the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements. 
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION 
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records

visited by us; or 
 the parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters. 
Directors’ remuneration 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not been made or the

in the current year. 
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no 
significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit or audit of significant 
risks and material balances. 
OPINION ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006 
In our opinion: 
 the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and 
 the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements. 
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION 
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or 
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or 
 the parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters. 
Directors’ remuneration 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not been made or the  
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have nothing to report arising 
from these matters.

MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION CONTINUED 
Corporate Governance Statement 
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with ten 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review. 
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report 
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is: 
 materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or 
 apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or 
 otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit and the 
Directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the Annual Report appropriately discloses 
those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified  
any such inconsistencies or misleading statements. 
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITOR 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors. We also comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that 
our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards review 
team and independent partner reviews. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has 
been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group and the parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we  
read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and  
to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course  
of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
(a) Basis of preparation 
These financial statements are consolidated financial statements for the 
Group consisting of DS Smith Plc, a company registered in the UK, and all  
its subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘adopted IFRSs’), and with those 
parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under 
IFRS. The consolidated financial statements are also in compliance with 
IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).  
The Company has elected to prepare its parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting  
Practice (UK GAAP); these are presented on pages 130 to 134. 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical  
cost basis with the exception of assets and liabilities of certain financial 
instruments, employee benefit plans and share-based payments that  
are stated at their fair value. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going 
concern basis as set out on page 56 of the Directors’ Governance Report. 
The Directors consider that adequate resources exist for the Company  
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management 
to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect whether and 
how policies are applied and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expenses. Judgements made by management in the application 
of adopted IFRSs that have a significant effect on the financial statements 
and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment are discussed  
in accounting policy (x). 
No changes have been made to the Group’s accounting policies in the year 
ended 30 April 2015.  
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently in 
all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements. The 
accounting policies have been applied consistently by all Group entities. 
(b) Basis of consolidation 
(i) Subsidiaries 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated 
financial statements from the date that control commences until the date 
that control ceases. Control is achieved where the Company has the power 
to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as 
to obtain benefits from its activities. The results of subsidiaries acquired 
or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income 
statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date 
of disposal, as appropriate. Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains 
and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions are 
eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. A list of key 
subsidiaries is included note 34. 
(ii) Interests in equity accounted investments 
The Group’s interests in equity accounted investments comprise of interests 
in associates and joint ventures. An associate is an entity over which the 
Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the 
financial and operating policy decisions of the investment. A joint venture 
is an entity in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has 
rights to the net assets of the entity, rather than rights to its assets  
and obligations for its liabilities. 
Interests in associates and the joint venture are accounted for using  
the equity method. They are recognised initially at cost, which includes 
transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition the consolidated 
financial statements include the Group’s share of the profit or loss and  
other comprehensive income of equity accounted investments, until  
the date on which significant influence or joint control ceases.  
(iii) Non-controlling interests 
Non-controlling interests are shown as a component of equity in the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position net of the value of options 
over interests held by non-controlling interests in the Group’s subsidiaries. 
(iv) Business Combinations 
The acquisition method is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries. 
Identifiable net assets acquired (including intangibles) in a business 
combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. 
Where the measurement of the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired 
is incomplete at the end of the reporting period in which the combination 
occurs, the Group will report provisional fair values. Final fair values are 
determined within a year of the acquisition date and retrospectively applied. 
The excess of the consideration transferred and the amount of any  
non-controlling interest over the fair value of the identifiable assets 
(including intangibles), liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is 
recorded as goodwill. 
The consideration transferred is measured as the fair value of the assets 
given, equity instruments issued (if any), and liabilities assumed or incurred 
at the date of acquisition. 
Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred. 
The results of the subsidiaries acquired are included in the consolidated 
financial statements from the acquisition date. 
(c) Revenue 
Revenue comprises the fair value of the sale of goods and services,  
net of value added tax and other sales taxes, rebates and discounts and 
after eliminating sales within the Group.  
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when: 
 the Group has transferred the significant risks and rewards  
of ownership to the buyer; 
 all significant performance obligations have been met; 
 the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement  
nor effective control over the goods sold; 
 it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the 
transaction will flow to the Group; and  
 the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.  
This is typically when either the goods are loaded onto the collection 
vehicle if the buyer is collecting them, or when the goods are unloaded 
at the delivery address if the Group is responsible for delivery.  90 Financial Statements

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
(d) Supplier rebates 
The Group receives income from its suppliers, mainly in the form of volume 
based rebates and early settlement discounts. They are recognised as a 
reduction in operating costs in the year to which they relate. At the period 
end the Group is sometimes required to estimate supplier income due from 
annual agreements for volume rebates. 
Included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position are amounts 
receivable of £5m in respect of supplier rebates. 
(e) Government grants 
(i) Emission quotas 
The Group participates in Phase II of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. 
Emission quotas received in a period are initially recognised at a nominal 
value of nil. As a result, no asset or liability is initially recognised in the 
statement of financial position. A provision is recognised if there is any 
anticipated shortfall in the level of quotas received or purchased when 
compared with actual emissions in any given period, measured at the 
market price of such quotas at the reporting date. Excess emission  
quotas acquired as part of a business combination are recognised  
as intangible assets at their fair value on the date of acquisition. 
(ii) Other 
Other government grants are recognised in the statement of financial 
position initially as deferred income when there is reasonable assurance 
that they will be received and that the Group will comply with the conditions 
attached to them. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred 
are offset against the expenses in the same periods in which the expenses 
are incurred. Grants relating to assets are released to the income statement 
over the expected useful life of the asset to which it relates on a basis 
consistent with the depreciation policy. Depreciation is provided on the  
full cost of the assets before deducting grants. 
(f) Dividends 
Dividends attributable to the equity holders of the Company paid during  
the year are recognised directly in equity.  
(g) Foreign currency translation 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is  
the Group’s presentational currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are 
translated into the respective functional currencies of Group companies at 
the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date 
are translated into the functional currency at the foreign exchange rates 
ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation of 
monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange  
rates at the dates of the transactions. 
The assets and liabilities of all the Group entities that have a functional 
currency other than sterling are translated at the closing exchange rate 
at the reporting date. Income and expenses for each income statement 
are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a 
reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing  
on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated 
at the date of the transactions).  
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of  
the net investment in foreign entities, borrowings, and other financial 
instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised  
in the translation reserve. On the disposal of foreign currency entities,  
the cumulative exchange difference recorded in the translation reserve  
is taken to the Consolidated Income Statement as part of the gain or loss  
on disposal. 
(h) Intangible assets 
(i) Goodwill 
The recognition of business combinations requires the excess of the 
purchase price of acquisitions over the net book value of identifiable 
assets acquired to be allocated to the assets and liabilities of the acquired 
entity. The Group makes judgements and estimates in relation to the fair 
value allocation of the purchase price.  
Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. The useful 
life of goodwill is considered to be indefinite. Goodwill is allocated to the 
cash generating units (CGUs), or groups of CGUs, that are expected to  
benefit from the synergies of the combination and is tested annually  
for impairment; or more frequently if impairment is indicated.  
On disposal of a subsidiary or a jointly controlled entity, the attributable 
amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.  
(ii) Intellectual property 
Intellectual property is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation  
and impairment losses. 
(iii) Computer software 
Computer software that is integral to a related item of hardware is included 
within property, plant and equipment. All other computer software is 
treated as an intangible asset.  
(iv) Customer related 
Customer relationships, acquired as part of a business combination,  
are capitalised separately from goodwill and are carried at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment. 
(v) Other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated  
at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.    Financial Statements 91

(d) Supplier rebates 
The Group receives income from its suppliers, mainly in the form of volume 
based rebates and early settlement discounts. They are recognised as a 
reduction in operating costs in the year to which they relate. At the period 
end the Group is sometimes required to estimate supplier income due from 
annual agreements for volume rebates. 
Included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position are amounts 
receivable of £5m in respect of supplier rebates. 
(e) Government grants 
(i) Emission quotas 
The Group participates in Phase II of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. 
Emission quotas received in a period are initially recognised at a nominal 
value of nil. As a result, no asset or liability is initially recognised in the 
statement of financial position. A provision is recognised if there is any 
anticipated shortfall in the level of quotas received or purchased when 
compared with actual emissions in any given period, measured at the 
market price of such quotas at the reporting date. Excess emission  
quotas acquired as part of a business combination are recognised  
as intangible assets at their fair value on the date of acquisition. 
(ii) Other 
Other government grants are recognised in the statement of financial 
position initially as deferred income when there is reasonable assurance 
that they will be received and that the Group will comply with the conditions 
attached to them. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred 
are offset against the expenses in the same periods in which the expenses 
are incurred. Grants relating to assets are released to the income statement 
over the expected useful life of the asset to which it relates on a basis 
consistent with the depreciation policy. Depreciation is provided on the  
full cost of the assets before deducting grants. 
(f) Dividends 
Dividends attributable to the equity holders of the Company paid during  
the year are recognised directly in equity.

ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation of 
monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange  
rates at the dates of the transactions. 
The assets and liabilities of all the Group entities that have a functional 
currency other than sterling are translated at the closing exchange rate 
at the reporting date. Income and expenses for each income statement 
are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a 
reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing  
on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated 
at the date of the transactions).  
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of  
the net investment in foreign entities, borrowings, and other financial 
instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised  
in the translation reserve. On the disposal of foreign currency entities,  
the cumulative exchange difference recorded in the translation reserve  
is taken to the Consolidated Income Statement as part of the gain or loss

(h) Intangible assets continued 
(vi) Amortisation 
Amortisation of intangible assets (excluding goodwill) is charged to the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives  
of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. Intangible assets  
(other than goodwill) are amortised from the date they are available for use.  
The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
Intellectual property Up to 20 years
Computer software 3-5 years
Customer relationships 5-15 years
(i) Property, plant and equipment and other investments 
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses.  
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line  
basis over the estimated useful lives of each item of property, plant and 
equipment, and major components that are accounted for separately  
(or in the case of leased assets, the lease period, if shorter). Land is not 
depreciated. 
The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
Freehold and long leasehold properties 10-50 years
Plant and equipment, fixtures and fittings  
(including IT hardware) 
2-25 years
Motor vehicles 3-5 years
During the year, the estimated useful lives were reviewed and aligned,  
and the fair value exercise on the acquisition of SCA Packaging finalised.  
As a result, depreciation in the year was reduced by £7 million. 
Other investments consist of available for sale investments in unquoted 
equity and debt securities which are carried at cost, less any impairment, 
and restricted cash. 
Gains or losses arising on the sale of surplus property assets are recorded 
through operating profit before exceptional items. For further information 
on current year gains or losses, see note 27. 
(j) Impairment  
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets, including tangible and  
intangible non-current assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to 
determine whether there are any indicators of impairment. If any such 
indicators exist, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill  
is tested for impairment annually at the same time, regardless of the 
presence of an impairment indicator. An impairment loss is recognised 
whenever the carrying amount of an asset, collection of assets or its  
CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised  
in the income statement. 
(i) Cash generating units 
For the purposes of impairment testing, each segment, split by process, 
is a separate CGU. Impairment testing of property, plant and equipment 
and other intangibles is carried out at an individual CGU level. Goodwill 
impairment testing is carried out based on regional groupings of CGUs 
as illustrated in note 10, as this is the lowest level at which goodwill is 
monitored for internal management purposes. 
(ii) Calculation of recoverable amount 
The recoverable amount of the Group’s assets is calculated as the value-in-
use of the CGU to which the assets are attributed or the net selling price, if 
greater. Value-in-use is calculated by discounting the cash flows expected  
to be generated by the CGU/group of CGUs being tested for evidence of 
impairment. This is done using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the 
current assessment of the time value of money, and the country specific 
risks for which the cash flows have not been adjusted. For an asset that  
does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable 
amount is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs.  
(iii) Reversals of impairment 
Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed. In respect of  
other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in  
the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment 
loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does  
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net  
of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. 
(k) Derivative financial instruments  
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate, 
currency and commodity swaps, to manage interest rate, currency and 
commodity risks associated with the Group’s underlying business activities 
and the financing of these activities. The Group has a policy not to, and 
does not, undertake any speculative activity in these instruments.  
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on 
the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair 
value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
Derivative financial instruments are accounted for as hedges when 
designated as hedges at the inception of the contract and when the  
financial instruments provide an effective hedge of the underlying risk. 
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as: 
 fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the  
fair value of a recognised asset or liability; 
 cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows 
that is attributable to a particular risk associated with either a statement 
of financial position item or a highly probable forecast transaction; or 
 hedges of the net investment in a foreign entity. 
The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluing derivatives 
designated as hedging instruments depends on the nature of the hedging 
relationship as follows: 
Fair value hedges: the carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted for 
gains or losses attributable to the risk being hedged and the derivative is 
remeasured at fair value. Gains and losses from both the hedged item  
and the fair value of derivatives are taken to the income statement. The 
Group discontinues fair value hedge accounting if the hedging instrument 
expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge no longer meets the 
criteria for hedge accounting or the Group revokes the designation.  92 Financial Statements

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
(k) Derivative financial instruments continued 
Cash flow hedges: the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion 
is recognised in the income statement. Amounts taken to equity are 
transferred to the income statement in the same period during which  
the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale  
or purchase occurs. Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial 
asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial 
carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.  
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised  
without replacement or roll-over, the hedged transaction ceases to  
be highly probable, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts 
previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast 
transaction occurs and are transferred to the income statement or 
 to the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as  
above. If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts 
previously recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement. 
Hedges of net investment in a foreign entity: the effective portion of the 
gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity,  
while the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement. 
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement  
when the foreign entity is sold. 
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of all other 
derivatives are taken to the income statement. These may arise from 
derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied because they are  
not effective as hedging instruments. 
The net present value of the expected future payments under options  
over interests held by non-controlling interests in the Group’s subsidiaries 
are shown as a financial liability. At the end of each period, the valuation  
of the liability is reassessed with any changes recognised in profit or loss  
for the period. 
(l) Treasury shares 
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of  
the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised  
as a change in equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares 
and are presented as a deduction from total equity. 
(m) Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are stated at their cost less impairment provisions. 
(n) Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.  
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course  
of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. 
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in first-out principle and 
includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing  
them to their existing location and condition. In the case of manufactured 
inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of 
overheads based on normal operating capacity. 
(o) Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank 
overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the 
Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash 
equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows. Cash and cash 
equivalents are stated at amortised cost. 
Cash subject to contractual restrictions on use by the Group is excluded 
from cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated financial statements 
and presented within other investments in the Consolidated Statement  
of Financial Position. Restricted cash is stated at amortised cost. 
(p) Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, less attributable transaction 
costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are 
stated at amortised cost unless designated in a fair value hedge relationship, 
with borrowing costs being accounted for on an accruals basis in the income 
statement using the effective interest method.  
At the reporting date, accrued interest is recorded separately from the 
associated borrowings within current liabilities. 
(q) Employee benefits 
(i) Defined contribution schemes 
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised  
as an employee benefit expense within personnel expenses in the income 
statement, as incurred. 
(ii) Defined benefit schemes 
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension schemes  
is calculated separately for each scheme by estimating the amount of future 
benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current 
and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to its present value amount and 
recognised in the income statement as personnel expense; a corresponding 
liability for all future benefits is established on the statement of financial 
position and the fair value of any schemes’ assets is deducted.  
The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit rated bonds 
that have maturity dates approximating to the duration of the schemes’ 
obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using  
the projected unit method. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised 
immediately in the statement of comprehensive income. 
(iii) Share-based payment transactions 
The Group operates equity-settled share-based compensation plans.  
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant  
of the options is recognised as personnel expense, with a corresponding 
increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally 
become entitled to the awards. The fair value of the options granted is 
measured using a stochastic model, taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the options were granted. The total amount to  
be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the  
fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market 
vesting conditions.  
At each reporting date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of 
options that are expected to become exercisable. It recognises the impact 
of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and  
a corresponding adjustment to equity. 
(r) Provisions 
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group 
has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, a 
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation and it is probable 
that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
Provisions are discounted to present value where the effect is material.   Financial Statements 93

Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of all other 
derivatives are taken to the income statement. These may arise from 
derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied because they are  
not effective as hedging instruments. 
The net present value of the expected future payments under options  
over interests held by non-controlling interests in the Group’s subsidiaries 
are shown as a financial liability. At the end of each period, the valuation  
of the liability is reassessed with any changes recognised in profit or loss  
for the period. 
(l) Treasury shares 
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of  
the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised

(m) Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are stated at their cost less impairment provisions. 
(n) Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.  
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course  
of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. 
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in first-out principle and 
includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing  
them to their existing location and condition. In the case of manufactured 
inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of 
overheads based on normal operating capacity. 
(o) Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank 
overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the 
Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash 
equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows. Cash and cash 
equivalents are stated at amortised cost. 
Cash subject to contractual restrictions on use by the Group is excluded 
from cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated financial statements 
and presented within other investments in the Consolidated Statement  
of Financial Position. Restricted cash is stated at amortised cost. 
(p) Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, less attributable transaction 
costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are 
stated at amortised cost unless designated in a fair value hedge relationship, 
with borrowing costs being accounted for on an accruals basis in the income 
statement using the effective interest method.  
At the reporting date, accrued interest is recorded separately from the 
associated borrowings within current liabilities. 
(q) Employee benefits 
(i) Defined contribution schemes 
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised  
as an employee benefit expense within personnel expenses in the income 
statement, as incurred. 
(ii) Defined benefit schemes 
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension schemes  
is calculated separately for each scheme by estimating the amount of future 
benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current 
and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to its present value amount and 
recognised in the income statement as personnel expense; a corresponding 
liability for all future benefits is established on the statement of financial 
position and the fair value of any schemes’ assets is deducted.  
The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit rated bonds 
that have maturity dates approximating to the duration of the schemes’ 
obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using  
the projected unit method. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised 
immediately in the statement of comprehensive income. 
(iii) Share-based payment transactions 
The Group operates equity-settled share-based compensation plans.  
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant  
of the options is recognised as personnel expense, with a corresponding 
increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally 
become entitled to the awards. The fair value of the options granted is 
measured using a stochastic model, taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the options were granted. The total amount to  
be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the  
fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market 
vesting conditions.  
At each reporting date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of 
options that are expected to become exercisable. It recognises the impact 
of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and  
a corresponding adjustment to equity.

A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group 
has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, a

that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
Provisions are discounted to present value where the effect is material.

(s) Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are stated at their cost. 
(t) Leases 
(i) Finance leases 
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at 
the inception of the lease at the lower of their fair value and the present value 
of the minimum lease payments. Depreciation on leased assets is charged to 
the income statement on the same basis as owned assets. Leasing payments 
are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements and the interest is 
charged to the income statement so that a constant periodic rate of interest  
is recognised on the outstanding balance of the liability. 
(ii) Operating leases 
Operating lease rentals are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement  
on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any premium or discount on the 
acquisition of a lease is spread over the life of the lease on a straight-line basis. 
(u) Taxation 
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred  
tax. Income tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates 
to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, 
using tax rates enacted in each jurisdiction at the reporting date, and any 
adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
The Group is subject to corporate taxes in a number of different jurisdictions 
and judgement is required in determining the appropriate provision for 
transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In such 
circumstances, the Group recognises liabilities for anticipated taxes based  
on the best information available and where the anticipated liability is both 
probable and estimable. Such liabilities are classified as current when the 
Group expects to settle the liability within 12 months with the remainder 
as non-current. Any interest and penalties accrued are included in income 
taxes both in the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position. Where the final outcome of such matters 
differs from the amount recorded, any differences may impact the income 
tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which the final determination 
is made. 
Deferred tax is provided for using the balance sheet liability method, 
providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts  
used for taxation purposes.  
The tax effect of certain temporary differences is not recognised, principally 
with respect to goodwill; temporary differences arising on the initial 
recognition of assets or liabilities (other than those arising in a business 
combination or in a manner that initially impacts accounting or taxable 
profit); and temporary differences relating to investment in subsidiaries 
and equity accounted investees to the extent that they will probably not 
reverse in the foreseeable future and the Group is able to control the 
reversal of such temporary differences. The amount of deferred tax 
provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement  
of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted  
or substantively enacted at the reporting date.  
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can  
be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no  
longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
(v) Assets held for sale  
Non-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities  
that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than  
through continuing use, are classified as held for sale. Immediately  
before classification as held for sale, the assets, or components of a disposal  
group, are remeasured in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. 
Thereafter, generally the assets, or disposal group, are measured at the 
lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. Any 
impairment loss on a disposal group is first allocated to goodwill, and then to 
the remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis, except that no loss is 
allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets and employee 
benefit assets, which continue to be measured in accordance with the 
Group’s accounting policies. Impairment losses on initial classification  
as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are 
recognised in the income statement. Gains are not recognised in excess  
of any cumulative impairment loss. 
(w) Exceptional items  
Items of income or expenditure that are significant by their nature, size 
or incidence, and for which separate presentation would assist in the 
understanding of the trading and financial results of the Group, are classified 
and disclosed as exceptional items. Such items include business disposals, 
restructuring and optimisation, acquisition related and integration costs,  
and impairments. 
(x) Critical accounting policies  
The application of the Group’s accounting policies requires management 
to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions 
affect the reported assets and liabilities and financial results of the Group. 
Actual outcomes could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. 
The Group’s accounting policies that are most critical to an understanding 
of the results and position of the Group, and the judgements involved in  
their application, are as follows: 
(i) Impairments 
When applying IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, the Group compares the 
carrying value of tangible and intangible non-current assets with the  
higher of their net realisable value and value-in-use to determine 
whether an impairment exists. Impairment testing is an area requiring  
management judgement.  
To determine the present value of expected future cash flows, certain 
assumptions have to be made in respect of uncertain matters including 
management’s expectations of (a) the discount rates reflecting the risks 
involved, (b) the timing and quantum of capital expenditure, (c) short and 
long-term growth rates and (d) the future development of the business. 
Whilst the Directors consider their assumptions to be realistic, if actual 
results differ from expectations the Group’s impairment evaluation could 
be affected. In addition, the use of different estimates, assumptions and 
judgements, in particular those involved in (a) determining a value based on 
our current expectations of future conditions and the associated cash flows 
from the Group’s operations, (b) our determination of the level at which 
groups of assets can be reasonably tested for impairment separately from 
other parts of the business, and (c) our treatment of centrally held assets, 
could each result in material differences in the carrying values of assets  
and assessments of impairment. See note 10 for additional information.  94 Financial Statements

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED  
(x) Critical accounting policies continued 
(ii) Pensions and other employee benefits 
IAS 19 Employee Benefits (Revised 2011) requires the Group to make 
assumptions including, but not limited to, rates of inflation, discount  
rates and life expectancies. The use of different assumptions, in any of  
the above calculations, could have a material effect on the accounting 
values of the relevant statement of financial position assets and liabilities 
which could also result in a change to the cost of such liabilities as 
recognised in profit or loss over time. These assumptions are subject  
to periodic review. See note 25 for additional information. 
(iii) Provisions  
The Group measures provisions at the Directors’ best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date. These 
estimates are made, taking account of information available and different 
possible outcomes, and are reviewed on a regular basis. 
(iv) Taxation 
The Group’s tax payable on profits is determined based on tax laws and 
regulations that apply in each of the numerous jurisdictions in which the 
Group operates. The Group is required to exercise judgement in determining 
income tax provisions, along with the recognition of deferred tax 
assets/liabilities. While the Group aims to ensure that estimates recorded 
are accurate, the actual amounts could be different from those expected. 
 
(y) IFRS standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective 
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) have issued new standards  
and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements.

and hedge accounting.  
The Group does not anticipate that the adoption of the remaining standards and interpretations that are effective for the year ending 30 April 2016 will 
have a material effect on its financial statements. These standards have all been endorsed by the EU, with the exception of IFRS 9 and Amendments to

2. SEGMENT REPORTING 
Operating segments 
IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires operating segments to be identified on the same basis as is used internally for the review of performance and  
allocation of resources by the Group Chief Executive (who is the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined by IFRS 8). Further details of these segments  
are given in the Strategic Report on pages 3 and 26 to 27.  
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Central administration costs  
are allocated to the individual segments on a consistent basis year-on-year. All assets and liabilities have been analysed by segment, except for items of a 
financing nature, taxation balances, employee benefit liabilities and current and non-current asset investments. Debt and associated interest is managed  
at a Group level and therefore has not been allocated across the segments.

Goodwill impairment tests – key assumptions and methodology 
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired. The recoverable amounts  
of the groups of CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations. No impairment arose in the year ended 30 April 2015 as the recoverable amount  
of the groups of CGUs, based on value-in-use calculations, exceeded the carrying amounts.  
The key assumptions in the value-in-use calculations are: 
 the cash flow forecasts have been derived from the most recent Board approved budget for the year ending 30 April 2016 and are based upon past 
performance, known changes and expectations of current market conditions, taking into account the cyclical nature of the business; 
 the sales volume and price assumptions underlying the cash flow forecasts is the Directors’ estimates of likely future changes based upon historic 
performance and the current economic outlooks for the economies in which the Group operates. These are viewed as the key operating assumptions  
as they determine the Directors’ approach to margin and cost maintenance;  
 the cash flow forecasts for capital expenditure are based upon past experience and include the replacement capital expenditure required to generate 
the terminal cash flows;  
 cash flows beyond the budgeted period (2017 and beyond) have been determined using a long-term growth rate specific to each of the CGU groups  
based upon external sources such as the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook Database. This resulted in an average growth rate for  
the total Group of 1.7%; and  
 the pre-tax adjusted discount rate is derived from the weighted average cost of capital (‘WACC’) for the Group of 9.5% (2013/14: 9.5%). The WACC 
is a function of the cost of debt and equity. The cost of equity is largely based upon the risk free rate for 30 year German Bund yields (70%) and 30 
year UK gilts (30%), adjusted for the relevant country market risk premium, ranging from 0% to 3.75%, which reflects the increased risk of investing  
in country specific equities and the relative volatilities of the equity of the Group compared to the market as a whole. This Group rate has been adjusted  
for the risks inherent in the countries in which the CGU group operates that are not reflected in the cash flow projections. 
Goodwill impairment tests – sensitivities 
The value-in-use is based upon anticipated discounted future cash flows and results in significant headroom across all CGU groups. Whilst the Directors 
believe the assumptions used are realistic, it is possible that a reduction in the headroom would occur if any of the above key assumptions were 
adversely changed. Factors which could cause an impairment are: 
 significant underperformance relative to the forecast; and 
 deteriorations in the economies in which the Group operates. 
To support their assertions, the Directors’ have conducted sensitivity analyses to determine the impact that would result from the above situations. 
Key sensitivities tested included future growth and discount rates. In these cases, if estimates of future growth were reduced to 0% per annum, or if 
the estimated discount rates applied to the cash flows were increased by 1%, there would still be significant headroom to support the carrying value 
of the assets.  
Based on this analysis the Directors believe that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions detailed above would cause the carrying value 
of CGU groups to exceed their recoverable amounts. Therefore at 30 April 2015 no impairment charge is required against the carrying value of goodwill.   Financial Statements 105

In July 2014 the Group acquired the remaining 50% interest in Italmaceri S.r.l.. In accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements  the Group  
ceased equity accounting for its initial 50% interest on the transaction date when the Group gained control. At 30 April 2015 Italmaceri S.r.l. is accounted  
for as a 100% owned subsidiary and is fully consolidated into the Group financial statements. 
During the year ended 30 April 2014, the Group adopted IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements. As such, the Group’s 50% interest in Italmaceri S.r.l. changed from 
proportionate consolidation to equity accounting in the prior period, as it was classified as a joint venture.  
Principal equity accounted investments

Lantero Group Packaging Spain 25.0% 25.0%
Italmaceri S.r.l. Recycling Italy 100.0% 50.0%
The Group accounts for its investments in Rubezhansk and the Turkish Group using the equity method as associates because the Group has the ability  
to exercise significant influence over the investment due to the Group’s equity holdings. 
Rubezhansk 
For four months during the year ended 30 April 2015, the foreign exchange rate between the Ukrainian Hryvnia weakened against the US dollar by over  
10% in each month driven by the ongoing political unrest in Ukraine. The Group’s share of the resultant post-tax foreign exchange loss on retranslation  
of the associate’s US dollar loan liability has been classified as an exceptional item in the financial statements for the year (note 4). The Group continues  
to monitor the carrying values of its interest with particular reference to the ongoing political unrest.

The majority of the Group’s trade receivables are due for maturity within 90 days of due date. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables 
are limited due to the Group’s customer base being large and diverse. Management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the 
normal provision for bad and doubtful receivables.

a new finance lease entered in the year of £2m.

Borrowings are unsecured and measured at amortised cost, except for £14m of note purchase agreements in a fair value hedge relationship 
(30 April 2014: £77m).  
In May 2014, the Group refinanced its committed bank borrowing facilities. The syndicated term loan facility, under which €380m was outstanding at  
30 April 2014, was repaid on 23 May 2014, and replaced with a €300m syndicated bank term loan facility maturing in May 2017. This facility bears interest  
at a margin over EURIBOR. The Group has entered into interest rate swap derivatives with bank counterparties to fix a proportion of the interest on this 
facility in compliance with Group hedging policy on interest rate risk management.  
In addition, on the same date, the £610m syndicated bank revolving credit facility was repaid and replaced with a £800m syndicated bank revolving  
credit facility maturing in 2019, but with options to extend this facility to 2021. Advances drawn down under the facility bear interest at a margin over  
the applicable LIBOR or EURIBOR rate. Since the year end the maturity of this facility has been extended to May 2020. 
There have been no breaches of covenants during the year ended 30 April 2015 in relation to the above loans and borrowings. 
Of the total borrowing facilities available to the Group, the undrawn committed facilities available at 30 April were as follows:

The Group’s activities expose the Group to a number of key risks which have the potential to affect its ability to achieve its business objectives. A summary  
of the Group’s key financial risks and the policies and objectives in place to manage these risks is set out in the Financial Review and Principal Risk sections  
of the Strategic Report. 
The derivative financial instruments set out in this note have been entered into in line with the Group’s risk management objectives.  
The Group’s treasury policy prohibits entering into speculative transactions.

The fair value is the amount for which an asset or liability could be exchanged or settled on an arm’s-length basis. For financial instruments carried at fair 
value, market prices or rates are used to determine fair value where an active market exists. The Group uses forward prices for valuing forward foreign 
exchange and commodity contracts and uses valuation models with present value calculations based on market yield curves to value note purchase 
agreements, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps. All derivative financial instruments are shown at fair value in the Consolidated Statement 
of Financial Position.  
Under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, only the portions of the note purchase agreements which form part of an effective 
fair value hedge are carried at fair value in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The majority of the Group's note purchase agreements are 
in effective cash flow and net investment hedges and are therefore held at amortised cost. The fair values of financial assets and liabilities which bear 
floating rates of interest are estimated to be equivalent to their book values. 
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures  requires the classification of fair value measurements using the fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance  
of the inputs used in making the assessments.  
All of the Group’s financial instruments are Level 2 financial instruments in accordance with the fair value hierarchy, where inputs are observable for the  
asset and liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).   Financial Statements 113

(ii) Fair value hedges 
At 30 April 2015, the Group held interest rate and foreign exchange swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate and foreign exchange risk 
on fixed rate debt payable by the Group. The receive leg of the swap contracts is identical in all critical aspects to the terms of the underlying debt and 
therefore the hedging is treated as highly effective. The pre-tax gain on hedging derivative instruments taken to the income statement during the  
year was £5m (2013/14: loss of £11m) offset by a pre-tax loss on the fair value of the debt of £5m (2013/14: gain of £12m). 
(iii) Hedges of net investments in foreign operations 
The Group holds cross-currency interest rate swap contracts as hedges of long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries. The pre-tax gain on the hedges 
recognised in equity during the year was £30m (2013/14: gain of £7m). This gain is matched by a similar loss in equity on the retranslation of the hedged 
foreign subsidiary’s net assets resulting in a net gain of £nil (2013/14: net gain of £nil) treated as hedge ineffectiveness in the income statement.  114 Financial Statements

Net debt 651 827
Total equity 1,018 1,131
Managed capital 1,669 1,958
There have been no changes to the components of managed capital during the year. Managed capital is different from capital employed (defined as  
property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, working capital, capital debtors/creditors, provisions and assets/liabilities held for sale). 
Managed capital relates to our sources of funding, whereas return on average capital employed is our measure of the level of return being generated 
by the asset base.  
The Group funds its operations from the following sources of capital: operating cash flow, borrowings, shareholders’ equity and, where appropriate,  
disposals of non-core businesses. The Group’s objective is to achieve a capital structure that results in an appropriate cost of capital whilst providing  
flexibility in short and medium-term funding so as to accommodate significant investments or acquisitions. The Group also aims to maintain a strong  
balance sheet and to provide continuity of financing by having a range of maturities and borrowing from a variety of sources.  
The Group’s overall treasury objectives are to ensure sufficient funds are available for the Group to carry out its strategy and to manage certain financial 
risks to which the Group is exposed, as described elsewhere in this note. The Group’s treasury strategy is controlled through the Balance Sheet Committee 
which meets regularly and includes the Group Finance Director, the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, the Group Financial Controller, the  
Group Treasurer and the Group Tax Manager. The Group Treasury function operates in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board  
and controlled by the Group Treasurer. The function arranges funding for the Group, provides a service to operations and implements strategies for financial 
risk management. 
(ii) Market risk 
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument fluctuate because of a change in market prices. The Group is exposed  
to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. 
Interest rate risk 
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as borrowings are arranged at fixed interest rates exposing it to fair value risk and floating interest rates exposing it 
to future cash flow risk. The risk is managed by maintaining a mix of fixed and floating-rate borrowings and by the use of interest rate swap contracts which 
modify the interest payable on the Group’s underlying debt instruments. The Group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities 
are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note. 
At 30 April 2015, 79% of the Group’s interest-bearing loans and borrowings were at fixed rates of interest (30 April 2014: 71%). The sensitivity analysis 
below shows the impact on profit and total equity of a 100 basis points rise in market interest rates (representing management’s assessment of the 
reasonably possible change in interest rates) in all currencies in which the Group had variable-rate borrowings at 30 April 2015. 
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year, the interest rates on all variable-rate external interest-bearing loans and cash deposits 
have been increased by 100 basis points, and the resulting increase in the net interest charge has been adjusted for the effect of the Group’s interest 
rate derivatives. Changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments only affect the Group’s income statement. 
The results are presented before non-controlling interests and tax.

Under interest rate swap contracts the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest rate amounts calculated on agreed 
notional principal amounts. At 30 April 2015, losses of £17m (30 April 2014: losses of £20m) net of tax are deferred in equity in respect of cash flow hedges  
of interest rate risk. These will be recycled to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item also affects the income statement, which will be

Foreign exchange risk 
Foreign exchange risk on investments 
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from net investments in Group entities, the functional currencies of which differ from the Group’s 
presentational currency, sterling. The Group partly hedges this exposure through borrowings denominated in foreign currencies and through cross-currency 
swap contracts. Gains and losses for hedges of net investments are recognised in equity. 
Foreign exchange risk on borrowings 
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk on borrowings denominated in foreign currencies. The Group hedges this exposure through cross-currency 
swaps designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges.  
Foreign exchange risk on transactions 
Foreign currency transaction risk arises where a business unit makes product sales or purchases in a currency other than its functional currency.  
Part of this risk is hedged using foreign exchange contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges.  
At 30 April 2015, losses net of tax deferred in equity in respect of cash flow hedges were £nil (30 April 2014: £nil). These amounts will be recycled  
to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item also affects the income statement, which will occur within one year. 
The Group’s main currency exposure is to the euro and the following significant exchange rates applied during the year: 
 2015 2014
 Average Closing Average Closing
euro 1.290 1.368 1.191 1.215
The following sensitivity analysis shows the impact on the Group’s results of a 10% increase and decrease in the sterling exchange rate against all other 
currencies representing management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The analysis is restricted to financial 
instruments denominated in a foreign currency and excludes the impact of financial instruments designated as net investment or fair value hedges. 
Net investment and fair value hedges are excluded as the impact of the foreign exchange movements on these are offset by equal and opposite  
movements in the hedged items. 
The results are presented before non-controlling interests and tax.

Commodity risk 
The Group’s main commodity exposures are to changes in gas and electricity prices. The majority of this commodity price risk is managed by a combination  
of physical supply agreements and derivative instruments. At 30 April 2015, losses of £10m net of tax are deferred in equity in respect of cash flow hedges  
in accordance with IAS 39 (30 April 2014: losses of £11m). These will be recycled to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item also affects 
the income statement, which will occur within three years.  
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase in these prices, which is management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change, 
on average, over any given year. A decrease of 10% in these prices would produce an opposite effect on equity. As all of the Group’s commodity financial 
instruments achieve hedge accounting under IAS 39, there is no impact on profit for either year. 
The results are presented before non-controlling interests and tax.

(iii) Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to perform or fail to pay amounts due, causing financial loss to the 
Group. In the current economic environment, the Group has placed increased emphasis on the management of credit risk. The carrying amount of financial 
assets at 30 April 2015 was £689m and is analysed in note 21(a). This represents the maximum credit risk exposure.  
Credit risk on financial instruments held with financial institutions is assessed and managed by reference to the long-term credit ratings assigned to that 
counterparty by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s credit rating agencies. There are no significant concentrations of credit risk. 
See note 15 for information on credit risk with respect to trade receivables. 
(iv) Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group, although solvent, will have difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities as they fall due. 
The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining a sufficient level of undrawn committed borrowing facilities. At 30 April 2015, the Group had £649m 
of undrawn committed borrowing facilities (30 April 2014: £496m). The Group mitigates its refinancing risk by raising its debt requirements from a number  
of different sources with a range of maturities.

legislation. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available 
against which the Group can utilise these benefits. 
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £286m (30 April 2014: £206m) relating to unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries  
as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable  
future. The temporary differences at 30 April 2015 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK  
of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas jurisdiction in which these 
subsidiaries operate.

The restructuring provision includes amounts associated with the closures, restructuring and integration costs described in note 4. Other provisions  
mainly relate to site restorations and to provisions for vacant leaseholds and various legal claims. The timing of the utilisation of these provisions is  
uncertain, except where the associated costs are contractual, in which case the provision is utilised over the time period specified in the contract.

Hedging reserve 
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged 
transactions that have not yet occurred.  
Share premium 
The share premium account represents the difference between the issue price and the nominal value of shares issued.  
Own shares  
The reserve for the Company’s own shares comprises the cost of the Company’s shares held by the Group. The Group operates a General Employee Benefit 
Trust, which acquires shares in the Company that can be used to satisfy the requirements of the Performance Share Plan and the Share Matching Plan.  
At 30 April 2015, the Trust held 0.1m shares (30 April 2014: 0.5m shares). The market value of the shares at 30 April 2015 was £0.3m (30 April 2014: £2m). 
Dividends receivable on the shares owned by the Trust have been waived. 
Non-controlling interests 
The Group has various put options in relation to subsidiaries with non-controlling interests. The Group records a liability at the net present value of 
the expected future payments, with a corresponding entry against non-controlling interests in respect of the non-controlling shareholders’ put option, 
measured at fair value. At the end of each period, the valuation of the liability is reassessed with any changes recorded within finance costs through the 
income statement and then transferred out of retained earnings into non-controlling interests.

Employee benefit schemes 
At 30 April 2015, the Group operated a number of employee benefit arrangements for the benefit of its employees throughout the world. The plans are 
provided through both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements and their legal status and control vary depending on the conditions and 
practices in the countries concerned.  
Pension scheme trustees and representatives of the Group work with those managing the employee benefit arrangements to monitor the effects on the 
arrangements of changes in financial markets and the impact of uncertainty in assumption, and to develop strategies that could mitigate the risks to which 
these employee benefit schemes expose the Group. 
UK schemes 
The DS Smith Group Pension Scheme (the ‘Group Scheme’) is a UK funded final salary defined benefit scheme providing pensions and lump sum benefits  
to members and dependants. The Group Scheme closed to future accrual from 30 April 2011 with pensions calculated based on pensionable salaries up  
to the point of closure (or the date of leaving the Group Scheme, if earlier). The Group Scheme has a normal retirement age of 65 although some members  
are able to take their benefits earlier than this. Increases to pensions are affected by changes in the rate of inflation for the majority of members.  
The Group Scheme is governed by a Trustee Company (DS Smith Pension Trustees Limited), which is comprised of a Board of Trustee Directors  
(the ‘Trustee Board’) and is independent of the Group. The Trustee Board is responsible for managing the operation, funding and investment strategy  
of the Group Scheme.

UK legislation requires the Trustee Board to carry out valuations at least every three years and to target full funding over an appropriate period of time,  
taking into account the current circumstances of the Group Scheme and employer on a basis that prudently reflects the risk to which the Group Scheme  
is exposed. The most recent valuation was carried out as at 30 April 2013, following which a deficit recovery plan was agreed with the Trustee Board on  
18 July 2014. This recovery plan agreed that the Group would remove the deficit by paying annual contributions, starting at £15.7m in the year ended  
30 April 2015 and increasing by 2% per annum, for a period of 8 years and 9 months, such that the final contribution is made by 31 January 2023.  
As part of the 30 April 2010 valuation, the Trustee Board and the Group agreed to put in place a secondary Long-Term Funding Target (the ‘LTFT’),  
in addition to the statutory funding requirement, the purpose of which is to achieve material additional security for the Group Scheme’s members.  
The objective of the LTFT is for the Group Scheme to be funded to a level by 30 April 2035 that does not rely on contributions from the employer. 
The Group Scheme’s assets are invested in a diversified range of assets, as noted above. A portion of the assets are invested in inflation-indexed bonds to 
provide a partial hedge against inflation and the Group Scheme has agreed a process that moves assets from corporate bonds to index-linked gilts when 
specific financial targets or triggers are met. If inflation increases, the Group Scheme’s obligation will be likely to increase more than the change in the fair 
value of the assets which would result in an increase in the net liability. The Group Scheme’s overseas equity is exposed to currency risk and approximately 
50% of this exposure is hedged back to sterling. To help the Trustee Board to monitor, review and assess investment matters, the Investment and Funding 
Committee (the ‘IFC’), which consists of representatives from the Trustee Board and the Group, meets on a quarterly basis throughout the year.  
The Group Scheme exposes the Group to risks, such as longevity risk, currency risk, inflation risk, interest rate risk and investment risk. As the Group Scheme’s 
obligation is to provide lifetime pension benefits to members upon retirement, increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the Group Scheme’s 
liabilities. Other assumptions used to value the defined benefit obligation are also uncertain. 
The largest defined contribution arrangement operated by the Group is in the UK. The UK defined contribution scheme is a trust-based arrangement offering 
members a range of investments. All assets are held independently from the Group. The Group also operates a small unfunded arrangement in the UK. 
Overseas schemes 
The countries where the Group operates the most significant defined benefit post-retirement arrangements are: 
 France – various mandatory retirement indemnities, post-retirement medical plans and jubilee arrangements (benefits paid to employees after 
completion of a certain number of years of service) the majority of which are determined by the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement; 
 Italy – mandatory end-of-service lump sum benefits in respect of pre-2007 service;  
 Switzerland – funded scheme, affiliated to a fully insured joint foundation;  
 Germany – jubilee arrangements and non-contributory defined benefit pension schemes; and 
 Netherlands – transitional arrangements on closure of defined benefit scheme. 
In general, local trustees or similar bodies manage the post-retirement and medical plans in accordance with local regulations. Other employee benefits  
relate to pre-retirement benefits in Germany.  
Overseas schemes expose the Group to risks such as longevity risk, currency risk, inflation risk, interest rate risk, investment risk, life expectancy risk and 
healthcare cost risk. Actions taken by the local regulator, or changes to legislation, could result in stronger local funding requirements for pension schemes, 
which could affect the Group’s future cash flow.

The Group made agreed contributions of £16m to the Group Scheme in 2014/15 (2013/14: £15m). A charge over certain assets of the Group has been  
made as security for certain unfunded arrangements. The Group’s current best estimate of contributions expected to the Group Scheme in the year ending 
30 April 2016 is approximately £16m.  
Significant actuarial assumptions 
Principal actuarial assumptions for the Group Scheme are as follows: 
 2015 2014
Discount rate for scheme liabilities 3.5% 4.4%
Inflation 2.1% 2.3%
Pre-retirement pension increases 1.9% 2.3%
Future pension increases for pre 30 April 2005 service 2.2% 2.3%
Future pension increases for post 30 April 2005 service 1.8% 2.1%
For other overseas arrangements, the weighted average actuarial assumptions are a discount rate of 1.2% (30 April 2014: 2.7%) and an inflation rate  
of 1.4% (30 April 2014: 2.4%). 
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on actuarial advice and in accordance with the relevant standard mortality tables in each 
country. For the Group Scheme at 30 April 2015, the mortality base table used is S1NMA/S1NFA (year of birth) with a +1 year age rating, with CMI 2014 
projections with a 1.25% per annum long-term rate of improvement used for future longevity improvement. At 30 April 2014 the mortality base table  
used is S1NMA/S1NFA (year of birth) with a +1 year age rating, with CMI 2013 projections with a 1.25% per annum long-term rate of improvement used  
for future longevity improvement. As part of the Group Scheme actuarial valuation exercise the projected life expectancies were as follows: 
 2015 2014
 Male Female Male Female
Life expectancy at age 65  
Member currently aged 65 21.5 23.9 21.4 23.8

Sensitivity analysis  
The sensitivity of the liabilities in the Group Scheme to each significant actuarial assumption is summarised in the following table, showing the impact on  
the defined benefit obligation if each assumption is altered by the amount specified in isolation, whilst assuming that all other variables remain the same.  
In practice, this approach is not necessarily realistic since some assumptions are related. This sensitivity analysis applies to the defined benefit obligation  
only and not to the net defined benefit pension liability, the measurement of which depends on a number of factors including the fair value of plan assets.

26. SHARE-BASED PAYMENT EXPENSE 
The Group’s share-based payment arrangements are as follows: 
(i) A Performance Share Plan (PSP). Awards under the PSP normally become exercisable after three years subject to remaining in service and the 
satisfaction of performance conditions measured over the three financial years commencing with the year of grant. Awards have been made  
under the PSP annually since 2008, originally based on the following performance measures, in the proportions shown below: 
i. the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) compared to the constituents of the Industrial Goods and Services Supersector within the FTSE 250; 
ii. average adjusted earnings per share (EPS); and 
iii. average adjusted return on average capital employed (ROACE). 
Awards since 2010 are subject to three performance measures: 
i. 50% of each award based on a TSR component;  
ii. 25% of each award based on average adjusted EPS; and 
iii. 25% of each award based on average adjusted ROACE. 
The 2010 and 2011 awards have vested, but have not yet been fully exercised.

26. SHARE-BASED PAYMENT EXPENSE

Awards since 2010 are subject to three performance measures: 
i. 50% of each award based on a TSR component;  
ii. 25% of each award based on average adjusted EPS; and 
iii. 25% of each award based on average adjusted ROACE. 
The 2010 and 2011 awards have vested, but have not yet been fully exercised.

26. SHARE-BASED PAYMENT EXPENSE CONTINUED 
(ii) The Substitute Share Bonus Award for Mr M W Roberts is subject to substantially the same terms as the Company’s Deferred Share Bonus Plan (see (iii)), 
except that the vesting date was 1 September 2013. The Substitute Share Bonus Award vested in full on the vesting date and has been fully exercised.  
Mr Roberts was entitled to a cash payment on vesting, representing a value equivalent to the dividends which would have been paid on his vested shares 
while they were subject to his awards. There were no performance conditions governing the vesting of the Substitute Share Bonus Award because the 
awards they replicated had no performance conditions attaching to them. 
(iii) A Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP) is operated for Executive Directors and, from 2012/13, for senior executives. Shares awarded under the Plan 
will vest automatically if the Director or senior executive is still employed by the Company three years after the grant of the award. 
(iv) A Share Matching Plan (SMP) is operated for Executive Directors and senior executives with the first award made in 2012/13. The award will vest after 
three years subject to remaining in service and the satisfaction of performance conditions measured over the three financial years commencing with  
the year of grant. The performance conditions of the award are based 50% on average adjusted EPS and 50% on average adjusted ROACE. No further 
awards under this Plan will be made subsequent to the 2014/15 award granted in July 2014. 
(v) A Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTI) is operated for selected senior managers with the first award made in 2013/14. The award will vest after three years 
subject to remaining in service and the satisfaction of performance conditions measured over the three financial years commencing with the year of 
grant. The performance conditions of the award are based 50% on average adjusted EPS and 50% on average adjusted ROACE. 
(vi) A Sharesave Plan was introduced in the UK in January 2011. All UK employees of the Company and participating subsidiaries were eligible to participate in 
this Plan. Under this HMRC approved Plan options are granted to participants who have contracted to save up to £250 per month over a period of three 
years at a discount of up to 20% to the average closing mid-market price of a DS Smith Plc ordinary share on the three dealing days prior to invitation. 
Options cannot normally be exercised until a minimum of three years has elapsed. In common with most plans of this type there are no performance 
conditions applicable to options granted under this Plan. The first award under this Plan has now vested and has been fully exercised. An international 
Sharesave Plan was introduced in January 2014. The main provisions of this are the same as for the January 2011 Plan, subject to minor country specific 
variances. A standard US Stock Purchase Plan, which received shareholder approval at the 2014 AGM, was also introduced in January 2014. US employees 
of the Group are eligible to participate in this Plan. Options are granted to participants who have contracted to save up to $405 per month over a period  
of two years at a discount of up to 15% to the average closing mid-market price of a DS Smith Plc ordinary share on the day before grant. Options cannot 
normally be exercised until a minimum of two years has elapsed. In common with most plans of this type there are no performance conditions applicable  
to options granted under this Plan. 
Full details of the awards described in (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (vi) are set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 64 to 78.

26. SHARE-BASED PAYMENT EXPENSE CONTINUED 
The average share price of the Company during the financial year was 306.2 pence (2013/14: 291.2 pence). 
The fair value of awards granted in the period relates to the PSP, DSBP and SMP schemes. 
The fair value of the PSP award granted during the year, determined using the stochastic valuation model, was £3.7m. The significant inputs into the model 
were: a share price of 263.6p for the PSP at the grant date; the exercise prices shown above; an expected initial volatility of the share price of 23.4% and 
long-term volatility of 28.8%; the scheme life disclosed above; an annual risk-free interest rate of 1.47% and an expected dividend yield of nil. The volatility 
of share price returns measured as the standard deviation of expected share price returns is based on statistical analysis of average weekly share prices  
from 1 January 1970. 
The total charge for the year relating to share-based payments recognised as personnel expenses was £5m (2013/14: £4m).

30. CAPITAL COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
At 30 April 2015, the Group had committed to incur capital expenditure of £3m (30 April 2014: £3m). 
The Group is not subject to a material litigation but has a number of contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business on behalf of trading 
subsidiaries including, inter alia, intellectual property disputes and regulatory enquiries on areas such as health and safety, environmental, and anti-trust. 
No losses are anticipated to arise on these contingent liabilities.  
As a result of previous acquisitions, various contingent liabilities were identified and included within provisions, as required by IFRS 3 Business Combinations. 
Whilst it is difficult to reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of these claims, the Directors’ best estimate has been updated and included in the closing 
provision balance at 30 April 2015.  
At the reporting date the Group had committed to the acquisition of the Duropack group subject to competition clearance. Clearance was obtained on  
31 May 2015. See note 33 for further information.   Financial Statements 127

33. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
(a) Acquisition of Duropack 
On 31 May 2015, the Group acquired the Duropack business. The acquisition was effected by the purchase of equity of the Duropack business for €305m on  
a cash, debt and, to the extent legally possible and commercially practicable, pension free basis. This is subject to customary post-completion adjustments. 
Duropack, a recycled corrugated board packaging business, has market-leading positions across south eastern Europe, holding the number one or two 
position in many of the geographies in which it operates. It is well invested with high quality assets and operates a “short paper, long fibre” model similar  
to that of the Group. 
The Group expects that this acquisition will improve its position in higher-growth south eastern European geographies, further strengthening pan-European 
capabilities to our existing customer base in addition to providing access to new customers.  128 Financial Statements

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
A summary of the significant accounting policies, which have been applied 
consistently to all periods presented, is set out below:  
(a) Accounting basis  
The financial statements of DS Smith Plc (the ‘Company’) have been prepared 
on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention and have 
been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and UK Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP). 
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt 
from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.  
Under FRS 1 Cash Flow Statements, the Company is exempt from the 
requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds the  
Company is included in the consolidated financial statements. 
The Company has also taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 29 Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures, not to present Company only information as the 
disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
comply with the requirements of this standard. 
In accordance with FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, the Company has taken  
the multi-employer exemption from disclosing the assets and liabilities of  
the scheme as it is not possible to separately identify those relating to the 
Company employees. This is because of complexities in determining how  
the cost of funding the deficit will be allocated between Group companies in 
future periods. A Group level actuarial valuation under FRS 17 has not been 
performed, but the net pension liability before tax under IAS 19 for the UK 
defined benefit pension schemes was £109m at 30 April 2015 (2014: £72m). 
FRS 100 Application of Finance Reporting Requirements has been issued  
but not yet adopted by the Company. It is effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2015. 
(b) Income recognition 
Dividend income from subsidiary undertakings is recognised in the profit 
and loss account when paid. 
(c) Tangible fixed assets  
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. 
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost or valuation less the 
estimated residual value of all tangible fixed assets in equal annual 
instalments over their estimated useful lives at the following rates:  
Plant and equipment  2-25 years 
(d) Fixed asset investments  
Fixed asset investments are valued at cost less provisions for impairment. 
(e) Deferred taxation  
In accordance with FRS 19 Deferred Tax, deferred tax is provided in full on 
timing differences that result in an obligation at the reporting date to pay more 
tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when 
they crystallise, provided at current tax rates and based on current legislation. 
Timing differences arise from inclusion of items of income and expenditure  
in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are 
included in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised  
to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be 
recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. 
(f) Foreign currencies  
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at that date. Exchange 
differences arising on translation are taken to the profit and loss account. 
(g) Pension contributions  
The Company participates in a funded, defined benefit scheme in the UK, the 
DS Smith Group Pension scheme (the ‘Group Scheme’). On 30 April 2011, the 
scheme was closed to future accrual. As the Company is unable to identify  
its share of scheme assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable  
basis, the Company treats contributions to defined benefit schemes as if they 
were contributions to a defined contribution scheme in accordance with the 
exemption permitted by FRS 17 Retirement Benefits. As a result, the amount 
charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable 
to the scheme in respect of the relevant accounting period.  
(h) Financial instruments  
Financial instruments are reported in accordance with FRS 26 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. 
The Company uses derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate, 
currency and commodity swaps, to manage interest rate, currency and 
commodity risks associated with the Group’s underlying business activities  
and the financing of these activities. The Group has a policy not to, and does 
not, undertake any speculative activity in these instruments. Such derivative 
financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which  
a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair 
value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as 
liabilities when the fair value is negative.  
Derivative financial instruments are accounted for as hedges when designated 
as hedges at the inception of the contract and when the financial instruments 
provide an effective hedge of the underlying risk. Any gains or losses arising 
from the hedging instruments are offset against the hedged items.  
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:  
 fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair 
value of a recognised asset or liability; and 
 cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows 
that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised 
asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction. 
(i) Share options  
The Company operates an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan. 
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of 
the options is recognised as an expense. The fair value of the options granted  
is measured using a stochastic model, taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the options were granted. The total amount to be 
expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair  
value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market  
vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions 
about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.  
At each reporting date, the entity revises its estimates of the numbers of 
options that are expected to become exercisable. It recognises the impact  
of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the profit and loss account, and  
a corresponding adjustment to equity. Where applicable, the fair value of 
employee services received by subsidiary undertakings within the DS Smith Plc 
Group in exchange for options granted by the Company is recognised as an 
expense in the financial statements of the subsidiary by means of a recharge 
from the Company.  132 Financial Statements

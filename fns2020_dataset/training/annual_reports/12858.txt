Chairman’s statement
Directors’ Report – Business Review
A tough year, given the 
economic, market and 
political uncertainty.
Mark Elliott Chairman
Dear shareholder,
I am pleased to submit my first report as Chairman of QinetiQ, 
having assumed the role in March this year, following the retirement 
of Sir John Chisholm.
The last financial year was noteworthy for the Group given the 
changes in our markets on both sides of the Atlantic. Responding to 
fast-moving market developments has required a step change by the 
business and particularly by our people. I would like to pay testimony 
to our employees who have taken on the challenge to adapt quickly 
to the changing priorities of our customers.
With changes in the political landscape on both sides of the Atlantic, 
compounded by economic pressures, our business has experienced 
considerable uncertainty. On the back of political change, customers 
have delayed decision making as they review their budgets. As a 
consequence of these market changes, in November we alerted the 
market that the Group was unlikely to meet market expectations. 
The wider UK budget pressures and delays in contract awards 
resulted in lower utilisation of our teams in the last quarter. This 
was followed in January by confirmation that the delays in orders 
for survivability products and Unmanned Ground Vehicles within 
the QinetiQ North America (QNA) Technology Solutions Group would 
result in performance for our second half not exceeding that of the 
first half. This was disappointing and highlighted the need for the 
business to be more agile and to look to itself to reduce its cost base, 
to ensure that it remains competitive. 
The safety of our operations remains a priority. Following the tragic 
loss of Nimrod XV230 in 2006 and the subsequent publication of 
the Haddon-Cave Report in October 2009, we were determined 
to take on board any key findings which will further improve our 
ways of working. Subsequently in November 2009, the Board 
appointed Sir Robert Nelson QC to consider the findings and 
recommendations of the Haddon-Cave Report. Sir Robert concluded 
that substantial improvements have occurred in QinetiQ since 2004 
but recommended that further changes were implemented and that 
improvements which have been made to date, are consolidated. 
I am pleased to report that we are already well underway with 
implementing Sir Robert’s recommendations and are in the 
process of recruiting a new Group Safety Director to the Executive 
Team. QinetiQ has a long established heritage and track record in 
airworthiness and safety. It is important that we ensure through 
our actions, processes, procedures and people that we are able 
to reinforce our credentials in this crucially important field.
In November, Leo Quinn joined the Board as Chief Executive Officer 
to lead the next stage of QinetiQ’s development. Leo took over 
the reins from Graham Love who left the Group after eight years, 
having taken the organisation through privatisation. Leo joined the 
Group having led De La Rue plc, overseeing its transformation into 
a focused, market-leading security printer. Prior to that, Leo was 
responsible for a number of business turnarounds in both Europe 
and the US. Leo has drive and energy, and a passion for operational 
excellence and delivery. I am pleased to report that in the short time 
that he has been with the Group, he has already started the process 
of its transformation. The Board is fully supportive of the priorities 
set out by Leo Quinn in his Chief Executive Officer’s report.
The results 
Group revenues were flat at £1,625.4m (2009: £1,617.3m), including 
a £43m benefit from the strengthening US dollar exchange rate. The 
overall organic decline in US revenues at constant currency was 4%, 
with the decline in higher margin product sales partially offset by 
growth in services. The UK businesses suffered from a reduction in 
the historic concentration of Ministry of Defence (MOD) order flow 
towards the year end, although this impact was partially masked at 
the revenue level by higher pass-through revenues, resulting in a 1% 
organic decline in EMEA revenues.
As a result of the reduction in higher contribution revenues, 
underlying operating profit* decreased to £120.3m (2009: £151.6m), 
resulting in an underlying margin* of 7.4% (2009: 9.4%). The EMEA 
underlying margin* decreased to 7.5% (2009: 10.0%) and the QNA 
underlying margin* fell to 8.5% (2009: 10.8%). Losses for the Ventures 
division reduced as a result of the partial disposal of Cody Gate 
Ventures in the prior year. Underlying profit before tax* was 
£85.7m (2009: £130.2m).
The Group incurred impairment charges on goodwill of £50.1m, 
intangible assets and investments of £14.6m and tangible assets 
of £24.0m. Other non-recurring items include a profit on business 
divestments of £5.1m (2009: £13.0m) and a charge for reorganising 
the EMEA business, announced in May 2009, of £42.1m. The resulting 
statutory loss before tax was £66.1m (2009: profit of £114.0m).
The Group achieved a strong underlying cash conversion* of 145% 
(2009: 107%) due to a continued focus on cash generation. Cash flow 
from operations increased to £204.6m (2009: £202.2m), before the 
costs of the EMEA reorganisation announced in May 2009. 4 www.QinetiQ.com QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 5
Net debt, as at 31 March 2010, was £457.4m (31 March 2009: 
£537.9m), resulting from strong cash flow from operations and 
the beneficial translation impact of the US dollar exchange rate, 
as the majority of the Group’s debt is drawn in US dollars. The 
Group’s gearing ratio† at 31 March 2010 was 2.5x† (31 March 
2009: 2.2x†), well inside the covenant level of 3.5x†.
Full year underlying earnings per share* were 11.1p (2009: 15.9p).
The Board is confident that the programme announced on 27 May 
will restore the Group to strength over the next 24 months, 
including the rapid pay-down to a target gearing ratio of below 
2x†. For this reason, the Board is recommending that no payment 
be made either of a final dividend for the year just ended or of an 
interim dividend for the current year. It is the Board’s expectation 
that the Group will pay a final dividend with respect to the 
financial year ending 31 March 2011.
The Board
There have been a number of changes to the Board during 
the year.
In May 2009, Sir John Chisholm announced his intention to retire 
from the Board as Chairman. Some 19 years ago Sir John took 
on the challenge of creating a successful commercial enterprise 
out of the research laboratories of the Ministry of Defence. 
This culminated in the Company’s listing on the London Stock 
Exchange in February 2006. His personal commitment, integrity 
and phenomenal energy have made QinetiQ the successful 
organisation it is today and, on behalf of the Board, I thank him 
for his enormous contribution. I am sure everyone at QinetiQ 
wishes Sir John all the very best for his retirement.
In August last year, David H Langstaff joined the Board as a 
Non-executive Director, bringing an in-depth understanding 
of the North American security market. Non-executive Director 
Dr Peter Fellner stepped down from the Board at the close of the 
Group’s AGM on 4 August 2009. Graham Love left the Company 
and Leo Quinn joined the Board in the role of Chief Executive 
Officer in November. Just after the year end, I was pleased to 
announce the appointment of Admiral Sir James Burnell-Nugent 
KCB CBE MA as an Independent Non-executive Director. 
Sir James brings extensive experience of the operational 
challenges of the defence sector.
People
QinetiQ is a unique organisation built on the technical knowledge, 
expertise and integrity of its people. They are involved in solving 
some of society’s most complex problems. I believe our teams 
undertake their roles with integrity and demonstrate commitment 
to our customers. During the second half of the year our employees 
adapted to significant change which will modernise and reposition 
the business for the future, ensuring we remain competitive in the 
market. This required flexibility from our people and I thank them 
for their ongoing commitment and support.
Outlook
In both the US and the UK, the defence markets remain challenging 
as a result of the economic environment. Additionally in the UK, the 
impending Strategic Defence and Security Review adds uncertainty 
to forecasts for defence spending. The Board has concluded its 
review of operations and reset the priorities of the Group. The new 
management is taking action over the next 24 months to reduce 
costs, improve productivity and drive cash generation, both to 
reduce the Group’s net debt rapidly, and to refocus and reposition its 
businesses over the medium term for a return to profitable growth.
In the current financial year, the performance of QinetiQ’s service 
businesses is likely to remain steady overall. The product businesses, 
whose performance is by nature more variable, should benefit from 
the release of some orders in the US delayed from prior period, 
although this will be partially offset by the weaker UK environment. 
The Board believes it will meet its expectations for the current year.

Chief Executive Officer’s review
Directors’ Report – Business Review
QinetiQ’s deep customer 
relationships in the UK and 
the US, together with the 
world-class expertise and 
innovation of its employees, 
provide the capacity for longer 
term profitable growth.
Leo Quinn Chief Executive Officer
During the past year, it became apparent that our markets were 
undergoing significant changes, as Governments sought to reduce 
their budgets and their debt, while continuing in the short-term 
to conduct high levels of military operations abroad. These 
uncertainties had a marked impact on the Group’s performance, 
but also highlighted the need for substantial internal change if 
we were to chart a course to profitable and sustainable growth.
That is why, immediately following my appointment in November 
2009, I began a review of our operations and processes. That review 
is now complete and the Board has agreed our priorities and actions 
to return QinetiQ to strength.
Review of operations and processes
In recent years, QinetiQ has grown rapidly both by acquisition and by 
seeking to use its technology in industries outside its core expertise. 
To date, these investments have not delivered their expected returns 
and the Group’s net debt has risen significantly. In addition, the 
organisational structure and processes within QinetiQ have become 
overly complex and fragmented which is a barrier to effective 
performance. These factors, combined with challenging market 
conditions, make it imperative that QinetiQ ensures it has a strong 
foundation on which to build.
QinetiQ predominantly comprises a range of service businesses, 
positioned to advise and support customers to achieve efficiency 
and effectiveness in the UK and the US. These businesses are based 
on – and continue to refresh – QinetiQ’s deep customer knowledge 
and technical understanding of the aerospace, defence and 
security sectors, and are capable of providing a relatively stable and 
predictable income pattern. This capability is based on the expertise 
of our people and the relationships they develop in specific national 
markets and, over time, should create opportunities to provide 
similar services in other countries.
The Group also possesses a smaller proportion of product businesses 
with technically advanced offerings developed in-house. Today 
these products are sold principally to customers in the UK and the 
US, but the market is potentially global. By their nature – based 
on technology – these businesses have higher margins but more 
variable sales and, to date, they have been managed without 
sufficient sharing of intellectual property or scale between the 
UK and US operations to maximise opportunities and profitability. 
Our US products businesses gives us a strong route into the world’s 
most advanced defence market and we believe that this position, 
combined with the complementary skills of our research and 
expertise in the UK, has the potential for profitable growth on 
a global basis. 
Fit for the future
My focus for the Group is to deliver the full potential of the 
investments which the Group has made. This means removing 
barriers to success and focusing rigorously on the best opportunities 
created by our markets and our own strengths. My objective is to 
build a new trajectory for QinetiQ, one with a very clear direction 
and more urgent pace. Our customers’ needs, the development of 
offerings which address those needs and their successful execution, 
must be our touchstone. I am making changes to ensure that QinetiQ 
competes successfully in challenging markets. We need to remain 
competitive, have robust processes which make us fit for the future, 
fit for growth, and that means tackling the way we all work. We are 
focused on reducing our costs, improving our efficiency, stabilising 
our business and becoming more flexible and agile. I set out my 
priorities over the following pages.
I believe these changes are essential to provide the Group with a 
solid foundation. QinetiQ’s deep customer relationships in the UK 
and the US, the two leading markets in its core areas, together with 
the world-class expertise and innovation of its employees, provide 
the capacity for longer-term profitable growth once the Group’s 
operations and processes have been returned to strength. 
Trading environment and outlook
This has been a difficult year for QinetiQ, with challenging 
conditions in our core markets and considerable internal change. 
Our markets are likely to remain uncertain for some time, but 
we now have a decisive programme of self-help to restore value. 
We are acting to make our costs more competitive, our productivity 
better and our debt lower. We are changing our structure to benefit 
from QinetiQ’s overall strengths. Most of all, we are working to 
transform our culture into one based on leadership, accountability 
and empowerment of what is an outstanding group of people. 
With these immediate steps, the Board believes that it will meet 
its expectations for the current year. At the same time our goal is to 
build the right foundation for a return to profitable and sustainable 
growth in the future. 6 www.QinetiQ.com QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 7

Directors’ Report – Business Review
Our priorities
To strengthen our foundations and build a future path to sustainable 
and profitable growth, the following priorities to create value have 
been put in place.
>  Set a clear direction which reduces the span of focus and matches 
both customer needs and core QinetiQ strength – Going forward, 
our investment decisions will be guided by building on our 
known strengths. Some parts of the original QinetiQ strategy 
have proven successful over recent years – focusing on the needs 
of existing customers, exploiting the potential of our expert 
technical services and the decision to enter the US marketplace, 
the largest defence market in the world. However, we have not 
been successful at commercialising our technology or exploiting 
it in adjacent markets. As yet, we have not achieved the potential 
from extending into defence markets beyond the UK and the US, 
and from fully integrating and developing some of our acquisitions. 
Unquestionably, QinetiQ’s strength lies in its ability to provide 
customers with trusted advice, working in close partnership, 
and using its expertise in both technology and specific markets to 
enable customers to have greater efficiencies and to take effective 
decisions. This work, including the research we conduct on 
customers’ behalf, in turn continually refreshes the knowledge 
and value of our people to provide innovative services. 
>  Simplify and align our operating structure with the new direction, 
removing unnecessary layers – The Group’s current fragmented 
structure has hindered development of its full potential. The 
operating model and management of the service businesses, 
which comprise approximately 80% of our total sales, differ 
markedly from that of our product businesses, which currently 
account for about 20% of sales. A new structure comprising three 
divisions – US Services, UK Services and Global Products – will 
enable greater focus to leverage QinetiQ’s expertise, technology, 
customer relationships and business development skills to enable 
sustainable and profitable growth.
>  Increase transparency and control through all levels – Following 
a period of growth, it is essential to put disciplined standard 
processes which aid transparency and management visibility into 
the operations. This includes standard reporting of performance 
information across the Group and regular reviews of talent, 
innovation and cost reduction.
>  Upgrade leadership to ensure a commercial, value-oriented 
mindset – Given the challenges ahead for the business, it is
vital we have the right strength of team in place and remove 
unnecessary management layers. Continually evaluating and 
upgrading the top leaders, setting clear expectations which align 
performance and behaviours with the Group’s overall objectives, 
with appropriate incentives to drive profit and cash, are key to 
our achievement of success. Increased communications and 
engagement by leaders, both with their own teams and customers, 
and the delivery of value for our shareholders, will be laid out 
in personalised leadership charters and published throughout 
the organisation.

>  Create a strong performance culture of both accountability and 
empowerment to our people – QinetiQ needs to build a culture 
which embraces individual contribution and responsibility 
through measurement. A new performance management system, 
My Personal Success Plan, will focus on identifying our top leaders 
of the future and helping each person to develop their potential. 
We will actively enrol the knowledge and ideas of our teams 
through the roll-out of My Contribution, a tracked and measured 
productivity programme which embeds the concept of employee 
engagement to improve business performance. We are refreshing 
our focus on Health and Safety as this is fundamental not only 
to employee well-being but also to the nature of the work that 
we undertake. As part of this, in response to the findings of the 
Haddon-Cave report, we are recruiting a new Group Safety 
Director to the Executive Team.
>  Establish a lower level of cost base to ensure future 
competitiveness – Our customers are all under increasing pressure 
to gain better value for their investments and, as a supplier to these 
markets, we must have a competitive cost base. We are therefore 
re-examining and streamlining our business processes through a 
programme called Fit4Growth, focused on improving our systems 
and procedures to ensure we reduce and retain tight control of our 
costs, eliminate inefficiencies and address loss-making activities. 
And, whilst we will continue to invest in developing our businesses 
and our people, this must be financed by rigorously reducing 
other costs.
>  Ensure a more unified approach Group-wide to exploit key 
opportunities – We need a more unified approach to exploit key 
opportunities, so that we leverage our customer knowledge and 
technical expertise better, including our approach to untapped 
opportunities in smaller international markets outside the UK and 
the US. Through a more unified approach to working as one team 
and making key decisions on a global basis, we can develop our 
best opportunities and most effective routes to market to build 
QinetiQ’s reputation and position.
>  Drive for cash generation to strengthen the Group’s balance 
sheet – We intend to reduce our indebtedness. We have identified 
a number of ‘self-help’ measures to drive cash generation harder, 
including the reduction of working capital, lowering costs and the 
elimination of loss-making activities.

Revenues declined 4% on an organic basis at constant currency 
to £800.1m (2009: £765.6m). Within this, the services businesses 
(Mission Solutions and Systems Engineering), which account for 
c80% of QNA’s revenue, grew by 7% on an organic basis. This was 
offset by the slowdown in Technology Solutions’ military product 
sales as the new US Administration completed many of its key 
Department of Defense (DoD) leadership appointments and 
finalised its strategy for the continued involvement in Afghanistan. 
Underlying operating profit* decreased to £67.7m (2009: £83.0m) 
delivering an underlying operating margin* of 8.5% (2009: 10.8%). 
The decline in operating margin is principally reflective of the 
composition of QNA’s revenue, which included a smaller proportion 
of its higher margin product sales.

The Mission Solutions business grew organically by 8% and 
continued to broaden its customer base with contract wins from 
a number of new customers, including the US Department of State, 
the US Secret Service and a contract with the US Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. The five-year $100m Janus II contract was 
awarded in August 2009 to replace and upgrade the Department 
of State’s telecommunications systems at American embassies and 
other locations worldwide. The Systems Engineering business grew 
organically by 6% with increased demand on a number of contracts 
from customers across the US Army, Navy, Marines and Special 
Forces. In addition, the Systems Engineering business continues 
successfully to deliver Iraqi flight-training services. The fourth option 
year of this contract was recently exercised by the customer. Towards 
the end of the year, the services businesses experienced some delays 
and curtailments in Government orders.

flight-training services
The slowdown in Technology Solutions QNA resulted in a 31% 
decrease in organic revenues against a very strong comparable prior 
year. From an international perspective, the Australian Department 
of Defence placed a AUD$23m contract for TALON® robots and 
replacement parts to support the Australian Defence Force deployed 
on operations. A key contract win for Technology Solutions QNA this 
year was the $31m Q-NETS contract, a vehicle survivability product, 
for the MRAP Lite fleet. 
In July 2009 the Group acquired Cyveillance, Inc. for an initial cash 
consideration, including costs, of £26.1m ($42.2m). A potential 
further payment up to a maximum of £26.4m ($40m) will be made 
depending on performance during the two-year period ending 
31 December 2010. Cyveillance develops and operates online 
monitoring technology to identify and track data on the internet, 
providing proactive preventative solutions for customers in the 
cyber security market.

Prior year comparatives have been restated to show the finance element
of the IAS 19 pension cost in the finance and expense lines.
Revenue for the period was £818.8m (2009: £842.3m), a 1% decline 
on an organic basis. The UK budget pressures and delays in contract 
awards resulted in lower utilisation of employees in Q4 than has 
been the case in prior years. This impact was masked to a degree 
on the revenue line by higher levels of pass-through revenue on 
certain programmes; however, it resulted in underlying operating 
profit* decreasing to £61.1m (2009: £84.2m). Orders received were 
down 25% against the prior year, which included the £150m 15-year 
Maritime Strategic Capability Agreement.

£31m DTR Early Training Transformation contract 
signed in August 2009
Both Consulting and Technology Solutions EMEA have previously 
benefited from a seasonal pick-up in a large number of small-value 
contracts in Q4 as MOD closed out its financial year. This year the 
volume of such contracts was much reduced and consequently, 
Consulting’s reported revenues declined by 3% on an organic basis. 
In Technology Solutions EMEA the equivalent decline was 7%, 
exacerbated by the decrease in MOD research revenues. During the 
period, Technology Solutions EMEA worked with QNA in enabling 
transfer of technologies across the Atlantic, as evidenced by the 
sale of Dragon Runner™ Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) to 
the UK MOD.
Managed Services’ revenue for the period increased organically 
by 6% over the prior period, enhanced predominantly by some 
pass through revenues on the LTPA contract and the £31m Defence 
Training Review (DTR) Early Training Transformation contract, signed 
in August 2009. Package 1 of the UK MOD DTR is progressing. During 
the period £11.2m of bid costs were capitalised, bringing the total 
amount of bid costs capitalised as at 31 March 2010 to £30.8m 
(2009: £19.6m). The programme has been submitted to the MOD 
Investment Appraisal Board (‘Main Gate’) which has indicated that 
MOD may continue to develop the transaction in parallel with the 
Strategic Defence and Security Review. The MOD’s expectation for 
financial close is currently mid-2011.
Managed Services’ revenue

The EMEA restructuring programme announced in May 2009 was 
largely completed this financial year. The cost of this programme 
was £42.1m, all of which has been expensed to the income 
statement in the year as a non-recurring item.
During the period the EMEA business disposed of a number 
of non-core assets, including the Underwater Systems business, 
in September 2009 (for a cash consideration before costs of 
£23.5m), and ASAP Calibration Services Limited, in July 2009 
for a nominal consideration.

underlying operating margin* decreased to 7.5% (2009: 10%) and the 
QNA underlying operating margin* fell to 8.5% (2009: 10.8%). Losses 
for the Ventures division reduced as a result of the partial disposal 
of Cody Gate Ventures in the prior year. Underlying profit before tax* 
was £85.7m (2009: £130.2m).
Our investment in Ventures continued during the year. The underlying 
operating loss* of £8.5m (2009: £15.6m) was mitigated during the 
year following our part disposal of our investment in the Cody Gate 
Ventures Fund in March 2009. The prior year results included the

events and amortisation of acquired intangible assets is shown 
below.

The resulting statutory loss after tax was £63.3m (2009: profit 
of £93.6m).
Non-recurring items that have been excluded from underlying profit 
relate to gains on business divestments, impairment of investments, 
impairment of plant, property and equipment, impairment of 
intangible assets and EMEA reorganisation costs.
During the period, the Group has elected to align the treatment 
of the Group’s IAS 19 pension charge with that of its peer listed 
companies by showing the finance element of the pension charge 
in the finance costs line and the service cost remaining in operating 
expenses; in prior reported periods these elements had been combined 
and reported in operating costs. IAS 19 Employee Benefits permits 
both treatments. The Group’s comparative figures have been 
restated to reflect this change although there is no impact on the 
Group’s profit before tax or retained profit. This pension liability 
sits within the EMEA business and therefore the operating segment 
comparatives have also been restated.
Finance costs
Net finance costs have increased to £34.6m (2009: £21.4m) due 
principally to an adverse movement in the net pension return of 
£5.9m combined with the effect of refinancing floating rate US dollar 
debt under the revolving credit facility with more secure long term 
fixed rate debt obtained from the US private placement market in 
February 2009.
Taxation
The Group’s underlying effective tax rate* was 15% (2009: 20.5%). 
The reduction on prior year is due to the combination of the 
cessation of equity accounted losses of Cody Gate Ventures and 
certain favourable outcomes and settlements to date, coupled 
with lower reported profits in QinetiQ North America. The 
Group continues to benefit from the availability of research and 
development relief and in future years, the Group will benefit from 
enacted tax law changes having an impact on US State taxes. Overall, 
the Group effective tax rate is not anticipated to rise significantly in 
the medium term, subject to any future tax legislation changes.

Chief Financial Officer’s review (continued)
Directors’ Report – Business Review
During the year there has been an impairment of £53.4m against 
intangible assets. A £50.1m impairment of goodwill has arisen in 
Technology Solutions QNA (£11.4m), Mission Solutions (£30.8m) and 
Australia (£7.9m). The global economic uncertainty has led to weaker 
market outlooks which has, in turn, impacted on the future growth 
potential. The remaining impairment charge of £3.3m is in respect 
of other intangible assets. 
An impairment charge of £20.7m against the Group’s land and 
buildings was taken during the year relating to owned properties 
within EMEA where there are no external tenants following 
vacancies arising during the year. An impairment charge of £3.3m 
was taken against the Group’s plant, machinery and vehicles during 
the year relating to the impairment of assets which are no longer 
generating a return. Both of these impairments relate to reductions 
in the carrying value of these assets to their recoverable amounts.
The EMEA restructuring programme announced in May 2009 largely 
completed this financial year. The cost of this programme was £42.1m, 
all of which has been expensed to the income statement in the year 
as a non-recurring item. 
The gain on business divestments in the year relates to the disposal 
of two businesses during the period. On 30 September 2009 the 
Group disposed of the Underwater Systems business and on 31 July 
2009 the Calibration business, including ASAP Calibration Ltd. for a 
nominal consideration.
Earnings per share
Underlying earnings per share* was 11.1p compared with 15.9p for 
the year to 31 March 2009. Basic earnings per share reduced to (9.7p) 
(2009: 14.3p) over the same period.
Dividend
The Group paid an interim dividend of 1.58 pence per share and the 
Board is recommending that no final dividend be paid (2009: total 
dividends 4.75 pence per share). 
Other Financials
Cash flow
The Group’s cash flow from operations before reorganisation costs 
was £204.6m (2009: £202.2m). The underlying operating cash 
conversion ratio* post capital expenditure was 145% (2009: 107%), 
as a result of a keen focus on cash generation. The cash outflow 
in the year on EMEA reorganisation was £35.4m (2009: £27.0m).
Acquisition expenditure, net of cash acquired, totalled £45.6m 
(2009: £89.2m), £26.1m of which was due to the acquisition of 
Cyveillance, Inc. in July 2009 and the remainder was deferred 
consideration on prior year’s acquisitions. Proceeds received from 
the disposals of Underwater Systems and Calibration businesses 
totalled £21.1m (2009: £20.9m)
At 31 March 2010, net debt reduced by £80.5m to £457.4m compared 
with £537.9m at 31 March 2009.
The Group’s borrowings remained comfortably within its banking 
covenants. The Group’s two key debt covenant measures are the 
gearing and interest cover ratios. At 31 March 2010 the actual ratios 
were well within the maximum covenant levels permitted with the 
gearing† ratio at 2.5x compared to the covenant maximum level of 3.5 
and interest cover of 5.6 compared to a minimum covenant level of 4.0.
The total committed facilities available to the Group, at 31 March 
2010, were £877m. The earliest maturity date of the Group’s 
committed facilities is August 2012.

Pensions
The net pension liability under IAS 19, after deferred tax, was 
£106.1m at 31 March 2010 (31 March 2009: £75.8m). The increase 
in the net pension liability is primarily driven by reductions in the 
corporate bond discount rate which reduces the extent by which the 
pension liability is discounted.
The key assumptions used in the IAS 19 valuation of the scheme are:
Assumption
31 March 
2010
31 March 
2009 
Discount rate 5.6% 6.5%
Inflation 3.6% 3.1%
Salary increase 4.6% 4.1%
Life expectancy – male (currently aged 40) 89 89
Life expectancy – female (currently aged 40) 90 90
Each assumption is selected by the Group in consultation with the 
Company actuary and takes account of industry practice amongst 
comparator listed companies. The sensitivity of each of the key 
assumptions is shown in the table below.

liabilities was £1,063.2m (31 March 2009: £752.6m).

Capital risk
The Group funds its operations through a mixture of equity funding 
and debt financing, including bank and capital market borrowings. 
At 31 March 2010 the Group’s capital was £485.8m (2009: £619.4m), 
which comprises total equity of £473.7m (2009: £602.7m) plus 
amounts accumulated in equity relating to cash flow hedges of 
£12.1m (2009: £16.7m). Net debt as defined by the Group was 
£457.4m (2009: £537.9m).
The capital structure of the Group reflects the judgement of the 
Directors of an appropriate balance of funding required. The Group’s 
target is to reduce its gearing ratio to 2x EBITDA†. The Directors have 
recommended a suspension of the dividend until 2011.
Treasury policy
The Group treasury department works within a framework of 
policies and procedures approved by the Audit Committee. As part 
of these policies and procedures, there is strict control on the use of 
financial instruments. Speculative trading in financial instruments 
is not permitted. The policies are established to manage and control 
risk in the treasury environment and to align the treasury goals, 
objectives and philosophy to those of the Group.
Funding and debt portfolio management
The Group seeks to obtain certainty of access to funding in the 
amounts and maturities required to support the Group’s medium- 
to long-term forecast financing requirements. Group borrowings 
are arranged by the Group treasury function.
Interest risk management
The Group seeks to reduce the volatility in its interest charge caused 
by rate fluctuations.
A significant portion of the Group’s borrowings are fixed in the short 
to medium term through a combination of interest rate swaps and 
fixed-rate debt.
Foreign exchange risk management
The principal exchange rate affecting the Group was the sterling 
to US dollar exchange rate.
2010 2009
£/US$ – average 1.59 1.68
£/US$ – closing rate 1.52 1.44
£/US$ – opening rate 1.44 1.99
The Group’s income and expenditure is largely settled in the functional 
currency of the relevant Group entity, mainly sterling or US dollar. The 
Group has a policy in place to hedge all material transaction exposure at 
the point of commitment to the underlying transaction. Uncommitted 
future transactions are not routinely hedged. The Group continues 
its practice of not hedging income statement translation exposure.
To minimise the impact of currency depreciation of the net assets on 
its overseas subsidiaries, the Group seeks to borrow in the currencies 
of those subsidiaries, but only to the extent that its gearing covenant 
within its loan documentation, as well as its facility headroom, are 
likely to remain comfortably within limits.
Tax risk management
The central principle of QinetiQ’s tax strategy is to manage effective 
and cash tax rates whilst fully complying with relevant legislation. 
Tax is managed in alignment with the corporate strategy and with 
regard to QinetiQ’s core value of integrity in all business dealings. 
These principles are applied in a responsible and transparent manner 
in pursuing the Group’s tax strategy and in all dealings with tax 
authorities around the world.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises when a counterparty fails to perform its obligations. 
The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial instruments such 
as liquid assets, derivative assets and trade receivables. Credit risk 
is managed by investing liquid assets and acquiring derivatives 
from high-credit quality financial institutions. Trade receivables are 
subject to credit limits, control and approval procedures across the 
Group. The nature of the Group’s operations leads to concentrations 
of credit risk on its trade receivables. The majority of the Group’s 
credit risk is with the UK and US Governments and is therefore 
considered minimal.
Insurance
The Group continually assesses the balance of risk arising from 
the operations undertaken against the insurance cover available 
for such activities and associated premiums payable for such cover. 
A consistent approach to risk retention and scope of cover is applied 
across the Group. The Group has a policy of self-insurance, through 
its captive insurance company, on the first layer of specific risks with 
insurance cover above these levels placed in the external market 
with third-party insurers.
Employees
Year-end employee numbers have decreased by 7% to 13,078 at 
31 March 2010. The decline of 812 in EMEA (including Ventures & 
corporate) reflects normal in-year attrition, departures under the 
reorganisation programme and the divestment of the Underwater 
Systems and Calibration business. In QNA total headcount declined 
from 6,348 to 6,178.

As a UK listed company, the Group is required to adopt EU endorsed 
IFRSs and comply with the Companies Act 2006. The effect of 
changes to financial reporting standards in the year and critical 
accounting estimates and judgements have been disclosed in 
Note 1 to the Financial Statements.

The Group’s organic revenue growth is 
calculated by taking the increase in 2010 
revenue over 2009 pro forma revenue, at 
constant exchange rates. The pro forma 
revenue assumes that any acquisitions were 
owned and any discontinued operations 
or disposals excluded, for the comparable 
period in the prior year.
Organic revenue growth demonstrates 
the Group’s capability to expand its core 
operations within its chosen markets before

Principal risks and uncertainties
Directors’ Report – Business Review
Risk Potential impact Mitigation
A change in demand from 
reduced military operations 
in Iraq and Afghanistan
A significant shift in policy by either the 
Administration in the US or the new 
Government in the UK, which results in a 
significant reduction in the number of forces 
personnel present in Iraq and Afghanistan, 
may have a materially adverse impact on 
the Group’s financial performance.
QinetiQ has capitalised on increased 
UK and US Government spending on 
technology in support of operations in 
Iraq and Afghanistan. Notably, QinetiQ has 
experienced strong demand for Unmanned 
Ground Vehicles and survivability products 
across the duration of both campaigns. 
However, the focus on operational support 
in defence, on both sides of the Atlantic, 
has given rise to a decline in defence 
expenditure in other areas, such as services 
to improve procurement efficiency and 
innovative research. The Group mitigates 
this by maintaining a market focus and 
competitive positioning in adjacent 
markets, including defence services (which 
are not directly conflict-related); aerospace, 
security and intelligence, providing a degree 
of portfolio diversification.
A change in either US or 
UK Government spending 
on defence and security
The Strategic Defence and Security Review in 
the UK, and the financial burden on both UK 
and US Government budgets from the recent 
economic downturn, may lead to reduced 
spending in the markets in which the Group 
operates. Any reduction in Government 
defence and security spending in either the 
UK or the US could have an adverse impact 
on the Group’s financial performance.
 The Group is focused on a range of markets in 
defence, security and intelligence, providing 
a degree of portfolio diversification. The 
Group will continue to review trends 
in defence, aerospace and security 
expenditure in order to align the business 
with those trends.
Risk Management
The understanding, and effective management, of the risks that 
face QinetiQ is fundamental to its success and is an integral 
part of managing the business. The identification, assessment, 
mitigation and reporting of risks are processes carried out at a 
Group, business and project level and are included as part of the 
business performance review process. Risks are assessed according 
to the likelihood of the event’s occurrence and its impact, both from 
a financial and non-financial standpoint. The Group Risk Register 
includes an analysis of the potential exposures and severity of 
each risk (as a function of the likelihood and impact of the risk), 
the assumptions underlying each risk and the mitigating actions 
required to manage the risk.
It is reviewed by the Executive Team on a monthly basis which considers:
• the authority, resources and coordination of those involved in the 
identification, assessment and management of significant risks 
faced by the organisation;
• the response to the significant risks which have been identified 
by management and others;
• the monitoring of reports from Group management; and
• the maintenance of a control environment directed towards the 
proper management of risk.
The risk register is reviewed quarterly by the Board and, in addition, 
the risk owners present an update of current status and mitigating 
actions by rotation throughout the year. 18 www.QinetiQ.com QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 19
Risk Potential impact Mitigation
Defence Training Review (DTR) 
Package 1 may not reach financial close
In 2007 Metrix, the Group’s joint venture 
with Land Securities Trillium, was confirmed 
as the preferred bidder for Package 1 of the 
proposed 30-year DTR contract to outsource 
training for UK armed forces. The Group is 
responsible for the design and provision of 
training to Metrix. In January 2009, Sodexo 
replaced Land Securities Trillium as the joint 
venture partner. Metrix and the partners 
continue to work with the MOD to finalise 
the scope of the programme as the next 
stage in moving to a financial close. There is 
a risk that the DTR programme may suffer 
material change to the final scope, delay, 
inability to be financed or even cancellation. 
This would have a significant impact on the 
expected future growth of the Group. In 
addition, if financial close were not reached, 
the bid costs incurred since preferred 
bidder status was achieved would have to 
be written off and expensed through the 
income statement. These costs capitalised to 
date amount to £30.8m as at 31 March 2010.
QinetiQ maintains close contact with 
Metrix, Sodexo and the MOD in relation 
to the DTR programme, including the 
potential timing of reaching a financial 
close. In addition, the MOD has signed some 
Pre-Contract Award Letters (PCAL) which 
effectively underwrite a small portion of 
the external costs incurred by the joint 
venture partners to date. A funded early 
training transformation agreement, which 
will study the proposed technical design 
and delivery of the training programmes, 
has been let.
Changing in the timing of contracts The amounts payable under some 
Government contracts can be significant 
and the timing of receiving orders could 
have a material impact on the Group’s 
performance in a given reporting period.
The contract and orders pipeline is 
regularly reviewed by senior operational 
management.
Funding of the defined benefit 
pension scheme
The Group operates a defined benefit 
pension scheme in the UK. Presently 
there is a deficit between the projected 
liability of the scheme and the value of 
the assets held by the scheme. The size of 
the deficit may be materially affected by 
a number of factors, including inflation, 
investment returns, changes in interest 
rates and improvements in life expectancy. 
An increase in the deficit may require the 
Group to increase the cash contributions 
to the scheme which would reduce the 
Group’s available cash for other purposes.
The performance of the pension scheme is 
reviewed regularly by Group management 
in conjunction with the scheme’s 
independent trustees. External actuarial 
and investment advice is also taken on a 
regular basis to ensure that the scheme 
is managed in the best interests of both 
the Group and the scheme’s members. The 
most recent triennial funding valuation of 
the scheme as at 30 June 2008 resulted in a 
deficit of £111.3m. The Group and trustees 
have agreed a ten-year recovery period to 
make up this deficit.
Policies or attitudes may change 
towards Organisational Conflicts 
of Interest (OCI)
The Group provides services to defence 
customers that meet their needs as part 
of the defence supply chain and also as 
technical advisor through its consultancy 
services. The future growth of the business 
could be compromised should the current 
attitudes to policies adopted by our key 
customers, especially in the UK, change.
The Group takes proactive steps to manage 
any potential OCI and to maintain its ability 
to provide independent advice through 
its consulting and systems engineering 
activities. In the UK, a formal compliance 
regime operates with the MOD to monitor 
and assess potential OCI as part of the sales 
acceptance process. 20 www.QinetiQ.com QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 21
Principal risks and uncertainties (continued)
Directors’ Report – Business Review
Risk Potential impact Mitigation
Tax liabilities may change as a 
result of changes in tax legislation
QinetiQ is liable to pay tax in the countries 
in which it operates, principally in the UK 
and the US. Changes in the tax legislation 
in these countries could have an adverse 
impact on the level of tax paid on the 
profits generated by the Group.
External advice and consultation is sought 
on potential changes in tax legislation in 
both the UK and the US. This enables us 
to plan for and mitigate potential changes 
in legislation.
A material element of the Group’s 
revenue and operating profit is 
derived from one contract
The Long-Term Partnering Agreement (LTPA) 
is a 25-year contract to provide a variety of 
evaluation and testing services to the MOD. 
The original contract was signed in 2003. 
The LTPA operates under five-year periods 
with specific programmes, targets and 
performance measures set for each period. 
On 3 March 2008, the Group signed up to a 
second five-year period of the LTPA with the 
MOD. The first break point is in 2013. In the 
current year, the LTPA directly contributed 
11% of the Group’s revenue and supported 
a further 8% through tasking services 
using LTPA managed facilities. The loss, 
cancellation or termination of this contract 
would have a material, adverse impact on 
the Group’s future reported performance.
The Group continues to achieve customer 
performance and satisfaction levels. 
QinetiQ achieved a weighted performance 
rating of 90% against an agreed minimum 
rating of 80%.
Failure to comply with laws and 
regulations, particularly trading 
restrictions and export controls
The Group operates in a highly-regulated 
environment and the majority of its 
revenues are generated from sales within 
the UK and the US. The Group is subject 
to numerous domestic and international 
laws, including import and export controls, 
financial and fiscal laws, health and 
safety, environmental, money laundering, 
anti-bribery, etc. Failure to comply with 
particular regulations could result in a 
combination of fines, penalties, civil or 
criminal prosecution, and suspension or 
debarment from Government contracts, 
as well as reputational damage to the 
QinetiQ brand. Any one of these could 
have a material impact on the Group’s 
financial performance.
The Group has procedures in place to ensure 
that it meets all current regulations. Local 
management continuously monitors local 
laws and regulations, and policies are in 
place for the appointment of advisors to 
support business development. Professional 
advice is sought when engaging in new 
territories to ensure that the Group complies 
with local and international regulations 
and requirements. In the US, the Group 
undertakes work that is deemed to be of 
importance to US national security, and 
arrangements are in place to insulate these 
activities from undue foreign influence as 
a result of foreign ownership. The Group 
has procedures in place to ensure that 
these arrangements remain effective and 
to respond to any changes that might 
occur in US attitudes to foreign ownership 
of such activities. The terms of reference 
of the Compliance Committee have been 
expanded to review the effectiveness of 
the compliance risk frameworks.
Exchange rate movement The Group is exposed to volatility in exchange 
rates due to the international nature of its 
operations; this includes a translational 
impact on the key financial statements as 
a result of the Group reporting its financial 
results in sterling. The Group has limited 
transaction exposure as its revenues and 
related costs are often borne in the same 
currency, principally US dollars or sterling. 
QinetiQ North America represents 49% 
of the Group’s consolidated revenues. 
These operations are funded by US dollar 
denominated debt. Any significant movement 
in the foreign exchange markets could have 
a material impact on the Group’s reported 
financial performance in a given period.
The Group actively hedges all significant 
transactional foreign exchange exposure 
as described on page 78 of the notes to 
the financial statements and has adopted 
hedge accounting. The Group’s objective 
is to reduce medium-term volatility to 
cash flow, margins and earnings. The Group 
protects its balance sheets and reserves 
from adverse foreign exchange movements 
by financing acquisitions in North America 
with US dollar denominated borrowings, 
partially mitigating the risk as US dollar 
earnings are used to service and repay 
US dollar denominated debt. 20 www.QinetiQ.com QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 21
Risk Potential impact Mitigation
Raising external funding and 
volatility in interest rates
The Group relies on the proper functioning 
of the credit markets which could have 
an impact on both the availability and 
associated costs of financing. The Group is 
exposed to interest rate risk derived mainly 
from long-term indebtedness and related 
to borrowings which have been issued at 
floating interest rates.
The Group maintains a sufficient level of 
committed funding facilities, with a phased 
maturity profile, from commercial banks 
and private placement investors. The Group 
also uses fixed-rate debt instruments and 
interest rate swap derivatives to provide 
some certainty in the future cost of 
maintaining these facilities.
Fixed price contracts Some of the Group’s revenue is derived from 
contracts which have a fixed price. There 
is a risk that the costs required for delivery of 
a contract could be higher than those agreed 
in the contract due to operational overruns 
or external factors, such as inflation. Any 
significant increase in costs which cannot 
be passed on to a customer may reduce the 
profitability of a contract or even result in a 
contract becoming loss-making.
The nature of much of the services provided 
under such fixed-price arrangements 
is often for a defined amount of effort 
or resource rather than firm product 
deliverables and, as such, the risk of cost 
escalation is substantially mitigated. The 
Group ensures that its fixed-price bids and 
projects are reviewed for early detection 
and management of issues which may 
result in cost overrun.
Acquisition of businesses The Group has the ability to acquire 
other businesses and companies. These 
acquisitions may not perform in line 
with expectations, thereby having a 
detrimental impact on the Group’s 
financial performance.
The risks are mitigated through the due 
diligence and internal approvals processes. 
In addition, the usual contractual 
protections are included in the purchase 
agreements signed with the vendors.
Inherent risks from trading 
in a global marketplace
QinetiQ operates internationally. The risks 
associated with having a large geographic 
footprint may include: regulation and 
administration changes; changes in 
taxation policy; political instability; civil 
unrest; and cultural and terms of reference 
differences leading to a lack of common 
understanding with customers. Any such 
events could disrupt some of the Group’s 
operations and have a material impact on 
its future financial performance.
While the core activities of the Group are 
confined to the UK and the US, the Group 
continues to explore potential client 
relationships internationally.
Highly-competitive marketplace The aerospace, defence and security 
markets overall are highly competitive. 
The Group’s financial performance may 
be adversely affected should it not be able 
to compete in the markets in which it aims 
to operate.
QinetiQ seeks to focus on areas 
within these markets in which its deep 
customer understanding, domain 
knowledge, technical expertise and 
platform independence provide a strong 
proposition and significant advantage in 
competitive bidding.
Realisation of value from intellectual 
property may be delayed
The funded research and development work 
that the Group undertakes for defence and 
other customers creates intellectual property 
that the Group retains and can utilise for 
commercial applications. The uncertainty 
that exists over new technologies and 
markets may result in delays, failure to 
realise value from intellectual property, 
or the need for a higher level of investment 
for the opportunity to be realised. The 
additional investment requirements may 
have to be funded from the Group’s own 
capital resources which may have an adverse 
impact on the Group’s financial performance.
The Group invests in the development 
of intellectual property only where it 
believes there is a substantial and realistic 
market opportunity for the technology, 
and it undertakes a portfolio approach, in 
recognition that not all investments will be 
successful. The performance of intellectual 
property realisation programmes is 
monitored to increase support for successful 
prospects and reduce expenditure where 
realisation appears less likely. The Group 
uses external experts and financial backers 
as partners in a variety of structures 
to enhance the performance of certain 
intellectual property realisation projects. 22 www.QinetiQ.com QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 23

Corporate responsibility management
The CR Committee met three times during the year to discuss 
strategy and progress. This new group, which comprises the 
Executive Team and the Group CR Manager, has enabled greater 
senior management visibility and support for CR programmes. 
A report is provided monthly to the Executive Team and the CEO 
reports to the Board on CR issues as required. Our approach is to 
embed CR into how we do business and the CR Manager worked 
with a wide network of domain experts across the UK and the US. 
In Australia, a new CR Team has been formed and has developed a 
plan to roll out local initiatives, in line with the Group CR framework.
Delivery of the Business Risk Management process is a key 
mechanism to improve awareness, understanding and management 
of risk. CR and ethical risks have previously been held separately but, 
following a programme of work this year with the UK business, are 
now integrated to ensure our approach to risk is holistic. We have 
been refreshing our strategic objectives around Health Safety and 
Environment (HS&E) and Business Ethics. There is now a clearer focus 
on leadership, communications, competencies and risk management.
Policy and process
We have a balance between Group and regional policies to 
encompass regional differences in best practice and law. Relevant 
policies include HS&E, sustainable procurement, business ethics, 
equality and diversity. Our Group Business Ethics Policy, which is 
available in the Investor Relations and CR sections of our website 
(www.QinetiQ.com), provides a framework of how we operate. 
Further information on governance can be found on page 28.

Mission statement: to be a responsible and sustainable business
Sustainable procurement 
We recognise that how and what we buy needs to be an integral 
part of our ambition to improve sustainability in QinetiQ. Our UK 
Sustainable Procurement Forum has been active in raising employee 
awareness through training, employee campaigns and leadership 
team briefings. An introduction to Sustainable Procurement is part 
of the corporate induction for UK employees. A key part of the 
process is working with our suppliers and this is an area on which we 
must continue to focus. We are a signatory to the MOD’s Sustainable 
Procurement Charter and are an active member of the MOD-Industry 
Sustainable Procurement Working Group. 
Business ethics 
We are committed to the highest standards of ethical conduct. 
We know this is critical for our success because it builds trust and 
transparency with our people and with our customers. Maintaining 
these high standards of ethical behaviour can result in difficult 
choices. Integrity and ethics may require us to forgo business 
opportunities, but in the long run we will be better served by 
doing what is right. Over 95% of UK employees and 100% of QNA 
employees have undertaken business ethics training. The Australian 
business now has its Code of Conduct in place.
Policies and procedures are in place to prevent corruption within our 
operations and activities. We have been working with organisations 
such as TRACE (Transparent Agents and Contracting Entities), an 
independent and internationally recognised organisation, in two 
areas. Firstly, to conduct a due diligence review on the anti-bribery 
issue associated with engaging third-party representatives overseas: 
secondly, to provide bespoke training for our sales and commercial 
employees on international law and regulations covering anti-
corruption and bribery.
We have a Whistleblower line available for all employees worldwide 
and we have developed a new gifts and hospitality register in the UK. 
There is a need for continual improvement and we are developing our 
strategic objectives in business ethics, which will focus on leadership, 
communications, competencies, policy and risk management.
Environmental solutions
Monitoring and collection of environmental data is increasingly 
crucial in addressing the challenges of climate change and 
environmental management. The SWIMA project is managed by 
QinetiQ, working with an international group of companies, the UK 
Environment Agency and universities. The team is using field trials 
in the River Tamar catchment in South West England to demonstrate 
how the exploitation of open standards in ‘sensor webs’ (networks 
of disparate sensors connected via the same web interface) can make 
environmental monitoring more efficient and intelligent while also 
reducing associated costs. Having this type of data available at the 
click of a mouse has considerable impact on the accuracy and timely 
delivery of alerts of pollution and flooding.
Our people 
Mission statement: to create an environment which attracts 
great people and enables them to deliver high levels of 
performance
Health and safety
Employee safety is a key part of our overall business ethic and duty 
of care to fellow employees. Senior management is responsible 
for delivering and embedding the highest standards and we 
have been refreshing our programme of leadership, including 
the introduction of Safety Leadership Charters. A comprehensive 
audit of our UK safety management system was completed by the 
Explosives Inspectorate of the HSE. Whilst it identified a number of 
opportunities for improvement, it concluded that we have ‘a clear 
and strong commitment to the safe conduct of the business’ and 
‘a strong culture of safe working’.
Our businesses in the UK, the US and Australia collect and report 
accident data differently, because of in-country requirements. Going 
forward, we are looking at greater alignment of reporting metrics.

Directors’ Report – Business Review
Employee engagement
Regular dialogue with employees is part of good leadership, and 
listening to our people has never been more important whilst 
we have been undergoing significant change. A range of tools is 
deployed regularly to keep in touch with our employees, including: 
CEO notices, team briefings and leaders hosting ‘town hall’ sessions 
across all our sites. We also make good use of intranet, newsletters, 
video and print media. The newly formed Employee Forum and 
the Communications Network create an open dialogue to give 
employees across the UK business the opportunity to have their 
say and to give input into important issues that we face. Employee 
engagement has been a key part of QNA’s programme of bringing 
many separate companies together into one business. 
Employee surveys are also an opportunity for our people to have 
their say. This year we introduced the widely used ‘Best Companies to 
Work for’ questionnaire in the UK, which will enable us to benchmark 
ourselves against other companies across a wide range of issues. 
We had a high response of 73% and the survey gave us some clear 
feedback on areas on which we need to focus.
We have introduced an exciting new programme, ‘My Contribution’, 
which enables everyone to play a part in improving our business. It 
gives employees a way to generate and voice ideas and convert them 
quickly into projects that will benefit the Company’s bottom line. It is 
a simple, common sense concept enabling continuous improvement. 
The programme is up and running in the UK and there are plans in 
place to roll it out across QinetiQ globally.
Learning and development
We support the development and employability of our people. 
Across QinetiQ we have in place a range of high quality programmes, 
from apprentice training and graduate entry, to leadership. For 
example, the UK Graduate Development Programme provides new 
entrant graduates with business awareness through the Henley 
Graduate Programme and professional development through the 
Accredited Initial Professional Development Scheme. Investment in 
graduate development continues to play a major factor in graduate 
retention. CR is an integral part of the UK Corporate Induction and 
is supplemented by a CR e-learning module. In the UK, our Flight 
Engineering Services Training Centre is currently training just under 
100 engineering apprentices from across our Managed Services 
Group and dstl. The training pathways cover aircraft mechanical 
and avionics, workshop machining and ground instrumentation/
electrical. The aircraft training pathways conform to the MOD 
Maintenance Approved Organisation Scheme training requirements 
for Mechanical (B1) and Avionics (B2) trades.
In Australia, a People Development Programme is establishing career 
development for our most talented employees and is supporting 
succession planning. QNA was formed over a short period from 
a number of companies with different cultures and practices. 
The focus has been on efficiently implementing consistency in 
job roles and performance management. QNA has been driving 
robust succession planning and working with the Darden Business 
School at the University of Virginia to develop future leaders. For 
QNA technical employees, the focus is on a rapid and competitive 
knowledge update. 
We are one of only 5% of the 28,000 Investors in People organisations 
that have chosen to stretch above the standard. Since a key area 
identified in recent feedback was performance management in the 
UK, we have carried out a full review and update of our performance 
management processes, and introduced the Personal Success Plan.
Community 
Mission statement: to make a positive contribution 
to the community
Science for society 
Following a request from the Combined Services Disabled Ski Team, 
our experts designed and manufactured a more competitive ski 
racing seat for Sergeant Mick Brennan, a double amputee who has 
discovered a real talent for downhill skiing as part of the Battle Back 
initiative to rehabilitate injured servicemen and women. Mick’s 
performance improved considerably with the seat and he achieved 
a Bronze medal in the Giant Slalom at the Canadian Nationals in 
Vancouver.
In 2009, two UK employees visited Saravan Province in southern Laos 
and worked with Norwegian People’s Aid as part of our unexploded 
ordnance (UXO) Science for Society Programme, which has been 
running for five years. The UXO is a legacy of the Vietnam war. The 
team provided training in UXO pinpointing, CAD, surveying and 
mapping, as well as simple practical solutions for water purification, 
bomb disposal and simple protection schemes.
Education outreach
QinetiQ collected three prestigious STEM Education Outreach 
Awards, from STEMNET including Support & Development, Most 
Dedicated Ambassador and Most Dedicated Organisation. In 2009 
we launched a strategic partnership with Shoeburyness High 
School to provide some business focus, to complement the STEM 
curriculum. We are working closely with the school on the delivery 
of the new, two-year STEM Leadership qualification and supporting 
16-year-old Fast Track students on the Applied Science course. Going 
forward, we aim to focus on our education outreach programmes, 
by developing partnerships with other key schools near our sites. 
QNA also recognises the importance of encouraging young people 
towards maths and science careers, and sponsors science and 
technology education in schools.
In the UK, we supported many students at various stages in their 
university careers: 16 pre-university students were hosted on 
the Year in Industry scheme, while other students worked in the 
company for up to a year during their undergraduate course. At any 
time, over 50 doctoral level students are sponsored, in conjunction 
with the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, on 
projects that are relevant to our business, with placements 
on various sites. 
Charity and community programmes
Employees across the Group undertook a range of volunteering 
activities in the community. QNA supported a number of employee-
driven initiatives and contributed time, resources and funding to 
numerous community grassroots efforts, such as Habit for Humanity 
and the Special Olympics. In addition, QNA encouraged active 
participation and support for military-aligned programmes, such 
as the Wounded Warrior Project for injured servicemen and women. 
In the UK, employees have been involved in a range of community 
activities, from conservation projects to beach safety talks for 
children. Total charitable giving from the business across the 
Group was £114,100 (see page 42). In addition, our UK employees 
raised £26,112 for our priority charities through a range of events, 
attracting corporate matched funding for priority charities and 
made contributions through our payroll giving scheme. 24 www.QinetiQ.com QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 25
Environment 
Mission statement: to be an excellent environmental steward
Carbon management
A highlight this year was meeting our target of attaining the Carbon 
Trust Standard which demonstrates that we have measured, 
managed and reduced our carbon emissions. For the third year, we 
provided information to the Carbon Disclosure Project and we also 
took part in the Business in the Community May Day Network. We 
recognise the importance of being prepared for the UK Government’s 
Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme and are 
well positioned, having put in place the Carbon Management Group 
(CMG) which brings together expertise from Estates, Environmental 
Management, CR, Procurement and the 
business. The CMG oversees our five-year 
carbon management plan, promotes energy 
efficiency and awareness, and sets and 
monitors targets. Following our carbon foot-
printing programme, this is the first year we 
are reporting CO

Environmental management and conservation 
We continue to maintain ISO 14001:2004 certification in the UK. 
This is evidence of effective controls as part of our Environmental 
Management Systems, which cover a broad range of activities, from 
knowledge and technology-based research and services, to weapons 
and systems testing. Our Australian business has also established a 
small group responsible for developing environmental initiatives. 
We take a responsible and proactive approach to the stewardship of 
the many Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) that we manage in 
the UK, with appropriate conservation management plans in place 
for all of them. We won a prestigious Sanctuary Award for our work 
on a SSSI on the MOD Hebrides range.
Waste
As part of our waste management programmes, we have extended 
data collection to the majority of sites we own or manage for 
the MOD and incorporated additional waste streams, the largest 
of which are construction and grounds waste. In QNA, recycling 
programmes operate across much of the business.

the Ministry of Defence and gained cross-Whitehall experience while 
on secondment to HM Treasury. The Board considers that Sir James’ 
expertise in the Government contracting domain, particularly with 
the UK MOD and HM Treasury, is highly beneficial in the context of 
QinetiQ’s Government sourced operations. 28 www.QinetiQ.com QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 29
Corporate governance report
Directors’ Report – Governance
The Board is committed to promoting the highest standards of 
corporate governance and believes that strong governance is 
key to delivering value to all stakeholders, maintaining investor 
confidence and managing change.
This section of the Annual Report, together with the Report of the 
Remuneration Committee on pages 36 to 41, describes how QinetiQ 
has promoted strong governance throughout the Group by applying 
the principles of the UK Financial Reporting Council’s Combined Code 
on Corporate Governance (the Combined Code). The Board considers 
that QinetiQ has complied with the provisions of the Combined Code 
throughout the last financial year, except that the Combined Code 
recommends that a company’s chairman should be independent 
on appointment and that its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) should 
not become chairman of the same company. Sir John Chisholm, the 
Chairman of the Group until February 2010, was not regarded as 
independent under the Combined Code as he was formerly QinetiQ’s 
CEO; the Board gave the reasons for this non-compliance both in the 
prospectus published as part of the Company’s Initial Public Offering 
(IPO) in 2006 and in subsequent Annual Reports.
The Board – governance, processes and systems
Highlights
• Conducted a global search culminating in the appointment 
of a new Chairman
• Managed the process of appointing a new Chief Executive Officer
• Created a new Security Committee and conducted a review of the 
composition of the Board Committees
• Appointed Sir Robert Nelson to conduct an independent 
investigation into the conclusions and recommendations made 
in the Haddon-Cave report
• Created a revised risk register and introduced clear processes 
in relation to oversight and management of risk.
Board objectives
• Provide support to the new Chief Executive Officer to ensure 
the Group’s success
• Assist in the development of a new strategic direction for the 
Group’s business
• Remain focused on succession planning for the Board
• Deliver the highest standards of health and safety 
management across the Group
• Support the Chief Executive Officer in ensuring that the 
key recommendations of Sir Robert Nelson’s review of the 
Haddon-Cave report, published in November 2009, are 
implemented across the Group
• Continue to promote the highest standards of corporate 
governance and rigorous oversight of Group performance 
and risk management.
Composition of the Board
The Board currently has ten members: the Non-executive Chairman; 
seven other Non-executive Directors; and two Executive Directors, 
namely the CEO and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO); with the 
objective of achieving a balance of Executive and Non-executive 
Directors.

Mark Elliott has been the Non-executive Chairman of QinetiQ since 
1 March 2010 following Sir John Chisholm stepping down from this 
role. Mr Elliott joined the Board as a Non-executive Director on 
1 June 2009. During the year the Board also welcomed David Langstaff, 
who joined as a Non-executive Director on 5 August 2009, Leo Quinn, 
who joined as QinetiQ’s Chief Executive Officer on 16 November 
2009 and Admiral Sir James Burnell-Nugent, who joined the Board 
as a Non-executive Director on 10 April 2010. Mr Quinn replaced 
Graham Love, who ceased to be CEO on 31 October 2009. The Board 
would like to express its thanks to Sir John Chisholm, Graham Love 
and Dr Peter Fellner, all of whom stepped down during the year, 
for their dedication and valuable contributions during their years 
of service.
The Board considers its overall size and composition to be 
appropriate, having regard in particular to the independence of 
character and integrity of all the Directors and the experience and 
skills which they bring to their duties, which prevents any individual 
or small group from dominating the Board’s decision-making.
The Board considers that the skills and experience of its individual 
members, particularly in the areas of UK/US defence and security, 
the commercialisation of innovative technologies, corporate 
finance, mergers and acquisitions and risk management, have 
been fundamental in the pursuit of QinetiQ’s strategic initiatives 
(as described in the Chief Executive Officer’s Review section of 
this Annual Report) in the past year. In addition, the quoted 
company experience available to members of the Board in a 
variety of industry sectors and international markets has also 
been invaluable to the Group as it seeks to penetrate new 
markets and geographic territories. 28 www.QinetiQ.com QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 29
Roles and responsibilities
The Board is responsible for managing the Group’s operations and, 
in this capacity, determines the Group’s strategic and investment 
policies. The Board also monitors the performance of the Group’s 
senior management team and organises its business to have regular 
interaction with key members of the Group, including those based in 
North America. The Directors are responsible for the management of 
the business of the Group and their powers are subject to the Articles 
of Association and any applicable legislation and regulation.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
The roles of Chairman and CEO are separate, with their responsibilities 
having been clearly articulated by the Board in writing. The Chairman, 
Mark Elliott, is responsible for the effective operation of the Board 
and ensures that all Directors are enabled and encouraged to play 
their full part in Board activities. The CEO, Leo Quinn, is responsible 
to the Board for directing and promoting the profitable operation 
and development of the Group consistent with enhancing long-term 
stakeholder value, which includes the day-to-day management of the 
Group, formulating, communicating and executing Group strategy, 
and the implementation of Board policies.
Senior Independent Director
The Senior Independent Non-executive Director is Sir David Lees. 
Sir David is also Deputy Chairman of the Board and serves as an 
additional point of contact for shareholders should they feel that 
their concerns are not being addressed through the normal channels. 
Sir David is, furthermore, available to fellow Non-executive Directors, 
either individually or collectively, should they wish to discuss matters 
of concern in a forum that does not include the Chairman, the 
Executive Directors or the senior management of QinetiQ.
Independence of Non-executive Directors
Of the current Directors of the Company, the Board considers 
Admiral Sir James Burnell-Nugent, Noreen Doyle, Mark Elliott, 
Admiral Edmund P. Giambastiani, David Langstaff, Sir David Lees 
and Nick Luff to be independent of QinetiQ’s executive management 
and free from any business or other relationships that could materially 
interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. Of the 
remaining Non-executive Directors, the Board considers that Colin 
Balmer is not independent for Combined Code purposes, on the basis 
that he was (until MOD sold its entire ordinary shareholding in the 
Company on 9 September 2008) the MOD’s nominated director.
Based on the above, the Board considers that over half of its members 
were independent Non-executive Directors throughout the last 
financial year.
Performance of the Board
During the financial year ended 31 March 2010, QinetiQ conducted 
its fourth evaluation of the performance of the Board and its 
Committees since IPO. Given that the Group had undertaken 
an externally facilitated evaluation in the previous financial year, 
and the number of Board changes occurring in year, the 2009/10 
evaluation exercise was an internal exercise led by Sir John Chisholm. 
The Chairman used the core conclusions arising out of the prior year’s 
exercise as a reference point for a series of questions focused on best 
practice areas of corporate governance, which was supplemented by 
a number of meetings held individually with each of the Directors at 
which the performance of the Board, its Committees and individual 
Board members was discussed. Sir David Lees, in his capacity as the 
Senior Independent Non-executive Director, also met with individual 
members of the Board to evaluate the performance of the Chairman. 
The evaluation process revealed that the operation of the Board 
was conducted in an open and transparent manner, with the Board 
possessing an appropriate range of skills which were well matched 
to QinetiQ’s business and having devoted increased attention to 
strategic planning, succession and risk management in the year. 
As a result of the evaluation exercise, the Board agreed to maintain 
its focus on these key issues in the coming year. 
As a separate exercise, the Chairman held various meetings with 
the Non-executive Directors in the last financial year, without the 
Executive Directors present, in order to review both the operation 
of the Board and the performance of the Executive Directors. 
In addition, the Executive Directors were appraised as part of 
the annual salary review process, which was overseen by the 
Remuneration Committee. 
Directors’ induction, on-going training and information
All newly-appointed Directors participate in an induction 
programme, which is tailored to meet their specific needs in relation 
to information on the Group. This induction programme includes 
an induction pack, which is refreshed to ensure it contains the most 
up-to-date information available on the Group.
All Directors are encouraged to visit QinetiQ’s principal sites and 
to meet a wide cross-section of the employee base. During the 
last financial year, the Board held one of its meetings at QinetiQ’s 
facility in McLean, Virginia and one at QinetiQ’s facilities in Waltham, 
Massachusetts, which allowed members of the Board to better 
appreciate the operational dynamics and technical offerings of the 
QNA business. The Board also held one of its meetings at QinetiQ’s 
Farnborough site.
As part of the corporate planning process, the Board has the 
opportunity to question the sector heads and the Executive Directors 
in relation to the formulation of the corporate plan at sector level 
and the impact of these plans on the Group strategy as a whole. 
The Non-executive Directors also have an opportunity to meet 
with other employees within the Group (including, but not limited 
to, other members of the senior management team) at lunchtime/
evening events, which are scheduled to coincide with Board meetings. 
Training is also available to the Board on key business issues or 
developments in policy, regulation or legislation on an ‘as needed’ 
basis. 
Each of the Directors has access to the services of the Company 
Secretary, and there is also an agreed procedure for the Directors 
to seek independent advice at the Company’s expense.
Re-election of Directors
Rules concerning the appointment and replacement of Directors 
of the Company are contained in the Articles of Association and 
changes to these articles must be submitted to shareholders for 
approval. According to the Articles of Association, all Directors 
are subject to election by shareholders at the first AGM following 
their appointment, and to re-election thereafter at intervals of no 
more than three years. It is the Company’s practice for each serving 
member of the Board to be put forward for election or re-election 
at each Annual General Meeting. 30 www.QinetiQ.com QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 31

Board meetings and attendance
The Board has regular scheduled meetings. Nine scheduled Board 
meetings were held in the last financial year. Members of the 
Board were also invited to attend a dinner on the occasion of each 
scheduled Board meeting, to assist in the process of relationship 
building and to ensure that key strategic initiatives were thoroughly 
discussed. The Board held two of its scheduled meetings in the US in 
the last financial year, to give members of the Board an opportunity 
to meet with senior management in QNA. One Board meeting was 
held at QinetiQ’s Farnborough site to provide members of the Board 
with greater opportunity to understand the operational dynamics of 
the UK business at first hand. 
The following table shows the number of Board meetings held 
during the year and the attendance by individual directors.

Matters reserved to the Board
The Board operates through a comprehensive set of processes, 
which define the schedule of matters to be considered by the Board 
and its Committees during the annual business cycle, the level of 
delegated authorities (both financial and non-financial) available to 
both Executive Directors and other layers of management within the 
business, and QinetiQ’s Business Ethics, Risk Management and Health, 
Safety and Environmental processes. The Board devotes one entire 
meeting each year to consider strategy and planning issues which 
have an impact on the Group, from which the five-year corporate plan 
is generated. The Board also has a clearly articulated set of matters 
which are specifically reserved to it for consideration, which include 
reviewing the annual budgets, raising indebtedness, granting security 
over Group assets, approving Group strategy and the corporate 
plan, approval of the annual and interim report and accounts, 
approval of significant investment, bid, acquisition and divestment 
transactions, approval of Human Resources policies (including pension 
arrangements), reviewing material litigation and monitoring the 
overall system of internal controls, including risk management.
Operation of the Board
The Board receives written reports from the CEO and CFO each 
month, together with a separate report on investor relations (which 
is prepared in consultation with QinetiQ’s brokers) and a report 
produced by the Company Secretary on key legal and regulatory 
issues affecting the Group. The Board also considers reports from the 
Chairs of the Committees of the Board at the next scheduled Board 
meeting, following the date on which each Committee meeting 
was held. 
The CEO’s monthly report addresses the key strategic initiatives 
which have had an impact on the Group since the previous meeting 
of the Board, and focuses, in particular, on the progress of each 
of the Sectors. Other key areas of focus include health, safety 
and environmental matters, employee and organisational issues, 
corporate responsibility, the status of key account management/
customer relationship initiatives, the pipeline of potential bids, 
acquisitions, disposals and investments, and the post-acquisition 
performance of recently acquired businesses. The Board also receives 
updates from the CEO’s key functional reports on an ‘as needed’ 
basis, on issues such as Human Resources, Treasury, Corporate 
Responsibility, Real Estate and Pensions, throughout the financial 
year. Key issues considered by the Board in the past year included 
succession planning, which culminated in the appointment of a 
new Chairman and CEO in year, strategy (in particular the strategic 
response to the operational challenges faced by the QNA and EMEA 
businesses, as described in the Business Review) and the Company’s 
response to the key findings of the Haddon-Cave report into the 
Nimrod aircraft which crashed in Afghanistan in 2006.
The CFO’s monthly report addresses the financial performance and 
outlook of the Group and each of the sectors, both on a monthly and 
year-to-date basis, with the key performance indicators analysed by 
the Board being those identified on pages 16 and 17. The Group Risk 
Register also forms part of the CFO’s report on a quarterly basis and 
tracks the ‘Principal risks and uncertainties’ identified on pages 18 to 
21 of the Business Review. The CFO also reports on a monthly basis, 
as part of his investor relations report, on the key issues raised by 
shareholders, potential investors and other important stakeholders 
on QinetiQ’s performance and key strategic initiatives.
Conflicts of interest
The Company has established a process requiring Directors to 
disclose proposed outside business interests before they are entered 
into. This enables prior assessment of any conflict, or potential 
conflict, of interest and any impact on time commitment. An annual 
review of all external interests is carried out by the Board.
Directors’ responsibilities
Statements explaining the Directors’ responsibilities for preparing 
the Group’s financial statements and the auditor’s responsibilities for 
reporting on those statements are set out on pages 44 and 45.
Other Directors’ information
Details of Executive Directors’ service contracts and the Non-
executive Directors’ letters of appointment are set out in the Report 
of the Remuneration Committee. Copies of Directors’ service contracts 
and letters of appointment will be available for inspection at the 
Company’s AGM.  30 www.QinetiQ.com QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 31
Other management committees
Responsibility for the day-to-day management of the Group’s 
activities, with the exception of QinetiQ’s North American 
operations (which are managed through the Proxy Board, as 
described in the section below headed ‘Management and control of 
US subsidiaries’), is conducted through the QinetiQ Executive Team 
(QET). The QET comprises the Group CEO, Group CFO, Functional 
Directors and the Managing Directors of each of the Sectors. The 
QET meets on a monthly basis, and receives weekly updates on key 
operational issues by way of pre-scheduled conference calls. The 
activities of the QET are supplemented by the Proxy Board and the 
Executive Management Team in QNA. Separate committees have 
also been established to review Group strategy in the areas 
of Technology, Communications and Corporate Responsibility, 
each of which meets on a periodic basis.
Board committees 
The Board has established five principal committees: the Audit 
Committee, the Remuneration Committee, the Nominations 
Committee, the Compliance Committee and the Security Committee. 
Each operates within written terms of reference approved by the 
Board, details of which are set out in the Investor Relations section 
of QinetiQ’s website (www.QinetiQ.com). Each Chairman of a Board 
Committee reports on the key issues discussed, and decisions taken, 
at the next meeting of the Board following the Committee meeting 
in question. Details of each of these Committees are summarised 
below, along with details of Committee members’ attendance at 
Committee meetings.

Highlights
• Introduction of an updated/more comprehensive 
self-certification tool
• Increased focus on QNA internal control activity.
Audit Committee – role and focus
Each member of the Audit Committee is an independent Non-
executive Director. The Committee is chaired by Nick Luff, who has 
been a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England 
and Wales since 1991. The Board considers him to have recent and 
relevant financial experience, given his former roles as CFO of P&O 
and P&O Princess Cruises and his current position as Finance Director 
of Centrica. The Audit Committee meets as necessary and at least 
four times a year. During the financial year ended 31 March 2010, 
the Committee met on five occasions. The external auditor has the 
right to request that a meeting of the Audit Committee be convened. 
During the past financial year, the Committee met with QinetiQ’s 
external auditor on two separate occasions, without Executive 
Directors present, to discuss the audit process. The Committee 
Chairman also met with the Group Head of Internal Audit on the 
same basis. 
The CEO, CFO, Group Financial Controller, Group Head of Internal 
Audit, the Internal Audit Manager, and a representative of the 
external auditor, normally attend Audit Committee meetings, 
except where not permitted.
During the last financial year, consideration of the audit process 
for the full-year and interim results represented the principal areas 
of focus for the Audit Committee. These included detailed reviews 
of asset valuation and impairment testing. The Committee also 
assessed the effectiveness of the Internal Audit function, through 
a balanced scorecard review process designed to measure the 
achievement of Internal Audit objectives, which resulted in the 
approval of a detailed 12-month work programme for the function.
In the context of the Group’s North American business, the 
Committee undertook two in-depth reviews of the internal 
controls environment across QNA, which included an assessment 
of the effectiveness of the financial controls in place across the US 
business, contract management activity and the resourcing of the 
QNA Internal Audit team. As part of its review of internal controls, 
the Committee focused in particular on those matters which had 
failed to achieve at least a ‘satisfactory’ audit rating in the year, and 
the management plans to address the issues raised by the Internal 
Audit function, which benefited from the introduction of a more 
comprehensive ‘self certification’ process across the EMEA and QNA 
businesses in year. The Committee also reviewed the activities of the 
pensions, tax, insurance and treasury functions in detail, as well as 
overseeing the level of KPMG’s audit fees. The Committee confirms 
its view that it has received sufficient reliable and timely information 
from management in the last financial year to enable it to fulfil 
its responsibilities.

Corporate governance report (continued)
Directors’ Report – Governance
In order to safeguard auditor independence and objectivity, the 
Committee ensures that any other advisory/consulting services 
provided by the auditor does not conflict with their statutory 
audit responsibilities and are conducted through entirely separate 
working teams; such advisory and/or consulting services generally 
only cover regulatory reporting, tax and mergers and acquisitions 
work. Any non-audit services conducted by the auditor require 
the consent of the CFO or the Chairman of the Audit Committee 
before being initiated, with any such services exceeding £50,000 
in value requiring the consent of the Audit Committee as a 
whole. In the last financial year, the only non-audit activity 
conducted by KPMG on behalf of QinetiQ which exceeded this 
£50,000 threshold, related to the provision of services to support 
detailed strategic planning work being conducted across the 
EMEA business, as well as taxation advisory services to the Group, 
neither of which the Committee concluded created any conflict 
of interest issues which might compromise the independence of 
KPMG audit work.
It is also QinetiQ’s policy that no KPMG employee may be 
appointed into a senior position within the QinetiQ Group 
without the prior approval of the CFO. The cost of non-audit 
work undertaken by the auditor was reviewed by the Committee 
on several occasions during the last financial year; this process 
enables the Committee to take corrective action if it believes that 
there is a risk of the auditor’s independence being undermined 
through the award of such work.
KPMG has been the Company’s auditor since 2003. The members 
of the Audit Committee have declared themselves satisfied with the 
performance of KPMG as the Company’s auditor in the last financial 
year. A rotation of KPMG’s lead audit partner was undertaken during 
2008; it is anticipated that he will continue in this role for a maximum 
term of five years.

Highlights
• Appointment of Mark Elliott as a Non-executive Director and 
Chairman elect
• Appointment of David Langstaff and Admiral Sir James Burnell-
Nugent as a Non-executive Directors
• Appointment of Leo Quinn as the Group CEO and Executive Director.
Nominations Committee – role and focus
The Committee meets as necessary and when called by its Chair. 
During the financial year ended 31 March 2010, the Committee met 
formally on three occasions and consulted informally on several 
other occasions.
The principal focus of the Committee’s activities during the financial 
year ended 31 March 2010 was to review QinetiQ’s succession 
planning processes at both the Executive and Non-executive 
Director levels. As part of the process, the Committee oversaw 
the recruitment of a new Chairman elect, which culminated in the 
appointment of Mark Elliott as Non-executive Director in June 2009. 
Mark took over the role of Chairman in March 2010. The Committee 
also oversaw the appointment of two additional Non-executive 
Directors, which culminated in the appointment of David Langstaff 
in August 2009 and Admiral Sir James Burnell-Nugent in April 2010, 
together with a new CEO, which culminated in the appointment of 
Leo Quinn in November 2009. 32 www.QinetiQ.com QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 33

Highlights
• Transition of the Committee’s focus to include wider compliance 
issues, such as ethics and the QNA Proxy Regime
• Further widening of the Committee’s remit, to include matters such 
as Trade Controls and Health, Safety and Environment.
Compliance Committee – role and focus 
During the last financial year, the remit of the Committee was 
widened to provide oversight of other significant compliance issues 
beyond the operation of the Compliance Regime, particularly: the 
activities that fall within the scope of the Helsinki Protocol covering 
trials involving human volunteers; the Group’s Business Ethics policy; 
and the Proxy regime.
The Committee continues to monitor the Compliance Regime, which 
is designed to give MOD customers confidence that QinetiQ is able 
to provide impartial advice during any competitive evaluation of a 
procurement where QinetiQ wishes to operate on both the ‘buy’ and 
the ‘supply’ sides. QinetiQ is required by its Articles of Association to 
implement a Compliance Regime, which was established on its creation 
out of DERA. Central to this Regime is the requirement for QinetiQ to 
seek permission from the MOD prior to providing commercial defence 
services to others where there is potential for a conflict of interest with 
the services that QinetiQ provides to the MOD.
In designing the Compliance Regime, the MOD and QinetiQ sought 
to achieve a balance between meeting the needs of the procurement 
customers within the MOD (principally Defence Equipment and 
Support) and the need to allow QinetiQ flexibility to exploit research 
into the supply chain and pursue its planned commercial activities, 
without compromising the defence or security interests of the UK. 
The Compliance Regime is largely self-policing, in that it is applied 
by QinetiQ in respect of its activities without extensive intervention 
or oversight by the MOD. Since the inception of the Compliance 
Regime, over 97% of the requests to the MOD to allow QinetiQ to 
operate on the supply side of the commercial defence market have 
been approved. Oversight of the operation of the Regime is provided 
by the Compliance Committee. The Board nominates two senior 
executives to act as Compliance Implementation Director and 
Compliance Audit Director.
QinetiQ’s Compliance Committee meets on four occasions each 
year. It receives a quarterly report on the compliance areas that it 
monitors from the Head of Business Assurance. In respect of the 
Compliance Regime, the Committee receives a report from the 
Company’s Compliance Implementation Director which describes 
the permissions which have been sought and granted since the last 
meeting of the Committee, and the status of projects where the 
potential conflicts of interest are being managed. The Committee 
also receives, from the Compliance Audit Director, a report on the 
effectiveness of the controls that are in place to ensure that the 
Regime is operated correctly. The Committee is the forum that would 
address any issues arising out of QinetiQ’s failure to comply with the 
requirements of the Regime. The Committee reviews the systems 
that support the Compliance Regime and those that may have an 
impact on it, directing changes, if appropriate. A computer-based 
training package continues to be used to ensure that all relevant 
employees have a satisfactory knowledge of the operation of the 
Regime. For key roles, competence is demonstrated by passing an 
annual mandatory test.
The MOD reviews the operation and effectiveness of the Compliance 
Regime, through its right to have an observer at the Compliance 
Committee meetings.
During the year, a total of six new permissions were sought from 
the MOD under the Compliance Regime, where potential conflicts 
of interest were identified by QinetiQ, with one permission request 
being outstanding from the previous year. Of these seven requests, 
five were approved, one was rejected and one remained outstanding 
at the end of March 2010. At the end of the year, 16 firewalls were 
in place, with two being established and ten being closed down 
during the year. Since vesting in 2001, a total of 119 firewalls have 
operated with 103 now closed. No breaches of the MOD Compliance 
Regime were noted during the year. A firewall is a series of rules and 
procedures governing written and oral communication between 
employees contributing to products in an MOD competition with 
industry (outside the wall) and employees assessing those products 
for MOD (inside the wall).
Following the end of the last financial year, the remit of the 
Committee was further widened to include oversight of Health, 
Safety and Environment, Trade Controls, Ethics and Security.

Corporate governance report (continued)
Directors’ Report – Governance
Security Committee – role and focus 
The Security Committee was established in June 2009 to allow UK 
nationals on the Board to consider matters of a UK national security 
dimension which have an impact on QinetiQ’s UK business. The 
Committee has not met since its inception as no business has 
arisen which would require it to do so. The Committee is chaired 
by Colin Balmer.
Going concern
The Group’s activities, combined with the factors that are likely to 
affect its future development and performance, are set out in the 
CEO’s review on pages 6 to 11. The CFO’s report on pages 12 to 15 
sets out details on the financial position of the Group, the cash flows, 
committed borrowing facilities, liquidity and the Group’s policies and 
processes for managing both its capital and financial risks. Note 27 to 
the financial statements also provides details of the Group’s hedging 
activities, financial instruments and its exposure to liquidity and 
credit risk.
The market conditions in which the Group operates have been, 
and are expected to continue to be, challenging as spending from 
the Group’s key customers in its primary markets in the UK and US 
remain under pressure. In light of this, during the year the Group 
announced revised results expectations which highlighted the 
challenges experienced from our key markets and customers. 
Despite these challenges the Directors believe that the Group is 
well positioned to manage its overall business risks successfully. 
After making the appropriate enquiries, including a review of the 
latest five-year forecast for cash flow and results, the Directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Consequently, the Annual Report and Accounts have been prepared 
on a going concern basis.
Communication with shareholders
The Company attaches significant importance to the effectiveness of 
its communications with shareholders. During the last financial year, 
the Company has maintained regular dialogue with institutional 
shareholders and the financial community, which has included 
presentations of the full-year and interim results (including investor 
‘road shows’ held in the UK, Europe and US), regular meetings 
with major shareholders and industry analysts, participation in 
stockbrokers’ seminars and investor site visits. In addition, each 
member of the Board attended the Company’s Annual General 
Meeting in August 2009 and a number of Non-executive Directors 
attended key shareholder events in the last financial year, including 
the full-year and interim results presentations, at which they were 
available to take questions from shareholders. All shareholders 
and potential shareholders can gain access to the Annual Report, 
presentations to investors and other significant information about 
QinetiQ on the Company’s website (www.QinetiQ.com).
Holders of ordinary shares may attend the Company’s AGM at 
which the Company highlights key business developments during 
the year and at which shareholders have an opportunity to ask 
questions. The Chairs of the Audit, Remuneration, Nominations, 
Compliance and Security Committees will be available to answer any 
questions on the work of the Committees. The Company confirms 
that it will send the AGM Notice and relevant documentation to all 
shareholders at least 20 working days before the date of the AGM. 
For those shareholders who have elected to receive communications 
electronically, notice is given of the availability of documents on the 
Investor Relations Section of the Group’s website.
All shareholders will be entitled to vote on the resolutions put to the 
AGM and, to ensure that all votes are counted, a poll will be taken on 
all the resolutions in the Notice of Meeting. The results of the votes 
on the resolutions will be published on the Company’s website.

Responsibility for maintaining regular communications with

by an investor relations function which reports to the CFO. The Board 
is informed on a regular basis of key shareholder issues, including 
share price performance, the composition of the shareholder register 
and City expectations. The Chairman, the Senior Independent 
Director and Non-executive Directors make themselves available 
to meet with shareholders as required.
Management and control of US subsidiaries
QinetiQ’s principal US subsidiaries are currently required by the US 
National Industrial Security Program to maintain facility security 
clearances and to be insulated from foreign ownership, control 
or influence. To comply with these requirements, QinetiQ North 
America, Inc. (formerly known as QinetiQ North America Operations, 
LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of QinetiQ in the US and the holding 
company for the substantive part of QinetiQ’s North American 
operations) and the US DoD have entered into a proxy agreement 
that regulates the ownership, management and operation of 
these companies. Pursuant to this proxy arrangement, QinetiQ has 
appointed four US citizens (Peter Marino, Riley Mixson, John Currier 
and Vince Vitto) holding requisite US security clearances as proxy 
holders to exercise the voting rights of QinetiQ North America, Inc.’s 
shares in the US subsidiaries. The proxy holders are also appointed 
as directors of the relevant US subsidiaries and, in addition to their 
powers as directors, have power under the proxy arrangements 
to exercise all prerogatives of share ownership of QinetiQ North 
America, Inc. The proxy holders have a fiduciary duty to, and agree 
to perform their role in the best interests of, QinetiQ North America, 
Inc. and consistent with the national security concerns of the US. 
QinetiQ does not have any representation on the boards of the 
subsidiaries covered by the proxy agreement and does not have the 
right to attend board meetings. QinetiQ may not remove the proxy 
holders except for acts of gross negligence or wilful misconduct 
or for breach of the proxy agreements (with the consent of the 
US Defense Security Service).
Internal controls
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s system of 
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness in safeguarding 
shareholders’ interests and the Company’s assets. However, such a 
system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives, and can provide only reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or 
loss. QinetiQ managers are responsible for the identification and 
evaluation of significant risks applicable to their areas of business, 
together with the design and operation of suitable internal controls 
to ensure effective mitigation. These risks, which are related to the 
achievement of business objectives, are assessed on a continual basis 
and may be associated with a variety of internal and external events, 
including control breakdowns, competition, disruption, regulatory 
requirements and natural and other catastrophes.
An annual process of hierarchical self-certification has been 
established within the organisation which provides a documented 
and auditable trail of accountability for the operation of the system 
of internal control. 
This process is informed by a rigorous and structured self-assessment 
that addresses all the guidance cited in the Combined Code and 
compliance with Company policy. The process provides for successive 
assurances to be given at increasingly higher levels of management 
and, finally, to the Board. The process is informed by the Internal 
Audit function, which also provides a degree of assurance as to the 
operation and validity of the system of internal control. In the last 
financial year the assessment was re-designed to provide greater 
objectivity and incorporate a wider scope. Planned corrective actions 
are independently monitored for their timely completion. 
The centrally provided internal audit programme is prioritised 
according to risks identified by the Company and is integrated across 
all business and functional dimensions, thereby reducing issues of 
overlap or gaps in coverage. These risks are identified dynamically 
and the Board is involved in this process as well as the QinetiQ 
Executive Team and the QNA Executive Team.
The Audit Committee reviews, on behalf of the Board, the risk 
management process and the system of internal control necessary 
to manage risks and presents its findings to the Board. Internal Audit 
independently reviews the risk identification and control processes 
implemented by management and reports to the Audit Committee. 
Where areas for improvement in the system of internal control 
are identified, the Board considers the recommendations made by 
the QinetiQ Executive Team, the QNA Executive Team, the Audit 
Committee and the Compliance Committee. 
The Audit Committee also reviews the assurance process, ensuring 
that an appropriate mix of techniques is used to obtain the level 
of assurance required by the Board. It presents its findings to the 
Board on a regular basis. The Board reviewed the effectiveness of the 
system of internal control that was in operation during the financial 
year ended 31 March 2010. The Board also routinely challenges the 
management to ensure that the systems of internal control are 
constantly improving to maintain their continuing effectiveness.
QinetiQ has in place internal procedures which are designed not only 
to comply with, but to exceed, international best practice in relation to 
the prevention of corruption. This is facilitated by the engagement of 
independent, internationally recognised organisations, such as TRACE 
(Transparent Agents and Contracting Entities) which conduct anti-
bribery due diligence reviews and compliance training on behalf of 
the Group, particularly in circumstances in which QinetiQ is planning 
to engage third-party agents overseas. QinetiQ has, since 2006, been 
a member of the UK Defence Industry Anti-corruption Forum. 36 www.QinetiQ.com QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 37
Remuneration report
Directors’ Report – Governance
Introduction
I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committee’s report 
on Directors’ remuneration for the year to 31 March 2010.
The primary objectives of our remuneration policy remain unchanged:
• Incentivising key executives and managers
• Driving superior performance in both the short and long term
• Alignment with the interests of shareholders.
During the year, the Committee approved the remuneration 
arrangements for the new Chief Executive Officer (CEO) which are 
laid out in this report. Exit payments to the former CEO, Graham 
Love, were agreed by the Committee in the light of existing 
contractual arrangements and the performance of the business 
at the time of exit and these arrangements are also detailed in 
this report.
Given the current challenging environment and our commitment 
to pay for performance, we are reviewing all existing incentive 
arrangements to consider whether they remain appropriate to the 
Company’s strategy.
Noreen Doyle Chair, Remuneration Committee
2 June 2010
Report of the Remuneration Committee
The following Report of the Remuneration Committee has been 
approved by the Board for submission to shareholders.
The Report covers the remuneration of Directors and includes 
specific disclosures relating to their compensation, shares and other 
interests. The report also describes the share-based incentive plans 
available to Executive Directors and to other employees. This report 
has been prepared and, where appropriate, audited, in accordance 
with the requirements of the Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and the FSA 
Listing Rules.
Membership
The Committee is composed of the following Non-executive 
Directors:
• Noreen Doyle • Mark Elliott
• Colin Balmer • David Langstaff
• Admiral Sir James Burnell-Nugent
Dr Peter Fellner served on the Committee until his resignation 
from the Board on 4 August 2009. Sir David Lees was a member 
of the Committee until 28 April 2010 when he was replaced by 
Admiral Sir James Burnell-Nugent.
The full Terms of Reference of the Committee can be found on 
the QinetiQ website (www.QinetiQ.com). Copies are also available 
on request.
Governance
The Committee is chaired by Noreen Doyle and all its members 
are Non-executive Directors. In the financial year 2009/10, the 
Committee met six times.
During the year, the Committee received advice from its appointed 
independent advisors, Deloitte LLP (‘Deloitte’). Deloitte provided other 
consulting services during the year to QinetiQ, but did not provide advice 
on executive remuneration matters other than to the Committee.
Following a review and a formal tender process, the Committee has 
appointed new independent advisers, to support the review of the 
existing incentive arrangements.
Market data was provided by Deloitte and by Hewitt New Bridge Street 
who also advised on whether performance targets had been met.
The former Group Chairman, Group Chief Executive, Group HR Director 
and Group Head of Reward also provided advice to the Committee. 
No employee of QinetiQ is permitted to participate in discussions 
about their own remuneration.
Activities
During 2009/10 the Committee meetings covered a number 
of topics including:
April • Executive Directors’ FY09 bonuses
• FY10 performance targets
May • Executive Directors’ salary reviews
• Directors’ Remuneration report
•  Executive team salary reviews and FY09 bonuses
July •  Performance Share Plan, Restricted Stock Unit and 
Share Option awards
October • Offer to Leo Quinn
• Exit terms for Graham Love
November • Review of Executive team total compensation
• Update on pay trends
• Review of Executive team shareholdings
January • Review of Remuneration Committee remit
• Review of comparator group
The key purpose of the Committee is to ensure that the 
remuneration structure supports the Company’s strategy 
and that we are able to attract, retain and motivate the 
highest calibre executives while aligning their interests 
with those of shareholders.
Noreen Doyle Chair, Remuneration Committee 36 www.QinetiQ.com QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 37
Directors’ remuneration policy
The Committee aims to maintain a remuneration policy, consistent 
with the Company’s business objectives, which:
• attracts, retains and motivates individuals of high calibre;
• is responsive to both Company and personal performance; and
• competitive within industry.
The remuneration policy is built on the following philosophy:
• remuneration packages are structured to support business strategy 
and conform to current best practice;
• appropriate rewards are given for meeting specific target objectives 
set at the beginning of each year;
• incremental compensation is achieved for attaining stretch 
performance targets; and
• objectives are measured on metrics designed to be consistent with 
the interests of all shareholders.
The total remuneration levels of the Executive Directors are reviewed 
annually by the Committee, taking into account:
• performance of the executive against specific targets;
• competitive market practice and remuneration levels; and
• the general economic environment.
Base salary
Executive Directors’ base salaries are reviewed annually as are all 
other employees. There were no changes in salary for the Executive 
Directors in 2009/10, in line with the treatment of the majority of 
employees within QinetiQ and reflecting market conditions.
External remuneration consultants provide data about market salary 
levels. For market comparison purposes, account is taken of company 
type, sector and company size in terms of both market capitalisation 
and turnover.
No salary increase has been recommended for Executive Directors 
in respect of 2010/11.

Annual cash bonus
Executive Directors participate in an annual cash bonus plan which 
is non-pensionable. Bonuses are linked to Group performance targets 
and are modified for performance against personal objectives. The 
2009/10 bonus potential and awards are laid out in the following 
table, expressed as a percentage of salary.

The cash bonus was determined on a constant exchange rate basis, 
against four elements in 2009/10: operating profit; underlying EPS; 
operating cash flow; and turnover.
During 2009/10, target operating profit was not achieved and 
therefore annual bonuses have not been awarded. 
Leo Quinn joined the Company on 16 November 2009 and was thus 
eligible for a cash bonus based on his performance during his 4½ 
months as CEO. The Board agreed that Leo Quinn had achieved his 
partial year objectives and was eligible for a pro-rated annual cash 
bonus. However, in reflecting on the current results of the Group, 
Leo Quinn waived his right to a bonus for the financial year ended 
31 March 2010.
In line with the corporate plan for 2010/11 target payment has been 
reduced as in the table below and the new bonus plan will focus on:
• operating profit;
• operating cash flow; and
• underlying EPS.

Deferred Annual Bonus (DAB) Plan 
The Deferred Annual Bonus Plan aligns the interests of executives 
with shareholders and aids retention of key individuals by ensuring 
that executives are incentivised to take part of their annual bonus 
awards in shares rather than cash.
Executive Directors have a mandatory deferral of 30% of any bonus 
payable and may voluntarily defer up to 50% of their bonus into 
QinetiQ shares. Any deferred bonus will be matched based on EPS 
performance up to a maximum match of 100% of the deferred 
element.
The EPS element is earned only if EPS growth, measured over three 
years, exceeds defined targets. EPS must grow by at least 22.5% 
to trigger any vesting, at which point 25% of the award will vest. 
Vesting increases pro rata to EPS growth up to a maximum of 100% 
of the award vesting at 52% EPS growth, as illustrated below.
Awards are in the form of matching shares delivered after three years, 
subject to the achievement of the EPS-based performance conditions.
Where an individual participates in the DAB and also receives an award 
under the Performance Share Plan (PSP), they will not receive share 
awards which, in aggregate, exceed 150% of base salary in any one year. 38 www.QinetiQ.com QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 39

Long-term incentives for Executive Directors
The objective is to align the rewards of executives with returns 
to shareholders by a focus on increasing the share price over the 
medium to long term. Executive Directors are eligible to participate 
in both the PSP and the DAB Plan.
These arrangements are the principal means for long-term 
incentivisation of the Executive Directors and the direct reports of 
the CEO. The Committee considered various performance conditions 
and determined that the criteria set out below were appropriate to 
incentivise the long-term creation of shareholder value.
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
Awards of performance shares under the PSP were made to 
Executive Directors and a limited number of other senior 
executives in July 2009 and to certain individuals on joining. Share 
awards are contingent on meeting pre-determined performance 
criteria. Individual participants’ award levels are determined by 
the Committee annually based on these criteria and, with due 
consideration of business and personal performance.
Executive Directors are eligible to receive awards with a value of up 
to 100% of base salary and other executives up to 75% of base salary.
Awards are earned based on an equal weighting of relative total 
shareholder return (TSR) performance and absolute underlying 
earnings per share (EPS) growth.
The EPS performance criteria for the PSP is the same as that applied 
to the DAB (outlined above).
The TSR part of the award is measured against the constituents 
of the following comparator group of companies:
Babcock International plc Invensys plc
BAE Systems plc Logica plc
BBA Aviation plc Meggitt plc
Bodycote International plc The Morgan Crucible Company plc
Capita Group plc Rolls-Royce plc 
Chemring Group plc Serco plc
Cobham plc Senior plc
Cookson Group plc Tomkins plc
GKN plc Ultra Electronics plc
Halma plc VT Group plc
Hampson Industries PLC Victrex Group plc
IMI plc WS Atkins plc
The TSR element is earned only if relative performance is at least at 
median against this comparator group over a three-year performance 
period, calculated by an independent third party.

Incentive arrangements for new CEO
The Board appointed Leo Quinn on 16 November 2009. To attract 
the services of Leo Quinn, the Committee recommended and the 
Board approved a share scheme based on the existing long-term 
incentive plan and using the same TSR and EPS metrics as the PSP. 
The Board granted a Matching Share Award under which Leo Quinn 
invested £1m in QinetiQ shares. The Company agreed to match that 
investment based on TSR and EPS criteria as in the PSP.
In addition Leo Quinn was granted a PSP Mirror Award, with the 
terms of the plan mirroring the normal PSP plan as described 
opposite.
External appointments
QinetiQ allows its Executive Directors to broaden their knowledge and 
experience by becoming Non-executive Directors of other companies. 
Appointments are approved by the Board or the Committee on 
the basis that there is no conflict of interest or deterioration in the 
Executive Director’s performance. Fees are normally retained by 
the individual. During the year ended 31 March 2010, none of the 
Executive Directors held such an appointment at a public company.
Performance graph
The graph below shows the Company’s TSR over the period from

(g)

QinetiQ’s policy is that Executive Directors should have contracts with a rolling term providing for a maximum of one year’s notice. Consequently, 
no Executive Director has a contractual notice period in excess of 12 months. In the event of early termination, this ensures that compensation is 
restricted to a maximum of 12 months’ basic salary and benefits. The Committee will generally require mitigation to reduce the compensation 
payable to a departing Executive Director.
Non-executive Directors’ terms, conditions and fees
The Group Chairman reviews the fees of the Non-executive Directors 
and makes recommendations to the Board. Non-executive Directors 
receive additional fees as agreed by the Board for the chairing of 
Board committees to take account of the additional responsibilities of 
the role. The Chairman’s fees are reviewed by the Senior Independent 
Non-executive Director who makes recommendations to the Board.
The level of fees paid in UK organisations of a similar size and 
complexity to QinetiQ is considered in setting the remuneration 
policy for Non-executive Directors. The fees are neither performance 
related nor pensionable. Non-executive Directors are not eligible 
to participate in bonus, profit sharing or employee share schemes. 
Current fee structures for Non-executive Directors are shown below.
2009/10 fees
Non-executive Chairman £225,000
Basic fee for UK-resident Non-executive Director £40,000
Basic fee for US-resident Non-executive Director $100,000
or £50,000
Additional fee for chairing a Committee £7,000
Additional fee to Deputy Chairman/Senior 
Independent Non-executive Director
£10,000
As the Group Chairman is a US resident, the Board have agreed 
an accommodation allowance of £75,000 per annum.
Excluding the Group Chairman, an additional fee of $4,000 is payable 
to US-resident Non-executive Directors when they attend Board 
Meetings in the UK.
The review of fees scheduled for October 2009 was deferred until 
Summer 2010.
Non-executive Directors’ contracts are renewed on a rolling twelve-
month basis subject to reappointment at the Annual General 
Meeting. There are no provisions in their contracts for compensation 
on early termination.
Management of share based rewards
The Committee also oversees arrangements for share-based reward 
in respect of managers and the wider workforce. In addition to PSP, 
the Company also operates the following executive share plans:
Executive plans
• QinetiQ Share Option Scheme (QSOS)
• Restricted Stock Units (RSU)
Executive Directors do not participate in either plan. 40 www.QinetiQ.com QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 41
Remuneration report (continued)
Directors’ Report – Governance
No awards were made during the year under QSOS. Provision exists 
for annual awards up to a face value of 300% of salary to be granted.
All-employee plans
• Share Incentive Plan (UK and Australia)
The Share Incentive Plan was operated in the UK and Australia 
in the form of a share purchase award with matching company 
contribution to encourage employee ownership and engagement 
in the business.
Restricted Stock Units
RSU awards are used in QinetiQ North America to retain and 
motivate senior managers. The RSU awards vest evenly over a four-
year period. The vesting of half of the award is subject to a condition 
that organic profit grows by a minimum of 5% per annum. Maximum 
vesting of 125% of the award occurs at 15% per annum organic profit 
growth. The other half of the award is subject to time-based vesting 
criteria.
Awards are granted based on business performance, balanced with 
the need to attract, retain and motivate high-calibre employees.
Dilution limits 
In accordance with ABI guidelines, the Committee has determined 
that no more than 10% of the Company’s issued share capital will 
be used under all of the Company’s share schemes. The dilution as 
at 31 March 2010 was significantly below this 10% level, and below 
5% in respect of executive schemes. In addition, the Board intends 
to continue to satisfy a proportion of awards with purchased shares 
held in the employee benefit trust.
Personal shareholding policy
The Committee believes that a powerful way to align Executives’ 
interests with those of shareholders is for the Executives to build up 
and retain a personal holding in QinetiQ shares. 
The CEO and CFO are required to hold the equivalent of one times 
their base salary in QinetiQ shares.
David Mellors, having joined on 20 August 2008, has been given 
four years to build up such a shareholding. The Chief Executive has 
already met the Committee’s guideline on minimum shareholding 
requirement.
Direct reports of the CEO are required to hold the equivalent of 50% 
of their base salary in shares. These can be accumulated over a four-
year period following appointment.

Directors’ Report – Governance 
Other statutory information
Principal activity
QinetiQ Group plc is a public limited company, listed on the London 
Stock Exchange and incorporated in England and Wales with 
registered number 4586941.
QinetiQ Group plc is the parent company of a Group whose principal 
activities during the year were the supply of technical advice to 
customers in the global aerospace, defence and security markets. 
Customers include government organisations, such as the UK MOD 
and the US DoD and commercial customers around the world.
Research and development
One of the Group’s principal business streams is the provision of 
funded research and development (R&D) for customers. The Group 
also invests in the commercialisation of promising technologies 
across all areas of business. 
The majority of R&D-related expenditure is incurred on behalf of 
customers as part of specific funded research contracts. R&D costs 
are included in the income statement and R&D income is reflected 
within revenue. In the financial year, the Group recorded £425.6m 
(2009: £468.5m) of total R&D-related expenditure, of which £418.3m 
was customer-funded work (2009: £457.0m). 
In the year to 31 March 2010, £7.3m (2009: £11.5m) of internally 
funded R&D was charged to the income statement. £70.6m (2009: 
£0.2m) of late-stage development costs were capitalised and £3.0m 
(2009: £2.4m) of capitalised development costs were amortised in 
the year.
Policy and practice on payment of suppliers
The policy of the Group is to agree terms of payment prior to 
commencing trade with a supplier and to abide by those terms 
based on the timely submission of satisfactory invoices. At 31 March 
2010, the trade creditors of the Group represented 28 days of annual 
purchases (2009: 42 days).
Political and charitable contributions
QinetiQ does not make political donations to parties as that term 
would be commonly recognised. The legal definition of that term 
is, however, quite broad and may have the effect of covering a 
number of normal business activities that would not commonly be 
perceived to be political donations, such as sponsorship of events. 
These may include legitimate interactions in making MPs and others 
in the political world aware of key industry issues and matters 
affecting QinetiQ, which make an important contribution to their 
understanding of QinetiQ, the markets in which it operates and their 
constituents work. During the last financial year this expenditure 
amounted to no more than £15,000.
Charitable donations during the year across the Group amounted 
to £114,100 (2009: £133,500).
Share capital
As at 31 March 2010 the Company had allotted and fully paid share 
capital of 660,476,373 ordinary shares of 1p each with an aggregate 
nominal value of £6.6 million (including shares held by employee 
share trusts) and one Special Share with an aggregate nominal 
value of £1.
Details of the shares issued during the financial year are shown 
in note 32 on page 84. 
The rights of ordinary shareholders are set out in the Articles of 
Association. The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive 
the Company’s reports and accounts, to attend and speak at General 
Meetings of the Company, to exercise voting rights in person or by 
appointing a proxy and to receive a dividend where declared or paid 
out of profits available for such a purpose.
The Special Share is held by HM Government through the Secretary 
of State for Defence and it confers certain rights under the Articles of 
Association which are detailed in note 32 on page 84. These include 
the right to require certain persons with a material interest in QinetiQ 
to dispose of some or all of their ordinary shares on the grounds of 
national security or conflict of interest. The Special Share may only be 
held by and transferred to HM Government. At any time the Special 
Shareholder may require QinetiQ to redeem the share at par and if 
wound up the Special Shareholder would be entitled to be repaid 
capital before other shareholders. Any variation of the rights attaching 
to the Special Share requires the written approval of the MOD.
Change of control – significant agreements
The following significant agreements contain provisions entitling 
the counter parties to require prior approval, exercise termination, 
alteration or other similar rights in the event of a change of control 
of the Company or if the Company no longer remains a UK company:
• the Combined Aerial Target Service contract is a 20-year contract 
awarded to QinetiQ by MOD on 14 December 2006. The terms of 
this contract require QinetiQ Limited to remain a UK company which 
is incorporated under the laws of any part of the UK or an overseas 
company registered in the UK and that at least 50% of the Board of 
Directors are UK nationals. The terms also contain change of control 
conditions and restricted share transfer conditions which require 
prior approval from HM Government if there is a material change in 
the ownership of QinetiQ Limited’s share capital, unless the change 
relates to shares listed on a regulated market, with material defined 
as being 10% or more of the share capital. Additionally, there 
are restrictions on transfers of shares to persons from countries 
appearing on the restricted list as issued by HM Government; and
• the Long-Term Partnering Agreement is a 25-year contract which 
QinetiQ Limited signed on 28 February 2003 to provide test, 
evaluation and training services to the MOD. This contract contains 
conditions where the prior approval of HM Government is required 
if the contractor, QinetiQ Limited, ceases to be a subsidiary of the 
QinetiQ Group, except where such change in control is permitted 
under the Shareholders Agreement to which MOD is a party.
The Company is party to a £500m Revolving Credit Facility with 
Lloyds TSB Bank plc (as agent) expiring 19 August 2012. Under the 
terms of the facility, if either (1) the MOD ceases to retain in its 
capacity as Special Shareholder its Special Shareholders Rights; 
or (2) there is a change of control of the Company, any lender may 
request by not less than 90 days’ notice to the Company, that its 
commitment be cancelled and all outstanding amounts be repaid 
to that lender at the expiry of such notice period.
On 6 December 2006, QinetiQ US Holdings, Inc., formerly known 
as QinetiQ North America, Inc (as Borrower) and the Company (as 
Guarantor) entered into a Note Purchase Agreement to issue $135m 
5.44% Senior Notes due 6 December 2013 and $125m 5.50% Senior 
Notes due 6 December 2016. Under the terms of the agreement, 
if either (1) the MOD ceases to retain in its capacity as Special 
Shareholder its Special Shareholders Rights; or (2) there is a change 
of control of the Company; and (3) in either case where there has 
been a rating downgrade, or where there are no rated securities 
(unless a rating of at least investment grade is not obtained within 
90 days of the change of control), the Notes must be offered for 
prepayment by the Company within 21 days of the change of control. 
The prepayment date would be no later than 45 days after the offer 
of prepayment by the Company. 42 www.QinetiQ.com QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 43
On 5 February 2009, QinetiQ US Holdings, Inc., formerly known 
as QinetiQ North America, Inc. (as Borrower) and the Company (as 
Guarantor) entered into a Note Purchase Agreement to issue $62m 
7.13% Senior Notes due 5 February 2016 and $238m 7.62% Senior Notes 
due 5 February 2019. Under the terms of the agreement, if either (1) the 
MOD ceases to retain in its capacity as Special Shareholder its Special 
Shareholders Rights; or (2) there is a change of control of the Company, 
the Notes must be offered for prepayment within 21 days of the 
change of control. The prepayment date would be no later than 
45 days after the offer of prepayment by the Company.

up to an aggregate nominal value of £4,403,174 (£2,201,587 pursuant 
only to a rights issue), to disapply pre-emption rights (up to 5% of 
the issued ordinary share capital) and for the Company to purchase

resolutions will be laid before the 2010 AGM.
During the year, the Company provided funding to the trustees 
of its employee share schemes to make market purchases of the 
Company’s ordinary shares to cover future obligations under 
outstanding share-option and other share-based awards. Further 
details are disclosed in note 32 on page 84.
Restrictions on transfer of shares
As outlined in Note 32 on page 84, the Special Share confers certain 
rights under the Company’s Articles of Association to require certain 
persons with an interest in QinetiQ’s shares which exceed certain 
prescribed thresholds to dispose of some or all of their ordinary 
shares on grounds of national security or conflict of interest.
Articles of Association
Save in the respect of any variation to the rights attaching to the 
Special Share, the Company has not adopted any special rules 
relating to the amendment of the Company’s Articles of Association 
other than as provided under UK corporate law.
Employees
The Group is an equal opportunities employer, upholds the principles 
of the UK Employment Service’s ‘Two Ticks’ symbol and is accredited

strategies for professional and career development.

briefings, trade union consultation, the newly created QinetiQ 
Employee Forum and widespread training programmes.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
Directors’ Report – Governance 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent 
company financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and applicable law and 
have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements 
in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law 
(UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of 
their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU;
• for the parent company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent 
company financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent 
company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the parent company and enable them to 
ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and 
to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement 
that complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions. 
Responsibility statement of the Directors 
in respect of the Annual Report
We, the Directors of the Company, confirm that to the best 
of our knowledge:
• the financial statements of the Group have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, and for the Company 
under UK GAAP, in accordance with applicable United Kingdom 
law and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Group; and
• the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the Group, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that face the Group.

Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.

Notes to the financial statements
 
 
50 
1. Significant accounting policies 
Accounting policies 
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently 
to all periods presented in dealing with items which are considered 
material in relation to the Group’s financial statements. The Group 
separately presents acquisition amortisation and specific non-
recurring items in the income statement which, in the judgement 
of the Directors, need to be disclosed separately by virtue of 
their size and incidence in order for the reader to obtain a proper 
understanding of the financial information. Specific non-recurring 
items include amounts relating to gains and losses on business 
divestments and unrealised impairments and in 2010 the 
impairment of property, plant and equipment, impairment 
of intangible assets and EMEA reorganisation costs. 
Basis of preparation 
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared on a going 
concern basis as discussed in the Corporate Governance report on 
page 34. The Group’s financial statements have been prepared and 
approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRS’) and 
the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under 
IFRS. The Company has elected to prepare its parent company 
financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP; these are 
presented on pages 94 to 96. The financial statements have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the 
revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets, and other relevant 
financial assets and liabilities. Non-current assets held for sale 
are held at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs 
to sell. The Group’s reporting currency is sterling and unless 
otherwise stated the financial statements are rounded to the 
nearest hundred thousand. 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial 
statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings up 
to 31 March 2010. The purchase method of accounting has been 
adopted. Those subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of 
in the period are included in the consolidated income statement 
from the date control is obtained to the date that control is lost 
(usually on acquisition and disposal respectively). A subsidiary 
is an entity over which the Group has the power to govern financial 
and operating policies in order to obtain benefits. Potential voting 
rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered 
when determining control. 
An associate is an undertaking over which the Group exercises 
significant influence, usually from 20% to 50% of the equity 
voting rights, over financial and operating policy. A joint venture 
is an undertaking over which the Group exercises joint control. 
Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity 
method from the date of acquisition up to the date of disposal. The 
Group’s investments in associates and joint ventures are held at cost 
including goodwill on acquisition and any post-acquisition changes 
in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate less any 
impairment to the recoverable amount. Where an associate or 
joint venture has net liabilities, full provision is made for the Group’s 
share of liabilities where there is a constructive or legal obligation 
to provide additional funding to the associate or joint venture. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries, joint ventures and 
associates are adjusted where necessary to ensure compliance 
with Group accounting policies. 
On consolidation, all intra-group income, expenses and balances 
are eliminated.  
Revenue 
Revenue represents the value of work performed for customers, 
and is measured net of value added and other sales taxes on the 
following bases. 
Long-term contracts 
The Group’s long-term contract arrangements are accounted 
for under IAS 11 Construction Contracts. Revenue is recognised 
once the Group has obtained the right to consideration in exchange 
for its performance. No profit is recognised on contracts until the 
outcome of the contract can be reliably estimated. When the 
outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and 
costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion 
of the contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is normally 
measured by the proportion of contract costs incurred for work 
performed to date compared to the estimated total contract costs 
after making suitable allowances for technical and other risks 
related to performance milestones yet to be achieved. When it is 
probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, 
the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense. 
Goods sold and services rendered 
Sales of goods and the provision of services not under long-term 
contract are recognised in the income statement when the 
significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred 
to the customer and revenue and costs can be reliably measured.  
Cost-plus contracts 
Revenue on cost-plus and time-and-materials contracts 
is recognised as work is performed. 
Royalties and intellectual property  
Royalty revenue is recognised on the earlier of the date on which 
the income is earned and measurable with reasonable certainty 
or cash is received. Cash received in advance is deferred over the 
period to which the royalty relates. Intellectual property revenue can 
be attributed either to perpetual licences or limited licences. Limited 
licences are granted for a specified time period and revenue is 
recognised over the period of the licence. Perpetual licences are 
granted unlimited time frames and are recognised when the risks 
and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer. 
Segmental information 
Segmental information is presented according to the Group’s 
management structure and markets in which the Group operates. 
The principal activities of the Group are managed through three 
sectors organised according to the distinct markets in which the 
Group operates: 
• EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Australasia) mainly delivers 
technical advice, technology solutions, consultancy and managed 
services to the Ministry of Defence in the UK, and civil and other 
Government customers in the UK and Australia; 
• QinetiQ North America mainly provides technology and services 
to the US Government; and 
• Ventures mainly comprises commercial product businesses and 
business venturing activities. 
Segmental results represent the contribution of the different 
segments to the profit of the Group. Corporate expenses are 
allocated to the corresponding segments. Unallocated items 
comprise mainly profit on disposal of non-current assets, business 
divestments and unrealised impairment of investments, financing 
costs and taxation. Eliminations represent inter-company trading 
between the different segments.  50 www.QinetiQ.com QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 51
 
 
51
1. Significant accounting policies (continued) 
Segmental assets comprise property, plant and equipment, 
goodwill and other intangible assets, trade and other receivables, 
inventories and prepayments and accrued income. Unallocated 
assets represent financial assets which are included in net debt. 
Segmental liabilities comprise trade and other payables, accruals 
and deferred income and retirement benefit obligations. Unallocated 
liabilities represent financial liabilities which are included in net debt. 
Segmental assets and liabilities are as at the end of the year. 
Research and development expenditure 
Research and development costs incurred on behalf of a 
customer as part of a specific project are directly chargeable to 
the customer on whose behalf the work is undertaken. Internally 
funded development expenditure is capitalised in the balance 
sheet where there is a clearly defined project, the expenditures are 
separately identifiable, the project is technically and commercially 
feasible, all costs are recoverable by future revenue and the 
resources are committed to complete the project. Such capitalised 
costs are amortised over the forecast period of sales resulting from 
the development. All other research and development costs are 
expensed to the income statement in the period in which they are 
incurred. If the research phase cannot be clearly distinguished from 
the development phase, the respective project-related costs are 
treated as if they were incurred in the research phase only and 
expensed. 
Financing 
Financing represents the financial expense on borrowings 
accounted for using the effective rate method and the financial 
income earned on funds invested. Exchange differences on financial 
assets and liabilities and the income or expense from interest 
hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement 
are included within interest income and expense in financing. 
Taxation 
The taxation charge is based on the taxable profit for the year 
and takes into account taxation deferred because of temporary 
differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation 
and accounting purposes. Current tax and deferred tax are charged 
or credited to the income statement, except where they relate to 
items charged or credited to equity in which case the relevant 
tax is charged or credited to equity. Deferred taxation is the tax 
attributable to the temporary differences that appear when taxation 
authorities recognise and measure assets and liabilities with rules 
that differ from those of the consolidated financial statements. The 
amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner 
of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities, using rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date. 
Any change in the tax rates are recognised in the income statement 
unless related to items directly recognised in equity. Deferred tax 
liabilities are recognised on all taxable temporary differences 
excluding non-deductible goodwill. Deferred tax assets are 
recognised on all deductible temporary differences provided that 
it is probable that future taxable income will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities 
are offset only where there is a legally enforceable right to offset 
and there is an intention to settle balances on a net basis. 
Goodwill 
Business combinations are accounted for under the purchase 
accounting method. All identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
and contingent liabilities incurred or assumed are recorded at fair 
value at the date control is transferred to QinetiQ, irrespective of the 
extent of any minority interest. The cost of a business combination 
is measured at the fair value of assets received, equity instruments 
issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, 
plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Any excess of the 
cost of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the 
net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities recognised is capitalised as goodwill. Goodwill is subject to 
annual impairment reviews (see below). If the cost of an acquisition 
is less than the fair value of the net assets acquired, the difference 
is immediately recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement 
as a gain. 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets arising from business combinations are 
recognised at fair value and are amortised over their expected 
useful lives, typically between 0 and 9 years. Internally generated 
intangible assets are recorded at cost, including labour, directly 
attributable costs and any third-party expenses. Purchased 
intangible assets are recognised at cost less amortisation. Intangible 
assets are amortised over their respective useful lives on a straight 
line basis as follows: 
Intellectual property rights 2–8 years 
Development costs Useful economic life or unit of 
production method subject to a 
minimum amortisation of no less than 
straight line method over economic life 
of 1–4 years 
Other 1–9 years 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation. 
Freehold land is not depreciated. Other tangible non-current assets 
are depreciated on a straight line basis over their useful economic 
lives to their estimated residual value as follows: 
Freehold buildings 20–25 years 
Leasehold land and 
buildings 
Shorter of useful economic life and 
the period of the lease 
Plant and machinery 3–10 years 
Fixtures and fittings 5–10 years 
Computers 3–5 years 
Motor vehicles 3–5 years 
 
Assets under construction are included in property, plant and 
equipment on the basis of expenditure incurred at the balance 
sheet date. In the case of assets constructed by the Group, the 
value includes the cost of own work completed, including directly 
attributable costs and interest. 
The useful lives, depreciation methods and residual values 
applied to property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually 
and, if appropriate, adjusted accordingly.  Financial Statements

1. Significant accounting policies (continued) 
Impairment of tangible, goodwill, intangible and 
held for sale assets 
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an 
indication that an asset may be impaired. If the carrying amount 
of any asset exceeds its recoverable amount an impairment loss 
is recognised immediately in the income statement. In addition, 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually irrespective of any 
indication of impairment. If the carrying amount exceeds the 
recoverable amount, the respective asset or the assets in the 
cash generating unit are written down to their recoverable amounts. 
The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash generating unit is 
the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. 
The value in use is the present value of the future cash flows 
expected to be derived from an asset or cash generating unit 
calculated using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate. Impairment 
losses are expensed to the income statement. 
Investments in debt and equity securities 
Investments held by the Group are classified as either a current 
asset or as a non-current asset and those classified as available 
for sale are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss being 
recognised directly in equity, except for impairment losses. When 
these investments are de-recognised, the cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognised directly in equity is recognised in the income 
statement. 
The fair value of quoted financial instruments is their bid price at the 
balance sheet date. The fair value of unquoted equity investments 
are held at fair value based upon the price of the most recent 
investment by the Group or a third party if available or derived 
from the present value of forecast future cash flows. 
Inventories 
Inventory and work-in-progress (including DTR pre-contract costs 
capitalised since QinetiQ was awarded preferred bidder status in 
2007) are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Work-in-progress and manufactured finished goods are valued at 
production cost. Production cost includes direct production costs 
and an appropriate proportion of production overheads. A provision 
is established when the net realisable value of any inventory item 
is lower than its cost. 
Bid costs 
Costs incurred in bidding for work are normally expensed as 
incurred. In the case of large multi-year government contracts 
the bidding process typically involves a competitive bid process 
to determine a preferred bidder and then a further period to reach 
financial close with the customer. In these cases, the costs incurred 
after announcement of the Group achieving preferred bidder status 
are deferred to the balance sheet within work-in-progress. From the 
point financial close is reached, the costs are amortised over the life 
of the contract. If an opportunity for which the Group was awarded 
preferred bidder status fails to reach financial close, the costs 
deferred to that point will be expensed in the income statement 
immediately, when it becomes likely that financial close will not 
be achieved. 
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are stated net of provisions for doubtful 
debts. Amounts recoverable on contracts are included in trade and 
other receivables and represent revenue recognised in excess of 
amounts invoiced. Payments received on account are included in 
trade and other payables and represent amounts invoiced in excess 
of revenue recognised. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and short-term 
deposits that are readily convertible into cash. In the cash flow 
statement overdraft balances are included in cash and equivalents. 
Current and non-current liabilities 
Current liabilities include amounts due within the normal operating 
cycle of the Group. Interest-bearing current and non-current 
liabilities are recognised at fair value and then stated at amortised 
cost with any difference between the cost and redemption value 
being recognised in the income statement over the period of the 
borrowings on an effective interest rate basis. Costs associated 
with the arrangement of bank facilities or the issue of loans are 
held net of the associated liability presented in the balance sheet. 
Capitalised issue costs are released over the estimated life of the 
facility or instrument to which they relate using the effective interest 
rate method. If it becomes clear that the facility or instrument will 
be redeemed early, the amortisation of the issue costs will be 
accelerated. 
Provisions 
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has 
a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event 
which can be reliably estimated, and it is probable that an outflow 
of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Where 
appropriate, provisions are determined by discounting the expected 
cash flows at the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the 
Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. The derecognition of 
a financial instrument takes place when the Group no longer 
controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, 
when the instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised. 
Derivative financial instruments 
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and 
thereafter held at fair value, being the market value for quoted 
instruments or valuation based on models and discounted cash 
flow calculations for unlisted instruments. 
Fair value hedging 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value 
hedges of currency risk or interest rate risk are recognised in the 
income statement. The hedged item is held at fair value with respect 
to the hedged risk with any gain or loss recognised in the income 
statement. 
Cash flow hedging 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives 
designated as a cash flow hedge are recognised in equity. The 
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income 
statement. Where a hedged item results in an asset or a liability, 
gains and losses previously recognised in equity are included 
in the cost of the asset or liability. Gains and losses previously 
recognised in equity are removed and recognised in the income 
statement at the same time as the hedged transaction. 
Hedging of net investment in foreign operations 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives 
designated as hedges of the net investment in a foreign entity 
are recognised in equity until the net investment is sold or 
disposed. Any ineffective portion is recognised directly in the 
income statement.  52 www.QinetiQ.com QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 53

1. Significant accounting policies (continued) 
Leased assets 
Leases are classified as finance leases when substantially all of the 
risks and rewards of ownership are held by the lessee. Assets held 
under finance leases are capitalised and included in property, plant and 
equipment at the lower of the present value of minimum lease payments 
and fair value at the inception of the lease. Assets are then depreciated 
over the shorter of their useful economic lives or the lease term. 
Obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance charges arising 
in future periods, are included under financial liabilities.  
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate 
of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at period-end 
rates. Any resulting exchange differences are taken to the income 
statement. Gains and losses on designated forward foreign 
exchange hedging contracts are matched against the foreign 
exchange movements on the underlying transaction. 
The individual financial statements of each group company are 
presented in its functional currency. On consolidation, assets and 
liabilities of overseas subsidiaries’ associated undertakings and joint 
ventures, including any related goodwill, are translated to sterling 
at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date. The results and 
cash flows of overseas subsidiaries, associated undertakings and 
joint ventures are translated to sterling using the average rates of 
exchange during the period. Exchange adjustments arising from 
the re-translation of the opening net investment and the results for 
the period to the period-end rate are taken directly to equity and 
reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
Post-retirement benefits 
The Group provides both defined contribution and defined benefit 
pension arrangements. The liabilities of the Group arising from defined 
benefit obligations, and the related current service cost, are determined 
using the projected unit credit method. Valuations for accounting 
purposes are carried out half yearly for the largest plans and on a 
regular basis for other plans. Actuarial advice is provided by external 
consultants. For the funded defined benefit plans, the excess or deficit 
of the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation are recognised as an asset or a liability respectively. 
For defined benefit plans, the actuarial cost charged to the income 
statement consists of service cost, interest cost and expected 
return on plan assets. The finance element of the pension charge 
is shown in finance income and expenses, the remaining service 
cost element is charged as a component of employee costs in 
the income statement. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised 
in full immediately through the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income. Contributions to defined contribution plans are charged 
to the Income Statement as incurred. 
Share-based payments 
The Group operates share-based payment arrangements with 
employees. The fair value of equity-settled awards for share-based 
payments is determined on grant and expensed straight line over 
the period from grant to the date of earliest unconditional exercise. 
The fair value of cash-settled awards for share-based payments is 
determined each period end until they are exercised or lapse. The 
value is expensed straight line over the period from grant to the date 
of earliest unconditional exercise. The charges for both equity and 
cash-settled share-based payments are updated annually for non-
market-based vesting conditions. 
Share capital 
Ordinary share capital of the Company is recorded as the proceeds 
received less issue costs. Company shares held by the employee 
benefit trusts are held at the consideration paid. They are classified 
as own shares within equity. Any gain or loss on the purchase, sale 
or issue of Company shares is recorded in equity. 
Restatement of prior periods for finalisation of fair values 
arising on acquisitions 
The fair values of the net assets of acquired business are finalised 
within 12 months of the acquisition date, with the exception of 
certain deferred tax balances. All fair value adjustments are 
recorded with effect from the date of acquisition and consequently 
may result in the restatement of previously reported financial results. 
Recent accounting developments 
The following EU endorsed new, revised and amended published 
standards and interpretations are effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 April 2009 and have been adopted. 
IFRS 8, Operating Segments replaces IAS 14 Segmental 
Reporting and requires an entity to present segment information 
on the same basis as used for internal management reporting 
as provided to the chief operating decision maker. Adoption of this 
standard did not affect the reportable segments, disclosures have 
been prepared in accordance with the new standard. 
IAS 1 (revised), Presentation of Financial Statements requires 
the Group to present a Statement of Comprehensive Income and 
Statement of Changes in Equity as primary statements. The Group 
has elected to present the Statement of Comprehensive Income 
and the Income Statement as two statements. These consolidated 
Financial Statements have been prepared under the revised 
disclosure requirements. 
Amendment to IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures 
requires enhanced disclosures around fair value measurement 
and liquidity risk. The disclosures in these financial statements 
have been prepared in accordance with the new standard. 
The following EU endorsed amendments, improvements and 
interpretations of published standards are effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 April 2009 and have been adopted

1. Significant accounting policies (continued) 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following 
EU endorsed revised, amended and improved published standards 
and interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial 
statements, were in issue but not yet effective: 
IFRS 3 (revised), Business Combinations and amendments to IAS 
27, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements. The standard 
continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations with 
some significant changes. For example, all acquisition related costs will 
be expensed, all payments to purchase a business will be recorded at 
fair value at the acquisition date, with contingent payments subsequently 
re-measured at fair value through the income statement. There are also 
changes to the reporting of non-controlling interest. These revisions will 
have an impact on the way in which the Group reports all future 
business combinations. 
The impact of adoption of the following new, revised, amended and 
improved published standards and interpretations in future periods, 
which were also in issue at the date of authorisation of these 
Financial Statements, is under assessment: 
• IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, subject to EU endorsement; 
• IAS 24 (revised), Related Party Disclosures, subject to EU 
endorsement; 
• Amendment to IFRIC 14, IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit 
Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction, 
subject to EU endorsement; 
• IFRIC 19, Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity 
Instruments, subject to EU endorsement; and 
• Improvements to IFRSs 2010, subject to EU endorsement. 
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of the following new, 
revised, amended and improved published standards and 
interpretations in future periods, which were also in issue at the date 
of authorisation of these Financial Statements, will have no material 
impact on the Financial Statements of the Group: 
• IFRS 1 (revised), First time adoption of IFRS;  
• Amendments to IFRS 1, First time adoption of IFRS, subject 
to EU endorsement; 
• Amendment to IFRS 2, Share-based payment; 
• Amendment to IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation; 
• Amendment to IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement; and 
• IFRIC 17, Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners;  
Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying 
accounting policies 
The following commentary is intended to highlight those policies  
hat are critical to the business based on the level of management 
judgement required in their application, their complexity and their 
potential impact on the results and financial position reported for 
the Group. The level of management judgement required includes 
assumptions and estimates about future events which are uncertain, 
the actual outcome of which may result in a materially different 
outcome from that anticipated. 
Revenue and profit recognition 
The estimation process required to evaluate the potential outcome 
of contracts and projects requires skill, knowledge and experience 
from a variety of sources within the business to assess the status 
of the contract, costs to complete, internal and external labour resources 
required and other factors. This process is carried out continuously 
throughout the business to ensure that project and contract 
assessments reflect the latest status of such work. No profit is 
recognised on a contract until the outcome can be reliably estimated. 
Business combinations 
Intangible assets recognised on business combinations have been 
valued using established methods and models to determine estimated 
value and useful economic life, with input, where appropriate, from 
external valuation consultants. Such methods require the use of 
estimates which may produce results that are different from actual 
future outcomes.  
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any 
impairment. This process is reliant on the use of estimates of the 
future profitability and cash flows of its cash-generating units which 
may differ from the actual results delivered. The Group additionally 
reviews whether identified intangible assets have suffered any 
impairment.  
Post-retirement benefits 
The Group’s defined benefit pension obligations and net income 
statement costs are based on key assumptions including return 
on plan assets, discount rates, mortality, inflation and future 
salary and pension increases. Management exercises their best 
judgement, in consultation with actuarial advisors, in selecting 
the values for these assumptions that are the most appropriate 
to the Group. Small changes in these assumptions at the balance 
sheet date, individually or collectively, may result in significant 
changes in the size of the deficit or the net income statement costs. 
Research and development expenditure 
Internally-funded development expenditure is capitalised when 
criteria are met (see page 51), and is written off over the forecast 
period of sales resulting from the development. Management 
decides upon the adequacy of future demand and potential market 
for such new products in order to justify capitalisation of internally-
funded development expenditure. These can be difficult to 
determine when dealing with innovative technologies. Actual 
product sales may differ from these estimates. 
Tax 
In determining the Group’s provisions for income tax and deferred 
tax it is necessary to assess the likelihood and timing of recovery 
of tax losses created, and to consider transactions in a small 
number of key tax jurisdictions for which the ultimate tax 
determination is uncertain. To the extent that the final outcome 
differs from the tax that has been provided, adjustments will be 
made to income tax and deferred tax provisions held in the period 
the determination is made. 
Unquoted equity investments 
The Group usually judges the fair value of unquoted equity 
investments using the valuation ascribed to the investment 
by a third-party funding round or similar valuation event for that 
investment. In determining the value of an investment the Group 
may use information from funding rounds, business plans and 
forecasts, market projections and other estimation techniques, 
including management estimates, as a guide. These valuation 
techniques require estimates of the business’s future performance. 
The actual business performance of investments may differ from 
these estimates.

The principal factors reducing the Group’s current year tax 
charge below the UK statutory rate are explained below:  
 
  
 
  
(Loss)/profit before tax  85.7 (151.8) (66.1) 130.2 (16.2) 114.0

Taxation (credit)/expense  12.9 (15.7) (2.8) 26.7 (6.3) 20.4 
 
The effective tax rate on acquisition amortisation and specific non-recurring items in 2010 is lower than the Group rate as most of the 
elements do not attract tax relief. The tax rate on acquisition amortisation and specific non-recurring items in 2009 exceeds the overall 
Group tax rate as it primarily relates to items subject to the higher US tax rate. 
Factors affecting future tax charges 
The effective tax rate continues to be below the statutory rate in the UK primarily as a result of the benefit of research and development 
relief in the UK. The effective tax rate is expected to remain below the UK statutory rate in the medium term, subject to any future tax 
legislation changes.

10. Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the year. The weighted average number of shares used excludes those shares bought by the Group and held as own 
shares (see note 32). For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all 
potentially dilutive ordinary shares arising from unvested share-based awards including share options. Underlying basic earnings per share 
figures are presented below in addition to the basic and diluted earnings per share as the Directors consider this gives a more relevant 
indication of underlying business performance and reflects the adjustments to basic earnings per share for the impact of specific 
non-recurring items, amortisation of acquired intangible assets and tax thereon

Goodwill at 31 March 2010 was allocated across seven cash generating units (CGUs) in QNA and EMEA. In the year two CGUs in the 
EMEA business were amalgamated into one to reflect the way in which these CGUs are managed and operated.  
Goodwill is attributable to the excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired and includes expected synergies, future 
growth prospects and staff knowledge, expertise, customer contacts and security clearances. The Group tests goodwill impairment for each 
CGU annually or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.  
Key assumptions 
The value in use calculations use discounted future cash flows based on the most recent forecasts from the five-year corporate plan. 
The five-year corporate plan is approved by the Board. Cash flows for periods beyond this period are extrapolated based on the final year 
of the corporate plan, with a terminal growth rate assumption applied.  
Terminal growth rates  
The specific plans for each of the CGUs have been extrapolated using a terminal growth rate of 1.5% to 2.5% (2009: 2.5% to 3.0%). Growth 
rates are formed based on management’s estimates which take into consideration the long-term nature of the industry in which the CGUs 
operate and external forecasts as to the likely growth of the industry in the longer term. 
Discount rates 
The Group’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) was used as a basis in determining the discount rate to be applied, adjusted for risks, 
specific to the geographical location of CGUs as appropriate on a pre-tax basis. The pre-tax discount rate applied for QNA CGUs was 
11.8%–12.1% and a range from 9.3%–16.9% for EMEA CGUs.  
Impairment 
The in year impairment charge of £50.1m arises in three CGUs: Technology Solutions in QNA (£11.4m); Mission Solutions in QNA (£30.8m); 
and Australia in EMEA (£7.9m). 
Defence markets remain challenging as a result of the economic environment and both CGUs have seen a moderation in market growth 
expectations which has led the Group to re-evaluate the growth forecasts for the CGU, including the long-term growth rate. Additionally, 
Technology Solutions in QNA has been affected by the finalisation of the strategy for the US’s continued involvement in Afghanistan and 
the completion of key Department of Defense (DoD) leadership appointments. 
The Australian CGU impairment reflects an overall moderation in anticipated market growth which has, in turn, had an impact on the growth 
assumptions for this CGU and an associated moderation in the terminal growth rate.

11. Goodwill (continued) 
Significant CGUs 
Sensitivity analysis shows that both the discount rate and growth rate assumptions are key components of the outcome of the recoverable 
amount.  
The Technology Solutions CGU was impaired during the year by £11.4m. If the discount rate assumption was increased by 1% the 
impairment charge would have increased by £28.1m to £39.5m or, conversely, should the discount rate have been 1% lower this would 
have given the CGU headroom of £28.3m. Sensitivity analysis shows that a move of up to 1% in the terminal growth rate could result in 
an impairment of £33.8m or headroom of £20.3m. The resulting carrying value of goodwill for this CGU at 31 March 2010 was £120.7m. 
The Systems Engineering CGU had headroom, with current assumptions, of £109.1m. The Group’s sensitivity analysis shows that the 
pre-tax discount rate would have to increase to 16.6% or the terminal growth rate to decline to (1.4)% to cause the carrying value of 
the CGU to exceed its recoverable amount. The carrying value of goodwill for this CGU as at 31 March 2010 was £161.4m.  
During the period, the Mission Solutions business was impaired by £30.8m. If discount rates were assumed to be 1% higher the impairment 
charge would have increased by £53.4m to £84.2m. Conversely, if discount rates were 1% lower the CGU would have had a headroom of 
£47.3m. The sensitivity to terminal growth rates would imply that a decrease of 1% would result in a further impairment of £43.8m, or an 
increase of 1% would show the CGU with headroom of £32.9m. The resulting carrying value of goodwill for this CGU at 31 March 2010 
was £240.4m.  
In EMEA, the Managed Services and Consulting CGUs have significant headroom. An increase in either the discount rate or decrease in the 
terminal growth rate by 1% would not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount. 
The Technology Solutions CGU in EMEA has headroom, under current assumptions, of £21.7m. If the discount rate was to decrease 
or increase by 1%, the CGU would have headroom of £43.9m or £5.7m respectively. Similarly, if terminal growth rates were to decrease 
or increase by 1%, headroom would be £9.3m or £39.1m respectively.  
During the period, the Australia CGU was impaired by £7.9m. If discount rates were assumed to be 1% higher the impairment charge would 
have increased by £0.7m to £8.6m. Conversely, if discount rates were 1% lower the extent of the impairment would have been reduced by 
£0.8m to £7.1m. The sensitivity to terminal growth rates would imply that a decrease of 1% would result in a further impairment of £0.5m or 
an increase of 1% would reduce the impairment by £0.6m. 
The Directors have not identified any other likely changes in other significant assumptions since 31 March 2010 and the signing of the 
financial statements that would cause the carrying value of the recognised goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.   64 www.QinetiQ.com QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 65

In determining the recoverability of trade receivables, the Group considers any changes in the credit quality of the trade receivable from 
the date credit was granted up to the reporting date. Credit risk is limited due to the high percentage of turnover being derived from UK and 
US defence and other government agencies. Accordingly, the Directors believe there is no further credit provision required in excess of the 
allowance for doubtful debts. As at 31 March 2010, the Group carried a provision for doubtful debts of £8.8m (2009: £5.9m).

At the balance sheet date, the Group had unused tax losses of £117.1m (2009: £77.5m) potentially available for offset against future profits. 
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of this amount due to uncertainty over the timing of its utilisation. These losses can be 
carried forward indefinitely.

rate swaps the loan has an average fixed rate of 4.35% until September 2010, when it returns to floating rate.  
All the US private placements have been issued as fixed rate bonds and have not been converted to floating rate. Further analysis of the 
terms and maturity dates for financial liabilities are set out in Note 27. 
 
 
27. Financial risk management 
The Group’s international operations and debt financing expose it to financial risks which include the effects of changes in foreign exchange 
rates, interest rates, credit risks and liquidity risks. 
Capital, treasury and risk management policies are set by the Board, setting out specific guidelines on financial risks and the use of financial 
instruments to manage risk. The instruments and techniques used to manage exposures include foreign currency derivatives and interest 
rate derivatives. Group treasury monitors financial risks and compliance with risk management policies. These policies are discussed further 
in the Chief Financial Officer’s review on pages 12-15. 
 
A) Fair values of financial instruments  
Effective 1 April 2009, the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, for the financial instruments that are 
measured in the balance sheet at fair value. This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value 
measurement hierarchy: 
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices including within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and  
Level 3: Inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs). 
The following table presents the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 31 March 2010.

27. Financial risk management (continued) 
For cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and bank and current borrowings, the fair value of the financial instruments 
approximate to their carrying value due to the short maturity periods of these financial instruments. For trade and other receivables, 
allowances are made within the carrying value for credit risk. For other financial instruments, the fair value is based on market value, 
where available. Where market values are not available, the fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows to net present 
value using prevailing market-based interest rates translated at the year-end rates, except for unlisted fixed asset investments where 
a fair value equals carrying value.  
All financial assets and liabilities have a fair value identical to book value at 31 March 2010 and 31 March 2009 except where noted below:

27. Financial risk management (continued) 
B) Interest rate risk 
The Group operates an interest rate policy designed to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings. The Group’s current 
policy is to require rates to be fixed for 30–80% of the level of borrowings, but with a maximum 100% fixed for no more than 12 months. 
This is achieved primarily through fixed rate borrowings, and also through the use of interest rate swaps. At 31 March 2010 98% (2009: 73%) 
of the Group’s borrowings were at fixed rates, after adjusting for interest rate swaps.

Sterling assets and liabilities consist primarily of finance leases with the weighted average interest rate reflecting the internal rate of return 
of those leases. 
Interest rate risk management 
The majority of the Group's bank and private placement borrowings were fixed through a combination of interest rate swaps and fixed rate 
debt. The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 March 2010 was £138.4m or US$210m (31 March 
2009: £188.1m or US$270m). The swaps have the economic effect of converting floating rate US dollar borrowings into fixed rate US dollar 
borrowings and are accounted for as cash flow hedges.

C) Currency risk 
Transactional currency exposure 
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risks arising from sales or purchases by businesses in currencies other than their functional 
currency. It is Group policy that when such a sale or purchase is certain, the net foreign exchange exposure is hedged using forward 
foreign exchange contracts. Hedge accounting documentation and effectiveness testing are undertaken for all the Group’s transactional 
hedge contracts. 
The table below shows the Group's currency exposures, being exposures on currency transactions that give rise to net currency gains 
and losses recognised in the income statement. Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not 
denominated in the functional currency of the operating company involved, other than certain non-sterling borrowings treated as hedges 
of net investments in overseas entities. 
Functional currency of the operating company  
 Net foreign currency monetary assets/(liabilities) 
all figures in £ million US dollar Euro Australian dollar Other Total 
31 March 2010 – sterling 5.1 1.4 4.1 0.4 11.0 
31 March 2009 – sterling 5.6 1.4 0.6 0.9 8.5 
 
The amounts shown in the table take into account the effect of the forward contracts entered into to manage these currency exposures. 
The Group enters into forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the currency exposures that arise on sales and purchases denominated 
in foreign currencies, as the transaction occurs. The principal contract amounts of the outstanding forward currency contracts as at 31 March 
2010 against sterling are net US dollars sold of £6.2m ($9.4m) and net Euros sold of £12.5m ( 14.1m). 
Translational currency exposure 
The Group has significant investments in overseas operations, particularly in the United States. As a result, the sterling value of the Group’s 
balance sheet can be significantly affected by movement in exchange rates. The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of these translational 
exposures by matching the net investment in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in their functional currencies unless the cost 
of such hedging activity is uneconomic. This is achieved by borrowing in the local currency, or in some cases indirectly through the use of 
forward foreign exchange contracts. 
Net investment hedges 
The Group had one 6 million currency loan designated as a net investment hedge at 31 March 2010, but no swap contracts. During the 
year the Group de-designated currency loans of $210m which had previously been used to hedge translational currency exposures, and 
entered into offsetting currency swaps to eliminate any future exchange exposure arising from this loan. 
 
D) Financial credit risk 
The Group is exposed to credit related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not 
currently expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. Credit risk is mitigated by the Board-approved policy of only selecting 
counterparties with a strong investment grade long-term credit rating for cash deposits, normally at least AA – or equivalent. In the normal 
course of business, the Group operates notional cash pooling systems, where a legal right of set-off applies. 
The maximum credit-risk exposure in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations under financial assets, excluding trade and 
other receivables, totals £80.2m. At 31 March 2010 the maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits and cash was £41.9m, whilst the 
maximum mark to market exposure for derivatives was £4.8m. These exposures were with different financial institutions rated AA or better.

H) Sensitivity analysis 
The Group’s sensitivity to changes in market rates on financial assets and liabilities as at 31 March 2010 is set out in the table below. 
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming certain adverse market 
conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected results due to developments in the global financial 
markets which may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the table below, 
which therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses. 
The estimated changes for interest rate movements are based on an instantaneous decrease or increase of 1 percent (100 basis points) 
in the specific rate of interest applicable to each class of financial instruments from the levels effective at 31 March 2010, with all other 
variables remaining constant. The estimated changes for foreign exchange rates are based on an instantaneous 10 percent weakening or 
strengthening in sterling against all other currencies from the levels applicable at 31 March 2010, with all other variables remaining constant. 
Such analysis is for illustrative purposes only – in practice market rates rarely change in isolation.

Rights attaching to the Special Share 
QinetiQ carries out activities which are important to UK defence and security interests. To protect these interests in the context of the 
ongoing commercial relationship between the MOD and QinetiQ, and to promote and reinforce the Compliance Principles, the MOD holds 
a Special Share in QinetiQ. The Special Share confers certain rights on the holder: 
a) to require the Group to implement and maintain the Compliance System (as defined in the Articles of Association) so as to make at all 
times effective its and each member of QinetiQ Controlled Group’s application of the Compliance Principles, in a manner acceptable 
to the Special Shareholder; 
b) to refer matters to the Board or the Compliance Committee for its consideration in relation to the application of the Compliance Principles; 
c) to veto any contract, transaction, arrangement or activity which the Special Shareholder considers: 
i) may result in circumstances which constitute unacceptable ownership, influence or control over QinetiQ or any other member of the 
QinetiQ consolidated Group contrary to the defence or security interests of the United Kingdom; or 
ii) would not, or does not, ensure the effective application of the Compliance Principles to and/or by all members of the QinetiQ 
Controlled Group or would be or is otherwise contrary to the defence or security interests of the United Kingdom; 
d) to require the Board to take any action (including but not limited to amending the Compliance Principles), or rectify any omission in the 
application of the Compliance Principles, if the Special Shareholder is of the opinion that such steps are necessary to protect the defence 
or security interest of the United Kingdom; 
e) to exercise any of the powers contained in the articles in relation to the Compliance Committee; and 
f) to demand a poll at any of QinetiQ’s meetings (even though it may have no voting rights except those specifically set out in the Articles).  84 www.QinetiQ.com QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 85
 
 
85
The Special Shareholder has an option to purchase defined Strategic Assets of the Group in certain circumstances. The Special Shareholder 
has, inter alia, the right to purchase any Strategic Assets which the Group wishes to sell. Strategic Assets are normally testing and research 
facilities (see note 35 for further details). 
The Special Share may only be issued to, held by and transferred to HM Government (or as it directs). At any time the Special Shareholder 
may require QinetiQ to redeem the Special Share at par. If QinetiQ is wound up the Special Shareholder will be entitled to be repaid the 
capital paid up on the Special Share before other shareholders receive any payment. The Special Shareholder has no other right to shares 
in the capital or profits of QinetiQ. 
The Special Shareholder must give consent to a general meeting held on short notice. 
The Special Share entitles the Special Shareholder to require certain persons who hold (together with any person acting in concert with 
them) a material interest in QinetiQ to dispose of some or all of their Ordinary Shares in certain prescribed circumstances on the grounds 
of national security or conflict of interest. 
The Directors must register any transfer of the Special Share within seven days. 
Other reserves 
The translation reserve includes the cumulative foreign exchange difference arising on translation since the Group transitioned to IFRS. 
Movements on hedge instruments, where the hedge is effective, are recorded in the hedge reserve until the hedge ceases. 
The capital redemption reserve is not distributable and was created following redemption of preference share capital and the bonus issue 
of shares. 
Own shares 
Own shares represent shares in the Company that are held by independent trusts and shares held by the employee share ownership plan. 
Included in retained earnings at 31 March 2010 are 6,440,256 own shares (2009: 7,911,191 shares). 
 
 
33. Share-based payments 
The Group operates a number of share-based payment plans for employees. The total share-based payment expense in the year was £5.8m 
(year to 31 March 2009: £5.6m). 
2003 Employee share option scheme (2003 ESOS) 
Under the employee share option scheme all employees as at 25 July 2003 received share options which vested when the Group completed 
its IPO and had to be exercised within ten years of grant. The options are settled by shares.

QinetiQ Share Option Scheme (QSOS)  
The exercise price of the options is equal to the average market price of the Group’s shares on the date of the grant. The options vest after 
three years. For 8,711,683 (2009: 17,930,229) of the options outstanding at the end of the year the number that will vest is dependent upon 
the growth of earnings per share (‘EPS’) over the measurement period. 25% of options will vest if EPS growth is 22.5% for the period and 
100% will vest if growth is at least 52%. No options will vest if EPS growth is below 22.5%. Options will vest on a straight line basis if EPS 
growth is between 22.5% and 52%. There were no options subject to total shareholder return (‘TSR’) performance targets (2009: 173,071). 
For awards with a TSR performance condition, the EPS growth target is replaced by a performance target based on QinetiQ’s ranking by 
reference to total shareholder return (‘TSR’) against a comparator group of FTSE listed companies over a three-year performance period 
such that a below median ranking will result in nil shares vesting, at the median level 30% of the options would vest and the amount vested 
will increase on a straight line basis such that 100% would vest if TSR reaches the upper quartile of the ranking over a three-year period.

Performance Share Plan (PSP)  
In the year, the Group made awards of conditional shares to certain UK senior executives under the Performance Share Plan. The awards

In the year the Group granted RSU awards to certain senior US employees under the RSU Plan. The awards vest over 1 year, 2 years, 
3 years and 4 years. Half the awards are dependent on achieving QNA organic profit growth targets and half on a time-based criteria. 
The time-based criteria require the employee to have been in continued service up to the date of vesting. QNA organic profit growth 
is measured over the most recent financial year compared with the previous financial year, with 125% of this element awarded at QNA 
organic profit growth rate above 15%, 100% awarded at 12.5%, 75% awarded at 10% and 25% awarded at 5%.

Group Share Incentive Plan (SIP) 
Under the QinetiQ Share Incentive Plan the Group offers UK employees the opportunity of purchasing up to £125 worth of shares a month 
at the prevailing market rate. The Group will make a matching share award of a third of the employee’s payment. The Group’s matching 
shares may be forfeited if the employee ceases to be employed by QinetiQ within 3 years of the award of the shares. There is no exercise

(2009: 1.5 years). There is no exercise price for these SIP awards.  
Group Deferred Annual Bonus Plan (DAB) 
Under the QinetiQ Deferred Annual Bonus Plan the Group requires certain senior executives to defer part of their annual bonus as shares 
and be entitled to matching awards to a maximum of 1:1 based upon EPS performance. The number that will vest is dependent upon the 
growth of EPS over the measurement period of 3 years as detailed in the QSOS EPS conditions above. No awards will vest if EPS growth 
in the vesting period is below 22.5%.

Share-based award pricing – options 
Share options (excluding TSR performance related) and awards under the deferred annual bonus plan have been valued using 
Black-Scholes models to determine the fair value of awards. Assumptions used within the models were as follows for awards in 2009, 
there were no such awards in 2010: 
  2009 
Share price at date of grant (pence)  198.5p 
Exercise price (pence)  198.5p 
Volatility %  31.0% 
Average expected term to exercise  3 years 
Risk-free rate %  4.3% 
Expected dividend yield %  2.2% 
 
No such assumptions have been disclosed in the current year, as no QSOS awards have been made in the year ended 31 March 2010. 
The average share price in 2009 was 179.7p. The expected volatility assumption is based on the average historic volatility of QinetiQ’s 
share price at the date of grant (commensurate with the vesting period to the extent possible).  Financial Statements

33. Share-based payments (continued) 
Share-based award pricing – other 
Share-based awards involving market based performance conditions, including those based on TSR, have used Monte Carlo models to 
determine the fair value at grant date. Assumptions used in these models included 41% (2009: 32%) for the average share price volatility 
of the FTSE comparator group and 36% (2009: 33%) for the average correlation to comparator group. The fair value for these awards 
(before the probability of lapsing) in the year ended March 2010 was 66.5p (2009: 119.1p). 
Share-based awards that vest based upon non-market performance conditions, including certain PSP, RSUs and Deferred Annual Bonus 
awards, have been valued at the share price at grant less attrition. For the 2003 Share Option Scheme, there was a pre-bonus issue 
weighted average share price of £1 and a weighted average exercise price of £1 based on third-party transactions in the Company’s shares 
in the period immediately prior to the issue of the share options. Prior to IPO in February 2006 there was no active market for the Company’s 
shares therefore expected volatility was determined using the average volatility for a comparable selection of businesses. At this time the 
Group had no established pattern of dividend payments, therefore no dividends were assumed in this model.

35. Transactions with MOD 
The MOD continues to own its special share in QinetiQ which conveys certain rights as set out in note 32. Transactions between the Group 
and the MOD are disclosed as follows: 
Freehold land and buildings and surplus properties 
Under the terms of the Group's acquisition of part of the business and certain assets of DERA from the MOD on 1 July 2001, the MOD 
retained certain rights in respect of the freehold land and buildings transferred. 
i) Restrictions on transfer of title 
The title deeds of those properties designated as strategic assets (see below) include a clause that prevents their transfer without the 
approval of the MOD. The MOD also has the right to purchase any strategic assets in certain circumstances. 
ii) Property clawback agreement 
The MOD retains an interest in future profits on disposal following a ‘trigger event’. A ‘trigger event’ includes the granting of planning 
permission for development and/or change of use, and the disposition of any of the acquired land and buildings. During the 12 years from 
1 July 2001, following a ‘trigger event’, the MOD is entitled to clawback a proportion of the gain on each individual property transaction in 
excess of a 30% gain on a July 2001 professional valuation. The proportion of the excess gain due to the MOD is based on a sliding scale 
which reduces over time from 50% to 9% and at 31 March 2010 stands at 28% (2009: 33%). The July 2001 valuation was approximately 
16% greater in aggregate than the consideration paid for the land and buildings on 1 July 2001. 
Compliance Regime 
The Compliance Committee monitors the effective application of the Compliance Regime required by the MOD to maintain the position 
of QinetiQ as a supplier of independent and impartial scientific/technical advice to the MOD and ensures that the required standards are 
met in trials involving human volunteers.  
Strategic assets 
Under the Principal Agreement with the MOD, the QinetiQ controlled Group is not permitted without the written consent of the MOD, to: 
i) dispose of or destroy all or any part of a strategic asset; or 
ii) voluntarily undertake any closure of, or cease to provide a strategic capability by means of, all or any part of a strategic asset. 
The net book value of assets identified as being strategic assets as at 31 March 2010 was £2.5m (31 March 2009: £2.7m), the principal 
items being plant and machinery. 
Long-Term Partnering Agreement 
On 27 February 2003 QinetiQ Limited entered into a Long-Term Partnering Agreement to provide the Test and Evaluation (T&E) facilities 
and training support services to the MOD. This is a 25-year contract with a total revenue value of up to £5.6bn, dependent on the level of 
usage by MOD, under which QinetiQ Limited is committed to providing the T&E services with increasing efficiencies through cost saving 
and innovative service delivery.

37. Contingent liabilities and assets 
The Group, including subsidiary undertakings, have given unsecured guarantees primarily on leased properties and bank lines of £55.1m 
at 31 March 2010 (31 March 2009: £34.7m) in the ordinary course of business.  
The Group is aware of claims and potential claims by or on behalf of current and former employees, including former employees of the MOD 
and DERA and contractors, in respect of intellectual property, employment rights and industrial illness and injury which involve or may 
involve legal proceedings against the Group. The Directors are of the opinion, having regard to legal advice received, and the Group's 
insurance arrangements and provisions carried in the balance sheet, that it is unlikely that these matters will, in aggregate, have a material 
effect on the Group's financial position, results of operations and liquidity. 
The Group has not recognised contingent amounts receivable relating to the Chertsey property which was disposed of during 2004 
or the Fort Halstead property disposed of in September 2005. Additional consideration, subject to clawback to the MOD pursuant to the 
arrangements referred to in note 35, is potentially due upon the purchasers obtaining additional planning consents, with the quantum 
dependent on the scope of the consent achieved. 
 
 
38. Post-retirement benefits 
Triennial funding valuation 
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section of the QinetiQ Pension Scheme was undertaken as at 30 June 2008 
and resulted in an actuarially assessed deficit of £111.3m. On the basis of this full valuation the Trustees of the scheme and the Company 
agreed the employer contribution rate of 11.5% from 30 June 2009, and past service deficit recovery payments of £13m per year for a 
10-year period from this date.  
Introduction and background to IAS 19 
International Accounting Standard 19 (Employee Benefits) requires the Group to include in the balance sheet the surplus or deficit 
on defined benefit schemes calculated as at the balance sheet date. It is a snapshot view which can be significantly influenced by 
short-term market factors. The calculation of the surplus or deficit is, therefore, dependent on factors which are beyond the control 
of the Group – principally the value at the balance sheet date of equity shares in which the scheme has invested and long-term interest 
rates which are used to discount future liabilities. The funding of the scheme is based on long-term trends and assumptions relating to 
market growth, as advised by qualified actuaries. 
The QinetiQ Pension Scheme 
In the UK the Group operates the QinetiQ Pension Scheme for the majority of its UK employees, a mixed benefit scheme. The Defined 
Benefit (DB) section of the scheme provides future service pension benefits to transferring Civil Service employees. All Group employees 
who were members, or eligible to be members, of the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme or the UKAEA principal Non-Industrial 
Superannuation Scheme were invited to join the DB section of the scheme from 1 July 2001, together with all new employees who were 
previously members of schemes who are part of the Public Sector Transfer Club. On 31 March 2010, the Group withdrew from the Public 
Sector Transfer Club. The Defined Contribution (DC) section of the scheme was set up for employees who were not eligible or did not wish 
to join the DB section of the scheme. 
Other UK schemes  
In the UK the Group operates one further small defined benefit scheme, QinetiQ Prudential Platinum Scheme. The net pension deficits 
of this scheme at 31 March 2010 amounted to £0.2m (31 March 2009: £0.2m). There were no outstanding or prepaid contributions at the 
balance sheet date (March 2009: £nil). Set out below is a summary of the overall IAS 19 defined benefit pension schemes’ liabilities. The fair 
value of the schemes' assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they 
are realised, and the present value of the schemes’ liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods, and thus 
inherently uncertain, were:

38. Post-retirement benefits (continued) 
Assumptions 
The major assumptions (weighted to reflect individual scheme differences) were: 
 2010 2009 
Rate of increase in salaries 4.6% 4.1% 
Rate of increase in pensions in payment  3.6% 3.1% 
Rate of increase in pensions in deferment 3.6% 3.1% 
Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 5.6% 6.5% 
Inflation assumption  3.6% 3.1% 
Assumed life expectancies in years   
Future male pensioners (currently aged 60) 87 87 
Future female pensioners (currently aged 60) 89 89 
Future male pensioners (currently aged 40) 89 89 
Future female pensioners (currently aged 40) 90 90 
 
The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the 
timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice. It is important to note that these assumptions are long term, and in the case 
of the discount rate and the inflation rate are measured by external market indicators. The life expectancy assumptions for mortality have 
remained unchanged in the year to 31 March 2010 with the base tables for mortality in line with the Medium Cohort projections with minimum 
annual rates of improvement of 1% for males and 0.5% for females (2009: improvement 1% for males and 0.5% for females). The current 
mortality rates reflect the standard tables PNMA00MC (for males) and PNFA00MC (for females) for members' year of birth. These mortality 
tables are published by the Continuous Mortality Investigation and adopted by the actuarial profession. 
Scheme assets 
The overall expected rate of return on plan assets is based upon the expected return rates for each asset class. Equity return rates are the 
long-term expected return rates based upon the market rates of return for risk free investments, typically government bonds, together with 
the historical level of risk premium associated with equities; with the resulting rate then being reviewed and benchmarked against a peer 
group of listed companies. Expected long-term rates of return on scheme assets (weighted to reflect the individual scheme actual asset 
allocations) were: 
 2010 2009 
Equities 8.0% 8.0% 
Corporate bonds 5.5% 6.0% 
Government bonds 4.4% 3.8%

1. Accounting policies 
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the 
Company’s financial statements. 
Basis of preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK accounting

of the Company has not been presented. 
Investments 
In the Company’s financial statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any impairment in value. 
Share-based payments 
The fair value of equity-settled awards for share-based payments is determined on grant and expensed straight line over the period 
from grant to the date of earliest unconditional exercise. The fair value of cash-settled awards for share-based payments is determined 
each period end until they are exercised or lapse. The value is expensed straight line over the period from grant to the date of earliest 
unconditional exercise. The charges for both equity and cash-settled share-based payments are updated annually for non-market-based 
vesting conditions. Further details of the Group’s share-based payment charge are disclosed in Note 33 of the Group Financial Statements.

Electronic communication
QinetiQ has taken full advantage of changes brought about by 
the Companies Act 2006 which recognises the growing importance 
of electronic communications and allows companies to provide 
documentation and communications to shareholders via their 
websites (except to those who have specifically elected to receive 
a hardcopy (i.e. paper)).
The wider use of electronic communications enables fast receipt 
of documents, reduces the Company’s printing, paper and postal 
costs and has a positive impact on the environment.
Shareholders may also cast their vote for the 2010 AGM 
online quickly and easily using the Sharevote-service by 
using www.sharevote.co.uk

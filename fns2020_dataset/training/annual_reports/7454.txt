Chairman’s statement
This last year clients have
again relied on our
knowledge and experience
to find innovative solutions
to help them meet their
specific objectives.
Hogg Robinson Group’s results for 2012/13
are testament to the resilience of our
business model and our ability to manage
our cost base tightly. In markets that
remain difficult to predict, clients continue
to look to Hogg Robinson Group for
support in helping them to achieve best
value from their travel and related
expenditure and to reduce overall spend,
and this is again reflected in our new
business wins and renewals. Based on
our performance for the year, we propose
an increase in the total dividend per share
of 5%, maintaining our commitment to a
progressive dividend policy.
The results will be reported in more detail
by Chief Executive David Radcliffe and all I
seek to do here is summarise the macro
conditions in which we and our clients
operated in 2012/13. Economic growth
was nonexistent or even slightly negative
in the UK and the rest of Europe. In North
America GDP growth was around 2% while
in Asia Pacific and the rest of the world,
higher levels of growth could be found but
a number of economies were affected by
slowing growth in China. A significant
proportion of our revenue and profits is
generated in the UK and Europe and given
the global economic backdrop described
above, we are pleased with what our
business has achieved.
This last year clients have again relied on
our knowledge and experience to find
innovative solutions to help them meet their
specific objectives. A common aim for most
has been cost reduction and, as a result of
our advice, we have seen a continuation of
the trend by clients to use our internet
booking tools to supplement and, on
occasion, replace our more traditional direct
travel management service. As this dynamic
occurs, we adjust our cost structure to reflect
the new business preferences and work with
clients to ensure they have the type of
service to suit their needs. In this way we
have been able to maintain profitability, and
expect to do so going forward. Our service
offering has been enhanced by the inclusion
of expense management systems
developed by our subsidiary, Spendvision.
We were delighted when our combined
capability proved to be critical in winning
the Government of Canada as a new client.
This win was also underpinned by the
excellence of our technology and in future
years we hope to further capitalise on the
investment we have made and continue
to make in this area.
We review our risk management processes
elsewhere in the report including the
mitigating actions that can be taken should
events occur. In common with all
businesses, the effective identification and
management of risks across our operations,
including those around developing
technologies and cyber terrorism, are
integral to the delivery of the Group’s
strategic objectives. We are very aware of
these risks and are ready to respond in the
event it is necessary.
I referred in my report last year to our
intention to withdraw our active working
capital programme. As a result, and as
expected, year-end net debt rose,
increasing by £26m to £87m. A key focus
for management is to use the cash flow
generation capabilities of the business to
reduce this amount in the near to medium
term, at the same time as delivering our
progressive dividend policy.
The Group’s pension deficit increased
from last year’s level of £146m to £159m,
principally due to lower discount rates.
We have already taken a number of steps
to limit the Group’s exposure, including
closing the UK defined benefit scheme to
new entrants and putting salary caps in
place. We have now entered consultation
with the active members of our UK defined
benefit scheme on a proposal to close the
scheme to future accrual and replace it
with a defined contribution scheme. We
hope a conclusion can be reached on this
in the next few months. I am mindful of the
effect this will have on our colleagues but it
is in line with what many companies have
already done and it reflects the unfortunate
fact that defined benefit schemes have
become too expensive and too volatile in
their impact on companies’ finances to be
sustained in the private sector.
Since my last statement, Philip Harrison has
joined the company as Group Finance
Director and has rapidly become part of
our team. We have a small Board with
three executive and three non executive
directors as we believe this provides clear,
well informed and focused leadership,
appropriate to the size of the company.
However, many more than six people are
engaged in running the company and
providing the service to clients that is
essential to the success of this business.
To all those colleagues I would like to
express my thanks for their contribution
and the commitment they demonstrate
on a regular basis.

HRG delivered a resilient
performance under testing
conditions. We have
remained focused on
maintaining a cost base that
is appropriate to the market
backdrop while ensuring
that our usual high standard
of client service is not
compromised. Our focus
continues to be on
delivering good value to our
clients through excellent
service which meets their
specific requirements. 
OVERVIEW AND STRATEGY
HRG delivered another resilient
performance given the ongoing
unpredictable nature of the principal
markets in which the Group operates.
For the year ended 31 March 2013,
our revenue fell by 8% to £343m while
underlying operating profit margin rose
from 12.6% to 14.2%. Reported profit
before tax and EPS were up 1% and 4%,
respectively. Client travel activity fell by 5%
and travel spend by 8% during the period.
In response to the market slowdown and
predicted continuation of the trend by
clients to use our online booking tools,
we reduced our staffing levels and other
operating costs during the year and
introduced a number of self-help measures
designed to further reduce our costs and
protect margin as we go forward.
As we have often seen in previous
periods of austerity, clients rely on our
depth of experience and expertise to
devise innovative and effective travel
and expense management solutions
to help them meet their objectives.
More often, we see opportunities to
deploy HRG’s technology products and
solutions to great effect as part of a
series of actions designed to meet the
particular needs of each of our clients.
Online self-booking tools, including
HRG Online™, are now used by many of
our clients as an effective way of making
good use of available technology to
help them reduce the cost of making
travel bookings, particularly on simpler
itineraries. Client adoption of online
self booking of travel continues to rise.
As clients move from ‘classic’ , telephone-
based service to technology-based
service, our revenue is likely to be
affected and we need to ensure related
operating costs remain appropriate
for the new service configuration.
HRG is a leading player in a constantly
changing industry. Our focus
continues to be on delivering good
value to our clients through excellent
service which meets their unique
requirements. As the breadth of the
Group’s services has broadened in
recent years to include travel, expense
and data management underpinned by
proprietary technology, HRG’s strategy
has evolved also. Our current strategy
has two core elements:
– Managed travel – To grow our managed
travel business by increasing our business
from existing clients with new service
offerings, entering new markets and
winning new business by leveraging our
technology and service delivery.
– Software as a Service (SaaS) –
To develop a SaaS business focused on
providing travel, expense and payment
solutions to existing and new clients,
either direct or through third party
travel and payment providers.
We believe that this strategy, which now
includes the provision of technology
solutions not only to our existing clients
but also to the wider travel and expense
industry, provides a sensible balance of
resilience and growth. The ability to combine
excellent managed travel services with best-
in-class technology solutions also supports
our reputation as one of the world’s
leading international corporate services
companies, helping us sustain a business
which delivers value to all stakeholders in
the toughest of trading climates.
The global business travel market is expected
to grow at a rate of 4% per annum during
the period to 2022, according to the World
Travel and Tourism Council, with Europe and
North America predicted to grow at 2% and
3% per annum, respectively. We estimate
that the expense management market will
grow by 6% per annum in the same period.
Our medium-term objectives are to grow
revenue by 2-4% per annum, maintain
underlying operating profit margin in the
range 13-14.5%, reduce net debt to 0.7-1.0
times EBITDA, and to continue with our
progressive dividend policy. In growing our
managed travel business over the next
few years, our strategic priorities include
increasing revenue from existing clients
through new service offerings in areas such
as meetings, groups and events, data
analytics, consulting and card payments;
entering new markets such as logistics
serving the marine, offshore and energy
sectors; and winning new business by
leveraging our technology and service
delivery, for example in the Government
sector and through the launch of new end-
to-end travel and expense management
products. We aim to develop our SaaS
business both direct to corporates and
national organisations, and indirectly via
third-party travel and payment providers
such as global distribution system (GDS)
providers and financial services organisations.
During the first half of the year, we signed
an agreement to license some of our
travel technology to a leading GDS
provider, reinforcing the Group’s B2B
technology strategy. Our earnings in the
period benefited from this agreement and
we will see further contribution through
the life of the agreement. In the second half,
we entered into a preferred relationship
with Citi Commercial Cards, a leading
commercial card provider to large and

Managed travel

Software as a Service (SaaS)
Develop a SaaS business focused on providing travel, expense and

through third party travel and payment providers
multi-national organisations globally. This
new relationship provides an opportunity
to maximise our combined market
knowledge and technologies to deliver
enhanced travel programme solutions to
the end-to-end process of travel, payment
and expense management. The growing
importance and prevalence of technology in
the travel industry is unquestionable. Owning
our own technology provides HRG with the
necessary flexibility to adapt and respond to
future changes, giving the Group a significant
advantage over its principal peers.
Our continuing focus remains on providing
a premier service that meets the specific
needs of each of our clients throughout the
world. Our staff’s attention to detail and
determination to deliver excellent service to
clients and colleagues has once again been
rewarded as we have maintained our
consistently high client retention rate. Also,
we won more business during the period
than we lost. Amongst several new clients
that we welcomed during the year, of
particular note are Bayer, Centrica, Cricket
Australia, the Government of Canada,
Hansel, KfW, NetApp, Pirelli and Unilever. We
are encouraged by the scale and scope of
these wins which bode well for the future.
Our performance this year provides a
reminder of the fact that our model does
not rely solely on revenue growth to enable
margin progression. We will continue our
regime of sensible and appropriate cost
control, ensuring that our operating costs
match closely client activity levels. Self-help
measures, including structural changes, will
cost £6.5m in FY14, which will be treated
as an exceptional item, and we will see
annualised cost benefits of £6.5m from FY15
which will be reinvested in the business.
CURRENT TRADING AND OUTLOOK
The Group has traded in line with our
expectations since the year end. Overall in
the current year, whilst global prospects are
showing some signs of improvement, given
the economic and political uncertainties
that continue to exist in several of our key
markets, we expect trading conditions in
our industry to remain weak. However,
primarily as a result of our initiatives to drive
incremental revenue growth, our cost
reduction programme and the benefit of
new business wins, we expect to make
further progress through the rest of the year.

Financial results
Revenue of £343.2m was down 8% as reported, or 7% lower at
constant exchange rates. Underlying operating expenses, which
are before the amortisation of acquired intangibles, were down
10%, or down 8% at constant exchange rates. Underlying
operating profit was up by 3% to £48.8m, and represented a
margin improvement from 12.6% to 14.2%. New technology sales,
net of related additional investment, contributed approximately
7% of underlying operating profit for the year. Underlying profit
before tax increased by £0.1m to £38.3m, and underlying EPS
increased by 4% from 8.3p to 8.6p. After including the amortisation
of acquired intangibles, reported operating profit was up by 4%,
profit before tax was up by 1% and EPS increased by 4%.
Reported revenue per employee decreased by 1.0% from £69.3k
to £68.6k. At constant exchange rates this was an increase of 0.7%.
Year-end net debt rose, as expected. The increase of £26.0m
reflects our previously-announced decision to discontinue the
active working capital programme (£31.4m), dividends paid during
the year (£6.2m) and share purchases by the Employee Benefits
Trust (£8.1m). The Group’s active working capital programme
was introduced during 2009 to help remove uncertainty about
compliance with banking covenants. Net debt of £87.0m at
31 March 2013 represented 1.4x EBITDA for the last 12 months.
We continue to operate well within our banking covenants.
The Group has a progressive dividend policy and the Board is
recommending a final dividend of 1.5p per share resulting in a
full-year dividend of 2.1p per share, an increase of 5% on the prior
year. Our dividend is covered 4.1x (2012: 4.2x) by underlying EPS.
The final dividend will be paid on 29 July 2013 to shareholders
on the register at the close of business on 28 June 2013. DIRECTORS’ REPORT – BUSINESS REVIEW
Risk management
MANAGING RISK IN OUR BUSINESS
Effective risk management is critical to
achieving the Group’s strategic objectives.
HRG has a comprehensive system of
controls in place to manage risks. We
conduct regular reviews of the major risks
which may affect our business and its
financial performance. Risks are identified,
evaluated and mitigated through a
combination of a ‘top-down’ (driven by
the Board) and ‘bottom-up’ (originating
from the operations) approach. 
Our Group internal audit function
undertakes regular reviews across the
Group’s operations to assess the controls
that are in place to mitigate these risks.
ASSIGNED RESPONSIBILITY
The HRG Board has ultimate responsibility
for the management of all major risks
affecting the Group. Further information
concerning Board responsibilities are
described in the Governance section on
pages 19 to 21.
PERFORMANCE REPORTING
PROCESSES
HRG undertakes a detailed annual business
planning and budgeting process. This
includes annual objectives and targets for
both financial and non-financial metrics,
which are set at a geographic and business
unit level. Actual performance is reported
monthly, with narrative explaining key
variances, and there are regular re-forecasts
which take account of any emerging risks.
APPROPRIATE POLICIES
AND PROCEDURES
Detailed policies and procedures support
risk management across HRG and the
application and consistency of these
procedures is regularly reviewed by the
Group’s internal audit function. Further
details of this are included in Corporate
Governance on pages 19 to 21.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT – BUSINESS REVIEW
CLIENT ACTIVITY
Client travel booking activity declined
by 5% during the financial year, while
client travel spend fell by 8% or 6% at
constant currency.
Against a generally weak and uncertain
macroeconomic backdrop, business
confidence amongst our clients remained
subdued with the result that a generally
cautious approach to travel and related
expenditure continued to be adopted.
Three specific trends characterised many
of our clients’ activity this year:
– Tighter control of policy and spend
– Ongoing determination to seek further
cost savings
– Regionalisation of service
Stronger compliance has been a priority for
most clients this year as a route to better
accountability and control of expenditure,
and reduced security risk. Pre-trip
authorisation and pre- and post-trip
reporting, security advice, travel alerts,
traveller tracking and care procedures are
examples of travel management services
designed to address client needs in this
area. Another area of focus has been
control of suppliers, particularly airlines and
hotels through the provision of improved
data and information, enabling accurate
assessment of the performance of
suppliers by spend, by quality of service,
and during a crisis.
Reducing overall travel expenditure
remains a key objective for a majority of
HRG’s clients and there is an ongoing
pursuit of further incremental cost
savings. As we have seen in the past under
similar economic conditions, clients are
increasingly willing to adopt tighter travel
compliance controls and procedures,
often involving re-routing or lower-priced
travel and accommodation.
Expenditure related to business meetings
and events has often been poorly
controlled and largely overlooked by
clients in the past. This is now a higher
priority for our clients and through
improved data HRG is now offering greater
control and lower costs to clients.
Adoption of online self-booking of travel
continues to grow, particularly for simpler
travel itineraries. Using either HRG’s
proprietary technology delivered through
HRG Online™, or via third-party booking
tools, clients are able to take advantage of
lower booking fees thereby driving cost
savings. Approximately 36% of all client
travel bookings made during the year were
self-booked online by our clients, up from
about 32% last year, with the geographic
spread also increasing.
Many of our clients have long recognised
the benefits, in terms of control and
consistency of outsourced service, of
moving to a more centralised model.
We anticipated this trend several years
ago and have steadily moved to a service
structure based on fewer locations. While
a number of multinational clients have
adopted a global, single-centre approach,
a regional service configuration is
increasingly regarded as optimal as it
provides for differences in management
and supply while remaining consistent
with a global strategy.
At the half-year, we were pleased to
record a growing interest by our clients
in integrated ‘end-to-end’ travel and
expense management solutions. This
follows our move to full ownership of
Spendvision last year. One of our larger
new client wins secured during the
year includes the provision by HRG of
an integrated travel and expense
management tool and services.
Coupled with the demand for data has
been a desire for more insightful analysis
and forecasting. HRG is increasingly taking
an active role alongside clients in the
development of overall business plans
linked to savings. As such, clients are
seeking a more consultative approach to
travel and expense management, one
where HRG is more often seen by its
clients as a business partner rather than
simply a service provider. A natural
consequence is the growing trend of
clients willing to share success and
cost savings with HRG, a development
that we welcome.
Our priority at all times across all parts of
our global operations is to provide the
very best level of service to each of our
clients. Of course, we do lose clients from
time to time. However, we continue to
While travel management
remains at the core of
HRG’s global service offering
and robust business model,
and fundamental to the
Group’s ability to generate
cash, our ability to
provide expense and data
management services

travel management services

interest from larger clients
and prospects.

attract new clients and extend our services
to existing clients. Once again, our reward
for offering good value and a superior
service has been a consistently high client
retention rate, and we won more business
during the year than we lost.
New clients to HRG during the year
included Bayer, Centrica, Cricket Australia,
the governing body of professional and
amateur cricket in Australia, the
Government of Canada, Hansel, the
central procurement unit of the Finnish
Government, KfW, NetApp, Pirelli and
Unilever. Since the year end, Ernst & Young
has indicated its intention to award HRG its
travel contract in the EMEA region. We also
secured expanded contracts, in terms of
both service and geography, with existing
clients such as ABB, the Australian
Government, CGI, Holcim, Lloyds Banking
Group, PPR/Kering, the UK Government
and Volkswagen. Our pipeline of new
business prospects remains very healthy.
Notable amongst clients renewing 
their contracts with HRG were Abbott, 
BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, GDF Suez,
KPMG, Lloyds Banking Group, Man Group,
Porsche, Procter & Gamble and Roche.
While travel management remains at the
core of HRG’s global service offering and
robust business model, and fundamental
to the Group’s ability to generate cash,
our ability to provide expense and data
management services seamlessly linked
to our travel management services is
showing welcome interest from larger

At constant currency, revenue was down
4.3% for the year, with client spending
3% lower and travel activity down 1%.
Underlying operating profit rose by
£3.5m, notwithstanding a £0.6m negative
impact from currency movements.
Our UK business delivered another robust
performance, helped by focused cost
control and improved productivity
measures in areas such as properties,
management and support services.
We began to see some signs of recovery
during the second half of the year
following a relatively flat year-on-year
performance in the first half. Our travel
management services in the area of
corporate meetings, groups and events
showed strong growth, benefiting from
additional work for a number of large
clients including the UK Government.
Amongst other new business wins were
Centrica, Clifford Chance and Unilever.
As part of our ongoing drive to increase
efficiency across our operations, we made
further investment in advanced service
configuration techniques during the
period, including telephony call-flow
switching. The proportion of rail tickets
booked by HRG’s UK business continues
to grow and is now larger than that of
air and hotel transactions, a result of a
number of factors including changes to
travel patterns and increasing business
with the UK Government.
In Germany, as industrial production has
slowed, our clients have become more
dependent on our experience and ability
to offer innovative solutions offering
better value and incremental cost savings.
There has been particular focus on
reducing the cost of domestic and
European travel. ‘Simply HRG’ was
successfully launched during the year,
offering a range of services to small and
mid-sized companies. Our implementation
work for DHL, a major new client won last
year, was completed and we have begun
trading with this client. This is the first
significant global client consolidation on
one contract from Germany, with our
proprietary products and services being
provided to DHL in 48 countries. Similar
consolidation exercises continue for
clients Volkswagen and BMW. As activity
levels fell in Germany, significant cost
reduction measures were implemented
in the second half of the year.
In the Nordic region, particularly in Sweden,
clients remain focused on cost reduction.
As elsewhere in the world, clients have
been attracted to the lower costs afforded
by online self-booking of travel. Clients in
the oil & gas sector in Norway remained
resilient during the year, and this is
providing opportunities for HRG in the
current year, whilst exciting new business
wins were secured in Denmark and Finland,
including Hansel, the central procurement
unit of the Finnish Government.
Activity in Switzerland was mixed with
clients in the banking sector generally
slowing their activity and reducing
spend, while our pharmaceutical clients
expanded. Various cost-saving initiatives
were implemented during the year and
we were able to realise good productivity
gains from our investment in new
telephony systems.

Revenue was down by 17.8% at constant
currency. Underlying operating profit
reduced by £1.7m with no currency
impact. Client spend was down by 14% in
real terms and activity lower by 13%.
HRG operates two businesses in
North America: (1) corporate travel
management, and (2) loyalty, managing
the redemption of credit card loyalty
points programmes.
In our loyalty business in Canada, our
planned transition to an online
environment in cooperation with another
supplier resulted in significantly lower
fee income compared to prior year.
We reduced headcount and made
structural changes aimed at increasing
efficiency and protecting margin in this
operation. Given the size of this business,
which remains profitable, this transition has
materially affected the overall revenue and
earnings of our North American business
for the year. Approximately 80% of the
revenue decline and all of the fall in
underlying operating profit in North
America is attributable to the change in
the structure of our Canadian loyalty
business. Excluding our loyalty business
in North America, transaction activity
declined by 3% while client travel spend
fell by 1% at constant currency.
Amongst several new clients we
welcomed during the year, we are
particularly pleased to have been awarded
the contract for the overall travel
management of the Government of
Canada. The seven-year contract, which
followed an extensive three-year bidding
process, includes all commercially available
civilian travel requirements for the
Canadian Government including the
provision of travel services, an online
booking tool, a payment card (supplied
by BMO Financial Group), and online
expense management via Spendvision.
Implementation work for this client has
begun and it is anticipated that operations
will commence in the second quarter of
calendar 2014. We secured additional
business with several existing clients
including CH2M Hill, Christies, Lloyds
Banking Group and Volkswagen.
The North American travel market remains
highly competitive with lower-price
transactions accounting for a majority of
domestic travel. As such, point-to-point
travel between locations within this
region is well suited to online self
booking of travel by clients, accounting
for 51% of all transactions compared to
40% last year.

HRG savings successes
Some savings success stories from a selection of HRG’s clients:
Client Professional services firm in Nordic region
Concept Consolidation to HRG, delivering savings through measures that involved:
1. Transition from more than 40 local agencies to local HRG services in each country
2. Online adoption
3. Targeted savings plan on fares and rates
4. Customised region reporting
5. Online booking tool optimisation and trip control
Results Quantifiable 18% expenditure savings over the past three years.
SUCCESS STORY 1 BENEFITS OF CONSOLIDATION
Client Global pharmaceutical with multiple independent operating divisions and a non-mandate culture.
Concept A true partnership with commitment by both client and HRG to deliver a consolidated global travel
programme. The partnership focuses on defined client objectives around agreed performance and savings
targets that are mutually supported. The client gives HRG the freedom to be as creative and innovative as
possible to deliver continuous value.
Results Successive multi-million dollar air and hotel savings over the three years of contract.
SUCCESS STORY 2 TRUST AND FREEDOM TO DELIVER VALUE
Client Large and complex industrial company in France
Concept In an audit of customer performance we found that, on average, 33% of travellers fail to initiate refund of
the unused electronic tickets, even after a telephone reminder. Our electronic E-Ticket Tracking process
removes this dependency on traveller action and ensures that every opportunity is taken to reclaim
unused air and rail travel expenditure.
Results In the first ten months, the client had saved €618,000 from refunds on 1,044 e-tickets. We then introduced
a process to achieve similar savings on unused rail e-tickets and we now save more than €1m annually
from taking action to refund unused but forgotten air and rail e-tickets across all of this client’s divisions.
SUCCESS STORY 3 INNOVATION IN REFUND MANAGEMENT
Client Professional services firm
Concept Outsource a Communications Manager to handle changes to travel policy and increase awareness of
travel services team and programme.
Results Tangible results related to both process and programme value:
– High attendance at all booker events, travel user groups and training sessions.
– Compliance with preferred supplier programme is now 90% for air and 70% for hotel.
– High online adoption – more than 75% of eligible bookings, much better than their peer average.
– Market share on top two airlines increased after 16 personal assistants had a trip to London Heathrow
to experience the airlines’ services at first-hand.
– Booker feedback enabled introduction of a simplified booking process and removal of the out-of-policy
forms. The revised process saves time for travel bookers, function heads and the travel team.
– Supplier relations are a priority, offering greater access to key travel stakeholders than most companies,
which the client is confident brings them greater supplier value.
– Travellers and travel bookers engage with the programme and policy through training and other events. 
Programme benefits are widely recognised, contributing to excellent policy compliance and savings realisations.

were compounded during the second
half of the year by a marked slowdown in
demand for natural resources. Australian
clients in the professional services,
manufacturing and, in particular,
government sectors have been hit hardest
by these weaknesses and levels of client
activity and travel spend were well down
on the prior year. In response, we have
moved swiftly to streamline our
operations, reducing headcount in
line with forecast activity.
In Singapore, the continuing uncertainties
in the Eurozone region lead to softness
amongst our banking clients with activity
and spend down on prior year. This was
somewhat offset by strong growth in
demand from pharmaceutical and FMCG
clients, although we took actions to
reduce our operating costs. As elsewhere
in Asia Pacific, we saw a general
tightening and enforcement of client
travel compliance policies. Demand for
our travel management services for
meetings, group travel and events
began to increase towards the end of
the financial year and may indicate a
greater degree of business confidence
returning to the region.
Our joint venture in mainland China
continues to trade strongly as clients
appear largely immune to the challenges
experienced in other parts of the world
while benefiting from stronger growth in
the local economy. Our Hong Kong joint
venture faced similar challenges to
those experienced by our Singapore
business, although we noted some
recovery during the second half of the
year. As associates, the results of these
joint ventures are not included in the
table above.
Online self-booking of travel in the Asia
Pacific region increased further during the
year accounting for 50% of all bookings,
up from 48% in the prior year.

Spendvision is a global technology
company specialising in integrated travel,
expense, payment and reporting solutions.
Delivered direct and through partners
across the banking, telecoms and travel
sectors, Spendvision’s intelligent
technology, services and support enable
customers to achieve financial benefits,
visibility and control of their transactions.
Revenue was up 20.4% at constant
currency, with good growth in direct
business and also with financial services
clients. Underlying operating profit grew
by £1.0m, with no impact from currency
movements. Our increased investment in
development resource allowed us to benefit
from the release of new functionality to our
clients. This helped us grow revenue from
our white label products in the financial
services sector by 31% year on year.
Spendvision continues to work on
integrating its transaction management
technology into the Group and providing
clients with complete visibility and control
of total travel spend. Client interest in
integrated ‘end-to-end’ travel and expense
management continues to grow and we
expect to release next generation solutions
in calendar 2014. This integration will offer
Spendvision significant opportunities to
continue the positive growth seen this year.
TECHNOLOGY
As clients continue to seek ways of
reducing travel and related expenditure
while maximising the value of their spend,
the use of technology in providing time
and cost-efficient solutions grows in
importance. HRG’s investment in its own
technology platform, the HRG Universal
Super Platform™, continues and recent
client wins where the Group’s proprietary
products are being used globally have
proved the value the platform brings to our
business and to our clients. We continue to
enhance our product suite to ensure we
stay ahead of the industry changes.
Independence and flexibility remain key
strengths of HRG’s technology strategy.
During the first half of the financial year, we
successfully reached a ten-year agreement
with a leading GDS provider to utilise our
travel technology in future products.
We will see contributions in the form of
royalties and from development work
through the life of the agreement.
The Government of Canada contract
award demonstrates our ability to offer
an integrated travel and expense
management solution.
At this year’s Business Travel Show, we
demonstrated the new design of HRG
i-Suite™, our online portal offering clients
access to both HRG and third-party
products, which reflects our strategy of
responsive design to enable any device
size, from phone to desktop, to be catered
for automatically. After successful customer
pilots, we have begun the rollout of HRG
Insight™, our new dynamic and flexible
reporting tool, across our client base.

and a reduction of 9.6% for other expenses,
primarily reflecting lower staff numbers and
a continuing focus on cost management.
Underlying operating profit
Underlying operating profit, which is
before amortisation of acquired
intangibles, increased by 3.4% from
£47.2m to £48.8m, or by 4.7% at constant
exchange rates. Underlying operating
profit margin increased from 12.6% to
14.2%, inclusive of a 0.1% benefit from
currency movements.
Net finance costs
Net finance costs increased by £1.4m to
£11.3m, primarily reflecting an increased
IAS 19 pension charge as a result of a
reduction in the discount rate applied to
the defined benefit pension schemes.
A revision to IAS 19 has been issued, which
the Group will adopt from 1 April 2013.
If the revision had been applied this year,
the pension charge would have been
£3.4m higher, and would be expected to
increase by a further £0.2m in the year
to 31 March 2014.
Taxation
The tax charge for the year represents an
overall effective tax rate (ETR) of 28% of the
reported profit before tax (2012: 29%). The
current year ETR includes a £0.3m charge
relating to the impact on deferred tax
assets of a reduction in the UK corporation
tax rate from 24% to 23% and a reduction
in the Swedish corporation tax rate from
26.3% to 22%. An additional charge of
£1.4m is reflected in the Consolidated
Statement of Comprehensive Income in
respect of deferred tax assets on pension
liabilities resulting from the reduction in
the UK corporation tax rate. We anticipate
an ETR of around 28% in future years.
Return on capital employed
Return on capital employed is calculated
by dividing underlying operating profit
plus net share of the results of associates
and joint ventures by average net assets.
Average net assets are based on each of
the 12 month ends for the financial year
and exclude net debt, pension deficits and
tax provisions. Average net assets
amounted to £222.0m (2012: £214.4m)
compared with £204.4m at the year end
(2012: £169.7m). The return for the year
was 22.3% (2012: 22.5%).
Cash flow
Free cash outflow, which is the change in
net debt before acquisitions and disposals,
Employee Benefits Trust purchases,
dividends and the impact of foreign
exchange movements on net debt balances,
was £10.5m (2012: inflow of £19.6m).
Cash outflow in respect of working capital
was £36.8m (2012: £11.6m), primarily due
to the planned withdrawal of the working
capital management programme which
was previously used to reduce working
capital requirements at the end of each
half-year reporting period. The cash
outflow related to interest was £6.4m
(2012: £5.6m). Tax paid in cash was £5.7m
(2012: £6.7m) and capital expenditure,
which is primarily internal software
development and office equipment, was
£9.7m (2012: £9.4m). Cash costs for
pension deficit reduction were £9.8m
(2012: £6.0m).
In addition to free cash flow, the other
major cash flow items are related to share
purchases of £8.1m made by the Employee
Benefits Trust (2012: £2.5m) and £6.2m of
dividends paid to shareholders during the
year (2012: £4.7m).
Funding and net debt
The principal banking facility is a £190m
multi-currency revolving credit facility
(RCF) that is committed until November
2014. The RCF is used for loans, letters of
credit and guarantees, with interest based
on LIBOR/EURIBOR plus a margin and costs.
The Group has fixed interest on CHF25m
until November 2014 and on £20m until
February 2017. In addition, the Group has a
£30m fixed rate loan, repayable by 2018,
and uncommitted facilities amounting to
around £21m at the year end.
The principal covenants continue to be
measured semi-annually, at the end of
March and the end of September, against
EBITDA. The covenants require that net
debt is less than 3.0 times EBITDA and
net external interest is covered at least
4.0 times by EBITDA, both on a rolling
12-month basis. The definition of EBITDA
for covenant purposes is not materially
different from the definition used in
these financial statements.
Net debt at year end increased by
£26.0m to £87.0m and was equivalent
to 1.4 times EBITDA (2012: 1.1 times).
This translates into gearing of 41.8%
(2012: 35%), or 106% (2012: 99%)
including the pension deficits and
related deferred tax assets.
Net external interest costs of £6.8m
were covered 8.8 times by EBITDA
(2012: 8.8 times).
Pensions
The Group-wide pension deficits under
IAS 19 have increased by £13.6m to
£159.4m before tax.
The UK scheme deficit increased by
£10.5m to £144.6m. The £27.1m increase in
scheme assets was more than offset by a
£37.6m increase in scheme liabilities,
primarily driven by a lower discount rate
adding £25.8m. For several years, the UK
defined benefit scheme has been closed to
new entrants and has capped increases in
pensionable salary. We are in consultation
with active members of the scheme on 
a proposal to close the scheme to future
defined benefit accrual and replace it with
a defined contribution scheme.
The overseas schemes are primarily in
Germany and Switzerland, where the year-
end deficit increased by £3.1m to £14.8m.
At the year end, there was a deferred tax
asset of £33.2m (2012: £32.2m) relating to
the UK deficit and a liability of £0.2m
(2012: £0.5m asset) relating to the overseas
schemes. The change in UK deferred tax
includes the 1% reduction in the headline
rate of UK corporation tax.
The Group will apply the revised version
of IAS 19 with effect from 1 April 2013,
with comparatives restated (see page 39).
Whilst the net pension deficit would have
been unchanged, the pre-tax profit would
have been £3.4m lower, equating to a 9%
decrease in underlying EPS, if the revision
had been applied this year.
Share price
The closing mid-market price at the year
end was 57p (2012: 70.25p). During the
year, the price ranged from 46.5p to 72p
per share.

18 HRG Annual Report 2013 DIRECTORS’ REPORT – GOVERNANCE
Corporate governance
STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
The Board has at all times been guided by the UK Corporate
Governance Code (‘the Code’) in seeking to achieve the highest
standards of business integrity, ethics, and professionalism across
all of the Company’s activities. This report sets out the manner in
which the main and supporting principles of the Code have
been applied. Except as noted below, HRG has complied with
the Code throughout the year and is committed to maintaining
such compliance in the future.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Board has six members: the Chairman, two further Non-
Executive Directors and three Executive Directors. The effectiveness
of the Board is underpinned by a balance between Executive and
Non-Executive Directors and the Board believes that this brings
together the appropriate skills and experience necessary to provide
effective leadership and control of the Company. The biographies
of the Directors appear on page 18.
BOARD RESPONSIBILITIES, BALANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS
Collectively, the Board is responsible to shareholders for setting the
direction of the business and monitoring the Group’s performance.
It is also responsible for ensuring that an effective internal control
environment exists, and that the risks associated with the business
are appropriately managed. It defines and sets the strategic
objectives of the Group, ensuring that sufficient financial and
human resources are in place to meet those objectives. The Board
meets its commitment to the strategic direction and control of the
Group by meeting regularly throughout the year. In addition to a
schedule of regular meetings, the Board also meets on an
unscheduled basis as the need arises.
The executive element of the Board is balanced by independent
Non-Executive Directors, so that no individual or group of
individuals can dominate the Board’s decision making. The Group’s
Non-Executive Directors are regarded as independent and free
from any business or other relationship that could materially
interfere with their judgement.
On appointment, the Chairman met the independence criteria set
out in paragraph B.1.1 of the Code, and remains independent in
the Board’s view although, in accordance with paragraph B.1.2 of
the Code, he is not counted as independent for the purposes of
that provision of the Code. The Company has been below the FTSE
350 throughout the year and, in accordance with paragraph B.1.2 of
the Code, the Company has two non-executive directors who are
counted as independent. In view of the fact that the Board includes
three Executive Directors and only two Non-Executive Directors
who are counted as independent for the purpose of the Code, the
Board has also adopted voting procedures which provides that the
votes of the Executive Directors cannot outvote the combined
votes of the independent Non-Executive Directors and intends to
retain these procedures. The Senior Independent Director has a
casting vote in the event of equality of votes on any resolutions.
The provisions of the Companies Act 2006 relating to Directors’
conflicts are incorporated into the Company’s Articles of
Association. No conflicts of interest have been noted or authorised
by the Board during the year.
DIRECTORS’ INDEMNITY ARRANGEMENTS
The Company has purchased and maintained Directors’ and
Officers’ liability insurance throughout the year in respect of itself
and its Directors, whether in their capacity as directors of the
company or associated companies. The Directors also have the
benefit of indemnity provisions in the Company’s Articles of
Association. These provisions are qualifying third party indemnity
provisions as defined by the Companies Act 2006.
THE CONDUCT OF BUSINESS
The Company has established business values and standards for
the Group, which provide a framework for the corporate social
responsibility which the Board expects the Company to observe
in balancing the interests of all its stakeholders in the conduct of
business. The Company has reviewed this framework in the light
of the Bribery Act 2010, and has adopted procedures which follow
the guidelines published by the Ministry of Justice. These values
and standards are available on the Company’s website
(www.hrgworldwide.com). The Company has a written anti-
corruption and bribery policy.
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman
and Chief Executive. The Chairman has overall responsibility for the
leadership and effectiveness of the Board, and there is a formal
schedule of matters specifically reserved to the Board for decision
which includes the Group’s business strategy, annual budget,
annual and half-yearly financial results, interim management
statements, dividends, and major corporate activities, such as the
making of investments, acquisitions and disposals. The Board also
considers regular reports from the Chief Executive, Group Finance
Director, Chief Operating Officer and operating reports from
individual divisions or functions. Complete, timely and relevant
information is provided to the Board to ensure that informed
judgements are made in pursuit of the Group’s objectives.
The Board also reviews the performance of management in
meeting business objectives, determines appropriate
remuneration levels through the Remuneration Committee
and plans the succession of key executives.
The operational management of the Group is delegated to the
Chief Executive who manages this through an Executive
Management Team which meets according to a regular schedule
and also on an ad hoc basis as the need arises. The composition
of the Executive Management Team is set out on page 18.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THEIR FUNCTION
The Non-Executive Directors provide an independent and
constructive challenge to the business development plans that are
proposed by executive management. Through their membership
of the Board’s committees they also have responsibility for:
– overseeing that the systems of internal control and risk
management are appropriate and effective;
– managing the relationship with the external auditors;
– evaluating the performance of the management teams in
meeting targets and objectives;
– setting the remuneration of Executive Directors and approving
the Chief Executive’s recommendations as to the remuneration
of the Executive Management Team; and
– planning senior management succession.
The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is Tony Isaac.
In this capacity, he is an additional contact point for shareholders
should they feel that their concerns are not being addressed
through normal channels.

BOARD DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING
Newly appointed Directors receive a comprehensive induction
programme, and training is provided for Directors on their roles
and legal obligations to ensure that they are fully conversant with
their responsibilities as Directors.
Directors are also kept informed of changes to relevant regulatory
regimes, and new institutional investor guidelines. All of the
Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company
Secretary and also to external independent advice should they
so wish.
PERFORMANCE OF THE BOARD
Following the externally moderated review which was conducted
in the prior year, the Board conducted an internal review of its
efficiency during the year and was satisfied with the overall
operational efficiency of the Board following the minor adjustments
to procedures which were implemented last year. Overall, the Board
remains satisfied that the current Board systems, structures and
procedures are appropriate to the needs of the business.
During the year, the Non-Executive Directors conducted a
performance evaluation of the Chairman, taking into account the
views of the Executive Directors. The Chairman also met the other
Non-Executive Directors without the Executive Directors being
present in order to review the operation of the Board. In addition,
the Chairman held a meeting with the other Non-Executive
Directors to review their contribution to the Board.
BOARD MEMBERSHIP
In accordance with the Code and the Company’s Articles of
Association, all Directors submit themselves for re-election on a
rotational basis every three years and newly appointed Directors
are subject to election by the shareholders at the first AGM after
their appointment.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Company has established Audit, Remuneration and
Nominations Committees. No person other than a committee
member is entitled to attend the meetings of these Committees,
except at the invitation of the Committee. The terms of reference
of the Committees are available on the Company’s website
(www.hrgworldwide.com).
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises Tony Isaac, Paul Williams, (both
of whom are Independent Non-Executive Directors) and John
Coombe. The Committee is chaired by Tony Isaac, who has
significant and recent relevant financial experience. In addition
to the members of the Committee, regular attendees at Audit
Committee meetings at the invitation of the Committee have
included the CEO, the Group Finance Director, representatives of
the external auditors, the head of internal audit, the head of
financial reporting and the Company Secretary.
The Audit Committee meets not less than three times a year and
at such other times as the Chairman of the Committee requires.
The Audit Committee reviewed a wide range of financial
reporting and related matters at its meetings during the year,
including the Company’s results prior to their submission to the
Board. The Committee focused in particular on critical accounting
policies and practices adopted by the Group and any significant
areas of judgement that may materially impact reported results.
It also monitored the internal controls that are operated by
management to ensure the integrity of information reported to
shareholders. The Committee provides a forum for reporting by
the Group’s external auditors. It has advised the Board on the
appointment, independence and objectivity of the external
auditors, and on their remuneration for both statutory audit and
non-audit work. It also discussed the nature, scope and timing
of the statutory audit with the external auditors. The Audit
Committee carries out an independent assessment of the
suitability and performance of the external auditors in making
its recommendation to the Board for their reappointment.
The Committee reviewed the appropriateness of the annual internal
audit plan for the Group, to ensure that the internal audit function is
adequately sponsored and resourced. Its terms of reference also
provide for it to review the whistle-blowing arrangements for staff.
At the meeting to review the 2013 Annual Report and Financial
Statements, the Committee considered the level of non-audit
services being provided by the Group’s external auditors in order
to satisfy itself that the objectivity and independence of the
external auditors is safeguarded. The lead audit partner is rotated
every five years and was last changed in 2011.

20 HRG Annual Report 2013 DIRECTORS’ REPORT – GOVERNANCE
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the Chairman of 
the Company, John Coombe, and the two independent 
Non-Executive Directors, Tony Isaac and Paul Williams, who is
Chairman of the Committee.
The Remuneration Committee sets the policy framework and
objectives for the remuneration of the Executive Directors and
other senior executives of the Group and monitors their
performance against these targets.
During the year, the Remuneration Committee has taken advice
on remuneration from Kepler Associates in relation to overall
remuneration strategy, and also in relation to the design and
structure of share-based incentive schemes. Details of the activities
of the Remuneration Committee are given in the Remuneration
Report on page 22.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee is responsible for matters of
Board structure, management succession and the identification
and appointment of Directors. The Committee comprises the
Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors of the Company.
The Chairman of the Committee is John Coombe.
COMMUNICATION WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Board attaches importance to the effectiveness of its
communications with shareholders. The Board has initiated
dialogue with institutional shareholders and the financial
community. This has included presentations of the preliminary
and half-year results, and also includes regular meetings with
major shareholders and industry analysts. All shareholders and
potential shareholders can gain access to the Annual Report
and other significant information about HRG on the
Company’s website (www.hrgworldwide.com).
Shareholders are encouraged to attend the Company’s AGM
which, this year, is to be held on 23 July 2013, where they will
have the opportunity to receive information on the Group’s
business activities and to question senior management about
business issues and prospects. The Chairmen of the Audit,
Remuneration, and Nominations Committees will be available
to answer any questions on the work of the Committees.
All shareholders will be entitled to vote on the resolutions put to
the AGM. All proxy votes will be counted and the level of proxy
votes lodged for each resolution will be reported at the AGM
and on the Company’s website (www.hrgworldwide.com).
INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s system of
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness in safeguarding
shareholders’ interests and the Group’s assets. Such a system is
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risks associated
with the achievement of business objectives, and can only
provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
Within the Group, managers are responsible for the identification
and evaluation of significant risks applicable to their areas of
operation together with the design and operation of appropriate
mitigation. In particular, with regard to regular financial reporting
and preparing Consolidated Financial Statements, Group Finance
participates in the control self-assessment and policy compliance
elements of risk management. Group Finance also contains a
consolidation team and reviews external technical developments
and detailed reporting and accounting policy issues. In addition,
Group Finance maintains an up-to-date Group Accounting Policies
Manual and sets formal requirements with business unit finance
functions specifying the reports and approvals needed.
Risk management software is used at all major sites and for key
central functions and is readily accessible by management.
The Executive Management Team regularly reviews the risk
management and control process and considers:
– the authority, resources, and coordination of those involved in
the identification, assessment and management of significant
risks faced by the Group;
– the response to the significant risks which have been identified
by management and others; and
– the maintenance of a control environment directed towards
the proper management of risk.
A process of self-certification is used within the Group to provide a
documented and auditable trail of accountability for the operation
of the system of internal control. This is complemented by the
activities of the internal audit function, which provides a degree of
assurance as to the system of internal control that takes account of
the major risks identified by the Executive Management Team.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of
internal control that has been in operation during the year ended
31 March 2013. The Executive Management Team has reviewed
and updated its evaluation of significant risks affecting the
business and the manner in which they are managed. The results
of this exercise have been reviewed and endorsed by the Audit
Committee and the Board, and are commented on in more detail
in the Risk Management section set out on pages 8 and 9.
HRG Annual Report 2013 21
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements DIRECTORS’ REPORT – GOVERNANCE
Remuneration report
As reported by both the Chairman and the Chief Executive, the global
business climate has made it a demanding year for HRG. The
Management Team has nevertheless delivered a resilient performance
whilst at the same time continuing to develop HRG products and
services which anticipate industry trends and client requirements.
In these introductory comments to this remuneration report, there
are three important policy decisions which I want to draw to
shareholders’ attention as follows:
a) The Executive Management Team believe that, in the present
economic climate, it is prudent that no performance-based
salary increases should be awarded in April 2013. The
Remuneration Committee endorses this approach.
b) In their comments prior to the 2012 AGM, some shareholders
made clear their discomfort with a Long-Term Incentive Plan
(LTIP) which comprised two distinct components, both of
which utilised identical performance metrics. After careful
consideration, a decision has been taken by the Remuneration
Committee to move to a single LTIP component in 2013. No
awards will be made under the Company Share Option Plan
(CSOP). The Performance Share Plan (PSP) will be the single LTIP
component and the performance metrics will continue to be
Total Shareholder Return and Earnings Per Share.
c) In addition to the requirement (announced in last year’s report)
for the Executive Management Team to use any bonus in excess
of 80% of salary towards fulfilling the Committee’s shareholding
guideline, the Committee has this year also agreed with the
Executive Management Team that, on vesting, all future LTIP
awards will have a restriction on the disposal of shares requiring
the relevant executive to retain at least 50% of the net after tax
value of such awards if, and to the extent that, such executive
does not already hold shares equal to at least one year’s salary.
MEMBERSHIP AND TERMS OF REFERENCE
The Remuneration Committee comprises the independent Non-
Executive Directors, Paul Williams and Tony Isaac, together with the
Chairman of the Company, John Coombe. The Committee is chaired
by Paul Williams, and sets the policy framework and objectives for
the remuneration of the Executive Directors and other members of
the Executive Management Team (collectively ‘Key Management’)
and monitors the performance of Key Management against those
objectives. The Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, Chief
Operating Officer and the Company Secretary (who also acts as the
Secretary to the Committee) are invited to attend meetings, except
when their own remuneration is being discussed. No Director is
involved in deciding his own remuneration.
ADVISERS
The Committee is advised on remuneration strategy, incentive
design and market data by Kepler Associates. Kepler Associates
were appointed by the Committee in 2006, provide no other
services to the Group and are accordingly regarded as
independent by the Committee. They were paid fees of £30,485
for their advisory work during the year (2012: £52,567).
REMUNERATION POLICY
When deciding appropriate levels of salary and other forms of
remuneration, the Committee takes into account:
– the annual and continuing performance of the Company,
and each Director within his sphere of operation;
– the requirement to ensure that executive remuneration is
aligned with the interests of shareholders;
– the Company’s need to provide sufficiently attractive
remuneration packages for the recruitment, motivation and
retention of executives able to provide the direction and drive
needed in order to deliver the Company’s strategic objectives;
– pay and conditions across the Company as a whole; and
– appropriate market rates.
In judging appropriate market salaries, the Committee considers
external benchmarking research from time-to-time undertaken for
them by Kepler Associates.
There is a formal and transparent procedure for developing policy
on executive remuneration and for determining the remuneration
packages of individual Directors. The Committee’s objective is to
ensure that at least 40% of each Executive Director’s potential
remuneration is variable and linked to performance. Fixed pay
includes salary and contributions towards pension arrangements;
the variable element of pay comprises annual bonus and long
term incentives. The combination of fixed and variable pay
potentially achievable by the Executive Directors is set out in
the table below.
SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES
The Committee has adopted a policy that Key Management are
required to build a holding in the Company’s shares equal to at
least the value of their annual salary. As indicated in last year’s
report, until such time as that guideline is met, any bonus earned
in excess of 80% of salary (net of tax) must be invested in
Company shares. As highlighted in the third of my introductory
comments, the Committee has also now agreed with Key
Management that, on vesting, all future long-term incentive
awards will have a restriction on the disposal of shares requiring
the relevant executive to retain at least 50% of the net after tax
value of such awards if, and to the extent that, such executive
does not already hold shares equal to at least one year’s salary.
The current shareholdings of Executive Directors and other
Key Management are set out in Table 4 of this report.

A summary of the advisory vote on the last year’s remuneration
report is shown in the following table.
Shareholder voting
% of votes cast
Votes in favour: 92.7%
Votes abstaining: 1.9%
Votes against: 5.4%
No issues were raised on remuneration at the Annual General
Meeting itself. The Company has engaged with its key investors to
understand any issues which were raised prior to the AGM, and
specific actions taken to address those concerns are summarised
in the relevant part of this report. A significant reason for the small
adverse vote related to the use of two long-term incentives
based on the same performance conditions. The Company has
subsequently engaged with its key investors to address this issue
and a revised policy is set out in this report.
DIRECTORS’ SERVICE AGREEMENTS
Executive Directors
a) David Radcliffe, Kevin Ruffles and Philip Harrison have
continuing service contracts with the Company which, other
than for cause, are subject to termination by the Company
giving not less than 12 months’ written notice, or by the
Executive Director giving not less than 12 months’ written
notice (in the case of Mr Radcliffe) or 6 months’ written notice
(in the case of Mr Ruffles and Mr Harrison).
b) Details of the salary and benefits paid to the Executive Directors
(including those of Julian Steadman who retired from the Company
on 25 July 2012) are set out in Tables 1-3 at the end of this report.
c) No member of Key Management has a notice period which is
longer than 12 months. Service contracts include a limited
liquidated damages clause which applies in the event of the
Company terminating the role or employment of a member
of Key Management in the 12 months following a takeover of
the Company.
Non-Executive Directors
a) John Coombe entered into a letter of appointment with the
Company dated 7 June 2006 for an initial three-year term which
was extended in 2009 and 2012 for further successive terms of
three years. His appointment expires at the 2015 Annual General
Meeting. For the year under review, he received an annual fee of
£135,000 together with the reimbursement of out-of-pocket
expenses. If the Company elects to terminate Mr Coombe’s
appointment before the expiry of his appointment, he would be

ELEMENTS OF REMUNERATION
Basic salaries
Individual basic salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee
taking into account Company performance, personal performance,
any changes in responsibility and market rates, normally with effect
from 1 April in each year. In addition to external benchmarking
exercises which are undertaken from time to time, these reviews also
consider the remuneration levels that are being set in respect of
other staff across the rest of the Company. However, as highlighted in
the first of my introductory comments, the Committee has endorsed
management’s recommendation that, despite a resilient performance
in a tough business environment, it would be prudent for no
performance-based salary increases to be made with effect from
1 April 2013. The annual rate of base salary for each of the Executive
Directors therefore remains as follows:
David Radcliffe £428,400
Kevin Ruffles £287,513
Philip Harrison £286,000
Non-cash benefits (other than pensions)
The Company also provides a package of employment benefits for
Key Management. Principal elements include the cash equivalent
to a fully expensed company car, life insurance, private health
insurance, personal accident insurance and permanent disability
insurance, none of which is pensionable.
Pensions
David Radcliffe, Philip Harrison and Kevin Ruffles have a direct
pension contribution arrangement under which they receive a
non-pensionable payment of 22%, 24% and 22% of their base
salary respectively. Details are set out in Tables 1 and 2 at the end
of this report.
Variable remuneration
As noted earlier in this report, the Committee believes that it is
important that Key Management have a substantial part of their
annual remuneration based on performance. Accordingly, in
addition to salary, Key Management are eligible for (i) an annual
performance-related bonus and (ii) long term incentive awards,
neither of which is pensionable.
Annual bonus plan
For the year under review, Key Management were eligible to
participate in an annual bonus plan. The maximum opportunity was
100% of base salary with 50% of base salary payable for on-target
achievement. 80% of any bonus opportunity is judged against a
combination of financial targets (principally a measurement of
profitability), with the balance judged against personal performance
targets. The personal element of the bonus is payable only if a
threshold level of profitability is met. In determining whether
bonuses are payable in respect of any year, the Committee also has
regard to the quality of the Company’s earnings.
As noted earlier in this report, Key Management are required to
invest any bonus earned in excess of 80% of salary (net of tax) in
Company shares and hold them until the Committee’s shareholding
guideline is achieved. The profit targets attached to the bonus for the
year under review were not met and, as such, no annual bonuses are
payable to Executive Directors for performance over the year to
31 March 2013.
For the year ending 31 March 2014, the Committee has determined
that the structure of the annual bonus plan will be unchanged
from the previous year. DIRECTORS’ REPORT – GOVERNANCE
Remuneration report

Long-Term Incentive Plans
The Company has three share-based incentive schemes, namely a
Performance Share Plan (PSP), a Company Share Option Plan
(CSOP) and a Sharesave Scheme.
As highlighted in the second of my introductory comments, the
Committee has considered the appropriate long-term incentive
structure for HRG going forward in response to feedback from some
of the Company’s major investors regarding the use of two long-term
incentives based on the same performance conditions, trends in
market practice, and the robustness of option versus share-based
incentives. As a result of these considerations, the Committee
proposes to grant awards for the coming year under only the PSP ,
with vesting continuing to be based on a combination of relative TSR
and cumulative EPS. As awards will be granted under only one long-
term incentive component, the Committee has determined that the
face value of PSP awards in 2013/14 should be over shares valued at
100% of salary to maintain the grant-date fair value of the aggregate
long-term incentive opportunity awarded in prior years.
The Company has already engaged with its major investors on this
change. The Committee has had no adverse reaction to that
engagement and such responses as were received have been
wholly supportive of this change of approach. The Committee will
continue to assess the appropriate structure and level for future
awards taking into account all relevant considerations at such
time, and therefore may return to a combination of shares and
options if deemed suitable, but the Committee will engage with
its major investors in advance of any future revisions to this policy.
The following grants were made under these Schemes during the
year (the 2012 awards).
The PSP
Awards were made during the year to employees eligible under the
PSP to subscribe for a total of 2,780,441 (2012: 2,986,275) Ordinary
shares in the Company of 1p each (Ordinary shares). Of these,
1,927,609 (2012: 2,405,472) were made to Key Management and will
vest on the third anniversary of grant subject to the achievement of
certain performance criteria which the Remuneration Committee
regards as appropriate, stretching and reflecting the Company’s
longer term objectives. Details of the performance targets are set
out below. The remaining 852,832 Ordinary shares were awarded to
other eligible employees (outside of Key Management). These
awards vest 1/3 on each of the first, second and third anniversary
of grant, subject to continued employment only.
Awards made under the PSP are exercisable without payment of an
exercise price. The individual awards made to Key Management
together with details of awards which have lapsed, exercised or
became exercisable during the year are set out in Table 3 on page 26.
The CSOP
During the year under review, options were granted to Key
Management to subscribe for 1,346,517 (2012: 1,641,145) Ordinary
shares, vesting on the third anniversary of grant subject to the
achievement of certain performance criteria which the
Remuneration Committee regards as appropriate, stretching and
reflecting the Company’s longer term objectives. Details of the
performance targets are set out below. To the extent that an
award vests, options are exercisable at an exercise price equivalent
to the prevailing share price on the date of grant.
The individual awards made to Key Management together with
details of awards which have lapsed, exercised or became
exercisable during the year are set out in Table 3 on page 26.
Performance Criteria in respect of the PSP and the CSOP
In respect of both the PSP and CSOP , half of each award made to
Key Management is based on the satisfaction of performance
conditions based on total shareholder return (TSR), with the
balance being subject to a performance condition based on real
growth in underlying earnings per share (EPS).
a) TSR targets: Awards subject to TSR targets will vest in full in the
event the TSR of the Company over the 3 year performance
period exceeds the performance of 80% of the companies in the
FTSE 350 Support Services Index. In the event of the Company’s
TSR performance equalling the median-performing company of
the index, 25% of the TSR based award will vest, with vesting
calculated on a straight-line basis between these two points. 
No award will vest if performance is below median.
b) EPS targets: EPS awards made to Key Management are measured
on cumulative underlying EPS. The 2012 awards will vest in full in
the event the Company’s cumulative underlying EPS over the
3-year performance period equals or exceeds 30p (2011 awards;
26p). In the event that the Company’s cumulative underlying EPS
over the period is 25p (2011 awards; 21p), 25% of the EPS award
will vest, with vesting calculated on a straight-line basis between
those two points. No award will vest if underlying EPS is below 25p.
The Committee intends to use this cumulative approach in
measuring EPS performance criteria for any future awards to
Key Management.
The Sharesave Scheme
No options were granted to employees under the Sharesave
Scheme during the year.
Policy on satisfying awards under the PSP and CSOP
Awards made under the PSP are satisfied by market-purchase
shares to the extent that such awards vest in due course. Awards
which vest under the CSOP may be satisfied by market-purchase
shares or are structured so as to be satisfied as equity-settled share
appreciation rights. Funding of awards through new issue shares is
subject to an overall dilution limit of 10% of issued share capital in
any 10 year period. Of this, 5% may be used in connection with the
Group’s discretionary share schemes (being the PSP and CSOP).
The Directors’ interests in the PSP , the CSOP and the Sharesave
Scheme are set out in Table 3.
Chart 1: Total shareholder return on £100 invested in HRG
shares over five years
Notes to Chart 1:
(i) TSR is calculated in pounds Sterling, based on spot share prices and includes
dividends reinvested on their ex-dividend date. HRG’s closing share price on
31 March 2008 was 40p. The closing share price on 31 March 2013 was 57p.
(ii) The FTSE 350 Support Services Index has been chosen as a suitable comparator
against which to measure the Company’s return to shareholders on the basis of
it comprising companies in broadly similar business activities to the Company.

28 HRG Annual Report 2013 DIRECTORS’ REPORT – GOVERNANCE
At the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on
25 July 2012, authority was given for the Company to purchase,
in the market, up to 31,795,868 Ordinary Shares of 1p each.
The Company did not use this authority to make any purchases
of its own shares during the period. At the Annual General
Meeting to be held on 23 July 2013, shareholders will be asked
to give a similar authority, details of which are contained in the
accompanying circular to shareholders. Details of the Company’s
interests in its own shares are set out in note 22 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements on page 67.
POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
There have been no post balance sheet events.
PENSIONS
The Group accounts for pensions under IAS 19, Employee Benefits.
On this basis, the deficit in the Group’s pensions schemes at
31 March 2013 has increased to £159.4m (2012: £145.8m). As with
most pension schemes, assets are invested for the long term to meet
long term liabilities but the deficit referred to above reflected market
conditions as at 31 March 2013. Further details of pension matters
are set out in note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
EMPLOYEES
Employees are informed of the performance of the Group and
of any factors affecting their employment. Annual Reports are
made available to all staff and there is a comprehensive internal
communications programme through which management
communicate with employees. Employees are encouraged
to assist in the Group’s development.
Fair and full consideration is given to applications for employment
from disabled persons having regard to their particular aptitudes
and abilities. Efforts are made to continue the employment of
those who become disabled. Training, career development and
promotion opportunities are, as far as practicable, identical for all
employees. The Group consistently seeks to recruit, develop and
employ suitably qualified, capable and experienced people in an
environment of equal opportunity.
The Group aims to maintain a high standard of safe and healthy
working conditions comparable with the best practices in the
particular industry in which it operates.
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
The Board recognises its responsibility to conduct business in a
manner which engages positively so as to ensure that it reflects
the social standards of all HRG’s stakeholders.
The following is a summary of HRG’s approach to each of the areas
on which it has adopted detailed policies reflecting its corporate
social responsibility:
How we do business
We recognise that our shareholders have invested in our business
and the success of our business will directly influence the value of
their investment. We work cooperatively with our suppliers and
business partners, choosing those who share our values and strive
for mutual trust and benefit. We recognise the importance of
managing environmental, social and governance risks through our
business practices and work hard to maintain our reputation for
honesty, integrity and respect for people.
How we treat our employees
We respect our employees’ individuality and diversity, require them
to live up to our values and provide the encouragement and
opportunity to develop their careers. We recruit and promote on
suitability and merit, and recognise the vital role our people play in
providing excellent client service. We are committed to attracting,
motivating and retaining the best talent, and will maintain our
reputation as a company of choice.
How we treat our clients
We constantly look to offer our clients superior products and
services that provide good value. We aim to give them the highest
quality service and strive to offer them the best economic and
environmental choices.
How we behave in our communities
We strive to behave as responsible corporate citizens globally and
good, supportive neighbours in our local communities.
How we deal with the environment
The Group’s trading activities have only a marginal direct impact
on the environment and contribute minimally to pollution. The
Group is committed to conducting its business in a manner that
shows responsibility towards the environment and in ensuring
high standards of health and safety for its employees. The Group
complies with statutory and mandatory requirements and, where
practicable, aims to exceed regulations applicable to its areas of
business. Working practices are routinely monitored as improved
techniques and technologies become available.
HRG strives to develop its approach to corporate social responsibility
constantly. Detailed copies of HRG’s current policies on each of
these areas and the way in which it seeks to implement them are
available on the Company’s website (www.hrgworldwide.com).
DONATIONS
The Group has made charitable donations during the year
totalling £0.1m (2012: £0.1m). Of the total charitable donations
made in the year £0.01m (2012: £0.01m) was made by the Group
and the remainder was paid on behalf of employees. No political
donations were made during the year (2012: £nil).
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
A statement of the Group’s policies in relation to financial instruments
is set out in note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
POLICY FOR PAYING SUPPLIERS
The Group’s current policy concerning the payment of its trade
payables and other suppliers is to:
(a) set the terms of payment with those suppliers when agreeing
the terms of each transaction;
(b) ensure that those suppliers are made aware of the terms of
payment by inclusion of the relevant terms in contracts; and
(c) pay in accordance with its contractual and other legal
obligations.
Wherever possible UK subsidiaries follow the same policy.
Overseas subsidiaries are encouraged to adopt similar policies by
applying local best practice. The figure for trade payables for the
Group at the end of the financial year represents 8 days purchases
(2012: 10 days). The Parent Company has no trade payables.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Consolidated Financial
Statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors
have prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and the Parent
Company Financial Statements in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under
company law the Directors must not approve the Consolidated
and Parent Company Financial Statements unless they are satisfied
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group
for that period. In preparing these Consolidated and Parent
Company Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
– select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
– make judgements and accounting estimates that are
reasonable and prudent;
– state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed,
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained
in the Consolidated and Parent Company Financial
Statements respectively; and
– prepare the Consolidated and Parent Company Financial
Statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate
to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable
them to ensure that the Consolidated and Parent Company
Financial Statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group
Consolidated Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the
Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on
page 18 confirms that, to the best of his knowledge:
– the Group Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and
profit of the Group; and
– the Directors’ report contained in the Annual Report includes a
fair review of the development and performance of the business
and the position of the Group, together with a description of the
principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
By order of the Board

Notes:
(a) The maintenance and integrity of the Hogg Robinson Group plc website is the
responsibility of the Directors; the work carried out by the auditors does not
involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no
responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the Consolidated
Financial Statements since they were initially presented on the website.
(b) Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination
of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
32 HRG Annual Report 2013 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Independent Auditors’ report
to the members of Hogg Robinson Group plc
We have audited the Consolidated Financial Statements of Hogg
Robinson Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2013 which
comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance
Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the related notes. The
financial reporting framework that has been applied in their
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS
AND AUDITORS
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement
set out on page 32, the Directors are responsible for the
preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and for
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the
Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with applicable
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only
for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements sufficient
to give reasonable assurance that the Consolidated Financial
Statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused
by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances
and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed;
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by
the Directors; and the overall presentation of the Consolidated
Financial Statements. In addition, we read all the financial and
non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify any
material inconsistencies with the audited Consolidated Financial
Statements. If we become aware of any apparent material
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications
for our report.
OPINION ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In our opinion the Consolidated Financial Statements:
– give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at
31 March 2013 and of its profit and cash flows for the year
then ended;
– have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as
adopted by the European Union; and
– have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the lAS Regulation.
OPINION ON OTHER MATTER PRESCRIBED BY
THE COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion:
– the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year
for which the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared is
consistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements; and
– the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement
on pages 19 to 21 with respect to internal control and risk
management systems and about share capital structures is
consistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements.
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO
REPORT BY EXCEPTION
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to
you if, in our opinion:
– certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law
are not made; or
– we have not received all the information and explanations we
require for our audit; or
– a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared
by the Parent Company.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
– the Directors’ statement in relation to going concern;
– the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK
Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and
– certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on
Directors’ Remuneration.
OTHER MATTER
We have reported separately on the Parent Company Financial
Statements of Hogg Robinson Group plc for the year ended
31 March 2013 and on the information in the Directors’
Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 March 2013
1 General information and summary of principal accounting policies
BASIS OF PREPARATION: INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL
REPORTING STANDARDS
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared 
in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) as endorsed and adopted for use by the European Union,
International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations
Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations and with those parts of 
the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS.
The preparation of the IFRS financial statements requires the use of
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial
Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the year. Although these estimates are based on
management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions,
actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates, as noted
in the key management judgements policy on page 44.
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The Directors consider that, taking into account the assets,
revenue and financing facilities available to the Group, the Group
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for
the foreseeable future. Accordingly the Directors adopt the
going concern basis for the Consolidated Financial Statements
contained in this Report.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the
historical cost basis of accounting except for the revaluation of
certain financial instruments and retirement benefit obligations.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all years
presented. No changes have been made to the accounting
policies by comparison with those applied in the Consolidated
Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2013 other
than as described below.
New and amended standards adopted by the Group
There are no standards or interpretations that are effective for the
first time for the financial year beginning 1 April 2012 that would
be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
Standards and amendments to existing standards that are not
yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group
The following standards and amendments to existing standards
have been published and are mandatory for the Group’s
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2013 or later
periods, but the Group has not early adopted them:
– IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’ , was amended in June 2011.
The impact on the Group will be to replace interest cost and
expected return on plan assets with a net interest amount on
the net defined benefit pension deficit calculated using the
discount rate currently used to measure defined benefit
pension liabilities. If the amendment had been applied this
year, pre-tax profit would have been £3.4m lower primarily
because the discount rate is lower than the expected
return on plan assets. The net pension deficit would have
been unchanged.
The directors anticipate that the following standards and
amendments to existing standards will not have a material impact
on the Consolidated Financial Statements:
– Amendment to IAS 1, ’Presentation of Financial Statements’ ,
requires items within Other Comprehensive Income that may be
reclassified to the income statement to be grouped together.
– IFRS10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’ , identifies the concept
of control as the determining factor as to whether the entity
should be included in the consolidated financial statements
of the parent company. The standard provides additional
guidance to assist in the determination of control where this
is difficult to assess.
– IFRS 11, ‘Joint arrangements’ , deals with how a joint arrangement of
which two or more parties have joint control should be classified.
There are two types of joint arrangement under IFRS 11: joint
operations and joint ventures. They are distinguished by parties’
rights and obligations under the arrangements. The existence of a
separate vehicle will no longer be a sufficient condition for a joint
arrangement to be classified as a joint venture.
– IFRS 12, ‘Disclosures of other entities’ , includes the disclosure
requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including
joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and
other off balance sheet vehicles.
– IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’ , aims to improve consistency
and reduce complexity by providing a precise definition of fair
value and a single source of fair value measurements for use
across IFRSs.
The following standard is likely to affect the Group’s accounting for
its financial assets, although the Group is yet to assess it’s full impact:
– IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’ , effective for accounting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2015, subject to endorsement
by the EU. This standard is the first step in the process to replace
IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement,
and introduces new requirements for classifying and measuring
financial assets. 
There are no other IFRSs or IFRS IC interpretations that are not yet
effective that would be expected to have a material impact on
the Group.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The Financial Statements of the Group consolidate the results of
Hogg Robinson Group plc, (the Company) and its subsidiary entities,
and include its share of its joint ventures’ results accounted for under
the equity method, all of which are prepared to 31 March.
All intra – group balances and transactions, and any unrealised
profits and losses arising from intra – group transactions have
been eliminated on consolidation.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control is the
power to govern the financial and operating policies in order to
obtain benefits from their activities. The existence and effect of
potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible
are considered when assessing control. Control is presumed to

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 March 2013 – continued
exist where the Group owns more than one half of the voting
rights (which does not always equate to percentage ownership)
unless it can be demonstrated that ownership does not constitute
control. The results of subsidiaries are included in the income
statement from the date of acquisition. The Consolidated Financial
Statements include all the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and
cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries after eliminating
intra-group transactions as noted above.
For partly owned subsidiaries, the allocation of net assets and net
earnings to outside shareholders is shown in the line ‘Attributable
to non-controlling interests’ on the face of the Consolidated
Income Statement and Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Associates and joint ventures
An associate is an entity, that is neither a subsidiary nor a joint
venture, over whose operating and financial policies the Group
exercises significant influence. Significant influence is presumed to
exist where the Group has between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of
the voting rights, but can also arise where the Group holds less
than 20 per cent if it has the power to be actively involved and
influential in policy decisions affecting the entity.
An entity is regarded as a joint venture if the Group has joint
control over its operating and financial policies. In some situations,
joint control exists even though the Group has an ownership
interest of more than 50 per cent because of the veto rights held
by joint venture partners.
Associates and joint ventures are accounted for under the equity
method, where the consolidated income statement and
consolidated balance sheet includes the Group’s share of their
profits and losses, and net assets. This involves recording the
investment initially at cost to the Group, which therefore includes
any goodwill on acquisition, and then, in subsequent periods,
adjusting the carrying amount of the investment to reflect the
Group’s share of the associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses,
which is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, and
its share of post-acquisition comprehensive income, which is
recognised within the line item ‘share of other comprehensive
income of equity accounted units’ in the Consolidated Statement
of Comprehensive Income. Unrealised gains on transactions
between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent
of the Group’s interest in the associates.
Acquisitions
On the acquisition of a subsidiary, the acquisition method of
accounting is used whereby the purchase consideration is
allocated to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities (identifiable net assets) of the subsidiary on the basis
of fair value at the date of acquisition. Provisional fair values
allocated at a reporting date are finalised within 12 months
of the acquisition date.
Consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary
includes the fair value of assets transferred, liabilities incurred
by the Group to the previous owners of the acquiree, equity
interests issued by the Group, contingent consideration, and
share-based payment awards of the acquiree that are replaced
through the acquisition to the extent they relate to pre-acquisition
conditions. Costs related to the acquisition of a subsidiary are
expensed as incurred. On an acquisition by acquisition basis,
the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the
acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s
proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets. Where the Group
has a previously held non-controlling interest in the acquiree,
this is remeasured to fair value at acquisition with any gain or
loss being recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The results of businesses acquired during the year are brought into
the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date on which
control, joint control or significant influence commences.
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are
accounted for as transactions with equity holders in their capacity
as equity holders. Any difference between the fair value of the
consideration paid and the carrying amount of the interest in the
net assets acquired at the date of the transaction is recognised
directly in equity. Prior to 1 April 2010 this difference was
recognised as goodwill.
Disposals
Disposal groups held for sale comprise assets and liabilities where
the carrying amount is expected to be recovered through a sale
transaction rather than continuing use. They are stated at the
lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The Group accounts for transactions with non-controlling interests as
transactions with equity owners of the Group, hence gains or losses
on disposals to non-controlling interests are recorded in equity.
The results of businesses are taken out of the Consolidated
Financial Statements from the date on which control, joint control
or significant influence ceases. At this point any retained interest
in the entity is re-measured to its fair value, with the change in
carrying amount recognised in the Consolidated Income
Statement. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the
purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as
an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any
amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in
respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly
disposed of the appropriate share of the related assets or liabilities.
This may mean that amounts previously recognised in the
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income are reclassified
to the Consolidated Income Statement.
REVENUE
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration
received or receivable for goods and services provided in the
normal course of business, net of discounts and rebates, value
added tax and other sales related taxes. Revenue does not include
gross transaction values entered into by Group clients for which
the Group acts as agent.
Revenue represents service fees earned from clients, management
fees and revenue and commissions from suppliers.
Client service fees are earned by charging a transaction or
management fee for airline or other transactions, based on
contractual agreements with travel clients. Transaction revenue is
recognised at the time of ticketing of the travel arrangement with
the exception of hotel related income, which is recognised at the
time travel plans are confirmed. Management fees are recognised
over the period of time that the service is provided to the client.
40 HRG Annual Report 2013
1 General information and summary of principal accounting policies continued CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Supplier revenues are earned under sales and marketing
agreements, incentive arrangements and distribution and system
usage agreements. In such cases, revenue is measured at each
balance sheet date as total anticipated income multiplied by the
percentage stage of completion of the contract. Revenue from
Meetings, Groups and Events is accounted on a percentage
completion basis.
Revenue from sales of software licences is recognised upon
persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery of the software
and determination that collection of a fixed or determinable fee is
reasonably assured. When the fees for software upgrades,
enhancements and maintenance are bundled with the licence fee,
they are unbundled using objective evidence of the fair value of
the elements. If evidence of fair value exists for all undelivered
elements and there is no such evidence of fair value established
for delivered elements, revenue is first allocated to the elements
where fair value has been established and the residual amount is
allocated to the delivered elements. If evidence of fair value for any
undelivered element of the arrangement does not exist, all
revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that
evidence of fair value exists or undelivered elements of the
arrangement are delivered.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Pension obligations
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes
or amounts paid directly to the personal pension plans of
employees are charged as an expense as they fall due.
The assets of the defined benefit pension schemes are
measured at their fair value at the balance sheet date and
compared to the liabilities of those schemes at the same date,
measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit
method. The discount rate used is the current rate of return
on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and
currency to the liabilities.
Costs of defined benefit pension schemes arising from employee
service in the current period are charged to operating expenses.
Past service costs, representing the increase in the present value
of pension scheme liabilities relating to employee service in prior
periods, but arising in the current period as a result of benefit
improvements, are charged to operating expenses immediately
to the extent that the benefits have already vested, or otherwise
recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The
expected return on the schemes’ assets and the increase during
the period in the present value of the schemes’ liabilities arising
from the passage of time are included in other finance income.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the Consolidated
Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Termination benefits
Termination benefits may be payable when employment is
terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date,
or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in
exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination
benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating
the employment of current employees according to a detailed
formal plan without possibility of withdrawal, or providing
termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage
voluntary redundancy.
Bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses
based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit
attributable to the Company’s shareholders after certain
adjustments. Bonuses are recognised in the Consolidated
Income Statement in the period a contractual or constructive
obligation arises.
Share-based incentives
The Group operates several equity-settled share-based incentive
schemes for employees. The fair value of the awards is calculated
at grant date and is recognised as an expense over the vesting
period. For awards with vesting conditions based on market
conditions (particularly, those based on total shareholder return
compared with external benchmarks), the likelihood of vesting is
assessed at the date of grant and is not subsequently amended
in arriving at the expense for each year in the vesting period.
All other awards are re-assessed at each balance sheet date, with
the expense recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement,
including the impact of changes of previous estimates of the
likelihood of vesting. The total expense for the year gives rise to
a corresponding credit to equity.
GOODWILL
Goodwill represents the surplus of the purchase consideration
over the Group’s share of the fair value of the separable net assets
of the subsidiary or interest in the associate or joint venture
acquired. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in
intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisitions of interests in associates
and joint ventures is included in ‘investments accounted for using
the equity method’ and is tested for impairment as part of the
Group’s total goodwill. Separately recognised goodwill is
recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least
annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in operating
expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement and is not
subsequently reversed.
The review of impairment includes examination of anticipated
cash flows from the cash generating units to which goodwill
relates. With the exception of the Spendvision business, cash
generating units are determined by geography. Goodwill is written
down to its estimated recoverable amount, being the higher of:
– fair value, the amount obtainable from sale on an arm’s length
basis, less the costs of disposal; and
– the value in use, the net present value of future cash flows
expected to be generated from the business.
When a business is disposed of the carrying amount of goodwill
applicable is taken into account in determining the profit or loss
on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition
to IFRS, 1 April 2003, has been retained at the previous UK
GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment since
that date.
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets are identifiable non-monetary assets without
physical substance. They are stated at cost less accumulated
amortisation and impairment. Cost includes third party purchases,
the directly attributable costs of internally generated assets and
HRG Annual Report 2013 41
Governance Business review Overview Financial statements
1 General information and summary of principal accounting policies continued CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
For the year ended 31 March 2013 – continued
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets arising on
acquisitions since the date of transition to IFRS, 1 April 2003.
Amortisation is provided on the cost of all intangible assets, less
the estimated residual value, using the straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives as follows:
Computer software 2-10 years
Client relationships in acquired businesses 10 years
Amortisation is charged to operating expenses in the
Consolidated Income Statement.
Computer software includes the cost of internally generated
software which is capitalised when it is probable that economic
benefits will flow to the Group from the asset being developed,
and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured and technical
feasibility can be demonstrated. Capitalisation ceases when the
asset being developed is ready for use. Research expenditure
incurred is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement.
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether an asset
may be impaired. If any such indicator exists, impairment is
tested by estimating the recoverable amount. If the recoverable
amount is less than the carrying value of an asset an impairment
charge is made.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and impairment. Cost is defined as expenditure that
is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Depreciation
is provided on the cost of all property, plant and equipment, less
the estimated residual value, which is re-assessed annually, using
the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives as follows:
Property:
Long-term leaseholds 50 years
Short-term leaseholds and structural
leasehold improvements the lease term
Plant and equipment:
IT and office equipment 2-7 years
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether an asset
may be impaired. If any such indicator exists, impairment is
tested by estimating the recoverable amount. If the recoverable
amount is less than the carrying value of an asset an impairment
charge is made.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial instruments are recorded initially at fair value net of issue
costs incurred. Subsequent measurement depends on the
designation of the instrument as follows:
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets as either at fair value
through profit or loss or loans and receivables. The classification
depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were
acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial
assets at initial recognition.
At fair value through profit or loss – Financial instruments at fair
value through profit or loss are financial instruments held for
trading. A financial instrument is classified in this category if
acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term.
Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are
designated as hedges. Financial instruments in this category are
classified as current assets or liabilities.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial
assets at fair value through profit or loss category are presented in the
Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which they arise.
Loans and receivables – Loans and receivables are non-derivative
financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not
quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets,
except where expected maturity is greater than 12 months after
the balance sheet date which are classified as non-current assets.
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other
receivables and cash and cash equivalent assets in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on
the trade-date, the date on which the Group commits to purchase
or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value for
all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are
initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed
in the Consolidated Income Statement. Financial assets are
derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the
investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group
has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest method.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value with
subsequent provision for impairment. A provision for impairment
of trade receivables is established when there is objective
evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts
due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant
financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will
enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or
delinquency in payments (more than 90 days overdue) are
considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The
amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash
flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The carrying
amount of the asset is reduced through the use of a provision
account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the
Consolidated Income Statement. When a trade receivable is not
collectible, it is written off against the provision account for trade
receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written
off are credited to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Financial liabilities
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.
42 HRG Annual Report 2013
1 General information and summary of principal accounting policies continued CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Borrowings are held at amortised cost and are classified as current
liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer
settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance
sheet date. Currency swaps are stated at fair value on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Exchange movements on long term
foreign currency borrowings are taken to reserves to the extent
that the borrowing is in the functional currency of the obligor and
to the Consolidated Income Statement to the extent it is not.
Changes in the fair value of currency swaps are taken to the
Consolidated Income Statement when they are acquired
principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Net finance
costs are recognised as an expense in the year in which they are
incurred. Debt issue costs are initially set off against the amount of
the related debt and subsequently are amortised proportionally
over the anticipated life of the relevant debt facility using the
effective interest method.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according
to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual
interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its
liabilities. A financial liability is a contractual obligation to deliver
cash or another financial asset to a third party.
Financial instruments are stated at fair value with differences
on valuation taken to reserves if hedge accounting has
been established for the particular instrument. Otherwise,
the differences on valuation are taken to the Consolidated
Income Statement. These include interest rate caps and
amounts receivable or payable in foreign currency together
with the forward foreign currency exchange contracts used
to fix their value. Fair values are derived from published
financial data.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the Consolidated Financial Statements in respect
of each of the Group’s subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures
and associates are measured using the currency of the primary
economic environment in which the entity operates (the
functional currency). The Consolidated Financial Statements are
presented in sterling which is the Company’s functional and
presentational currency.
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional
currency of the relevant entity using the exchange rates
prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains
and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and
from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, except when
deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges.
Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures
and associates in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at
the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The results
of foreign subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated
at the average rate of exchange for the year.
Exchange differences arising on the consolidation at closing rates
of net investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates,
together with those on foreign currency loans which finance
them, are taken to reserves and reported in the Consolidated
Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of
a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign
entity and translated at the closing rate. The Group has elected to
treat goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition
to IFRS (1 April 2003) as a sterling denominated asset.
LEASING
A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all
the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. Other leases are
classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase agreements
are included in property, plant and equipment and are
depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their useful
economic life. Lease obligations are stated net of finance charges
attributable to future periods. Finance costs are allocated over the
period of the lease to give a constant rate of charge.
Operating lease rentals, net of any incentives received from the
lessor, are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement over
the life of the lease.
TAXATION
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax
laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in
the countries where the Group’s subsidiaries, joint ventures and
associates operate and generate taxable income. Management
periodically evaluates the positions taken in tax returns with
respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject
to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate on
the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on
temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated Financial
Statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted
for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a
transaction other than a business combination that at the time of
the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that
have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet
date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income
tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is
probable that future taxable profit will be available against which
the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising
on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the
timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by
the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will
not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Governance Business review Overview Financial statements
1 General information and summary of principal accounting policies continued CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS
Interim dividends are recognised in the Consolidated Financial
Statements in the period in which they are paid.
Final dividends to the Company’s shareholders are recognised in
the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements in the period in
which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable
that an outflow of resources will be necessary to settle the
obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions
for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a
detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been
communicated to affected parties. Provisions are discounted
where the impact is material.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
For the purposes of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, cash
and cash equivalents includes bank balances and deposits with
original maturities of three months or less. It also includes bank
overdrafts which form an integral part of the Group’s cash
management and are likely to fluctuate from overdrawn to
positive balances. Bank overdrafts, where there is no right of
set-off, are shown as borrowings within current liabilities.
SHARE CAPITAL AND SHARE PREMIUM
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly
attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in
equity as a deduction from the proceeds.
The premium received on the issue of shares in excess of the
nominal value of shares is credited to the share premium account
and included within shareholders’ equity.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS TRUST
Transactions, assets and liabilities of the Group sponsored
Employee Benefits Trust are included in the Consolidated Financial
Statements. In particular, the Trust’s purchases of shares in the
Company remain deducted from shareholders’ funds until they
vest unconditionally with employees.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption under IAS 24,
Related Party Disclosures, not to disclose transactions and
balances between Group entities that have been eliminated
on consolidation.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND
KEY MANAGEMENT JUDGEMENTS
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are
based on historical experience and other factors, including
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances.
The principal management judgements made in the preparation
of these Consolidated Financial Statements are:
– the assessment of the impairment of goodwill at each balance
sheet date (see note 10). This process depends on the
preparation of estimates of future cash flows expected to be
generated by each cash generating unit in the Group;
– the valuation of client relationships included in intangible assets
at acquisition (see note 10). This process depends on the
preparation of estimates of future cash flows expected to be
generated by existing clients at acquisition;
– the capitalisation of internally generated intangible assets.
This process depends on it being probable that economic
benefits will flow to the Group from the asset being developed,
the cost of the asset being reliably measured and the technical
feasibility being demonstrated;
– the evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets (see
note 20), which depends on the assessment of the probability
that there will be sufficient appropriate taxable profits available
in future against which to realise them;
– the evaluation of retirement benefit obligations. This depends
on the actuarial assumptions set out in note 21, including
estimates of future returns on scheme assets; and
– within revenue there are key judgements made by management
in terms of revenue recognition. The Group uses a percentage
of completion method to measure supplier revenues earned
under sales and marketing agreements, incentive arrangements,
and distribution and usage agreements. The Group also uses
estimates of fair value in determining revenue recognition from
sales of software.

RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the
unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential
adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. Risk
management is carried out by a central treasury department (Group
Treasury) under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Group
Treasury identifies, evaluates financial risks and uses derivative
financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. The Group’s
treasury policy does not allow transactions of a speculative nature.
The Group arranges central borrowing facilities and maintains local
banking relationships to enable it to meet payment obligations as
they fall due, taking into account information from its cash
forecasts and business plans. The amounts of unused borrowing
facilities are set out in note 17.
CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern while providing
adequate returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders
and to maintain a capital structure to optimise the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may
adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return
capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce
debt. It may also increase debt provided that the funded venture
provides adequate returns so that the overall capital structure
remains supportable.
The Group uses an operational gearing ratio to manage net
debt
(1)
to ensure that covenants within banking arrangements are
complied with. Using a ratio of EBITDA
(2)
before exceptional items
to net debt, at 31 March 2013 the operational gearing ratio was 1.4
(2012: 1.1). The definition of EBITDA for covenant purposes is not
materially different from the definition used in these Consolidated
Financial Statements. There have been no breaches of the terms of
the Group’s banking arrangements and there have been no
defaults in the current or prior year.
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods
adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of
measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are
recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial
liability and equity instrument are disclosed within General
information and accounting policies (see note 1).
(1) Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including current and non-current
borrowings, and debt-related derivative financial instruments as shown in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet but excluding unamortised loan issue costs) less
cash and cash equivalent assets.
(2) Earnings before net finance costs, income taxes, depreciation, amortisation
and impairment.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK
The translation of non-Sterling earnings, assets and liabilities of
the Group is affected by changes in exchange rates.
The Group uses short-term currency swaps linked to intercompany
lending as well as direct borrowing in non-Sterling currencies to
manage the currency profile of external borrowings.
Net debt at 31 March 2013 included £18.1m of non-Sterling net debt
(2012: £12.8m) with changes in exchange rates, including the effect
of currency swaps, increasing the balance by £1.2m (2012: £0.6m).
The Group’s transaction exposure is limited, with the majority of its
transactions denominated in the currency of the country of
operation. In the few instances where there is exposure, short-term
hedges are taken once the exposure can be accurately identified.
The following principal exchange rates have been used in the
Consolidated Financial Statements:
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
For the year ended 31 March 2013, if the average value of Sterling
had been 5% higher or lower relative to other currencies than
actual, the profit before tax of the Group would have been
reduced or increased by £0.7m compared to the actual result
(2012: £1.5m). The impact on equity would be a movement of
£5.0m (2012: £4.5m) mainly arising on foreign currency exchange
gains or losses on translation of net investment in foreign
subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
INTEREST RATE RISK
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on any borrowing at
floating interest rates, except that it has fixed the interest rate
on £20m until February 2017 and on CHF25m until November
2014. The interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) is not
otherwise currently fixed, although the Group keeps this situation
under review. The fixed rate loan has an interest rate of 7.239%.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
For the year ended 31 March 2013, if interest rates in all currencies
in which the Group has borrowings had been higher or lower by
1%, interest cost would have been increased or reduced by £0.5m
(2012: £0.7m).

CREDIT RISK
The risk associated with deposits in commercial banks is managed by diversifying with a number of well known financial institutions
together with a periodic review of ratings attributed by major credit rating institutions.
The risk associated with clients and suppliers is not material based on the current client and supplier concentration and based on the
large number of countries where the Group trades. The Group makes widespread use of credit checks in respect of clients and maintains
a close working relationship with its key suppliers.
LIQUIDITY RISK
The RCF is committed until November 2014 and used for loans, letters of credit and guarantees. The fixed rate sterling private placement
of debt is committed in full until November 2016 when equal annual repayments begin until November 2018. In addition, the Group has
uncommitted facilities that are used for local flexibility. Working capital requirements fluctuate significantly during the year, with March
and September typically being the lowest levels.

3 Segment information
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Executive Management Team, which reviews the Group’s internal
reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources. The Executive Management Team has determined the operating
segments based on these reports.
The Executive Management Team considers the business from the perspective of two core activities, Corporate Travel Management,
which is analysed into three distinct geographic segments, and Spendvision. The Group’s internal reporting processes do not distinguish
between the numerous sources of income that comprise revenue for Corporate Travel Management. The performance of the operating
segments is assessed based on a measure of operating profit excluding items of an exceptional nature. Interest income and expenditure
and income tax expense are not included in the result for each operating segment that is reviewed by the Executive Management Team.
Other information provided, except as noted below, to the Executive Management Team is measured in a manner consistent with that in
the financial statements.
Total segment assets exclude cash and cash equivalent assets, current tax assets and deferred tax assets which are managed on a central
basis. These are included as part of the reconciliation to total Consolidated Balance Sheet assets. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The amortisation charge for the year of £10.4m (2012: £9.5m) is comprised of £4.0m (2012: £4.1m) in respect of intangible assets
acquired via business combinations and £6.4m (2012: £5.4m) which relates to amortisation of software purchased and internally
generated by existing businesses.
IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL
The recoverable amount used in the assessment of goodwill for all cash generating units comprises the higher of value in use and net
realisable value. During the year the Group reviewed its discount rate and long term growth rates and these have been applied in the
assessment. The value in use has been calculated by discounting at 10% per annum (2012: 10% per annum) the anticipated pre-tax cash
flows. The forecasts are prepared from management information taking into account historical trading performance and anticipated
changes in future market conditions. The detailed forecasts cover a period of three years from the balance sheet date; cash flows are
projected beyond that period based on market consensus for GDP growth of 2% (2012: 2%).
Goodwill consists of the following amounts related to cash generating units of the Group:
Years ended 31 March

Corporate Travel Management
Europe 170.4 169.7
North America 45.6 43.6
Asia Pacific 1.1 1.0
217.1 214.3
Spendvision 5.5 5.5
222.6 219.8
The key assumptions used in the impairment testing were as follows:
– Discount rates
– Rates of growth in cash generating units beyond 3 years
Discount rate
The discount rate reflects management’s estimate of the post-tax cost of capital employed for the Group’s cash generating units listed
above. The same rate is applied to all cash generating units, and reflects the Group’s funding arrangements where all units have equal
access to the Group’s treasury functions and borrowing lines to fund their operations. None of the Group’s cash generating units
demonstrate levels of risks that are significantly different from those experienced by the Group generally, and all have similar funding
profiles and therefore the discount rate applied is deemed to be justified.
Rates of growth in cash generating units beyond 3 years
Management have reviewed Corporate Travel industry forecasts and consider that the market consensus for GDP growth of 2% is
reasonable for the purposes of the assessment of goodwill.
Goodwill impairment
Management believes that no reasonable change in the key assumptions would cause any of the identified cash generating units
to become impaired. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
– Level 1:  quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
– Level 2:  other techniques for which all inputs which have significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly
or indirectly; and
– Level 3:  techniques which use inputs which have significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
All derivative financial instruments are shown at fair value in the balance sheet. The fair values have been determined by reference to Level 2
techniques in the hierarchy described above. The fair value of derivative financial instruments represent the maximum credit exposure. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Other includes provisions for onerous contracts, property dilapidations and litigation, which are expected to give rise to payment after
more than one year of the balance sheet date.
A provision for onerous contracts has been recognised for contracts where the expected benefits derived by the Group are lower than
the unavoidable costs of meeting the Group’s obligations under the contract.
Provision has been made for the present value of property lease commitments in respect of properties surplus to operational
requirements. Allowance has been made for anticipated sublet rental income, and costs to restore premises to their original condition
upon vacating them where such an obligation exists under the lease. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

At 31 March 2013, deferred tax assets include £36.2m (2012: £39.5m) arising in the UK. These assets are recognised on the basis that there
will be sufficient appropriate taxable profits available in the future against which to realise them.
The UK Government reduced the rate of corporation tax from 24% to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013. Based on the UK deferred tax
balances as at 31 March 2013, this has led to a reduction in deferred tax assets of £1.5m, of which £1.4m is recognised in the
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and £0.1m in the Consolidated Income Statement. Further proposals to reduce the
UK rate to 20% by April 2015 have not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not reflected in the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Swedish government reduced the corporate tax rate with effect from 1 January 2013. This has led to a reduction in deferred tax
assets of £0.2m, recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Of the total tax losses at 31 March 2013, £0.3m is scheduled to expire by 31 March 2023.
No deferred tax is recognised on the undistributed profits of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates as they are reinvested by the
Group and no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future. Since acquisition, subsidiaries have made profits of
£78.7m (2012: £65.8m) that have not been remitted to the Company. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION ARRANGEMENTS
The Group’s principal defined benefit pension arrangement is the Hogg Robinson (1987) Pension Scheme (the UK Scheme). The UK
Scheme was closed to new members in March 2003, with benefits based on final pensionable salary. The increase in final pensionable
salary since 31 March 2003 is limited to the lower of the increase in the Retail Prices Index and 5% per annum. The latest actuarial
valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2011 by an independent qualified actuary.
The Group also operates defined benefit schemes in Norway, Switzerland, Germany, Italy and France.
The following amounts have been included in the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of all defined benefit pension arrangements:

the assumptions used for the UK Scheme. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The expected rates of return have been set taking into account current market returns for each category of asset at the balance sheet date.
The net present value of the defined benefit obligations of the UK Scheme is sensitive to both the actuarial assumptions used and to
market conditions. If the discount rate assumption was 0.5% lower, the obligations would be expected to increase by £42.4m and if it
was 0.5% higher, they would be expected to decrease by £36.6m. If the inflation assumption was 0.5% lower, the obligations would be
expected to decrease by £17.9m and if it was 0.5% higher, they would be expected to increase by £16.9m.
The mortality assumptions for the UK Scheme are based on SAPS/CM1(2010) tables with ‘medium cohort’ projections and a 1% underpin
in the rate of future improvements in mortality. Life expectancy at the age of 65 is assumed to be:
Years ended 31 March

Current pensioners
Male 23.6 23.5
Female 25.7 25.7
Future retirements
Male 25.1 25.0
Female 27.4 27.3
The UK liability is based on the assumption that active and deferred members will take 25% of the value of their pension as a lump sum
on retirement.
The net present value of the defined benefit obligations of the UK Scheme are sensitive to the life expectancy assumption. If there was
an increase of one year to this assumption the obligations would be expected to increase by £11.8m.

In the year to March 2012, deferred members of the UK scheme were offered the opportunity to transfer their accrued benefits out of
the UK scheme to alternative pension providers on enhanced terms. The programme reduced the March 2012 assets and liabilities by
approximately £33m, of which £26.8m was settled in the year to 31 March 2013.
None of the plan assets are represented by financial instruments of the Group. None of the plan assets are occupied or used by the Group.
For several years, the UK defined benefit scheme has been closed to new entrants and has capped increases in pensionable salary.
Following the most recent triennial valuation, effective April 2011, the Trustees agreed cash contributions amounting to 14.8% of
pensionable salaries, plus deficit reduction payments totalling £7.9m for the year ending 31 March 2014.

On 17 September 2012 the Group acquired the 49% interest in Euro Lloyd Breuninger Reiseburo GmbH & Co. KG, Stgt and Euro Lloyd
Breuninger Reiseburo Btlg. GmbH, Stgt, which it did not already own for a cash consideration of £0.1m.
Non-controlling interest acquired during 2012
On 30 March 2012 the Group acquired the 42% interest in Spendvision Holdings Limited which it did not already own for a total
consideration of £13.4m satisfied by £8.4m in cash and £5.0m from the issue of 8.2m shares in Hogg Robinson Group plc. Spendvision
Holdings Ltd is a leading innovator in the development and support of transaction management solutions, including end-to-end
expense management and payables automation. The acquisition provides an opportunity to strengthen the Group’s product offering
and end-to-end services proposition, and is consistent with the Group’s strategy to provide a broader range of integrated products to
its corporate clients linked to its own proprietary technology.
The goodwill arising related to deferred consideration of £2.0m that was paid under pre-existing agreements resulting from a previous
sale of shares in March 2008, this was consequently accounted for under IFRS 3 (2004).
At the acquisition date, the carrying value of the non-controlling interest in Spendvision Holdings Ltd was £3.0m. The difference of
£10.4m between the consideration and the carrying value of the interest acquired has been recognised in retained earnings within
equity. Acquisition-related costs of £0.3m have been charged to retained earnings.

In 1994 Compagnie Dens Ocean NV (CDO), an indirectly owned subsidiary, received a claim from the Belgian Customs authorities
resulting in a liquidator being appointed in 1995. Civil litigation is in process with criminal proceedings being considered pending the
final outcome of the civil action. The liquidator is defending the civil action vigorously and has received strong legal advice on the
strength of CDO’s case. The Directors continue to believe, on the basis of such advice, that any future impact on the net assets of the
Group would not be material. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

30 Share-based incentives
The Group operates equity-settled share-based incentive schemes as follows:
PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN (PSP)
The PSP is applicable to senior executives including Key Management. Shares are awarded which, in respect of awards to Executive Directors,
vest for no consideration after a three year period. Award holders are not entitled to receive dividends during the vesting period.
For Key Management, each award has two discrete elements with performance conditions based on total shareholder return (TSR) and
on basic earnings per share (EPS).
The extent to which the TSR portion of the scheme will vest is subject to the Company’s TSR performance over a three year period
relative to the TSR performance of the companies in the FTSE 350 Support Service Index. Full vesting will take place for a top 20%
ranking, 25% vesting for a median ranking and no award if TSR falls below the median.
The extent to which the EPS portion of any award will vest is subject to the underlying EPS of the Company increasing over a three
year period.
– For awards made during the year ended 31 March 2011, full vesting takes place in the event that the Company’s underlying EPS
cumulatively equals or is greater than 23p over the performance period, 25% if in the event that the Company’s underlying EPS
cumulatively equals or is greater than 18p over the performance period and no award if underlying EPS falls below this. Vesting is
calculated on a straight-line basis between these points. The performance period for these awards is the three financial years ending
on 31 March 2013.
– For awards made during the year ended 31 March 2012, full vesting takes place in the event that the Company’s underlying EPS
cumulatively equals or is greater than 26p over the performance period, 25% if in the event that the Company’s underlying EPS
cumulatively equals or is greater than 21p over the performance period and no award if underlying EPS falls below this. Vesting is
calculated on a straight-line basis between these points. The performance period for these awards is the three financial years ending
on 31 March 2014.
– For awards made during the year ended 31 March 2013, full vesting takes place in the event that the Company’s underlying EPS
cumulatively equals or is greater than 30p over the performance period, 25% if in the event that the Company’s underlying EPS
cumulatively equals or is greater than 25p over the performance period and no award if underlying EPS falls below this. Vesting is
calculated on a straight-line basis between these points. The performance period for these awards is the three financial years ending
on 31 March 2015. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
HRG Annual Report 2013 73
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements
30 Share-based incentives continued
Awards to certain senior executives (other than Key Management) are not subject to TSR or EPS performance conditions.
– For awards made during the year ended 31 March 2010, 25% of such awards vest two years after the grant date, with the remaining
75% vesting one year later.
– For awards made during the years ended 31 March 2011, 31 March 2012 and 31 March 2013, one third of such awards vest on each
anniversary of the Deed of Grant.
If performance conditions are met then shares will be issued up to six months after the vesting date. Participants who leave as a result of
a qualifying reason (generally retirement or involuntary redundancy) will receive a pro-rata entitlement. The awards for other participants
who leave prior to vesting will lapse.
COMPANY SHARE OPTION PLAN (CSOP)
The CSOP is applicable to senior executives including Key Management. Share options are awarded which vest after a three year period
subject to performance conditions. The exercise price of the options is the market price of shares immediately prior to the award. Each
award has two discrete elements with performance conditions based on total shareholder return (TSR) and on earnings per share (EPS).
The performance conditions and arrangements for leavers are the same as for the PSP scheme. Options can be exercised for a period of
seven years following the end of the vesting period. Option holders are not entitled to receive dividends during the vesting period.
SHARESAVE SCHEMES
Sharesave schemes have been established in most countries in which the Group has operations and are applicable to all employees.
Options are issued linked to savings contracts of up to £250 per month (or equivalent amounts overseas) for periods of three or five years
(two years in the USA) with a six month exercise period. Options are issued at a discount of up to 20% of the market price immediately
preceding the date of invitation to apply.
CHARGE FOR THE YEAR
The Group’s charge for equity-settled share-based incentives for the year of £2.1m (2012: £2.4m) has been included in operating
expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The following table illustrates the weighted average exercise price (WAEP) of, and movements in, share options during the year:

In the year ended 31 March 2013, volatility was derived directly from the Group’s share price over the period from listing. In previous
years, the expected volatility was based upon the historical volatility over the expected life of the schemes for a comparator group of
similar companies.

that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and

SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the Financial Statements sufficient to give

material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This
includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Parent Company’s circumstances and have
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the
Directors; and the overall presentation of the Financial Statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information
in the Annual Report to identify any material inconsistencies with
the audited Financial Statements. If we become aware of any
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider
the implications for our report.

Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

Overview Business review Governance Financial statements
1 Accounting policies
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The Parent Company Financial Statements have been prepared
under the historical cost convention, in accordance with the
Companies Act 2006, and conform with applicable United
Kingdom accounting standards. The Directors consider that the
accounting policies set out below are suitable, have been
consistently applied and are supported by reasonable and
prudent judgements and estimates.
INVESTMENTS
Investments in subsidiary companies are stated at cost less any
provision for impairment in value.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial instruments are recorded initially at fair value net of issue
costs incurred. Subsequent measurement depends on the
designation of the instruments as follows:
Borrowings are held at amortised cost and are classified as current
liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer
settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the
balance sheet date. Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense
in the period in which they are incurred.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value with
subsequent provision for impairment.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according
to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An
equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest
in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. A
financial liability is a contractual obligation to deliver cash or
another financial asset to a third party.
TAXATION AND DEFERRED TAXATION
Any charge for taxation is based on the profit or loss for the period
and takes into account deferred taxation. Full provision is made
where required by FRS 19, Deferred Taxation for deferred taxation
on all timing differences, which have arisen but have not reversed
at the balance sheet date. Deferred taxation assets and liabilities
are not discounted.
DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS
Interim dividends are recognised in the Parent Company Financial
Statements in the period in which they are paid.
Final dividends to the Company’s shareholders are recognised in
the Parent Company Financial Statements in the period in which
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
The amounts of dividends taken as shares instead of cash under
the scrip dividend scheme have been added back to reserves. The
nominal value of shares issued under the scheme has been
funded out of the share premium account.
SHARE CAPITAL AND SHARE PREMIUM
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly
attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in
equity as a deduction from the proceeds.
The premium received on the issue of shares in excess of the
nominal value of shares is credited to the share premium account
and included within shareholders’ equity.
SHARE-BASED INCENTIVES
The Company operates several equity-settled share-based
incentive schemes for Group employees. The fair value of the
awards is calculated at grant date and is recognised as an expense
over the vesting period. For awards with vesting conditions based
on market conditions (particularly, those based on total
shareholder return compared with external benchmarks), the
likelihood of vesting is assessed at the date of grant and is not
subsequently amended in arriving at the expense for each year in
the vesting period. All other awards are re-assessed at each
balance sheet date, with the expense charged to the Profit and
Loss Account including the impact of changes of previous
estimates of the likelihood of vesting. The total expense for the
year gives rise to a corresponding credit to equity.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS TRUST
Transactions, assets and liabilities of the Group-sponsored
Employee Benefits Trust are included in the Financial Statements.
In particular, the Trust’s purchases of shares in the Company
remain deducted from shareholders’ funds until they vest
unconditionally with employees.
MANAGEMENT JUDGEMENT
In the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies,
management has made a number of judgements, none of which
are considered to have a significant effect on the amounts
recognised in the Parent Company Financial Statements.
2 Cash flow statement and related party disclosures
In accordance with the exemption under FRS 1, the Company’s
Cash Flow Statement has not been separately presented in these
Parent Company Financial Statements. The Company is also
exempt under the terms of FRS 8 from disclosing related party
transactions with entities that are part of Hogg Robinson Group
plc or wholly owned investees of Hogg Robinson Group plc.
The Directors of Hogg Robinson plc occasionally use the
services of Group companies for their personal travel needs.
These transactions are not material to either party and hence
do not warrant further disclosure in these Parent Company
Financial Statements. PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

02 Directors’ Report Business Review
Halma has an impressive record of creating sustained shareholder value through 
the economic cycle. Our reputation is built on consistently delivering record proﬁts, high 
returns, strong cash ﬂows, low levels of balance sheet gearing and a 30+ year track record 
of growing dividend payments by 5% or more every year . We are one of only three companies 
quoted on the London Stock Exchange with this record of dividend increases. 
Our ability to achieve record proﬁts through the recent period of unprecedented economic 
turbulence is derived from our strategy of having a group of relatively small, autonomous 
businesses operating in diverse specialised global markets with resilient growth drivers. 
These include Health, Safety and Environmental regulation which stimulate ‘non-discretionary’ 
purchase of products whose technical, quality and reliability requirements enable us to build 
competitive advantage. 
We maintain organic growth momentum by increasing levels of investment in management 
development, new product development and establishing platforms for growth in developing 
markets, where Health, Safety and Environmental regulation is starting to emerge. 
Organic growth generates the ﬁnancial and business resources we need to fund acquisitions. 
Through acquisitions we add value to our business by bringing new intellectual assets and a 
wider technological and geographic footprint.
Over the long term, we actively manage the mix of businesses in our Group to ensure we 
can continue to generate strong growth and returns. Whilst acquisitions accelerate entry into 
more attractive market niches, we also exit markets which promise to offer less attractive 
opportunities in the future through carefully planned disposals.
Halma’s defensive market qualities, organic growth momentum and potential to acquire new 
businesses position us strongly to continue to create shareholder value and achieve even 
higher levels of performance in the future. Geoff Unwin
Chairman
Halma p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011

The Group has made strong progress
Halma: what we do and our strategy
Our business is to make products which 
protect lives and improve the quality of life 
for people worldwide. We do this through 
continuous innovation in market-leading 
products which meet the increasing 
demands for improvements to health, 
safety and the environment. We build 
strong positions in niche markets where 
the demand is global. Our businesses are 
autonomous and highly entrepreneurial.
Strategically we aim to grow proﬁt and 
revenue in excess of 5% p.a. organically, 
to have Return on Sales in the region of 
18% to 22% and generate post-tax Return 
on Total Invested Capital of more than 12%. 
As a result, we are highly cash generative 
and reinvest in our businesses through 
people, product and market development, 
continue to acquire more companies with 
like characteristics and strive to give annual 
dividend growth of 5% or more to our 
shareholders; something we have achieved 
for more than 30 consecutive years.
Performance
Full year revenue increased by 13% to 
£518.4m (2010: £459.1m), organic revenue 
growth
1
 was 11%, and also 11% at constant 
currency. Proﬁt before tax, amortisation of 
acquired intangibles and acquisition costs 
increased by 21% (to break through the 
£100m level for the ﬁrst time) to £104.6m 
(2010: £86.2m), organic proﬁt growth was 
19% and also 19% at constant currency. 
Statutory proﬁt before tax increased by 21% 
to £98.3m. Return on Total Invested Capital
1
 
increased to 15.5% (2010: 13.6%), Return 
on Capital Employed
1
 at the operating level 
increased signiﬁcantly to 71.9% (2010: 
61.3%). Return on Sales
1
 improved to 20.2% 
compared to 18.8% the previous year. 
Net debt at the year end was £37 .1m having 
spent £82m on acquiring a number 
of excellent companies during the year.
You will see therefore, that the Company 
made excellent progress during the year 
against its key performance indicators.
As a result the Board is recommending 
a ﬁnal dividend of 5.56p per share giving a 
total dividend of 9.1p for the year, an increase 
of 7 .1%. The ﬁnal dividend is subject to 
approval by shareholders and will be paid 
on 24 August 2011 to shareholders on 
the register at 22 July 2011. Dividend cover 
is 2.25 times (2010: 1.98 times) meeting 
our objective of around 2 times cover.
Acquisitions
In contrast to the previous year, we judged 
that the climate was right to put more 
capital to work and during the year we 
invested a record £82m in acquisitions. 
With the maximum earn-outs, this sum 
could increase by a further £25m. 
Continued strong investment in markets 
and products
The Group has continued to invest strongly 
in developing markets, which in turn is 
boosting our growth rates. Our regional 
development in China is progressing well 
and sales in China grew by 28% to £24m. 
Many companies in the Group are now also 
developing a stronger focus on South 
America, Brazil in particular. As usual, 
the year has seen the launch of many 
new innovative products.
Technical collaboration across the Group 
has increased which accelerates our 
adoption of new technologies and speeds 
our time to market. Although we believe 
passionately in autonomy, collaboration 
is also encouraged, these are key 
differentiators for the Group. 
Research and Development was 5.0% 
of revenue (2010: 4.7%).
People
We continue to invest strongly in people 
development, introducing new tailor-made 
training courses for our technical staff as 
well as even more management training. 
As a result, it is pleasing to see more and 
more internal promotions across the Group.
To everyone in the Group, these outstanding 
and record results are the result of your 
imagination and dedication, sincere thanks 
to you all.
Governance
In July 2010, we appointed Norman 
Blackwell and Steven Marshall to the Board 
and I am delighted to say that already they 
are making strong contributions.
At this year’s AGM, Richard Stone will be 
stepping down from the Board after 10 years 
of exemplary service. Richard has made 
a huge contribution to the Board during his 
tenure, and we offer him our sincere thanks 
and wish him well for the future.
In line with the recommendations of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board 
has agreed to submit all Directors to annual 
election starting at this year’s AGM on 
28 July 2011, ahead of being obliged to 
do so at the 2012 AGM.
Following publication of the FRC’s 
Consultation Document: Gender Diversity 
on Boards, we are reviewing our own 
position and contributing to the consultation 
process. We intend to explore the 
establishment of wider diversity targets 
and report annually on our progress.
Outlook
Despite many economic uncertainties 
across the globe, the Group has made 
strong progress. Some excellent 
acquisitions have added to our strength. 
We are pleased with the momentum we 
have coming into 2011/12 and are looking 
forward to making further good progress 
in the year ahead.

04 Directors’ Report Business Review
Our  
strategy
We aim to achieve high returns on invested 
capital and create shareholder value. 
We operate in relatively noncyclical, 
specialised global markets where 
technology and application know-how 
provide the opportunity to generate growth 
at sustainable high returns through strong 
competitive advantage. Our chosen markets 
have signiﬁcant barriers to entry. Demand 
for our products is underpinned by long-
term, resilient growth drivers.
We place our operational resources close 
to our customers through local, 
autonomous businesses. 
Our growth  
drivers
Demand in each of our markets is 
driven by one or more of the following 
long-term growth drivers:
 – Increasing demand for healthcare
 – Increasing demand for energy and water
 – Increasing urbanisation of population
 – Increasing health and safety regulation
Our  
values
Our values help to ensure a consistent set 
of  standards and behaviours throughout 
the Group. This is particularly important 
given the Group’s decentralised structure.
Our core values are Achievement, 
Innovation, Empowerment and Customer 
Satisfaction. We encourage our employees 
to act fairly in their dealings with fellow 
employees, customers, suppliers and 
business partners.
Our organisational 
structure
A small head ofﬁce team focuses on setting 
the strategic framework and maintains 
a standard process of ﬁnancial planning, 
reporting and control. 
Halma’s 12 sub-sectors are composed 
of 38 autonomous operating companies, 
each with their own board of directors. 
These sub-sectors are grouped into 
operating divisions, each chaired by a 
Halma Divisional Chief Executive (DCE), 
responsible for its own growth. 
DCEs understand the market needs of their 
companies and contribute broadly to their 
strategies. Through regular interaction 
between Executive Board members, 
common challenges and opportunities 
are identiﬁed.
Our strategic 
priorities
We are making the following key strategic 
investments across the group to accelerate 
growth above market rates:
 –Acquisitions
 – Innovation (products and process)
 –People development
 – International expansion (especially Asia)
Our operational 
culture
Our decentralised structure delivers real 
competitive advantage. Tactical decision 
making takes place at operating company 
level by managers closest to markets 
with the ability to allocate resources. 
This ensures quick and agile responses 
to market changes. 
Acquisition prospects are attracted by our 
operating culture which affords them the 
autonomy they are accustomed to while 
providing access, amongst other things, 
to new markets and technology via the 
Group’s collective resources. Halma p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Our global capability is developing as we continue to put our 
resources close to our customers. We operate in 22 countries 
selling to customers in over 150 countries. We are not over-reliant

constituting less than 3% of revenue.  Halma p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Relationships and resource breakdown
We have access to the resources necessary to support investment 
for organic growth and acquisitions. Operationally, we have a 
decentralised structure which places our R&D, manufacturing, 
sales and marketing resources within each Halma company under 
the management of the local board.
External relationships
We work in partnership with our customers 
not only to ensure their short-term needs 
are met but also to ensure that we design 
new products which meet their medium- 
and long-term needs. Since we have a 
diverse customer base, our decentralised 
structure enables our companies to develop 
closer relationships with their customers 
than would be possible if we were more 
centralised. 
We assemble products locally, but source 
our components globally. Halma companies 
often collaborate to identify high quality 
suppliers of common technologies or 
component types and are required to ensure 
suppliers meet our ethical standards. 
We develop relationships with strategic 
partners such as universities, specialist 
design businesses and value-adding 
distributors to complement our technical 
and commercial resources. From these 
relationships come new technologies 
and expertise to aid product development 
or identify new market opportunities. 
We develop good relationships with industry 
regulators who regulate the quality of suppliers 
(like us) or our customers. Many Halma 
companies will be represented on industry 
regulatory bodies as technical experts to 
ensure regulatory codes are implemented in 
light of the latest technology and best practice.
Halma recognises the need to listen closely 
to the views given by shareholders and 
corporate advisers such as our bankers, 
brokers, solicitors and investor relations 
partners. They provide valuable insight 
gained through their involvement with 
a broad array of other businesses and 
commercial situations.
Internal resources
We continue to increase our investment 
in training and development of employees 
since this is critical to our medium- and 
long-term success. In 2010, we launched 
a new programme aimed at technical staff. 
In general our manufacturing is “ asset light” 
and not capital intensive. We do have some 
ﬁxed assets which are critical to our 
businesses (for example, thin ﬁlm coaters 
in Photonics). The average direct labour 
content of our products is less than 7% 
of the selling price. This allows us to locate 
operations close to our customers rather than 
be driven to position them in the lowest cost 
region. Decisions to establish manufacturing 
facilities in low cost regions are made because 
we see local sales opportunities.
Our technical resources include our people, 
patents and specialist application know-
how. Often our competitive advantage is 
built on knowing how to reliably apply a 
proven technology in very speciﬁc situations 
whilst meeting stringent regulatory 
requirements. We invest at least 4% of 
revenue in R&D and this, together with 
acquisitions, continues to refresh 
and strengthen our intellectual assets. 
We encourage our companies to collaborate 
on technical issues through our various 
training programmes and the HITE events 
held in May 2009 and May 2011. 
We have sufﬁcient ﬁnancial resources to 
meet our organic and acquisition growth 
objectives. We operate with a strong system 
of ﬁnancial control and audit the value and 
location of our cash on a weekly basis. 
Due to our high returns, we encourage 
our companies to make capital investments 
in accordance with a strict but speedy 
approvals process. 
Halma companies are typically the leader 
(in the top ﬁve) in their specialised markets 
and therefore each has a strong product 
brand. These brands are synonymous with 
high quality products and service levels 
and in some cases are used as the generic 
industry term for a particular product type.

Comment Strong organic growth following the tough 
economic conditions in 2010. Over the last ﬁve 
years our average rate of annual organic revenue 
growth has been 8% p.a. which is 3% in excess 
of our minimum target.
Very strong organic proﬁt growth. Over the last 
ﬁve years our average rate of annual organic 
proﬁt growth has been 10% p.a.
201 1/12 target The Board established a long-term minimum organic growth target of 5% representing the blended 
long-term average growth rate of our markets. This target remains appropriate to the Group’s 
achievement of an overall revenue and proﬁt objective of growing by 15% p.a. after acquisition revenue 
and proﬁt are taken into account. 
In order to meet the target of organic growth in excess of 5%, the Group will need to maintain its focus 
on innovation, people development and growth in Asia in order to ensure the momentum developed 
over recent years is retained.
The primary factors affecting our ability to meet the target relate to competitive innovations overtaking 
the Group’s technology and macro-economic factors.

The Health, Safety and Environmental markets in 
Asia and other developing regions are developing 
fast and offer us higher rates of growth in the 
future. We continue to invest in establishing local 
selling, technical and manufacturing resources 
to meet this current and future need.
We have maintained high levels of R&D 
investment and spending on innovation. 
The successful introduction of new products 
is a key contributor to the Group’s ability to build 
competitive advantage and grow organically 
and internationally.
We buy companies with business and market 
characteristics like Halma. They have to be a

in addition to being value-enhancing ﬁnancially.

Revenue outside the USA and UK/Europe was

Paciﬁc and Australasia up by 29%. Revenue from 
China grew by 28% to £24m which is now 4 times 
the level in 2006 when we established our ﬁrst 
Halma hubs. During 2010 we opened three new 
regional ofﬁces in China and doubled the number 
of local staff in our hub in India.
Total spend in the year was £26m (2010: £21m) 
exceeding the 4% of revenue target. All three 
sectors exceeded the 4% target both this year 
and last year.
We began the year with good ﬁnancial capacity 
with net cash and facilities in place to 
comfortably ﬁnance a further £100m of 
investment and we succeeded in buying a 
number of excellent companies during the year.
Our aim is for revenue outside the USA and  
UK/Europe to be 30% of the Group total by 2015.
Halma corporate hubs have been established in 
China and India to assist companies in setting up 
local operations. We will review our options for 
South America during 2011/12. 
New products contribute strongly to achieving 
organic growth, maintaining high returns and 
building strong market positions. The 4% 
minimum investment target is appropriate 
to the mix of product life cycles and technologies 
within Halma. 
The recently introduced HCAT development 
programme for engineers in the Group helps 
drive our technical and process innovation to 
fuel organic growth.
2011 ended with sufﬁcient ﬁnancial capacity 
to ﬁnance further acquisitions.
Such investment will be kept under close 
scrutiny to ensure market conditions remain 
appropriate and acquisition targets meet our 
exacting standards.

Comment High returns achieved representing a signiﬁcant 
improvement in performance against the 
previous year. This performance reﬂects both 
good management to ensure increases in ﬁxed 
and variable costs do not overtake revenue 
growth, and the quality of acquisitions.
High returns maintained in excess of our 
long-term Weighted Average Cost of Capital 
(WACC) of 8.5% (2010: 8.5%).
Earnings increased faster than our asset base 
due to good operational management and 
acquisitions at sensible values.
201 1/12 target We aim to achieve a Return on Sales within the 
18% to 22% range whilst continuing to deliver 
proﬁt growth. 
The target of 12% was set in 2005 when the 
Group’s ROTIC was 12.1% and WACC was 
7.9%. A range of 12% to 14% is considered 
representative of the Board’s expectations 
over the long term.

Very high returns above the target level achieved. 
The signiﬁcant increase in recent years is due to 
concerted efforts to improve proﬁtability and

Cash conversion of 108% was above the target, 
an excellent performance across the Group. 
The target of >45% is set in order to ensure the 
efﬁcient generation of cash at all levels to fund 
organic growth, closely targeted acquisitions 
and sustained dividend growth without Halma 
becoming a highly-leveraged group. 
The goal of cash inﬂow exceeding 100% is a 
metric that has relevance at all levels of the 
organisation and aligns management action 
with the strategic goals of organic growth, 
acquisitions and progressive dividends.

 proﬁt increased by 21% to 
£104.6m (2010: £86.2m), including strong 
underlying organic growth of 19%, and a 2% 
contribution from recent acquisitions. 
There was a minimal (<1%) positive impact 
on proﬁt and revenue growth due to 
currency exchange rate movements.
Revenue grew 13% to £518m (2010: £459m). 
Organic growth of 11% underlined the fact 
that our continued investment in 
management development, innovation and 
emerging markets is enabling us to achieve 
and sustain higher rates of growth. 
Acquisitions contributed 2% to growth.
Cash generation and operational 
management were excellent across the 
Group. We ended the year in a strong 
ﬁnancial position with net debt of £37m 
(2010: £9m net cash) after having spent 
£82m (2010: £2m) on acquisitions and 
paying a total of £33m (2010: £30m) to 
shareholders in dividends. We have core 
borrowing facilities of £165m in place until 
2013 and therefore have the capital 
resources available for further acquisitions 
in 2011/12, should we ﬁnd the right 
opportunities.
After a strong ﬁrst half year it was 
encouraging to see order intake growth 
momentum maintained throughout the 
second half, continuing to run slightly 
ahead of revenue, giving us a positive 
start to 2011/12.
Halma’s sustained high level of performance 
over the past four decades has been 
achieved through the commitment, 
innovation and excellence of our employees. 
However, I believe their achievements 
during the recent ﬁnancial downturn have 
been outstanding. I would like to thank all 
Halma employees for both their contribution 
to these successes and in ensuring that we 
are well placed to achieve even greater 
things in the future.
Record results and increased strategic investment
Halma has had a terriﬁc year , achieving strong organic growth and 
adding greater product and market strength to our existing business 
sectors through acquisitions. We are creating value for customers and 
shareholders in the short term, yet we are also increasing investment 
for growth in the future. We have a proven product, market and operational 
strategy which adapts as technology and mark et needs change.

Higher rates of return
Return on Sales
1
 increased to 20.2% 
(2010: 18.8%) reﬂecting excellent operational 
management across the Group, an 
impressive recovery in Industrial Safety and 
the increasing proportion of our revenue 
coming from the Health and Analysis sector. 
Our strategic objective is to operate in the 
18% to 22% range for Return on Sales and 
recent acquisitions support this goal.
All Halma companies are incentivised to 
deliver both proﬁt growth and high return 
on capital. This year, the average Return 
on Capital Employed
1
 of our operating 
companies increased to 71.9% (2010: 61.3%) 
demonstrating the strength of our 
operational management and the beneﬁts 
of decentralised, light-assembly 
manufacturing operations.
The combination of strong earnings growth, 
effective operational management and 
paying sensible prices for acquisitions 
resulted in Halma’s post-tax Return on 
Total Invested Capital improving to 15.5% 
(2010: 13.6%).
Growth in all regions and sectors
Revenue from the USA increased by 18% to 
£150m (2010: £127m) and Europe was up by 
2% to £138m (2010: £136m). We achieved 8% 
growth in the UK, which now represents just 
20% of total revenue at £106m (2010: £98m).
Revenue from outside our largest markets 
in Europe and the USA increased by 26% to 
£124m (2010: £98m), contributing 24% of the 
Group’s total. The strongest performance 
came from the Far East and Australasia 
region, which increased by 29%. China grew 
by 28% to £23.6m (2010: £18.4m).
Health and Analysis is now Halma’s 
largest sector
Health and Analysis performed strongly to 
become our largest sector. Revenue was up 
by 23% to £218m (2010: £178m) whilst proﬁt
2
 
was 33% higher at £46m (2010: £35m), 
representing 42% of the Group. All four 
sub-sectors increased revenue and proﬁt. 
Growth was stronger in the USA and UK 
than Mainland Europe, with revenue outside 
these core territories increasing by 34% to 
£53m (2010: £40m). Here Photonics, Fluid 
Technology and Health Optics made the 
major contributions whilst Water made 
greater progress in the developed countries. Halma p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011
13
Infrastructure Sensors made 
good progress
Our Infrastructure Sensor sector has 
continued to increase proﬁt throughout the 
downturn with demand largely driven by 
safety regulation globally and increasing 
urbanisation of population in developing 
countries. This year revenue was up by 8% 
to £197m (2010: £183m) whilst proﬁt
2
 grew 
by 10% to £39m (2010: £36m). Steady growth 
was achieved in the UK, USA and Mainland 
Europe with an encouraging 20% increase 
from outside these three regions. All four 
sub-sectors increased revenue and proﬁt. 
Elevator Safety and Door Sensors 
performed very well in the Far East and 
Australasia whilst our Security business 
made good progress in all regions, most 
notably in South Africa. Fire Detection had 
a positive year, especially in the USA.
Industrial Safety achieved high proﬁt 
growth and Return on Sales
Industrial Safety maintained the positive 
momentum it had coming into the year to 
deliver an excellent performance. Revenue 
improved by 5% to £103m (2010: £98m) 
whilst proﬁt
2
 grew by 20% to £25m (2010: 
£20m) giving a Return on Sales of 24%, 
the highest of our three sectors. All four 
sub-sectors increased proﬁt whilst all, 
except Safety Interlocks, grew revenue. 
Revenue grew steadily in the UK and USA. 
In Mainland Europe, there was a slight 
decline in revenue due to the non-repeat 
of a major order for Safety Interlocks 
last year although this was more than 
compensated for by 34% growth in the 
Far East and Australasia.
Clear strategic priorities
We aim to operate in global specialised 
markets offering long-term growth and 
establish strong market positions with 
products and technology that can sustain 
high returns. Our strategic priorities guide 
our activities and resource allocation at both 
a corporate and subsidiary company level 
ensuring a balance between organic and 
acquisition led growth in the medium term.
Organic growth
We aim to continue to deliver organic 
growth above the blended medium-term 
growth rates of our end markets, which 
we believe to be at least 5%. Over the past 
ﬁve years, the average of our annual organic 
growth rates has been 8% per annum 
(revenue) and 10% per annum (proﬁt) 
reﬂecting our ability to consistently 
outperform our markets by building 
sustainable competitive advantage through 
our products and customer service.
International expansion with a focus on Asia
Our strategic objective is for at least 30% of 
revenue to come from outside the UK, USA 
and Mainland Europe by 2015 (2011: 24%) 
and, by that time, for China to be 10% of the 
Group total (2011: 4.5%).
Since 2006, we have made a series of 
strategic central investments in China and 
India to accelerate the rate at which Halma 
subsidiaries can establish a local presence 
to design, sell and manufacture their 
products in these faster growth economies.
In the past year, we opened three new 
regional ofﬁces in China (Guangzhou, 
Chengdu and Shenyang), expanded our 
Door Sensor manufacturing facilities and 
acquired the assets of a Beijing based 
business to give us a local manufacturing 
base for our Fire Detection products.
In India, 10 companies now have a direct 
presence in our Halma hub in Mumbai 
compared with ﬁve at the start of the year. 
During the past year, revenue from India 
grew by 32% to £6.4m.
More Halma companies are investigating 
establishing a direct presence in South 
America. In the coming year, we will 
determine whether any central investment 
is appropriate to accelerate this process.
High rate of innovation
Product and process innovation enables us 
to build competitive advantage, gain market 
share and sustain high ﬁnancial returns. 
All Halma businesses measure the direct 
contribution of major innovations in their 
business each month and increasingly are 
collaborating more with each other to share 
best practice or ﬁnd new solutions to 
technical and operational problems. In May 
2011, we held our second Halma Innovation 
and Technology Exposition in Orlando, 
Florida. The focal point of HITE is a two-day 
exhibition where every Halma company 
exhibits transferrable technology and 
processes to each other. This ability to 
transfer state of the art technology from one 
sector to another is something most of our 
competitors simply don’t have.
Innovation excellence in Halma is recognised 
through the monthly Eureka award and the 
Halma Annual Innovation Award. Both are 
open to all employees, and award a top prize 
of £1,000 and £20,000 respectively.
The Halma Annual Innovation Award for 
2011 was won by an employee from Ocean 
Optics who developed a new way of testing 
products, resulting in superior product 
quality, faster lead times for customers 
and a £400,000 annual cost saving for the 
company. The runners-up included the 
Ricochet wireless security sensor system 
from Texecom and the Memcom elevator 
emergency telephone from Memco.
R&D expenditure in 2010/11 increased 
by 20% to £26m (2010: £21m), equivalent 
to 5% of revenue and well above our 
minimum spend target of 4% of revenue. 
R&D investment is greater in our higher 
technology businesses where the execution 
risk on new product development is higher 
too. In response to this challenge, we 
have established a training programme 
for our technical engineers called Halma 
Certiﬁcate in Applied Technology (HCAT). 
HCAT provides engineers with training 
in ﬁnance and project management as 
well as providing them with the opportunity 
to visit and network across other 
Halma companies.
Management development
Halma’s decentralised operating structure 
relies on local managers making good, 
timely decisions in the best interests of their 
business. R&D, manufacturing, sales and 
administrative resources are controlled 
locally where the intimate knowledge of 
market dynamics and customer needs 
resides. Strategic objectives, annual 
performance, goals and management 
incentives are aligned together with a real 
commitment to attract and develop high 
quality talent at all levels.
Halma offers a range of training 
programmes for employees including the 
Halma Executive Development Programme 
(HEDP), Halma Management Development 
Programme (HMDP) and Halma Certiﬁcate 
in Applied Technology (HCAT). During 
2010/11, over 130 employees attended these 
Halma-run programmes and many more 
beneﬁted from training provided by their 
subsidiary company. The value of this 
investment is shown both in our excellent

14 Directors’ Report Business Review Chief Executive’s Strategic Review continued
ﬁnancial performance and in succession 
planning. The latest example of the latter 
is the promotion of one of our US company 
Presidents, Dr Rob Randelman, to the 
Executive Board in April 2011.
In future, we recognise the need to increase 
the diversity of our management talent in 
order to meet the new challenges ahead. 
This objective will be integrated into a new 
management development strategy being 
implemented in early 2011/12.
Acquisitions, mergers and disposals
We look to buy companies with business 
and market characteristics like Halma. 
They have to be a good ﬁt with our operating 
culture and strategy in addition to being 
value-enhancing ﬁnancially. As the 
Group has grown, the average size of our 
transactions has increased. This remains 
in line with our increasing capacity and 
capability to successfully grow businesses 
of that larger size thereby not materially 
altering our risk proﬁle.
As expected, 2010/11 saw a pick-up in 
M&A activity globally and we successfully 
completed seven transactions spending 
a total of £82m (2010: £2m). Four of these 
were small bolt-on additions to existing 
Halma businesses adding new technology 
and local manufacturing or sales resources 
in Photonics, Water, Health Optics and 
Fire Detection.
We acquired three larger businesses, all 
within our Health and Analysis sector, which 
will operate as stand-alone companies. 
Within our Fluid Technology sub-sector we 
paid $26.3m for Alicat Scientiﬁc (Arizona, 
USA) in November 2010 and $24.8m for 
Accudynamics (Massachusetts, USA) in 
December 2010. In March 2011, we paid 
CHF70m for Medicel (Switzerland) who 
specialise in cataract lens injector devices 
and will operate within Health Optics. The 
Medicel deal includes an earn-out of up to 
CHF30m for achieving proﬁt growth targets 
over the next three years.
All these acquisitions are forecast to 
be earnings enhancing in year one. 
We are continuing to search for further 
acquisitions in Health and Analysis, 
Infrastructure Sensors and Industrial 
Safety and will be increasing resources 
to search for opportunities.
Our strategic objective is to grow our 
businesses organically and through 
acquisitions but maintain our ﬂat 
organisational structure and devolved 
management approach. Consequently, 
in addition to acquiring businesses, we also 
consider internal mergers or divestment. 
Our success in this active management 
of our portfolio is demonstrated by the fact 
that since the start of ﬁnancial year 2005/06, 
our proﬁt has more than doubled, yet the 
number of principal operating companies 
has reduced from 44 to 38.
Macro-economic, regulatory 
and competitive environment
Our expectation at the start of 2010/11 
was that the stability and slow recovery 
which had returned in Europe and the USA 
in late 2009 would be maintained as 
would the higher rate of growth enjoyed 
in developing economies. This was broadly 
borne out with our predominant focus in 
Europe on Northern markets providing 
some insulation from the economic 
problems in countries in Southern Europe.
Many Halma businesses have products 
where demand is driven by relatively 
non-discretionary customer spend and 
all beneﬁt from strong market positions 
providing upgrade and replacement sales 
opportunities. All these factors give us 
genuine resilience in tough economic 
conditions and enable us to achieve organic 
growth well above the market rate.
Increasingly environmental, health and 
safety regulation in our markets creates a 
relatively robust demand for our products 
and enables us to invest for the longer term 
with conﬁdence. Global, regional and 
national product approvals or technical 
validations are an increasing cost and 
technical challenge, but also allow us to 
build competitive advantage too. Many of our 
businesses have a presence on industry 
representative bodies, enabling them to 
inﬂuence and anticipate new market trends.
We serve a wide range of market niches, 
each with its own unique competitive 
environment. Our strategy is to empower 
local management to create or respond to 
their changing markets by controlling their 
own competitive strategy including product 
pricing, product development and market 
positioning. More details are given in the 
sector reviews on pages 26 to 37 .
Our primary market 
growth drivers
Halma’s strategy is to develop market 
positions with a horizon of 10 years or more. 
Growth strategies within our individual 
operating businesses tend to have three 
to ﬁve-year horizons.
Our selected markets must have robust 
growth drivers with the potential for organic 
growth at rates well above background 
GDP growth. 
All of our businesses operate in markets 
underpinned by at least one of the following 
growth drivers:
Increasing demand for healthcare
Three key demographic trends underpin 
the increasing demand for healthcare: 
population ageing in developed economies, 
and population growth and increasing 
afﬂuence in the developing world. Demand 
for healthcare services and health-related 
products drives growth in our Health and 
Analysis markets.
Spending on healthcare continues to grow 
rapidly throughout the developed world, 
particularly in the USA where it is projected 
to rise from about 17 .5% of GDP in 2010 
to about 20% by 2020.
3
Population growth and rising incomes in 
the developing world also drive healthcare 
demand. The world’s population is also 
ageing. Globally, the number of people 
over 60 years old is growing annually by 
2.6%, considerably faster than the general 
population growth of 1.2%.
4
Population ageing creates rising healthcare 
needs and, as incomes rise, health services 
become available to an increasing number 
of people in the developing world. In China, 
for example, the healthcare budget will have 
increased threefold between 2000 and 
2015.
5
 Continuous advances in medical 
technology create new medical procedures, 
which also stimulate demand for new 
instruments and equipment.
Increasing demand for energy and water
Throughout the world rising energy 
consumption and water usage is driven by 
three key trends: population growth; rising 
living standards; and changing patterns of 
food consumption and agriculture. In many  Halma p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011
15
economies energy and water supply are 
mutually dependent. In the USA for example, 
the energy sector’s water consumption is 
forecast to rise by 50% from 2005 to 2030. 
This will account for 85% of the country’s 
total increase in water demand.
6
Worldwide consumption of marketed 
energy is projected to increase by 49% 
from 2007 to 2035 with the highest 
increase in non-OECD economies.
7
 
While water demand rises relentlessly, 
both the quality and availability of clean 
water is declining.
8,9
 Contaminated water 
is the primary environmental cause of 
human sickness and death.
10
Several of our Health and Analysis 
businesses are positioned to beneﬁt from 
the global trend of rising demand for energy 
and water. In both developed and developing 
regions we see increasing competition for 
water resources between economic groups 
and between national governments.
11
 The 
increasing value placed on water resources 
drives demand for our water conservation, 
treatment and quality analysis products. 
Continued investment in oil and gas 
exploration and extraction drives demand 
for our Industrial Safety products.
12
Increasing urbanisation
Current expectations for continued global 
population expansion predict growth from 
today’s population of about 7 billion people 
to 9 billion by 2050.
13
 In many developed 
economies, such as Europe and Japan, 
falling birth rates mean that population 
numbers will decline; future global 
population growth will be concentrated in 
developing countries.
14
 Population increase 
will also be an almost entirely urban 
phenomenon. The world’s urban population 
is expected to increase by 84% between 
2009 and 2050; Asia’s urban population 
is predicted to grow by 1.7 billion, Africa’s 
by 0.8 billion, and Latin America and the 
Caribbean’s by 0.2 billion.
15
Urbanisation drives investment in non-
residential buildings like shops, ofﬁces, 
schools and hospitals, the primary market 
for our Infrastructure Sensors businesses, 
while it also requires investment in utilities 
such as Water, one of our target markets 
in Health and Analysis.
Increasing health and safety regulation
According to the International Labour 
Organisation about 2.3 million people die 
each year from work-related accidents and 
diseases. This comprises almost 360,000 
fatal accidents and an estimated 1.95 million 
fatal work-related diseases. By the end of 
each day nearly 1 million workers will have 
suffered a workplace accident, and around 
5,500 people will die due to a work-related 
accident or disease.
In addition to the human cost, workplace 
accidents and sickness restrain economic 
development. Taking account of the direct 
and indirect costs of occupational accidents 
and diseases, such as lost working time, 
employee compensation, production 
downtime and medical expenses, the 
economic impact is estimated at around 
4% of global GDP (US$1.25tn).
16
Throughout the world, governments are 
requiring employers to comply with 
increasingly strict laws and regulations 
to protect workers from workplace hazards. 
In parallel with government regulations, 
many multinational employers based in the 
developed world are extending health and 
safety protocols to developing regions. This 
combination of increasing safety regulation 
and globalisation drives demand for our 
Industrial Safety and Infrastructure 
Sensors products.
Delivering corporate 
responsibility and sustainability
Our primary market growth drivers mean 
that Halma companies operate in markets 
in which their products contribute positively 
to the wider community. These market 
characteristics and our commitment to 
health and safety, the environment and 
people development are reﬂected in the 
values held by our employees and our 
operating culture. We review our 
responsibility and sustainability reporting 
in accordance with best practice. Recent 
legislative changes, particularly concerning 
the environment and bribery and corruption, 
have provided an opportunity to review 
and ensure that our procedures in these 
important areas are accessible, compliant 
and ﬁrmly embedded within our businesses.
A detailed report on Corporate 
Responsibility is on pages 44 to 47 .
Outlook
In 2010/11 we achieved our objective 
of signiﬁcant organic growth and higher 
rates of return. We made substantial 
investments in acquiring businesses 
and developing new products and markets. 
This will remain a strategic focus for 
the year ahead to ensure we continue 
to position the Group’s activities into 
markets offering growth and high returns.
We are pleased with the momentum we 
have coming into 2011/12 and are looking 
forward to making further good progress 
in the year ahead.

Adding value through acquisitions
Higher growth 
mark ets
Since 2005 we have reshaped 
our business. We have moved into 
markets with higher growth potential 
which can sustain higher margins 
and exited from markets with 
unattractive growth prospects. 
We have achieved growth combined with increased 
returns by giving high priority to M&A activity. Since 2005 
we have bought 18 businesses and sold 12. We acquired 
businesses in our existing markets or closely allied 
sectors, with strong, long-term growth prospects. 
We sold businesses where market growth was uncertain, 
where competition was increasing and where mature 
technologies could not sustain high returns. Over the 
past six years we have grown revenue by 73% and 
Return on Sales (ROS) has risen; all three sectors 
now have ROS above 18% and overall ROS is over 20%.

Recent acquisitions have 
focused on our Health 
and Analysis sector .
 
Alicat
We acquired Alicat Scientiﬁc, Inc. in 
November 2010. It makes precision 
instruments which measure and 
control the ﬂow of gases in analytical 
and life sciences industries such as 
pharmaceuticals. Alicat’s secondary 
market is specialised industrial processes. 
The company shares many customers with 
our existing Fluid Technology businesses.
Accudynamics
Accudynamics LLC, which we bought 
in December 2010, makes components 
used in scientiﬁc and medical analysis 
systems such as in vitro diagnostics. 
Accudynamics is a good ﬁt with our other 
Fluid Technology businesses and enables 
us to offer OEM customers integrated 
sub-assemblies which incorporate 
components from different Halma 
ﬂuidics companies.
Medicel
In March 2011 we bought Medicel AG. 
This extended our interests in the 
ophthalmic surgical instrument market. 
Medicel is a leader in very high precision 
surgical instruments that inject 
replacement lenses into the eyes of people 
suffering from cataracts. Cataracts are 
the leading cause of treatable blindness, 
with approximately 15 million surgeries 
performed annually. There is a migration 
towards the specialist instruments made 
by Medicel because they allow surgeons 
to make a smaller incision which leads 
to improved patient safety and outcomes. Halma p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011

What is  
photonics?
Photonics is basically about how we make 
use of light. It is the science of generating, 
controlling and detecting light. Light 
lets us see, but it can also transmit data 
and control electronic equipment. 
While electronic devices communicate 
via electricity using electrons, 
photonics devices use photons, 
the fundamental ‘particles’ of light.
So many of the products we rely on 
are made using photonics components 
and principles. Light bulbs, TVs, digital 
cameras, cell phones, PDAs, the internet 
and computers all depend on the science 
of photonics and components that emit 
or measure light. Halma businesses 
match the science of photonics with 
products that solve customers’ problems.
Every aspect 
of our lives 
Photonics products are crucial to 
many cutting-edge areas of science 
and technology, often involving lasers, 
optics, ﬁbre optics and hybrid electro-
optical devices. The range of photonics 
applications is huge. Photonics devices 
play a major role in scientiﬁc research 
and medicine, and technology used 
in manufacture, lighting, communications, 
defence, aerospace, environmental 
monitoring, security, safety and 
consumer electronics.
Real  
or fake ? 
The ability to measure the quality 
of light which materials reﬂect, absorb 
or transmit, can tell us a lot about the 
world we live in. In Beijing Antique City, 
China, nationally renowned antiques 
appraiser Guan Haisen uses our 
spectrometers to tell genuine 
ceramics from fakes.
Which Halma 
sub-sectors use 
photonics?
In Infrastructure Sensors, our 
Fire Detection, Security Sensors, 
Automatic Door Sensors and 
Elevator Safety products all use a variety 
of optical technologies. In Health and 
Analysis, our Water products, Health 
Optics products and our Photonics 
businesses use light and optics within 
their products. In our Industrial Safety 
sector our Gas Detection and Asset 
Monitoring businesses use optics and 
imaging technologies.
Water on the 
moon ?
Our photonics products helped 
NASA to discover that there really 
is water on the moon in the form 
of ice crystals. NASA deliberately 
crashed a rocket carrying scientiﬁc 
instruments into the Moon’s surface 
and our spectrometer analysed the 
light to reveal the presence of water . Halma p.l.c.  Annual   Report  and  Accounts  2011

Our photonics markets 
and applications
What photonics 
products do 
we make?
We make products that generate and 
capture light, transmit light, analyse 
light and change light to deliver desired 
optical characteristics.
Ocean Optics makes instruments that 
analyse light. When something is hit 
by light it either reflects the light, emits 
energy, absorbs the light or does all 
three. Our spectrometer instruments 
record how light reacts with a sample 
which reveals what the sample is made 
of. Applications include scientific analysis, 
space research, medical diagnostics and 
environmental monitoring.
Fiberguide makes fibre optic products 
that transmit light carrying digital data. 
These are strands of glass thinner than 
a human hair sometimes coated with 
aluminium or gold to add strength or 
temperature resistance. 
Building our 
presence in 
photonics
We acquired Ocean Optics, a world-leading 
photonics business based in Florida, USA, 
in 2004 for £28m. Since then we have 
acquired a series of stand-alone and 
bolt-on photonics businesses and spent 
another £28m in acquisitions to generate 
a sub-sector within our Health and 
Analysis sector which generates around 
£73m of revenue.

Fiberguide manufactures the raw ﬁbre 
and produces assemblies that carry 
the energy from a light source to the 
point of use or transmit information 
from a test sample to a detector 
or analyser . Applications include 
photodynamic therapy, ophthalmology, 
laser delivery systems, industrial 
process control, illumination, remote 
sensing and smoke detection.
Labsphere is a world leader in capturing 
emitted light for analysis. They make high 
precision test chambers internally coated 
with highly reﬂective material. Customers 
include some of the world’s largest 
consumer electronics manufacturers 
and leading research scientists.
Ocean Thin Films specialises in changing 
light. They deposit coatings on glass 
or plastic which behave like ﬁlters, 
separating speciﬁc wavelengths of light. 
Applications include colour wheels 
for projecting light and coatings 
for surgical lamps.
Positioned to 
beneﬁt from fast 
growth in the LEDs 
market
Our businesses are world leaders 
in devices that capture light so that it 
can be measured. Our products enable 
the energy output and colour spectrum 
of light sources to be analysed with 
extraordinary accuracy. 
These systems are used to check quality 
in the manufacture of LED light ﬁxtures 
and electronic consumer products such 
as TVs, cameras and mobile phones.
The LED market is moving from niche 
to high volume. Market forecasts for the 
high brightness LED market suggest that 
applications such as backlights for LCD 
TVs and solid-state lighting will grow faster 
than 50% per year over the next ﬁve years. 
The global high brightness LED market is 
projected to grow at almost 30% per year 
between 2010 and 2014.
Photonics – 
the new 
electronics
Almost any physical or environmental 
parameter can be measured using 
light and the applications for photonics 
are growing all of the time. The areas 
where we expect exciting growth are 
photonics applications in remote sensing, 
biotechnology, medicine and other 
life sciences. Many people believe that 
photonics will be the fundamental 
transforming technology of the 21st 
century in the same way that electronics 
was the key technological development 
in the last century.

Management development
Our people play a vital role in delivering quality 
and growth. We have worked to develop a more 
collaborative, interactive, knowledge-sharing 
organisation consisting of many formal and informal 
cross-subsidiary networks.
In 2005 we initiated the Halma Executive 
Development Programme (HEDP) and subsequently 
the Halma Management Development Programme 
(HMDP) and the Halma Certiﬁcate in Applied 
T echnology (HCAT). These programmes bring 
together senior and middle management and 
engineers respectively from across subsidiaries 
and disciplines, develop their talents and encourage 
future communication and collaboration.

In 2009 we held our ﬁrst Halma 
Innovation & Technology Exposition 
(HITE) in London in order to improve 
cross-subsidiary communication, 
collaboration and innovation. 
We held a second HITE in Orlando 
in 2011, providing opportunities to 
cement relationships developed at 
the ﬁrst HITE and during training, in 
addition to showcasing new products 
and sharing innovative technologies 
and best practices.
Networks have developed throughout 
Halma for many disciplines from 
Human Resources to Operations.

International expansion 
with a focus on Asia
Global  
expansion
Investment in international expansion has 
been a key strategic priority since 2005. 
A speciﬁc aim has been to grow the proportion 
of sales from emerging markets where we can 
achieve higher revenue growth rates than in more 
mature markets. In the past year we grew sales 
outside of Europe and the USA to 24% of total 
revenue, taking us towards our target of at least 
30% by 2015. 
We have focused on Asia and aim that China alone 
will account for 10% of total revenue within four 
years. This year , we invested around £1m in three 
new regional ofﬁces with centrally-funded regional 
sales people. We are investing in expanded R&D 
and manufacturing so that we can design, make 
and sell appropriate products for the market. 
In India 10 of our businesses now have people based 
in our centrally-funded hub in Mumbai, ﬁve more 
than a year ago. Revenue from India grew by 32% 
during 2010/1 1.
Now that many of our companies have thriving 
operations in China and India, we are turning our 
attention to South America. Our Health Optics 
businesses have already set up a shared service 
centre in São Paulo, Brazil. Halma p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Water
World leader in products 
to detect leaks in water 
pipes; among the world 
leaders in UV technology 
for disinfecting water; and 
water quality test kits. 
Photonics
Market leading 
opto-electronic 
technology for scientiﬁc, 
medical, environmental 
and other applications.
Water
Market trends and growth drivers
A combination of water scarcity and 
pressure on ﬁnite water resources drives 
demand across our Water sub-sector. 
Capital investment in water infrastructure 
decreased during the global recession, but 
a return to pre-crisis growth is expected 
with global water capital expenditure 
projected to increase by 6% per year from 
2010 to 2016
1
. Spending on non-chemical 
water disinfection technologies, such as UV, 
is expected to grow even faster
2
.
In the UK a new ﬁve-year regulatory cycle 
of water infrastructure investment began 
in April 2010. This allowed utilities to 
increase capital spending and delivered 
a stimulus that will support sales growth 
of our network monitoring and control 
instrumentation
3
.
Strategy
We plan to increase market share in 
drinking water and waste water network 
management instruments. In the water 
leakage instrumentation market our 
strategy is to maintain world leadership 
through continuous technological innovation 
and geographic expansion. We made 
progress in reducing our Water businesses’ 
dependency on UK government-regulated 
infrastructure spending cycles with 
double-digit export sales growth.
To broaden exposure to the NGO-funded 
water analysis market, and increase market 
share in Africa and Asia, in March 2011 we 
acquired the Water Technology Division of 
Wagtech International Limited, a distributor 
of water testing kits.
Performance
Continued investment in R&D and people 
development within our Water businesses 
delivered good increases in revenue and 
proﬁt. 
Outlook
We expect continued expansion of the 
global markets for our water products. 
Growth is underpinned by increasing 
regulation to protect water supply security 
and drinking water quality, plus 
environmental regulation of wastewater 
discharge and management
4
. Capital 
investment by UK utilities will increase 
for the next two years
3
. Water sector sales 
growth in China is variable but increased 
regional sales resources and the stimulus 
of increasing regulation
5,6
 will deliver faster 
growth in the medium term.
Photonics
Market trends and growth drivers
Demand strengthened in several Photonics 
niches during 2010/11. The US spectroscopy 
market is forecast to continue to grow by 6% 
per year to at least 2014
7
 whilst annual 
growth of 29.5% is predicted for the LED 
lighting market
8
.
Photonics demand proved resilient in 
2010/11 despite cuts to US federal budgets. 
Any future impact of lower US government 
spending will be offset by growth in 
emerging economies and new technology.
Strategy
In Photonics our primary strategy is to 
reinforce technological leadership in our 
niche markets and expand geographical 
sales, particularly in Asia. High R&D 
investment is required to maintain market 
leadership in advanced technologies. 
While development risks can be relatively 
high, we often achieve rapid payback from 
technological innovation. Novel products 
with unique user beneﬁts targeted at 
fast-growing market sectors command 
high sales margins.
We continue to seek value-enhancing 
acquisitions in our existing and closely 
allied Photonics niches. Halma p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011
28 Directors’ Report Business Review Sector Reviews: Health and Analysis continued
Performance
Our Photonics business comfortably 
exceeded all sectoral KPI targets delivering 
record revenue and proﬁt. Reﬂecting the 
rapid pace of technological innovation in 
this sub-sector, Photonics R&D spending 
was over 7% of sales. Successful integration 
of the SphereOptics business, acquired 
in January 2010 continued.
Outlook
We expect further growth from new product 
launches in 2011 and we should beneﬁt 
from the high growth forecast for the 
solid-state low energy lighting (LED) 
market
8
. Strong Asian sales growth should 
continue and we expect increasing returns 
from our Chinese photonics manufacturing 
investments. In the USA and Europe, 
governments will cut spending in 2012 and 
we expect lower sales growth in these 
regions than seen in 2010/11. 
Health Optics
Market trends and growth drivers
New diagnostic and therapeutic 
technologies, ageing populations and 
greater access to healthcare in the 
developing world continued to drive growth 
in our Health Optics markets. In the USA, 
the largest ophthalmic market, annual 
growth of 3% to 4% is forecast
9
 over the 
next ﬁve years.
We expect strong growth in South East 
Asia as governments increase healthcare 
investment. The Chinese market for 
medical devices was estimated to 
have grown by over 13% during 2010
10
. 
Even in developing markets, increasingly 
stringent, complex and costly medical 
product certiﬁcation procedures create 
strong market entry barriers which 
favour our market-leading brands.
Strategy
Geographic expansion remains key to our 
Health Optics growth strategy with a strong 
focus on South East Asia, China, India and 
Latin America. Recently we set up a health 
optics sales and distribution company in 
São Paulo, Brazil. We acquired a key US 
distributor in March 2011 to grow sales in 
North America at a faster rate.
R&D is focused on projects to develop 
instruments marketed to existing 
customers. We are broadening health 
optics product lines with new products 
to maximise the value of our highly 
developed sales channels. A new family 
of ophthalmic diagnostic products, due 
for launch in 2011, has been created by 
collaborative R&D between two of our 
Health Optics businesses.
Performance
In Health Optics we achieved record sales 
and proﬁt. Sales growth was particularly 
strong in South East Asia.
Outlook
We expect our Health Optics businesses 
to continue to grow ahead of their markets. 
Growth will come from export channel 
investment, market expansion in South East 
Asia and Latin America and new products. 
We expect the newly acquired Medicel 
business to continue its recent growth 
trajectory as their OEM customers grow 
and as demand for their market-leading 
cataract surgery instruments increases.

Fluid T echnology
Market trends and growth drivers
We saw continued growth in the medical 
diagnostic sector despite customer 
consolidation leading to some pricing 
pressure. A continuous stream of new 
diagnostic tests developed by our OEM 
customers drives growth in the medical 
instrumentation market. Predictive 
medicine, in particular analysis of genetic 
DNA sequences, offers good sales 
prospects and this niche could deliver 5% of 
total ﬂuid technology sales during 2011/12. 
The scientiﬁc analysis market stabilised and 
returned to modest growth.
Strategy
The key strategic direction for our US-based 
Fluid Technology businesses is geographic 
diversiﬁcation in line with their customer 
base. They will become less US-centric 
by expanding sales in Europe and Asia.
With the acquisition of Alicat Scientiﬁc 
and Accudynamics, our ﬂuid technology 
target markets have broadened and 
our potential acquisition pool is larger. 
Alicat gives us greater exposure to the 
scientiﬁc analysis market, particularly 
laboratories and niche industrial 
applications. Accudynamics consolidates 
our position in clinical diagnostics, and 
gives us a platform to offer customers 
more complete ﬂuidic assemblies.
We began to manufacture ﬂuidics 
components in China during 2010 which has 
underpinned entry into the Chinese market.
Performance
Our Fluid T echnology businesses achieved 
record organic sales and proﬁt growth. 
All Fluid Technology companies achieved 
record sales in China.
Outlook
The scientiﬁc analysis market is recovering 
post-recession albeit at a slower rate than 
medical markets. With enlarged sales 
teams and expanded product offerings 
we expect continued growth in the Fluid 
Technology sub-sector. Recent R&D 
investment will also grow market share 
and enable entry to more non-US markets.

Fire Detection
Market trends and growth drivers
Legislation remains the strongest growth 
driver in the Fire Detection market. 
Standards governing the installation, 
maintenance and servicing of ﬁre products 
are extensive and may differ even within a 
single country at national, regional and city 
level. As the European Union enlarges, the 
newly admitted states will be governed by 
EU ﬁre codes creating a growing, 
regulation-driven market.
A combination of increasingly strict 
legislation, new technology and a slight 
recovery in building construction is 
expected to stimulate ﬁre industry growth 
in 2011 after reduced capital investment 
during the recession
1
. Asia is expected to 
deliver signiﬁcant growth; amendments to 
China’s ﬁre laws have stimulated demand 
with market expansion estimated at 12.9% 
per year between 2009 and 2014
2
.
Strategy
Our primary strategy in Fire Detection is 
world leadership in safety-critical sensor 
products for infrastructure monitoring in 
commercial buildings. Our market-leading 
products eliminate hazards and protect 
buildings and their occupants.
Investment in international Fire Detection 
product approvals and innovation in new 
products and technology platforms will 
continue to underwrite market share 
growth, competitive advantage and good 
margins. Further investment in our 
businesses and extension of sales coverage 
in emerging markets will aid organic 
growth. We will continue to seek 
acquisitions that enhance our product and 
geographical strength.
Performance
Fire Detection achieved record revenue and 
proﬁt. Despite challenging market 
conditions, we grew market share strongly 
in the UK and made signiﬁcant gains in 
Europe. We continue to innovate and launch 
exciting new products.
Outlook
We anticipate a continuation of current 
demand trends for Fire Detection in the 
short to medium term as many economies 
gradually recover from recession. Our 
businesses are positioned to gain market 
share due to technology leadership, our 
portfolio of worldwide product approvals 
and penetration of new regional markets.
Security Sensors
Market trends and growth drivers
After two years of recession, demand for 
intruder sensors is forecast to return to 
growth during 2011 with strongest demand 
in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia
3
.
Improved sensor technologies are driving 
upgrades to intruder detection systems and 
the trend towards integration of building 
management systems. The commercial 
intruder alarm market is migrating to 
wireless technology. Almost one-third of 
our security sensor revenue growth in 
2010/11 came from new battery-powered 
wireless products. Halma p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011
32 Directors’ Report Business Review Sector Reviews: Infrastructure Sensors continued
Strategy
In Security Sensors our growth strategy 
centres on reducing exposure to the UK 
by increasing sales in Europe, the Middle 
East and Africa together with long-term 
investment in India and China. We will 
continue to increase the proportion of 
non-residential sales with new wireless 
products targeted at commercial 
customers.
Our two Security Sensors businesses which 
make intruder sensors and hazard signalling 
products were successfully consolidated 
into a single company. Direct sales 
operations were set up in India and China.
Performance
Our Security Sensors business achieved 
double-digit increases in both revenue and 
proﬁt. We delivered strong market share 
growth despite ﬂat or receding markets in 
many of the countries where we operate. 
We made progress in reducing dependence 
on the UK market. During 2010/11, UK sales 
were less than half of total revenue for the 
ﬁrst time.
Outlook
Supported by a return to growth in the 
global intrusion alarm market, we anticipate 
further growth from Security Sensors 
based on geographic expansion, particularly 
in Asia, extending market share in Europe 
and positive customer response to our 
recently launched and upcoming advanced 
intrusion detection technology.
Automatic Door Sensors
Market trends and growth drivers
Legislation to enhance the safety and 
security of people continues to drive growth 
in our niche Automatic Door Sensors 
markets. Although we continue to forecast 
medium-term annual expansion in our core 
business of 3% to 4%, we expect higher 
growth in Asia.
We continued to diversify into industrial, 
transport and security markets supported 
by increased R&D and marketing spending. 
Investment in market-leading levels of 
product quality, reliability, service and 
product development has enabled us to win 
new customers in our core and diversiﬁed 
markets. We see considerable growth 
prospects in the transport sector.
Strategy
Our core strategy in Automatic Door 
Sensors is to maintain market leadership 
in pedestrian door sensors and diversify 
further into industrial doors, security and 
transportation applications. We continue 
to seek complementary acquisitions.
Implementation of lean manufacturing 
and improved logistics will increase 
competitiveness via improved customer 
service. Our unique laser scanner sensor 
products will ensure global technology 
leadership and assist market diversiﬁcation.
Performance
We achieved a very strong performance 
in Automatic Door Sensors with record 
revenue and proﬁt. We completed a 
signiﬁcant management reorganisation 
to support future growth. Revenue growth 
was strongest in Asia. Almost one-third 
of the workforce in this sub-sector is now 
based in China.
Outlook
Increasing safety regulation will continue 
to drive door sensor growth.
4
 Our strategy 
of developing innovative new technologies, 
extending global reach and investing in 
market diversiﬁcation has created a strong 
growth platform.
Automatic Door Sensors 
World leader in sensors 
used on automatic 
doors in public and 
commercial buildings.
China’ s stricter ﬁre regulations
At China’s 1 1th National People’s Congress 
the country’s leaders announced major 
changes to national ﬁre laws which came 
into force in May 2009. The stricter laws, 
which increase ﬁre safety liabilities for 
enterprises, are predicted to have a 
signiﬁcant impact on attitudes towards ﬁre 
safety and the way in which ﬁre detection 
equipment is used in Chinese buildings. 
Analysts predict that the Chinese market 
for ﬁre detection and suppression 
products will grow at a compound 
annual growth rate of about 13% from 
2009 to 2014.

Elevator Safety
Market trends and growth drivers
Western countries account for the majority 
of the installed elevator customer base. 
Here, demand for our safety products 
depends on building modernisation and 
elevator upgrades driven by legislation. 
The Asian elevator market, in contrast, is 
mainly driven by new elevator installations. 
China is now the world’s largest installer of 
new elevators and accounts for about 60% 
of all new elevator projects. Social housing 
is the largest segment of the Chinese 
market, forecast to grow signiﬁcantly in 
2011 fuelled by government investment
6
.
The competitive environment in the 
Elevator Safety market is changing as we 
face stronger competition from Chinese 
manufacturers in global markets. A rigorous 
and continuous cost reduction programme 
will maintain competitiveness and protect 
margins. European demand has been 
steady, driven by stronger safety regulations 
while US markets have been ﬂat.
Strategy
In contrast to other Halma sub-sectors, 
R&D and marketing activity among our 
Elevator Safety businesses is closely 
co-ordinated within a global business 
framework. Our three elevator companies 
sell the products of their sister businesses 
within their regional markets. Our core 
growth strategy in Elevator Safety is 
to increase investment in new products 
and expand global sales channels.
Performance
Elevator Safety performance improved 
due to more favourable market conditions 
and a return to growth at our Asian 
business. We saw growth in both sales and 
proﬁt. Our elevator emergency telephone 
product line achieved high UK market share 
with a number of signiﬁcant customer 
conversions.
Outlook
Global demand for Elevator Safety products 
is forecast to rise by over 4% annually 
at least until 2013. China will account for 
over half of all new demand, while Western 
Europe remains the largest market for 
modernisation
7
. Outside Asia, demand is 
expected to be ﬂat but we expect to maintain 
growth momentum from market share 
gains and new technology.
In the medium term we anticipate that 
the Chinese authorities will adopt 
European standards for elevator safety. 
These standards favour our market-leading 
elevator door control sensors and 
monitored emergency telephones.

Market focus
Intruder alarms go wireless
Wireless intruder alarms use radio waves 
in place of cables to communicate 
between the control panel and the security 
sensors. Wireless security products 
are more expensive than hard-wired 
equivalents but, because there are 
no cabling costs, wireless systems 
can be less costly overall.
Our new RICOCHET system is based on 
mesh network technology. This means 
that intruder sensors can communicate 
with their control panel by sending signals 
to any other sensor in the network. 
If the wireless connection between two 
devices weakens, the network ‘self-heals’ 
and automatically re-routes signals 
via other devices.

Gas Detection
Market trends and growth drivers
Fixed and portable Gas Detection 
equipment is increasingly required in 
industrial workplaces for compliance with 
health and safety regulations. In addition to 
our core oil & gas and chemicals markets, 
we see expanding sales opportunities in 
monitoring commercial buildings, conﬁned 
space working and wastewater treatment
1
.
The worldwide market for Gas Detection 
products is expected to grow by 3% to 4% 
annually at least until 2013
2
. We have seen 
demand grow strongly in China, India and 
South America and there are indicators 
of recovery from the 2009 recession in 
global markets such as power generation, 
offshore oil, utilities and chemical 
processing. We anticipate fastest growth 
from the Asia Paciﬁc region. Key market 
drivers in Asia are the increasing pace of 
industrialisation and adoption of Western 
safety standards by emerging economies
1
.
Strategy
In Gas Detection our strategic focus is to 
increase competitive advantage and gain 
market share by continuous technical 
upgrading and extension of our portable 
gas detectors. We will continue to invest in 
manufacturing, marketing and development 
resources to maintain market-leading 
customer service.
Geographic expansion, particularly 
penetration of markets in North and South 
America, and Asia, will support our strategic 
objective of increasing sales ahead of 
underlying market growth.
Performance
We achieved record Gas Detection sales 
and proﬁt in 2010/11, with solid market 
share gains across all trading territories.
Outlook
The outlook for Gas Detection is for good 
growth underpinned by resilient legislative 
growth drivers in industrial safety markets. 
The launch of innovative new products 
during 2011/12 will support this objective.
Bursting Disks
Market trends and growth drivers
Our Bursting Disks are sold into industrial 
manufacturing and process industry 
markets where increasing regulation and 
rising expectations of health and safety 
drive demand. A rising oil price and greater 
safety awareness during 2010/11 stimulated 
increased petrochemical capital spending 
by government-owned oil companies and 
created opportunities for sales growth
3
. 
Strategy
Our core Bursting Disks strategy is to build 
on growth in our core industry sectors and 
home markets by diversifying and 
expanding our customer base. We will 
increase sales resources beyond Europe 
and North America, particularly in Asia 
and South America. We will diversify into 
medical instrumentation, energy 
exploration and other new health and 
safety applications.
We will enhance competitiveness through 
advanced manufacturing processes 
and extend collaboration between our 
businesses to add new technologies.  Halma p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011
36 Directors’ Report Business Review Sector Reviews Industrial Safety continued
Performance
Increasing demand from the process 
industries, combined with upgraded 
products, delivered a return to solid 
organic growth in line with historic levels. 
Our Bursting Disks businesses achieved 
double-digit revenue increases and 
major expansion in developing economies. 
Asia Paciﬁc sales almost doubled. 
Outlook
We expect to maintain momentum in 
the medium term in our core geographic 
and industrial markets. Our strategy 
of differentiating ourselves from the 
competition through product innovation 
and service will support expansion into 
non-process industries and OEM markets. 
Safety Interlocks
Market trends and growth drivers
We sell Safety Interlocks into two distinct 
global industrial markets: machine safety 
and process valve control. In both markets 
growth is driven by health and safety 
regulation and the gradual adoption of more 
stringent safety protocols by the emerging 
economies. 
During 2010/11, demand from machine 
safety grew faster than valve control. This 
resulted from continuing industrial growth 
in Asia pulling through investment in raw 
material extraction, switchgear installation 
and infrastructure. Despite the high oil 
price, the main driver in the valve control 
sector is new reﬁning capacity construction 
and refurbishment which remained muted.
Geographically, we saw lower safety 
interlock sales in Europe, a strong recovery 
in the USA and the highest growth in the 
rest of the world.
Strategy
In Safety Interlocks, we will maintain 
our high market share by focusing on 
customers’ needs, applications engineering 
support and product quality. We will 
continue to extend sales and manufacturing 
resources in developing markets and 
expand our manufacturing hub in China. 
In addition, the acquisition of Kirk Key 
Interlock Company in May 2011 strengthens 
our market position in the USA.
Performance
Our Safety Interlocks businesses delivered 
increased proﬁt. Revenue was slightly 
lower than last year due to the non-repeat 
of a major order for an end customer in 
South America. The underlying revenue 
growth trends remained positive. 
Manufacture of safety interlocks in China 
increased signiﬁcantly to enable fast 
delivery to Asian customers. 
Outlook
We anticipate strong growth from the power 
generation and mining sectors but ﬂat 
demand from oil & gas reﬁning. We should 
beneﬁt from continuing growth of the 
Chinese economy. We expect to develop and 
introduce more diverse safety products to 
expand sales opportunities.

Market focus
State oil companies drive 
market growth
Market analysts are reporting a rise in the 
relative importance of state oil companies 
in comparison to private oil producers. 
The oil and gas market has seen a marked 
split in investment behaviour with 
state-owned oil companies gearing up 
capital investment but independent oil 
producers behaving more cautiously. 
Recent capital spending by national 
oil companies has risen steeply, growing 
by 131% from 2005 to 2009. Over the 
same period the major international oil 
companies only increased capital 
spending by 59%. This capital investment 
trend appears to be continuing. Capital 
spending by the major international oil 
companies was ﬂat for the ﬁrst 9 months 
of 2010 while spending by the national oil 
companies appeared to be increasing.

Asset Monitoring
Market trends and growth drivers
We make products which monitor the 
condition of physical assets underwater 
using innovative sensor and 
communications technologies. 
Spending on subsea inspection, repair and 
maintenance is forecast to rise by 10% per 
year from 2010 to 2014
4
. A similar growth 
rate is forecast for underwater remotely 
operated vehicle (ROV) services
5
. Tougher 
safety measures proposed for the offshore 
industry in the wake of the Deepwater 
Horizon tragedy may increase spending on 
underwater inspection.
6
Strategy
Our growth strategy in this sub-sector is to 
gain market share through market-leading 
technology, investment in sales channels 
and diversiﬁcation into new applications 
such as offshore renewable energy and 
subsea mining. We are establishing a sales 
and technical support ofﬁce for our sonar 
products in Brazil, one of the world’s fastest 
growing deepwater oil & gas markets
7
.
Performance
High investment in R&D, 8% of revenue in 
2010/11, has been a key driver for growth. 
The beneﬁts from restructuring in 2009/10 
delivered higher revenue and strong proﬁt 
growth aided by only a modest recovery in 
market demand.
Outlook
Current market forecasts for the subsea 
industry are very positive
8
, foreseeing 
growth over the next ﬁve years as the 
economy recovers, energy prices increase, 
technology improves, delayed projects 
come back online and investment in 
deep-water exploration increases. New 
market opportunities will be exploited in 
offshore energy generation and ﬁre and 
rescue services.

Deepwater Horizon prompts 
tougher safety regulations 
for offshore oil 
A US government commission set up to 
investigate the BP Deepwater Horizon oil 
rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico which 
killed 11 workers and created an 
environmental catastrophe has revealed 
systematic failures in risk management 
and highlighted the need for a dramatic 
increase in safety and further reforms 
to the offshore regulatory regime.
The commission’s report
6
 said that the 
technology, laws and regulations, and 
practices for containing and responding 
to oil spills lag behind the risks associated 
with deepwater drilling. According to the 
report, if the industry’s safety practice 
and regulatory oversight do not improve, 
another disaster is inevitable.

  In addition to those figures reported under IFRS, Halma uses adjusted figures as 
key performance indicators as the Directors believe the adjusted figures give a more 
representative view of underlying performance. Adjusted profit figures continue 
to exclude the amortisation of acquired intangible assets and for the first time in 2010/1 1, 
following the introduction of IFRS 3 (Revised), they exclude acquisition costs and fair value 
adjustments on acquisition contingent consideration, which are included in statutory 
figures. More details are given in the Accounting policies and note 1 to the Accounts.

contributor to the US growth with the stronger US Dollar also 
lifting reported revenue when translated to Sterling. The more 
modest growth in Mainland Europe is dampened by translation 
of revenue earned in weaker Euros. Over 60% of our revenue in 
Mainland Europe is in the Northern European countries. Health 
and Analysis and Infrastructure Sensors grew revenue in Europe. 
Revenue to the UK held up well with all sectors growing, however, 
the faster growth in most other territories means that revenue to 
the UK continues to be a reducing element of the total; now 20% 
compared with 26% in 2005. 
Our target is for revenue outside the USA, Mainland Europe and 
the UK to be 30% of Group revenue by 2015. We have taken another 
useful step toward this goal in 2010/11 with it increasing to 24% 
(2010: 21%). Asia Paciﬁc and Australasia revenue increased by 29% 
with all sectors growing strongly. Within that our revenue to China, 
targeted to be 10% of Group revenue by 2015, increased by 28% 
to £24m, now representing 4.6% (2010: 4.1%) of revenue. Revenue 
to Japan is approximately 1.5% of the Group total. Revenue to 
India, with its recently established hub, grew by 32% to £6.4m 
(2010: £4.9m) as we continue to expand our coverage there. 
Limited currency impacts this year
The Group has both translational and transactional currency 
exposure. Translational exposures arise on the consolidation 
of overseas company results into Sterling. Transactional 
exposures arise where the currency of sale or purchase invoices 
differs from the functional currency in which each company 
prepares its local accounts. 
Halma reports its results in Sterling. The most important other 
trading currencies are the US Dollar and Euro, and with the 
acquisition of Medicel, the Swiss Franc will become more 
signiﬁcant. Approximately 30% of Group revenue is denominated 
in US Dollars and 20% in Euros. As the US Dollar strengthened 
and the Euro weakened against Sterling in 2010/11, the currency 
translation of results resulted in only a net 0.5% increase to 
reported revenues and a net 0.3% increase in adjusted
1
 proﬁt. 
Translational currency exposures are not hedged.

US Dollar 1.56 1.60 1.60 1.53
Euro 1.18 1.13 1.13 1.13
Based on the current mix of currency denominated revenue and 
proﬁt, a 1% movement in the US Dollar relative to Sterling changes 
revenue by £1.8m and proﬁt by £0.3m. Similarly, a 1% movement 
in the Euro changes revenue by £0.9m and proﬁt by £0.2m. 
Within the Group there is a good degree of natural hedging (similar 
amounts of purchase and sale transactions) in US Dollars. We 
typically buy less products in Euros than we sell and so have a net 
exposure of approximately Euro 40m in any year. Our transactional 
hedging strategy, ﬁxing currency rates up to 12 months forward 
for approximately 50% of our trading transactions, gives our 
businesses greater certainty in their overseas trading. 
We take a neutral view of the future movements of currencies. 
Where we have debt we aim for some diversity of borrowing in 
currency to provide an element of balance sheet hedging although 
no more than 50% of our borrowing is drawn in currency at any 
time to ensure that currency movements do not unduly impact 
on our bank facility headroom. 
Higher returns and strong margins

 increased further to a record of 20.2% (2010:

and this is the ﬁrst year in that time it has exceeded 20%. Return 
on Sales is an important metric for the Group and is an indicator 
of the high value our customers place on our products.

As noted, Return on Sales increased in all sectors this year with 
Industrial Safety the highest at 24% following its strong recovery in 
the past 18 months although all three sectors continue to operate 
at high levels. Our target is for the Group to operate in the 18 to 22% 
Return on Sales range and this is supported by the high proﬁtability 
of recent acquisitions. 
Gross margins (revenue less direct materials and direct labour) 
continue to exceed 60%. Whilst no single commodity or component 
is signiﬁcant to the Group there is some upward pressure on input 
costs. Active management of the supply chain and alternative 
sources of supply largely mitigate these effects although we expect 
them to continue to be present across the Group in the coming year.  Halma p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011
40 Directors’ Report Business Review Financial Review continued
Reduced ﬁnance costs
The net ﬁnance cost in the Income Statement reduced to £1.1m 
(2010: £2.9m). Net bank interest and related expense reduced 
to £0.7m (2010: £0.9m) while the net pension ﬁnance charge of 
£2.0m last year reduced to £0.4m due to the increased return 
on higher pension assets this year. 
Looking ahead we expect the net pension cost to be lower again 
in 2011/12 but other interest costs, primarily bank interest expense, 
are expected to rise due to the increased level of debt following 
recent acquisitions, with the scale of the impact dependent on 
any changes in bank borrowing rates. 
Lower tax rates
Our approach to taxation is to minimise the tax burden where 
possible in a responsible manner, maintaining good relationships 
with tax authorities based on legal compliance, transparency 
and co-operation. 
The Group has its main operating subsidiaries in 11 countries so the 
Group’s effective tax rate is a blend of these different national rates 
applied to locally generated proﬁts. As expected, the effective tax 
rate on adjusted
1
 proﬁt reduced slightly to 26.2% (2010: 26.5%) 
because of the mix of proﬁt in various jurisdictions. 
A substantial element of our tax is paid in the UK and so the 
reduction of UK Corporation tax by 2% in 2011/12 will beneﬁt 
the Group. Together with the low rates in Switzerland enjoyed 
by Medicel, we expect these factors to lead to a lower Group 
effective tax rate in 2011/12.
Earnings per share grow and dividend increases
Adjusted earnings per share increased to 20.49p (2010: 16.89p), 
up 21.3%. Statutory earnings per share increased by 19.4% to 19.23p 
(2010: 16.1p) due to the amortisation of acquired intangibles being 
higher this year, the write off of acquisition related costs as now 
required by revised IFRS rules, and the associated tax credit 
thereon being proportionately lower. 
Halma has a long record of dividend increases. The recommended 
7% increase in the ﬁnal dividend to 5.56p (2010: 5.19p) together with 
the 7% increase in the interim dividend gives a total dividend of 9.1p 
(2010: 8.5p). At the year end share price this represents a dividend 
yield of 2.6%. Halma’s progressive dividend policy is reﬂected in the 
fact that it will have increased its dividend by 5% or more for every 
one of the last 32 years, paying out over £350m in dividends to 
shareholders over that period. 
Dividend cover (the ratio of proﬁt after taxation to dividends paid 
and proposed) calculated using adjusted
1
 proﬁt is now 2.25 times 
(2010: 1.98 times) meeting our target of around 2 times cover. 
Record returns
Return on Total Invested Capital (ROTIC), the post-tax return on 
all the Group’s assets including all historical goodwill, was a record 
at 15.5% (2010: 13.6%). This high and increased rate resulted from 
proﬁts growing much faster than the asset base. Halma’s ROTIC 
compares very favourably to our long-term Weighted Average Cost 
of Capital (WACC) calculated as being 8.5% (2010: 8.5%), highlighting 
the shareholder value generated by the Group. 
We operate an ‘asset light’ model and aim to be efﬁcient in our 
use of working capital and tangible assets within our businesses. 
This year our Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), which measures 
this operating efﬁciency, was also a record at 71.9%, exceeding the 
previous record of 61.3% set last year. Both the ROTIC and ROCE 
ﬁgures (see note 3 to the Accounts for detailed calculations) 
comfortably exceeded our KPI targets. 
Another year of good cash generation
Cash generated from operations excluding taxation paid, was 
£113.2m (2010: £112.7m) and represented 108% (2010: 131%) of 
adjusted proﬁt

. A summary of the year’s cash ﬂow is as follows:

Cash generation was higher last year because of the exceptional 
amount of cash released from working capital. This year working 
capital increased although the increase represented 5% of total 
working capital (inventory plus trade receivables less trade 
payables) which compares well with the 13% increase in revenue. 
Expenditure on property, plant and computer software this 
year was £15m (2010: £11m) with 2010 having been at a low level. 
This year’s ﬁgure represents 121% of depreciation, falling within 
the 100 to 125% range which we would expect. We constantly 
encourage our businesses to invest in assets given the high 
returns we can generate. 
Taxation paid of £18.1m was higher than last year’s ﬁgure of 
£12.3m and more typical for us. We expect a higher ﬁgure for 
taxation payable in the coming year despite the reducing tax 
rates as we continue to pay tax in advance on increased proﬁts. 
Strong ﬁnancial position and capital structure
Halma is highly cash generative and has substantial bank facilities. 
We use these facilities and our retained earnings to sustain and

develop our business. We have access to competitively priced 
ﬁnance at short notice and spread our risks to provide good 
liquidity for the Group. Group treasury policy is conservative 
and no speculative transactions are allowed. 
We have a ﬁve-year £165m syndicated revolving credit facility with 
a well established core group of banks which runs to February 2013 
on attractive terms. The Group continues to operate well within 
its banking covenants. We are comfortable with using debt to 
accelerate the Group’s development and keep our funding needs 
under regular review so that we have ample headroom to ﬁnance 
potential opportunities. This year we have been successful in 
deploying cash on acquisitions and continue to search for more 
acquisitions which meet our demanding criteria. 
We ended the year with £37 .1m of net debt (2010: £9.1m of net cash). 
The net debt ﬁgure is a combination of £79.7m of debt and £42.6m of 
cash held around the world to ﬁnance local operations or awaiting 
repatriation to the UK. We have an active repatriation programme 
to maintain efﬁcient cash/debt management. 
Value adding acquisitions
This year we spent £82.1m (2010: £1.7m) on three larger and four 
smaller acquisitions plus £1.7m on an investment in an associate. 
The Chief Executive’s Strategic Review outlines the main businesses 
acquired. The multiple of initial consideration to Earnings Before 
Interest and Tax (EBIT), paid for these acquisitions was in the 
range of 6.5 to 8, showing that we can acquire good businesses 
at sensible prices. 
At the run-rate of proﬁts at the time of acquisition these businesses 
added £8.8m to revenue and £2.0m to proﬁt net of the costs of 
ﬁnancing in 2010/11. In 2011/12 we would expect them to contribute 
an additional £26.4m of revenue and £8.3m of proﬁt net of ﬁnancing 
costs, on the same basis. 
Intangible assets of £44.5m were recognised in respect of 
the acquisitions made in the year, as was Goodwill of £66.8m. 
Amortisation of acquired intangible assets was £4.8m and is 
shown in the Income Statement together with acquisition costs 
of £1.3m and acquisition related contingent consideration fair value 
adjustments of £0.2m which are expensed there for the ﬁrst 
time under revised International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) rules. We expect the amortisation of acquired intangibles 
to be closer to £9m in 2011/12.
In December 2010 the Group made an investment of Euro 2m in 
Optomed Oy, a Finnish manufacturer of ophthalmic equipment 
whose products offer us good commercial opportunities. 
Our share of the results of Optomed are shown as an Associate. 
See note 14 to the Accounts for more information. 
The integration of all acquisitions is progressing well. 
Continuing to meet our pension obligations
On an IAS 19 basis the deﬁcit on the deﬁned beneﬁt plans was 
£36.2m (2010: £43.1m) before the related deferred tax asset. 
Plan assets increased to £140.8m (2010: £127 .8m) following 
further recovery in equity values, with approximately 60% of 
the plan assets invested in return seeking assets including equities. 
Plan liabilities increased to £177 .1m (2010: £170.9m) with relatively 
few changes required in the valuation assumptions. 
The Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans were closed to new 
members in 2003 to reduce the ongoing liability. The Board 
monitors the funding of our pension plans closely. We continue to 
make extra contributions to the plans at the rate of £6.4m per year 
as agreed with the actuary with the objective of eliminating the 
deﬁcit, as measured on an IAS 19 basis, over a 10-year period.
Investing in R&D 
Expenditure on R&D this year increased to £25.7m (2010: £21.4m) 
and represents 5% (2010: 4.7%) of revenue. All three sectors 
increased their absolute level of R&D expenditure and maintained 
or increased the percentage of revenue invested. We have been 
increasing our rate of investment in R&D steadily in recent years, 
continually enhancing our technology base. We aim to maintain this 
rate at around 5% of revenue, ahead of our benchmark KPI ﬁgure 
of 4% of revenue. 
We are required under IFRS to capitalise certain development 
expenditure and amortise it over an appropriate period, for us 
three years. R&D by its nature carries risk and all R&D projects, 
particularly those requiring capitalisation, are subject to close 
scrutiny and a rigorous approval and review process. In 2011 we 
capitalised £4.7m (2010: £3.1m) and amortised £4.2m (2010: £3.8m). 
This results in an asset carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheet 
of £9.7m (2010: £9.2m).
Managing risks and going concern considerations
The main risks facing the Group and how we address them are 
reviewed on pages 42 and 43. The key operating risks are covered 
in the Chief Executive’s Strategic Review and Sector reviews. 
We spread risk across the Group via well resourced independent 
operating units. There is extensive and regular review of operations 
at a local and divisional level. This review is supplemented by 
Internal Audit, which we have strengthened during the year with the 
appointment of an additional auditor based in China. During the year 
we upgraded our Group risk assessment process and undertook a 
detailed review of cash controls and related segregation of duties at 
all operating locations, resulting in further strengthening of controls. 
We are in the process of rolling out a centralised IT disaster recovery 
solution to complement existing local processes within subsidiaries. 
Shortly after year end we issued new and comprehensive guidance 
on Health and Safety procedures across the Group. Our record 
in this area is excellent and we aim to maintain best practice 
performance. We are also updating our long-standing policy 
on the mitigation of Bribery and Corruption to ensure we continue 
to meet developing requirements. 
The Board considers all of the above factors in its review of Going 
Concern as described on page 54 and has been able to conclude 
its review satisfactorily. Sound management of risks and high 
performance across the Group should enable Halma to continue its 
tremendous long-term record of creating value for its shareholders.

Description Mitigation
Operational Risk
We seek to continuously grow our proﬁts, generating 
a high return for shareholders over the long term 
within a clear strategic framework. We view risk 
within the context of this objective as well as in 
absolute terms. In any business the inherent risks 
that are an integral component of business activities 
must be identiﬁed, managed and mitigated. 
We perceive our primary operational risks to 
emanate from remoteness of operation and the 
actions and quality of our employees.
Our key means of risk control is the choice of the markets in which we operate and the 
people and methods we use to exploit those market opportunities. Our choice is to 
operate in the safety products and health-related technology markets which we consider 
to be robust over the long term. Our products are predominantly critical components or 
instruments which are warranted as ﬁt for the purpose rather than systems or intangible 
products where satisfactory performance is contingent upon third parties. We invest 
heavily in identifying, recruiting and training talented people who are able to manage 
the risks we face while delivering the excellent results we require. We do not place undue 
reliance on any one Group company nor does any one Group company rely heavily on 
one customer, supplier or transaction. We always seek to spread our risks. We have 
processes in place to ensure any major transactions are reviewed at the appropriate level. 
Organic Growth, Supplier Risk and Competition 
The Group faces competition in the form of pricing, 
service, reliability and substitution. We rely on high 
quality supply from our partners. These constitute 
an ongoing potential threat to our growth. 
Our focus on investing in management development, innovation and international growth 
is a direct result of assessing these risks. We aim to manage the risk of timing and quality 
of component supply by dual sourcing and long-standing working relationships. By 
empowering and resourcing local operations to respond to changing market needs, the 
potential adverse impact of downward price pressure and competition can be mitigated 
and growth maintained. We recognise the competitive threat coming from emerging 
economies and by operating within these economies, typically using local staff, we are 
better placed to make fast progress ourselves.
Research and Development 
New products are critical to our organic growth 
and underpin our ability to earn high margins 
and high returns over the long term. 
R&D is of necessity a risky activity but by devolving control of product development into 
the autonomous operating businesses, we spread the risk and ensure that the resource 
is as close to the customer as possible. New product development ‘best practice’ is 
shared between Group companies and return on investment of past and future innovation 
projects is tracked monthly. Large R&D projects, especially those which are capitalised, 
require Head Ofﬁce approval.
Intangible Resources
Our businesses build competitive advantage  
and strengthen barriers to entry in many ways 
including patents, product approvals, technical 
innovation, product quality, customer service 
levels and branding. We look for these qualities 
in the businesses we seek to acquire. Protection 
of our intellectual property is important to our 
continued success.
The main intangible resources which deliver competitive advantage and which support 
our strategic objectives are: the patents and trademarks which protect our products; our 
employees, whose understanding of our technology, customers’ needs and the dynamics 
of the markets we operate in, enable us to maintain leadership in many markets; and the 
enviable reputation enjoyed by our brands for superior product quality and market leading 
customer support. Whilst no single product or process is critical to the Group as a whole, 
all appropriate actions are taken to protect our intellectual property rights. With our 
development activity increasing in emerging economies we will often segregate the 
elements of a project to protect the know how.
Laws and Regulations 
Group operations are subject to wide-ranging  
laws and regulations including business conduct, 
employment, environmental and health and safety 
legislation. There is also exposure to product 
litigation and contractual risk.
All Group companies have an employee handbook detailing employment practices, 
including the need to report any major legal or contractual risks. The Group’s 
emphasis on excellent ﬁnancial control, the deployment of high quality management 
resource and strong focus on quality control over products and processes in each 
operating business helps to protect us from product failure, litigation and contractual 
issues. Each operating company has a health and safety manager responsible for 
compliance and our performance in this area is excellent. Updated Health and Safety 
policies and guidance were issued in the year, with enhanced monthly reporting. 
We carry comprehensive insurance against all standard categories of insurable risk. 
Contract review and approval processes mitigate exposure to contractual liability. 
Our well established policies on bribery and corruption continue to be updated to 
ensure continued compliance with best practice. 
We recognise major risks and uncertainties facing us  
and take action to identify, manage and mitigate them Halma p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Description Mitigation
Acquisitions
The identiﬁcation and purchase of businesses which 
meet our demanding ﬁnancial and growth criteria is 
an important part of our strategy for developing the 
Group, as is ensuring the new businesses are rapidly 
integrated into the Group.
We pay sensible multiples for businesses whose technology and markets we know well. 
Divisional Chief Executives are responsible for ﬁnding and completing acquisitions in their 
business sectors subject to Board approval. We support them with central resources 
to search for opportunities and assist with implementation of a post-acquisition plan. 
Incentives are aligned to encourage acquisitions which are value-enhancing from day one.
Information Technology/Business Interruption
Group and operational management depend on 
timely and reliable information from our software 
systems. We seek to ensure continuous availability 
and operation of those systems as disruption could 
delay or impact on decision making and service 
to our customers.
There is substantial redundancy and back up built into any Group-wide systems. The 
spread of business offers good protection from individual events and disaster recovery 
plans are widespread. We have a small central resource available, Halma IT Services, 
to assist Group companies with any major IT needs and to ensure adequate IT security 
policies are set across the Group. We carry out regular IT audits across the Group. 
This year we have increased external penetration testing and are rolling out a centralised 
IT disaster recovery solution to supplement local processes.
Financial Irregularities and International Expansion
Our objective is to grow our business across the 
world and to export outside of developed markets 
and particularly in Asia. This presents both operating 
and cultural risks. We recognise that the size and 
remoteness of some operations may not permit 
full segregation of duties and that Internal and 
External Audit procedures may not always identify 
a ﬁnancial irregularity.
The Group ensures that there is adequate local management and ﬁnancial resource in 
each operational location ensuring they are adequately trained in ﬁnancial matters whilst 
maintaining a culture of openness to promote disclosure. Responsibility for remote 
operations rests with operational management in the sponsoring company who supervise 
closely and visit frequently. Group companies operate a common set of reporting 
procedures and accounting policies, disseminated via the Group intranet. Internal Audit 
regularly reviews operations and we appointed a new Internal Auditor in China this year.
Cash
For any business a key risk is that it will run out of 
cash or have inadequate access to cash. In addition, 
cash deposits need to be held in a secure form 
or location. 
The strong cash ﬂow generated by the Group provides ﬁnancial ﬂexibility. Cash needs 
are monitored regularly. In addition to short-term overdraft facilities the Group holds a 
ﬁve-year revolving credit facility, renewable in February 2013, which provides sufﬁcient 
headroom for its needs. Cash deposits are monitored centrally and spread amongst 
a number of highly rated banks.
Treasury Risks
Foreign currency risk is the most signiﬁcant treasury 
related risk for the Group. In times of increased 
volatility this can have a signiﬁcant impact on 
performance. The Sterling value of overseas proﬁt 
earned during the year is sensitive to the strength 
of Sterling, particularly against the US Dollar and 
the Euro. The Group is exposed to a lesser extent to 
other treasury risks such as interest rate risk and 
liquidity risk.
The Group does not use complex derivative ﬁnancial instruments and no speculative 
treasury transactions are undertaken. Currency proﬁts are not hedged. Currency 
hedging must ﬁt with the commercial needs of the business and we have in place a 
hedging strategy to manage Group exposures. This requires the hedging of a substantial 
proportion of expected future transactions up to 12 months ahead. Longer term currency 
trends can only be covered through a wide geographic spread of operations. We closely 
monitor performance against the ﬁnancial covenants on our revolving credit facility and 
are operating well within these covenants. 
Economic Conditions
In times of uncertain economic conditions 
businesses face additional or elevated levels of risk. 
These include market and customer risk, customer 
default, fraud, supply chain risk and liquidity risk. 
We manage such risks primarily at local company level where they are best understood 
and where we are closest to the markets and our customers. The ﬁnancial strength, 
availability of ﬁnance and diversity of the Group provides mitigation to much of this risk. 
We operate robust credit management at each operating company. Each business 
regularly undertakes a close examination of its cost structure to determine that it is 
appropriate to the economic circumstances it faces. High quality subsidiary boards 
provide close monitoring of operations whilst the Halma Executive Board identiﬁes any 
wider trends which require action.
Pension Deﬁcit
Monitoring the funding needs of the Group’s pension 
plans is essential to funding our pension obligations 
effectively. Our UK deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans 
are closed to new members.
There is regular dialogue with pension fund trustees and pension strategy is a regular 
Halma Board agenda item. The Group’s strong cash ﬂows and access to adequate 
borrowing facilities mean that the pensions risk can be adequately managed. The Group 
has increased pension contributions with the overall objective of paying off the deﬁcit in 
line with the Actuary’s recommendations. We monitor and consider alternative means 
of reducing our pension risk in light of the best long-term interest for shareholders. Halma p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011
44 Directors’ Report Business Review
Governance and commitment to 
Corporate Responsibility
As Halma companies are involved in the 
manufacture of a wide range of products for 
the protection and improvement to quality  
of life for people worldwide, safety is critical 
to the Group and is a major priority for 
management. Likewise, the reduction of 
the Group’s carbon footprint has received 
elevated attention since 2007 with the initial 
objective of a 10% reduction in relative 
carbon usage in the three years to March 
2010 and over the subsequent three years 
to March 2013.
Our core values are Achievement, 
Innovation, Empowerment and Customer 
Satisfaction. These core values have been 
selected following extensive surveying of 
employees across the Group. Our culture 
is one of openness, integrity and 
accountability. We encourage our 
employees to act fairly in their dealings 
with fellow employees, customers, 
suppliers and business partners. We 
recognise that our employees determine 
our success and therefore have invested 
in and encouraged their development more 
this year than ever before, not only with 
our intranet training facilities and Halma 
Development Programmes, but also 
through clear leadership and decisive 
action. By ensuring that our team has the 
approach and skills required to succeed 
we are better placed to meet the challenges 
of the future.
We recognise the necessity of safeguarding 
the health and safety of our own employees 
whilst at work and operate so as to 
provide a safe and comfortable working 
environment for employees, visitors and 
the public. Our policy is to manage our 
activities to avoid causing any unnecessary 
or unacceptable risks to health and safety 
and the environment. We have an excellent 
long-term record for addressing 
environmental issues that affect our 
businesses and for developing products 
that protect the environment and improve 
safety at work and in public places.
Many of our innovative products play a very 
positive role in monitoring and improving 
the environment. Our brands lead the world 
in a number of technologies which help to 
minimise environmental damage. 
We support the concept of sustainability 
and recognise that, in common with 
all businesses, our activities have an 
environmental impact. Our strategy is not 
to have capital-intensive manufacturing 
processes, so the environmental impact 
of our operations is relatively low compared 
to manufacturers in other sectors. We also 
recognise that we can improve our own 
environmental performance and so 
resources are deployed to actively reduce 
our own carbon footprint.
Halma has been a member of the 
FTSE4Good UK index since its 
establishment in July 2001.
A summary of our progress and 
performance for all areas of corporate 
responsibility follows. Halma has developed 
meaningful key performance indicators 
(KPIs) that reﬂect the importance the 
Group places on corporate responsibility 
and enable the Board to monitor the Group’s 
progress in meeting its objectives and 
responsibilities in these areas.
Halma has an excellent health and safety 
record and a culture of safety is deeply 
embedded within the Group. We will 
continue to actively promote our safety 
culture over the coming year following a 
major update and relaunch of our internal 
Health and Safety policy and guidance.
Achievements KPIs
We deliver sustainable value to our customers and shareholders. Non-ﬁnancial Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are used by the 
Board to monitor progress on Group initiatives; ﬁnancial KPIs are 
considered on pages 8 to 11.
1.  Halma’s carbon policy was ﬁrst approved by the Board in 2007 . 
In 2010 the policy target was reviewed and continues to call for 
a 10% reduction in the carbon footprint every three years.

Halma and the environment
We have an excellent long-term record 
and a clear strategy for addressing 
environmental issues that affect our 
businesses and for developing products that 
protect the environment and improve safety 
at work and in public places.
Our products
Many of our innovative products play a very 
positive role in monitoring and improving 
the environment. Halma brands lead the 
world in a number of technologies which 
help to minimise environmental damage.
Our principal environmental technologies 
are water leakage detection, gas emissions 
monitoring, water and efﬂuent analysis,  
UV water treatment and optical sensing. 
We tirelessly promote the use of UV water 
sterilisation which eliminates the need 
to use dangerous chemicals, as well as 
products that minimise the waste of 
clean water.
Our commitment to the development of 
equipment for measuring environmental 
changes and controlling the damaging 
impact of industrial activities is long term.
We make safety equipment for use at work, 
in public places and in transportation 
systems that contribute to increased 
personal safety by ensuring safe practice 
at work, protecting people from ﬁre and 
making elevators and automatic doors 
safe and effective. We are the major world 
supplier in several of these areas.
Carbon policy
The Group’s policy on carbon is published 
on our website and has been distributed 
and explained to all Halma business units.
A senior executive in each of our higher-
impact business units is responsible for 
implementing the carbon policy at local 
level. Our Finance Director, Kevin 
Thompson, has principal responsibility 
for coordinating and monitoring the policy.
Environmental management system
We are committed to developing and 
implementing an environmental 
management system (EMS) throughout 
the Group to measure, control and, where 
practical, reduce our environmental 
impacts. We have developed performance 
indicators that assist local management 
in implementing the policy and ultimately 
developing an EMS. The requirement for 
an EMS and the related reporting has been 
rolled out to all UK business units, which 
represent approximately 43% of Group 
production facilities in terms of external 
turnover. All Group companies are 
encouraged to undertake ISO 14001, the 
international environmental accreditation, 
where warranted. The requirement to 
implement an EMS will be extended to 
the rest of the Group in the medium term. 
In terms of revenue, currently 19% of the 
Group has ISO 14001 approval.
Our impact
The environmental effect of our operations 
is relatively low compared to manufacturers 
in other sectors. Our manufacturing model 
is decentralised permitting our operations 
to be located close to their customers. 
Manufacturing operations are established 
across the world for this very reason 
rather than to save labour costs. The ethos 
of being close to our customers reﬂects the 
importance we place on the quality of our 
products and the service levels we provide 
to our customers. It also makes our 
operations more ﬂexible and responsive 
to their markets and customers. With 
operations spread around the globe, 
our supplier base is understandably 
fragmented. Therefore, responsibility for 
vetting and managing suppliers is devolved 
to local management whilst meeting the 
Group’s ethical standards.
FTSE4Good has assessed Halma as 
having a low impact on the environment. 
Nevertheless, Group companies are 
encouraged to improve energy efﬁciency, 
reduce waste and emissions and reduce 
the use of materials in order to minimise 
their environmental impact. The Group 
established baseline data in 2004/05 on 
emissions to air and water , water and energy 
consumption, and waste production, the 
results of which are updated on the Halma 
website each year. The data collected for the 
past ﬁve years has enabled the Group to set 
comprehensive and quantiﬁable objectives 
for reducing its environmental impacts in 
those areas and to set and monitor targets 
for reduction in key areas. The collected 
data conﬁrms that the main area of impact 
on the environment is energy consumption. 
The Group does not operate a ﬂeet of 
distribution vehicles although we do own a 
number of company cars. From May 2007 , 
we implemented a cap on permissible CO2 
emissions of all UK company vehicles and 
will extend this requirement to the rest 
of the world in due course. This limit is 
reduced each year so as to consistently 
reduce our vehicles’ environmental impact. 
We have also set a fuel consumption 
standard for company vehicles in the USA 
which is reviewed annually.
Due to revisions to best practice in 
conversion of energy usage into carbon 
tonnes we have restated prior year carbon 
ﬁgures to enable comparability.
We are committed to reducing our carbon 
footprint. We set a target in 2007 to reduce 
the Group’s total carbon emissions relative 
to revenues by 10% over three years. 
Following a total reduction of 7% in the 
ﬁrst two years, 2009/10 showed an increase 
following the acquisition of a high energy 
usage facility in the USA. We are working 
hard to reduce the energy impact of that 
facility and excluding that operation we 
would have achieved our target reduction. 
We renewed our target in 2010 and in the 
ﬁrst year achieved a useful reduction. We 
have initiated a number of carbon reduction 
actions, particularly in the UK, which are 
designed to help us meet our targets. Halma p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011
46 Directors’ Report Business Review Corporate Responsibility continued
From April 2010, we have worked with 
a provider of energy efﬁciency and 
carbon reduction solutions to ensure 
compliance with the new Carbon Reduction 
Commitment Energy Efﬁciency Scheme 
(CRC), which is the UK’s mandatory 
climate change and energy saving scheme, 
and administered by the Environment 
Agency. We are well on track to be in full 
compliance with the CRC requirements. 
Already we have rolled out Automatic 
Meter Reading (AMR) technology to the 
majority of UK sites. In 2010/11 all major 
UK sites received an energy survey and set 
an action plan for improved energy usage. 
This initiative is backed up by specialist 
carbon management software and 
comprehensive training on its use.
Our carbon policy can be found on the 
Halma website. The Group’s environmental 
performance will continue to be reported 
both in the Annual report and on 
our website.
The Group is committed to examining 
the establishment of ‘ green’ procurement 
policies and increasing our use of recycled 
materials.
Halma and its people
The Group has a policy of equal 
opportunities and preventing harassment, 
which applies in relation to recruitment of 
all new employees and to the management 
of existing personnel. This gives us access 
to the widest labour market and enables us 
to secure the best employees for our needs. 
We offer all of our staff training relevant to 
their roles and we believe that this 
contributes to an increase in employee 
motivation and job satisfaction. The culture 
alignment survey results mentioned below 
support this trend.
Periodically we complete a survey of 
employees to determine whether our core 
values are authentic in our organisation.
The survey establishes the values individual 
employees wish to see in our operating 
culture and to what extent they exist in 
our current culture.
In 2006, our survey of senior managers 
showed that ﬁve of the values they wanted 
to see in our business were actually 
present. Again in 2011, our survey of senior 
managers showed that ﬁve desired values 
were still present in our business. This 
indicates that there is a healthy level of 
alignment between the culture we aspire 
to have and the culture we have today.
No survey is capable of capturing all the 
appropriate sentiments, but our executives, 
who regularly visit all Group companies, 
agree that observable and valuable 
improvements in the Group culture 
have occurred over recent years.
The Group will continue to monitor the 
survey results to enable us to better support 
our people bringing these values and 
strengths to work so that they and we 
may derive further beneﬁt from them.
Disabled employees
Applications for employment by disabled 
persons are always fully considered, 
bearing in mind the aptitudes of the 
applicant concerned. In the event of 
members of staff becoming disabled, 
every effort is made to ensure that their 
employment with the Group continues and 
that appropriate training is arranged. It is 
the policy of the Group that the training, 
career development and promotion of 
disabled persons should, as far as possible, 
be identical to that of other employees.
Employee consultation
The Group places considerable value on 
the involvement of its employees and has 
continued to keep them informed on 
matters affecting them as employees 
and on the various factors affecting the 
performance of the Group. This is achieved 
through formal and informal meetings, the 
Group intranet and the annual ﬁnancial 
statements. Employee representatives are 
consulted routinely on a wide range of 
matters affecting their current and future 
interests. An employee share plan has been 
running successfully since 1980. It is open to 
all UK employees and aligns the interests of 
all UK employees to those of shareholders.
Health and safety
The Group manages its activities to avoid 
causing any unnecessary or unacceptable 
risks to health and safety to our employees 
in the work place or to the public as a result 
of our activities. The policy is understood 
by all Group companies and was reinforced 
during the year through improved guidance 
and reporting following a comprehensive 
review led by an external expert. The 
reporting of Health and Safety incidents 
and corrective action where needed has 
been give an even higher proﬁle. Given 
the autonomous structure of the Group, 
operational responsibility for compliance 
with relevant local health and safety 
regulations is delegated to the board 
of directors of each Group company. 
We believe health and safety training 
is important and it is carried out within 
companies as appropriate. Adequate 
internal reporting exists in order that the 
Group’s Finance Director may monitor 
each company’s compliance with this policy.

People development
The Halma Executive Development 
Programme (HEDP), which is based on 
our recognition of the fundamental part 
our people play in the success of the Group, 
continued to strengthen in 2010/11. HEDP 
is an integrated development plan for our 
senior people – including the next 
generation of Managing Directors and 
Divisional Chief Executives. Our objective 
is to provide these individuals with the tools 
and training to achieve more in their existing 
role and potentially to advance through the 
organisation if their achievements merit it.
Training 2011 2010 2009
Cumulative number of 
candidates that have 
completed HEDP 166 152 113
Cumulative number of 
candidates that have 
completed HMDP 319 277 206
HEDP is aimed squarely at employees 
already serving on subsidiary boards but 
we also encourage applications from senior 
functional managers who can demonstrate 
they already have equivalent responsibilities 
and will beneﬁt from the programme. 
There are approximately 200 such eligible 
employees in total.
The programme has been developed from 
a proven course structure and is speciﬁcally 
and continuously tailored to suit Halma’s 
needs, aligning the content to the Group’s 
four core values of Achievement, Innovation, 
Empowerment and Customer Satisfaction. 
It focuses strongly on strategic and 
leadership capabilities and developing 
personal attributes – commitment, 
determination and resilience. There is an 
emphasis on performance management 
and team development. It includes skill-
based elements such as sales and 
marketing management, project leadership, 
corporate governance, ﬁnance and 
innovation, but all are presented in a 
strategic context.
12 programmes have now been completed 
and the success of the programme can 
be measured by the enthusiasm of the 
participants upon their return to their 
businesses, the achievements of a number 
of participants and their eagerness to 
coordinate further sessions to explore 
topics of particular interest to their 
programme Group.
Now that a signiﬁcant proportion of 
executives have completed HEDP , a follow 
up programme, HEDP+, has been developed 
to provide updated training and to reinforce 
the original course contents.
Complementing the HEDP is a programme 
for subsidiary managers and supervisors – 
the Halma Management Development 
Programme (HMDP). During the year, three 
programmes were completed giving a 
cumulative total of 319 employees who have 
completed HMDP . Programmes were held 
in the USA, Europe and Asia.
In 2011, we introduced a new programme 
targeted at our technical engineers to equip 
them with a broader understanding of 
Halma’s technology, improve their 
productivity and provide speciﬁc skills 
training in areas such as project 
management. One such programme with 
20 participants has been completed with 
great success.
Community
In line with our decentralised structure, social 
and community activities are sponsored and 
undertaken at the direction of subsidiary 
management. Each subsidiary has the 
freedom to implement its own initiatives. 
This approach recognises that priorities 
will vary from business to business.
Responsible investment
Investing in Halma shares meets the 
criteria of many professional and private 
investors who base their decisions 
on environmental, ethical and social 
considerations. The Group is a world 
leader in several key environmental 
technologies and has a reputation for 
honesty and integrity in its relationships 
with employees, customers, business 
partners and shareholders.
Social conditions can be improved for all 
through the creation of wealth. Halma 
creates wealth responsibly allowing our 
employees, customers, business partners 
and shareholders to determine where this 
wealth is best distributed.
Halma’s policies reﬂect the core 
requirements of the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights and the ILO Declaration 
on Fundamental Principles and Rights at 
Work. We do not tolerate practices which 
contravene these international standards.
Regulatory demands upon us vary 
considerably around the world, so Halma 
establishes the core structure to ensure 
that Group companies fully comply with 
legislative and regulatory requirements 
while permitting them to tailor the solutions 
to their particular needs.
Ethics
The Group culture is one of openness, 
integrity and accountability. Halma 
encourages its employees to act fairly in their 
dealings with fellow employees, customers, 
suppliers and business partners. We aim to 
have suppliers of high quality and operate to 
accepted international standards. Halma 
operates a conﬁdential whistleblowing policy, 
which enables all Group employees to raise 
any concerns they may have.
Halma has a zero-tolerance policy on 
bribery and corruption which extends to all 
business dealings and transactions in which 
we are involved. This includes a prohibition 
on making political donations, offering or 
receiving inappropriate gifts or making 
undue payments to inﬂuence the outcome 
of business dealings. Policy and guidance 
in this area continues to be updated in line 
with best practice.
Cautionary note The Business review has been prepared solely to assist shareholders to assess the Board’s strategies and their potential to succeed. It should not be relied 
on by any other party, for other purposes. Forward-looking statements have been made by the Directors in good faith using information available up until the date that they 
approved the Report. Forward-looking statements should be regarded with caution because of the inherent uncertainties in economic trends and business risks. Halma p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Geoff Unwin  
Chairman
Corporate governance is about behaviour and this section of the 
report deals with how the Board and its committees discharge 
their duties and how we apply the principles of good governance 
in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance which is appended 
to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and for which 
the Board is accountable to shareholders. Governance is complex, 
so the Board is committed to the shared endeavour of maintaining 
high standards of corporate governance to ensure the Board 
sends consistent messages on values and behaviours. The policy 
of the Board is to manage the affairs of the Company in accordance 
with the principles of corporate governance contained in the 
Combined Code not by merely following regimented rules, but 
by the promotion of wide discussion on topics to which Board 
members properly contribute, demonstrating mutual engagement 
amongst the participants. 
I continue to be pleased with the progress Halma has made 
to ensure best practice is maintained and we continually seek 
to improve our practices for the beneﬁt of our shareholders.
Succession planning
I have always maintained that a key part of my role involves 
ensuring that the right people are doing the right jobs within 
the Group and that there is a sufﬁcient cadre of individuals being 
nurtured throughout the Group to enable effective succession 
planning. The additional emphasis placed on our succession 
planning practices over the past year has demonstrated the 
importance we place on developing talent in house, for example, 
Rob Randelman’s promotion to the Executive Board in April 2011. 
Reviews of management capabilities and potential are performed 
on a routine basis and I am satisﬁed that sufﬁcient resource 
within the Group exists and continues to be developed through 
programmes such as the Halma Executive Development 
Programme which itself evolves to meet the changing needs 
of the Group. Where a need for improvement to management 
resources is identiﬁed, the necessary attention is provided 
to ensure full strength is attained as soon as practicable.
Board appointments
The Board has been strengthened during the year by the 
appointment of both Lord Blackwell and Steven Marshall. 
These appointments have resulted in the Company’s full 
compliance with the principles of the Combined Code; a position 
which we plan to continue aided by the recruitment of an additional 
non-executive Director due to Richard Stone’s upcoming retirement.
Board committees
Our committees are a valuable part of the Company’s corporate 
governance structure. The workload of the committees is far 
more than the table of scheduled meetings would indicate as ad 
hoc meetings and communications between meetings frequently 
require considerable amounts of time. Our appointment of two 
non-executive Directors mid-year enabled us to review the 
committee allocations during the year to ensure their composition 
matched the resources available.
Board performance
The Board evaluates its performance and that of the Remuneration, 
Audit and Nomination Committees at least annually with each 
Committee also evaluating its own performance. Each year, we 
consult the Board to determine whether an external facilitator 
would enhance our process. To date, we have concluded that the 
current, open climate that the Board enjoys ensures a full and 
frank discussion of all matters, so an external facilitator is not 
necessary. However the Board feels that it would be worthwhile to 
engage an external facilitator periodically and plans to do so during 
2011/12. For 2010/11 the evaluation commenced with an updated 
self-assessment questionnaire, the results of which were compiled 
by the Company Secretary and discussed by the Board at the 
February 2011 Board and Committee meetings. The Board also 
met in February 2011, separate from any scheduled meeting, for 
a general discussion on Board effectiveness followed by a meeting 
of the executive Directors with the Chairman, the executive 
Directors with the Senior Independent Director , a meeting of 
the Chairman and non-executive Directors, and then a meeting 
of the non-executive Directors without the Chairman present. 
The outcomes of these meetings were then fed back to individuals 
by the Chairman, Senior Independent Director or Chief Executive, 
as appropriate. Overall, our process conﬁrms that the blend of 
behaviours and skills around the Halma Board table are well suited 
to the task and consistent with Group values. With a Board that is 
free to openly express concerns comes more considered outcomes 
emphasising collective responsibility, transparency, clarity and 
sustainable conduct.
Shareholder communication
I would like to encourage all shareholders to ﬁnd the time to attend 
our AGM on 28 July 2011. It is an excellent opportunity to meet the 
Board, the Executive Board and a selection of the CEOs from our 
operating companies.

52 Directors’ Report Governance Corporate Governance continued
Compliance with the Code of best practice
Since 29 July 2010 when Lord Blackwell and Steven Marshall 
were appointed, the Company complied with the Code provisions 
set out in Section 1 of the 2008 FRC Combined Code. Prior to that 
date the Company did not comply with provision A.3.2 which involves 
the composition of the Board and the number of members who 
are independent non-executive Directors.
The Board recently determined its ideal composition as a Chairman, 
ﬁve independent non-executive Directors and four executive 
Directors. The Board adjudged this composition as an appropriate 
structure for the Company providing valuable direct knowledge 
of operations and effective challenge surrounding the issues facing 
the Group. With Richard Stone’s upcoming retirement, the Board 
will appoint a further non-executive Director, placing an emphasis 
on improving its diversity.
Application of the principles of good governance
The Company has applied the principles set out in section 1 of the 
Code, including both the Main Principles and supporting principles, 
by complying with the Code as reported above.
The Group is controlled and directed by a Board consisting of a 
Chairman, four executive Directors and ﬁve other non-executive 
Directors. Their biographies appear on page 48. The Board 
considers the Chairman and each of the non-executive Directors 
to be independent. In assessing independence, the Board considers 
that the Chairman and non-executive Directors are independent of 
management and free from business and other relationships which 
could interfere with the exercise of independent judgment now and 
in the future. The Board believes that any shareholdings of the 
Chairman and non-executive Directors serve to align their interests 
with those of all shareholders. Richard Stone is acknowledged 
as the Senior Independent Director and, upon his retirement after 
the AGM, will be succeeded in this role by Stephen Pettit. Upon 
appointment and at regular intervals, all Directors are offered 
appropriate training. Under the Company’s Article’s, each Director 
is subject to re-election at least every three years however, 
commencing this year, the Board is adopting annual re-election of 
Directors. The Board conﬁrms that each Director standing for 
re-election continues to be effective and demonstrates commitment 
to their roles. Richard Stone is not standing for re-election as he is 
retiring after the Annual General Meeting.
The Directors retain responsibility for the formulation of corporate 
strategy, investment decisions, and treasury and risk management 
policies. There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for the 
Board’s decision and the Board meets at least six times each year 
with further ad hoc meetings as required. Directors are issued an 
agenda and comprehensive board papers in the week preceding 
each Board meeting. All Directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary as well as there being an 
agreed procedure for obtaining independent professional advice.
Engagement with management
The Directors have a programmed schedule of meetings and 
visits with the Executive Board, Group companies and Development 
Programmes to ensure that they are able to engage with 
management and employees at all levels. Such contact, especially 
between the non-executive Directors and Group employees, 
is where much value is added and supports the messages 
from the Executive team. 
Committees of the Board
Halma has six committees of the Board: the Remuneration 
Committee, the Audit Committee, the Nomination Committee,  
the Share Plans Committee, the Bank Guarantees and Facilities 
Committee and the Acquisitions and Disposals Committee.
Each of these committees has terms of reference approved 
by the Board, copies of which are available on the website or 
on request from the Company Secretary.
Board meeting attendance
During the year attendance by Directors at Board meetings was 
as follows:
Geoff Unwin 6 of 6
Andrew Williams 6 of 6
Kevin Thompson 6 of 6
Neil Quinn 6 of 6
Richard Stone 6 of 6
Stephen Pettit 6 of 6
Jane Aikman 5 of 6
Adam Meyers 6 of 6
Norman Blackwell 3 of 3
Steve Marshall 3 of 3
Training
During the year the Board received training and brieﬁng updates 
on changes in corporate governance, bribery and corruption 
legislation, health and safety matters and other relevant legislative 
changes. Newly appointed non-executive Directors followed an 
induction programme which included scheduled trips to companies 
in each of the 12 sub-sectors to be achieved over a 3-year period.  Halma p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility to the shareholders for 
the Group’s system of internal control, and responsibility for  
reviewing its effectiveness has been delegated to the Audit 
Committee. Whilst not providing absolute assurance against 
material misstatements or loss, this system is designed to identify 
and manage those risks that could adversely impact the 
achievement of the Group’s objectives. The principal risks are 
detailed on pages 42 and 43.
Following publication by the Turnbull Committee of the guidance 
for directors on internal control (‘Internal Control: Guidance for 
Directors on the Combined Code’), the Board conﬁrms that there 
is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
signiﬁcant risks faced by the Group, that this has been in place for 
the year under review and up to the date of approval of the Annual 
report and accounts. This process has been reviewed by the Board 
and the Group accords with the Turnbull guidance.
The Group’s external auditors, Deloitte LLP , have audited the 
ﬁnancial statements and have reviewed the internal ﬁnancial 
control systems to the extent they consider necessary to support 
their audit report.
The Board meets regularly throughout the year and has adopted 
a schedule of matters which are required to be brought to it for 
decision. This procedure is intended to ensure that the Directors 
maintain full and effective control over all signiﬁcant strategic, 
ﬁnancial and organisational issues.
Group risk is mitigated by means of an operating structure which 
spreads the Group’s activities across a number of autonomous 
subsidiary companies. Each of these companies operates with 
a high-quality board of directors including a ﬁnance executive.
Group companies operate under a system of controls which 
includes but is not limited to:
 – a deﬁned organisational structure with an appropriate delegation 
of authority to operational management which ensures 
appropriate segregation of key duties;
 – the identiﬁcation and appraisal of risks both formally, through the 
annual process of preparing business plans and budgets, through 
an annual detailed risk assessment carried out at local level and 
informally through close monitoring of operations;
 – a comprehensive ﬁnancial reporting system, further enhanced 
during the last ﬁnancial year, within which actual and forecast 
results are compared with approved budgets and the previous 
year’s ﬁgures on a monthly basis and reviewed at both local and 
Group level;
 – an investment evaluation procedure to ensure an appropriate level 
of approval for all capital expenditure and other capitalised costs;
 – self-certiﬁcation by operating company management of 
compliance and control issues; and
 – a prescribed robust structure under which it is appropriate to adopt 
means of electronic communication and to conduct e-commerce.
The processes which the Board has applied in reviewing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control are 
summarised below.
 – Operating companies carry out a detailed, relevant risk 
assessment each year and identify mitigating actions in place 
or proposed for each signiﬁcant risk. This risk assessment 
process was renewed and enhanced in line with best practice 
in 2010/11. A risk register is compiled from this information, 
against which action is monitored through to resolution. Group 
management also compile a summary of signiﬁcant Group risks, 
documenting existing or planned actions to mitigate, manage or 
avoid the risk.
 – Each month the board of each operating company meets, 
discusses and reports on its operating performance, its 
opportunities, the risks facing it and the resultant actions. 
The relevant Divisional Chief Executive chairs this meeting. 
Divisional Chief Executives meet regularly with the Chief Executive 
and Finance Director and report progress to the Executive Board.
 – ‘Warning signs’ are reported to Group and divisional management. 
These are designed to provide an early warning of potential risks 
and to direct appropriate action where necessary.
 – The Chief Executive submits a report to each Halma p.l.c. Board 
meeting which includes ﬁnancial information, the main features 
of Group operations and an analysis of the signiﬁcant risks facing 
the Group at that time.
 – Cyclical and risk-based internal control visits are carried out 
by internal audit personnel or senior ﬁnance staff resulting in 
actions fed back to each company and followed up by Divisional 
Finance Directors and Divisional Chief Executives. Visit reports 
are coded in terms of risk and a summary of all such visits 
reported to the Audit Committee regularly with any signiﬁcant 
control failings being reported directly to the Audit Committee; 
senior ﬁnance staff also conduct ﬁnancial reviews at each 
operating company prior to publication of half-year and year-
end ﬁgures. A programme of IT audits is also carried out and 
reported on.
 – The Chief Executive and Finance Director report to the Audit 
Committee on all aspects of internal control for its review. 
The Board receives the papers and minutes of the Audit 
Committee meetings and uses these as a basis for its annual 
review of internal control.  Halma p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011
54 Directors’ Report Governance Corporate Governance continued
During the year, actions to strengthen the control environment 
continue to be taken centrally by Group management, principally in 
the area of health and safety and bribery and corruption. The duties 
and responsibilities of subsidiary management are continually 
refreshed as well as documented in a manual circulated to 
all subsidiary managing directors. The dedicated resources 
established to identify and investigate potential acquisitions and 
to ensure a rapid and successful integration following acquisition 
remain in place, and the scope of the Group’s IT policies and the 
programme of compliance audits are regularly reviewed to ensure 
they are sufﬁcient to address current risks. During the year we 
refreshed our processes to ensure that appropriate tax accounting 
arrangements are maintained in particular to enable continued 
compliance with local tax requirements.
As noted above, a programme of internal control visits is conducted. 
The internal audit function has independently operated since 2004, 
reporting on the outcome of these visits to the Audit Committee. 
In 2008/09, a dedicated Internal Audit manager was added to 
support the function and during 2010/11 an internal auditor based 
in China was recruited to the function. Each year we implement 
further improvements to our Internal Audit activities as the result 
of benchmarking activities and continue to target further revisions 
for the coming year to enhance our processes.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the main trends and 
factors likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position, and the ﬁnancial position of the Group, its cash ﬂows, 
liquidity position and borrowing facilities, are set out in the Business 
Review. In addition, note 26 to the ﬁnancial statements includes the 
Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, 
its ﬁnancial risk management objectives, details of its ﬁnancial 
instruments and hedging activities, and its exposures to currency 
and liquidity risks.
The Group has considerable ﬁnancial resources (including a 
£165m ﬁve-year revolving credit facility) together with contracts 
with a diverse range of customers and suppliers across different 
geographic areas and industries. No one customer accounts for 
more than 3% of Group turnover. As a consequence, the Directors 
believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks 
successfully.
After making enquiries and after conducting a formal review of 
the Group’s ﬁnancial resources, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
Investor relations
In regular meetings with shareholders and analysts the Chief 
Executive and Finance Director communicate the Group’s strategy 
and results, disclosing such information as is permitted within 
the guidelines of the Listing Rules. Such meetings ensure that 
institutional shareholders representing over 50% of the Company’s 
issued share capital meet or hold discussions with the Company on 
a regular basis. Major shareholders are also offered the opportunity 
to meet the Chairman and/or Senior Independent Director.
All shareholders are encouraged to attend the annual general 
meeting, and major shareholders are also invited to brieﬁngs 
following the half-year and annual results. The content of 
presentations to shareholders and analysts at results 
announcements and all announcements are available 
on the Group website, www.halma.com.
The Group website also contains electronic versions of the latest 
Annual Report and Accounts, Half-Year Reports, biographical 
information on key Directors and Ofﬁcers, share price information, 
and full subsidiary company contact details as well as hotlinks to 
their own websites. The website also features the facility to request 
e-mail alerts relating to announcements made by the Group and 
contains information in Chinese, French, German and Spanish 
as well as English.
The Financial calendar is set out on page 128.
Auditor independence
The Audit Committee has responsibility for reviewing auditor 
independence and objectivity annually. During 2003/04, the 
Committee set down the ‘Policy on Auditor Independence and 
Services provided by the External Auditor’. This policy states that 
the Group will only use the appointed external auditor for non-audit 
services in cases where these services do not conﬂict with the 
auditor’s independence. The policy also sets a fee level per project 
of £100,000 above which non-audit services are subject to a 
tendering process. The above fee levels for non-audit services 
regarding the external auditors are also subject to an annual cap 
equal to the audit fee. Halma p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Activities
The Committee is responsible for nominating appropriate executive 
and non-executive candidates for appointment to the Board. 
During the past year, the Committee has been occupied with 
succession planning discussions and the appointment of two 
non-executive Directors.
When the necessity to appoint a Director is identiﬁed, a candidate 
proﬁle is developed indicating the ideal skills, knowledge and 
experience required taking into account the Board’s existing 
composition. External search consultancies are retained 
when recruiting non-executive Directors and are used to 
evaluate internal and external candidates for succession planning. 
The Committee meets at least annually and more frequently 
during times that a search is being conducted.
The coming year will involve the Committee in identifying a 
non-executive director candidate bringing additional diversity 
to the Board.
As noted on page 51 the process of appointments to the Board is 
paramount in ensuring the Company’s performance is maintained 
and continually improved upon. The Committee is committed 
to identifying the right candidates to take Halma forward.

Audit Committee Report Halma p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Activities
The Committee not only reviews the ﬁnancial reporting of the 
Company, but spends a signiﬁcant amount of its time reviewing 
the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control process. Combined 
with the Committee’s review of the internal and external audit 
functions, it is able to obtain sufﬁcient information to discharge 
its responsibilities. More speciﬁcally, the Committee:
 – reviewed the 2 April 2011 report and ﬁnancial statements, the 
2 October 2010 half-yearly report and the Interim Management 
Statements issued in July 2010 and February 2011. As part of 
these reviews the Committee received a report from the external 
auditors on their audit of the Annual Report and Accounts; 
 – considered the quality of the reports and the output from the 
Group-wide process used to identify, evaluate and mitigate risks;
 – reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and 
disclosures made in the annual report and ﬁnancial statements 
on this matter;
 – reviewed and agreed the scope of the audit work to be undertaken 
by the auditors;
 – evaluated the independence and objectivity of the external 
auditors;
 – agreed the terms of engagement and fees to be paid to the 
external auditors for their audit of the 2 April 2011 ﬁnancial 
statements;
 –reviewed its own effectiveness;
 – evaluated the performance of the Internal Audit function;
 – agreed a programme of work for the Company’s Internal Audit 
function; and
 – received reports from the Internal Audit Coordinator on the 
work undertaken by Internal Audit and management responses 
to proposals made in the audit reports issued by the function 
during the year.
The Group’s policy on external audit sets out the categories of 
non-audit services which the external auditors will and will not 
be allowed to provide to the Group, subject to de minimis levels.
The audit fees payable to Deloitte LLP during 2010/11 were 
£653,000 (2010: £608,000) and non-audit service fees were £251,000 
(2010: £263,000). The principal non-audit service is tax related. 
The Committee conﬁrms that Deloitte LLP remains best placed 
to advise the Group on matters related to compliance and the 
structure of the Group.
The independent auditors, Deloitte LLP , were appointed in 2003. 
The Committee has considered the risk of the withdrawal of their 
independent auditors from the market and has concluded that the 
risk is small. During the year a review of their independence was 
undertaken, and the Committee concluded that the independence 
criteria under the relevant standards continued to be met. As part 
of their review, the Committee ensured that adequate procedures 
were in place to safeguard the auditors’ objectivity and 
independence. At the year-end the auditors formally conﬁrmed that 
their independence and objectivity has been maintained. In addition, 
they are required to rotate the audit partner responsible for the 
Group audit every ﬁve years. In 2010/11 the Audit Committee 
considered whether to fully tender for the audit work in 2011 by 
conducting a rigorous joint re-evaluation of the audit service 
provided by Deloitte LLP . Following a change in audit partner and 
a thorough review of the audit process, from both Deloitte’s and 
Halma’s perspective, the Audit Committee agreed that a full tender 
was not required at this time. There are no contractual obligations 
that acted to restrict the Committee’s choice of auditor.
Accordingly, the Committee unanimously recommended to the 
Board that a resolution for the reappointment of Deloitte LLP as 
the Company’s independent auditors be proposed to shareholders 
at the AGM in July 2011.
The Group’s whistleblowing policy contains arrangements for 
the Group Internal Audit Coordinator to receive, in conﬁdence, 
complaints on accounting, risk issues, internal controls, auditing 
issues and related matters for reporting to the Audit Committee 
as appropriate.

Remuneration Committee Report
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board on 
the framework for executive Directors’ and senior executives’ 
remuneration based on proposals formulated by the 
Chief Executive.
Responsibilities
 – determining and agreeing with the Board the policy and 
framework for the remuneration of the Chief Executive, the 
executive Directors, the Company Secretary and such other 
members of the executive management as it is designated 
to consider; 
 – approving the design of, and determining targets for, any 
performance-related pay plans operated by the Company and 
agreeing the total annual payments made under such plans;
 – reviewing the design of all share incentive plans for approval by 
the Board and shareholders, and determining, each year, whether 
awards will be made, and if so, the overall amount of such awards, 
the individual awards to executive Directors and other senior 
executives and the performance targets to be set; and
 – determining the policy for, and scope of, pension arrangements 
for each executive Director and other senior executives.
The Committee also monitors and considers, with the Chief 
Executive, the framework of remuneration for subsidiary chief 
executives and directors and ensures a consistent approach 
is applied.
The full terms of reference, which were updated in February 2011, 
can be found on the Company’s website or can be obtained from 
the Company Secretary. 
Governance
The Remuneration Committee, which meets at least twice per 
year, was in place throughout the ﬁnancial year. All members 
are independent in accordance with provision A.3.1 of the 
Combined Code.
None of the Committee has any personal ﬁnancial interest (other 
than as shareholders), conﬂicts of interests arising from cross-
directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business. 
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board. No Director 
plays a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration.
In determining the Directors’ remuneration for the year, the 
Committee consults Andrew Williams (Chief Executive) on his 
proposals and relates the proposals to remuneration packages 
at comparable listed companies. The Committee consults Towers 
Watson regarding the structuring of executive remuneration 
packages and reviews other external published material. 
Independent pension advice is provided to the Company by Lane, 
Clark & Peacock LLP .
During the year attendance by Committee members at meetings 
was as follows:

Activities
During 2010/11, the Committee continued to review the Company’s 
remuneration strategy such that executives remain appropriately 
incentivised to meet the Group’s objectives in the prevailing 
economic conditions. That strategy relies upon three key 
components which produce an appropriate balance between 
ﬁxed and variable pay over the short and long term:
 – setting salaries close to median levels;
 – a performance related bonus scheme, as described below, 
tying bonuses to a weighted average increase in economic value 
added; and
 – a long-term equity-based incentive with entry and exit 
performance hurdles.
Accordingly the Committee agreed that:
 – executive base salaries for 2010/11 should be increased by an 
average of 3.5%;
 – executive base salaries for 2011/12 should be increased by an 
average of 5%;
 – the annual targets on the granting of performance shares were 
set appropriately; and 
 – the award of bonuses in respect of 2010/11 should only be based 
on objective measures and be related to the Company’s 
performance.
The Committee has reviewed the Remuneration Report for 2010/11 
and the Company’s remuneration strategy, policy and details of 
executive remuneration follow.

Report on Remuneration Strategy and Policy 
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006. The report 
also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied 
the principles relating to directors’ remuneration in the Combined Code. As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report will 
be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the ﬁnancial statements will be approved.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Company’s members on certain parts of the Directors’ Remuneration Report and to 
state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Accounting Regulations. 
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information 
Remuneration policy
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, retain and motivate executives of the high calibre needed to manage 
the Group successfully and align their interests with those of the shareholders by rewarding them for enhancing value to shareholders. 
The performance measurement of the executive Directors and key members of senior management and the determination of their 
annual remuneration package are undertaken by the Committee.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for executive Directors and senior management:
Element Purpose Operation
Salary To provide competitive ﬁxed remuneration that will 
attract and retain key employees and reﬂect their 
experience and position in the Group.
Reviewed every 12 months.
Benchmarked against appropriate median  
market comparators.
Linked to individual performance and contribution.
Annual bonus Incentivises the achievement of an objective annual 
target which supports the short- to medium-term 
strategy of the Group.
Maximum bonus potential is set at a market competitive 
level (100% of salary).
Bonus is based on Economic Value Added.
Paid in cash.
Equity incentive Performance share plan incentivises executives to 
achieve superior returns to shareholders  
over a three-year period.
Retain key individuals and align interests  
with shareholders.
Share awards are made annually to senior executives 
and are based on a combination of TSR (50%) and ROTIC 
(50%) targets over a three-year period.
Maximum awards range from 100% to 140%  
of salary.
Pension To provide competitive post-retirement beneﬁts. Executives may participate in either a Group deﬁned 
beneﬁt pension plan, Group deﬁned contribution 
pension plan or the US 401k money purchase 
arrangement.
Cash supplements in lieu of Company pension 
contributions are made to some individuals.
The Company’s policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive Directors should be performance-related. 
As described below, executive Directors may earn annual bonus payments of up to 100% of their basic salary together with the beneﬁts 
of participation in share plans which are subject to a maximum value, in the year of grant, of 140% of basic salary.
Each executive Director currently holds shares in the Company in excess of the guideline of one year’s salary.

Basic salary
An executive Director’s basic salary is reviewed by the Committee against the market, Company performance and future strategy prior 
to the beginning of each year and when an individual changes position or responsibility. The Chief Executive is responsible for assessing 
the performance of each senior executive taking account of the complexity of the operations under their control, their opportunities for 
advancement with the Group, their remuneration relative to other executives in the Group and their bonus earning potential. He then 
formulates a remuneration proposal for the Committee’s consideration. In deciding appropriate remuneration levels, the Committee also 
considers the Group as a whole and relies on objective external research which gives information on a comparator group of companies. 
Basic salaries are reviewed in January/February of each year with increases, if appropriate, taking effect from 1 April. Executive Directors’ 
contracts of service which include details of remuneration will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
Annual bonus payments
During the year the Committee carefully assessed existing incentive arrangements and determined that incentive levels are appropriately 
set. The Committee establishes the economic value added (EVA) objectives that must be met for each ﬁnancial year if a cash bonus is to be 
paid. In setting appropriate bonus parameters the Committee has determined that bonuses of approximately 60% of salary are payable on 
the achievement of targeted levels of growth. The maximum performance-related bonus that can be paid is 100% of basic annual salary. 
Executive Director bonus payments for 2011 were £1,127 ,000 versus £322,000 in the prior year reﬂecting the Group’s improved performance 
in terms of reported proﬁt and EVA. 
This performance-related bonus plan, which applies to executive Directors and Divisional Chief Executives, is reviewed annually by the 
Committee and approved by the Board. 
In the case of a Divisional Chief Executive a bonus is earned if the proﬁt of the Division for which he is responsible exceeds a target 
calculated from the proﬁts of the three preceding ﬁnancial years. The proﬁts calculated for this purpose regard each Division as a stand-
alone group of companies charging it with the cost of capital it utilises including the cost of acquisitions.
For the Chief Executive and Finance Director, bonuses are calculated as above but based on Group proﬁt exceeding a target calculated from 
the proﬁts for the three preceding ﬁnancial years after charging cost of capital, including the cost of acquisitions.

Added (EVA) for each year
For 2010/11, a supplemental cash bonus of up to 20% of salary could be earned, subject to the 100% of salary cap for total bonus paid, 
dependent upon attainment of a Return on Capital Employed of 45% and operating cash generation over 100%. 
Transitional provisions exist for divisional restructuring to ensure Divisional Chief Executives remain appropriately incentivised.
Subsidiary directors participate in bonus arrangements similar to those established for senior executives.
Performance share plan (PSP)
The Directors have long believed that share plans are an excellent way to align the interests of senior management with those of shareholders 
and that share plans provide excellent motivation. The Committee, recognising the need to assess and evaluate such incentives, adopted 
a performance share plan following shareholder approval at the 2005 annual general meeting; this Plan replaced the existing share option 
plans in respect of future share awards. The Committee has responsibility for supervising the Plan and the grants under its terms. 
The Committee believes that any incentive compensation awarded should be tied to the interests of the Company’s shareholders and that 
the principal measure of those interests is Total Shareholder Return.

How the PSP works
Performance criteria determine the amount to be granted and, after three years, the amount to vest as illustrated below:
Stages Award Vesting
Process Performance criteria 
determine the number of 
shares to be granted out 
of a Maximum Award level. 
Primary emphasis is placed 
upon the attainment of 
personal strategic objectives 
coupled with ﬁnancial 
and operational success.
The assessment of the 
individual’s achievement 
of their objectives establishes 
the proportion of the 
Maximum Award that 
an individual is granted 
(the Actual Award in the 
table below).
50% of the amount granted 
is subject to TSR growth relative 
to the FTSE 250, excluding 
ﬁnancial companies, over the 
three-year vesting period.
50% of the amount granted 
is subject to ROTIC performance 
over each of the three years.
Awards vest on a sliding 
scale, as set out on 
page 60.
Timeline Criteria set one year 
prior to grant.
Assessment occurs 
immediately prior to grant.

Vested awards are satisﬁed in shares with sufﬁcient shares being sold to meet tax and social costs owing, as directed, and the net balance 
of shares transferred to the individual.
Awards lapse if they do not vest on the third anniversary of their award.
Current vesting expectations for awards made in 2008, 2009 and 2010 range from 93% to 100%.

Awards vest after three years on a sliding scale, as set out on page 60, subject to the Company’s relative TSR performance against the 
FTSE 250, excluding ﬁnancial companies, combined with a measure based upon an absolute ROTIC. 
The ﬁve-year graph below shows the Company’s total shareholder return performance over the ﬁve years to 2 April 2011 as compared to 
the FTSE 250 and the FTSE 350 Electronic & Electrical Equipment sector indices, the latter of which the Company has been a constituent 
since it was reclassiﬁed in June 2006. Over the period indicated, the Company’s total shareholder return was 224% compared to 136% for 
the FTSE 250 and 197% for the FTSE 350 Electronic & Electrical Equipment sector. 
At the commencement of the ﬁve-year period depicted in the graph, the Halma p.l.c. ordinary share price was 187 .75p and the total of 
dividends paid in the year ended 1 April 2006 was 6.63p per share. The Halma p.l.c. ordinary share price at 2 April 2011 was 355p and the 
total of dividends paid in the year then ended was 8.73p per share. The Plan contains provisions permitting share option grants, restricted 
share awards and performance share awards. To date, the Committee has used the Plan only to award both approved and unapproved 
performance shares.

Share option plans
The 1999 share option plan provided for the grant of two categories 
of option both of which are subject to performance criteria. The 
exercise criteria for this plan are noted in note 23 to the accounts. 
No further grants may be made from this plan which has been 
replaced by the performance share plan approved by shareholders 
at the 2005 annual general meeting. The granting of options was 
spread over the life of the plan.
Dilution
The total dilution effect under these various discretionary share 
plans is less than 5%.
The Company does not operate any long-term incentive plans other 
than the share plans described above. No signiﬁcant amendments are 
proposed to be made to the terms and conditions of any entitlement 
of a Director to share options or performance share awards.
Pension arrangements
Except as noted below, the executive Directors participate in the 
appropriate section of the Halma Group Pension Plan. This section 
is a funded ﬁnal salary occupational pension plan registered with 
HM Revenue & Customs, which provides a maximum pension 
of two-thirds of ﬁnal pensionable salary after 25 or more years’ 
service at normal pension age (60). Up to 5 April 2006, ﬁnal 
pensionable salary was the greatest salary of the last three 
complete tax years immediately before retirement or leaving 
service. From 6 April 2006, ﬁnal pensionable salary is capped at 
7 .5% of the Lifetime Allowance equating to £135,000 for the year 
ended 2 April 2011.
From 6 April 2011, ﬁnal pensionable salary is capped at £139,185 
and will be increased annually thereafter by CPI.
Bonuses and other ﬂuctuating emoluments and beneﬁts-in-kind 
are not pensionable nor subject to any pension accrued supplement. 
The Plan also provides for life cover of three times salary, pensions 
in the event of early retirement through ill health and dependants’ 
pensions of one-half of the member’s prospective pension. 
Early retirement pensions, currently possible from age 55 with 
the consent of the Company and the Trustees of the Plan, are 
subject to actuarial reduction. Pensions in payment increase by 3% 
per annum for service up to 5 April 1997 , by price inﬂation (subject 
to a maximum of 5%) through to 31 March 2007 and 3% thereafter.
Whilst pension beneﬁts are accruing, executive Directors receive 
pension supplements to compensate them for the fact that their 
pension accrual entitlement under the Halma Group Pension 
Plan deﬁned beneﬁt arrangements is limited by a pensionable 
salary cap introduced from 6 April 2006. The Company introduced 
a pensionable salary cap in order to address changes affecting 
the Plan made in the Pension Act 2006. Without the introduction 
of such a cap, there would, effectively, have been no beneﬁt limits. 
This could have resulted in beneﬁts in excess of prescribed 
levels with some individuals suffering penal rates of tax and 
potentially causing a limitation on the tax deductibility of employer 
contributions. The Company obtained external advice regarding 
the changes to the Plan and executive pension arrangements 
and required each affected executive to obtain independent advice 
prior to implementing the changes. These changes reduce the 
Plan’s future liabilities and their associated funding risk.
Prior to receiving pension payments, to the extent that an 
executive’s current salary exceeds the Plan salary cap, 
the Company compensates him at an annual rate of 26% of the 
excess. In April 2006, Kevin Thompson chose to cease entirely 
future service accrual in the Halma Group Pension Plan in return 
for the pension supplement on his full salary.
Beneﬁts-in-kind
The executive Directors receive certain beneﬁts-in-kind, principally 
use of a car and private medical insurance.
Directors’ contracts
It is the Company’s policy that executive Directors should have 
contracts with an indeﬁnite term providing for a maximum of one 
year’s notice. The details of the Directors’ contracts are 
summarised in the table below:
Date of contract Notice period
Andrew Williams April 2003 one year
Kevin Thompson April 2003 one year
Neil Quinn April 2003 one year
Adam Meyers July 2008 one year
In the event of early termination, no predetermined compensation 
is provided for in the Directors’ contracts.
Non-executive Directors
Unless otherwise indicated, all non-executive Directors have a 
speciﬁc three-year term of engagement which may be renewed for 
further three-year terms if both the Director and the Board agree. 
Stephen Pettit, who is proposed for re-election had his terms of 
engagement extended for a further third three-year term in 2009 
in contemplation of attaining six years of service in 2009. 
The remuneration of the Chairman and the non-executive 
Directors is determined by the Board based on independent surveys 
of fees paid to the Chairman and the non-executive Directors of 
similar companies. The Chairman receives a basic fee and the 
non-executive Directors receive a basic fee supplemented by 
additional fees for membership and/or chairmanship of the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees.
The contract in respect of Geoff Unwin’s services provides for 
termination, by either party, by giving not less than six months’ 
notice. Richard Stone, Stephen Pettit, Jane Aikman, Norman 
Blackwell and Steve Marshall have contracts in respect of 
their non-executive Director services which can be terminated, 
by either party, by giving not less than three months’ notice. 
The Board has accepted Richard Stone’s notice to retire after 
the AGM on 28 July 2011.
The Chairman’s and the non-executive Directors’ fees were 
reviewed by the Board in April 2010 and July 2010, with increases 
taking effect from April 2010 and August 2010. Halma p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Other Statutory Information
Activities
Halma p.l.c. is a holding company. A list of its principal subsidiary 
companies and their activities is set out on pages 124 to 127 .
Ordinary dividends
The Directors recommend a ﬁnal dividend of 5.56p per share and, 
if approved, this dividend will be paid on 24 August 2011 to ordinary 
shareholders on the register at the close of business on 22 July 
2011. Together with the interim dividend of 3.54p per share already 
paid, this will make a total of 9.10p (2010: 8.50p) per share for the 
ﬁnancial year.
Share capital and capital structure
Details of share capital issued in the ﬁnancial year are set out in 
note 22 to the accounts. 
Details of the share capital, together with details of the movements 
in the share capital during the year, are shown in note 22 to the 
accounts. The Company has one class of ordinary shares which 
carry no right to ﬁxed income. Each share carries the right  
to one vote at general meetings of the Company. 
There are no other classes of share capital. There are no speciﬁc 
restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the transfer of shares, 
with both governed by the general provisions of the Articles of 
Association and prevailing legislation. No person has any special 
rights of control over the Company’s share capital and all issued 
shares are fully paid.
Rights and obligations of ordinary shares
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend and speak at 
general meetings of the Company and to appoint one or more 
proxies or, if the holder of shares is a corporation, one or more 
corporate representatives. On a show of hands, each holder of 
ordinary shares who (being an individual) is present in person 
or (being a corporation) is present by a duly appointed corporate 
representative, not being himself a member, shall have one vote, 
as shall proxies (unless they are appointed by more than one holder, 
in which case they may vote both for and against the resolution in 
accordance with the holders’ instructions). On a poll every holder 
of ordinary shares present in person or by proxy shall have one vote 
for every share of which he is the holder. Electronic and paper proxy 
appointments and voting instructions must be received not later 
than 48 hours before the meeting. A holder of ordinary shares can 
lose the entitlement to vote at general meetings where that holder 
has been served with a disclosure notice and has failed to provide 
the Company with information concerning interests held in those 
shares. Except as set out above and as permitted under applicable 
statutes, there are no limitations on voting rights of holders of a 
given percentage, number of votes or deadlines for exercising 
voting rights.
Restrictions on transfer of shares
The Directors may refuse to register a transfer of a certiﬁcated 
share that is not fully paid, provided that the refusal does not 
prevent dealings in shares in the Company from taking place on 
an open and proper basis or where the Company has a lien over 
that share. The Directors may also refuse to register a transfer of 
a certiﬁcated share unless the instrument of transfer is: (i) lodged, 
duly stamped (if necessary), at the registered ofﬁce of the Company 
or any other place as the Board may decide accompanied by the 
certiﬁcate for the share(s) to be transferred and/or such other 
evidence as the Directors may reasonably require to show the right 
of the transferor to make the transfer; (ii) in respect of only one 
class of shares; (iii) in favour of a person who is not a minor, infant, 
bankrupt or a person of unsound mind; or (iv) in favour of not more 
than four persons jointly.
Transfers of uncertiﬁcated shares must be carried out using 
CREST and the Directors can refuse to register a transfer of an 
uncertiﬁcated share in accordance with the regulations governing 
the operation of CREST.
There are no other restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares 
in the Company except certain restrictions which may from time 
to time be imposed by laws and regulations (for example insider 
trading laws); or where a shareholder with at least a 0.25% interest 
in the Company’s certiﬁcated shares has been served with a 
disclosure notice and has failed to provide the Company with 
information concerning interests in those shares. The Directors 
are not aware of any agreements between holders of the Company’s 
shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities 
or on voting rights.
Treasury shares
Shares held in treasury do not have voting rights and are not 
eligible for dividends. 
Employee share plans
Details of employee share plans are set out in note 23 to the accounts. 
Appointment and replacement of directors
With regard to the appointment and replacement of directors, 
the Company is governed by its Articles of Association, the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Companies Acts and related 
legislation. Directors can be appointed by the Company by ordinary 
resolution at a general meeting or by the Board. If a director is 
appointed by the Board, such director will hold ofﬁce until the next 
annual general meeting and shall then be eligible for re-election at 
that meeting. The Company can remove a director from ofﬁce, 
including by passing a special resolution or by notice being given by 
all the other directors. The Articles themselves may be amended by 
special resolution of the shareholders. 
Power of directors
The powers of Directors are described in the Matters Reserved for 
the Board, copies of which are available on request, and the 
Corporate Governance Statement on page 51.
Essential contracts and change of control
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate 
upon a change of control of the Company, principally bank loan 
agreements and employee share plans. 
The only signiﬁcant agreement, in terms of its likely impact on 
the business of the Group as a whole, containing such provisions 
is that governing the £165m revolving credit facility which on change 
of control, if the majority lenders require, can result in 30 days’ 
notice being given to the Company for all amounts outstanding to 
be immediately due and payable, at which time the facility would 
be cancelled. Halma p.l.c.  Annual   Report  and  Accounts  2011
68 Directors’ Report Governance Other Statutory Information continued
The  Group  has  contractual  arrangements  with  a  wide  range  of  suppliers.  The  Group  is  not  unduly  dependent  upon  contractual  arrangements  with  any  particular  customer.  Whilst  the  loss  or  disruption  to  certain  of  these  arrangements  could  temporarily  affect  the  Group’s  business,  none  is  considered  to  be  essential.
The  Company’s  share  plans  contain  provisions  as  a  result  of  which  options  and  awards  may  vest  and  become  exercisable  on  a  change  of  control  of  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  rules  of  the  plans.  The  Directors  are  not  aware  of  any  agreements  between  the  Company  and  its  directors  or  employees  that  provide  for  compensation  for  loss  of  office  or  employment  that  occurs  because of  a  takeover  bid.
Allotment authority
Under  the  Companies  Act  2006  the  Directors  may  only  allot  shares  if  authorised  by  shareholders  to  do  so.  At  the  Annual  General  Meeting  an  ordinary  resolution  will  be  proposed  which,  if  passed,  will  authorise  the  Directors  to  allot  and  issue  new  shares  up  to  an  aggregate  nominal  value  of  £12,500,000  (up  to  125,000,000  new  ordinary  shares  of  10p  each),  being  just  less  than  one-third  of  the  issued  share  capital  of  the  Company  (excluding  treasury  shares)  as at  20  June  2011  (the  latest  practicable  date  prior  to  the  publication  of  the  Notice  of  Meeting).  In  accordance  with  the  Directors’  stated  intention  to  seek  annual  renewal,  the  authority  will  expire  at  the  conclusion  of  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of  the  Company  in  2012.  Passing  this  resolution  will  give  the  Directors  flexibility  to  act  in  the  best  interests  of  shareholders,  when  opportunities  arise,  by  issuing  new  shares.
As  at  20  June  2011  (the  latest  practicable  date  prior  to  the  publication  of  the  Notice  of  Meeting),  the  Company  had  378,247,685  ordinary  shares  of  10p  each  in  issue  of  which  1,847,368  were  held  as  treasury  shares,  which  is  equal  to  approximately  0.5%  of  the  issued  share  capital  of  the  Company  (excluding  treasury  shares)  as  at  that  date.
The  Companies  Act  2006  also  requires  that,  if  the  Company  issues  new  shares  for  cash  or  sells  any  treasury  shares,  it  must  first  offer them  to  existing  shareholders  in  proportion  to  their  current  holdings.  At  the  Annual  General  Meeting  a  special  resolution  will  be proposed  which,  if  passed,  will  authorise  the  Directors  to  issue  a limited  number  of  shares  for  cash  and/or  sell  treasury  shares  without  offering  them  to  shareholders  first.  The  authority  is  for  an  aggregate  nominal  amount  of  up  to  5%  of  the  aggregate  nominal  value  of  the  issued  share  capital  of  the  Company  as  at  20  June  2011  (the  latest  practicable  date  prior  to  the  publication  of  the  Notice  of  Meeting).  The  resolution  will  also  modify  statutory  pre-emption  rights  to  deal  with  legal,  regulatory  or  practical  problems  that  may arise  on  a  rights  issue  or  other  pre-emptive  offer  or  issue.  The authority  will  expire  at  the  same  time  as  the  resolution  conferring  authority  on  the  Directors  to  allot  shares.  The  Directors  consider  this  authority  necessary  in  order  to  give  them  flexibility  to deal  with  opportunities  as  they  arise,  subject  to  the  restrictions  contained  in  the  resolution.  There  are  no  present  plans  to  issue  shares,  except  under  share  plans  previously  approved  in  general meeting.
Directors
The  names  of  the  Directors  of  the  Company  who  served  throughout  the  year  including  brief  biographies,  are  set  out  on  pages  48  and  49.
Directors’ indemnities
The  Company  has  entered  into  deeds  of  indemnity  with  each  of  the  current  Directors  which  remain  in  force  at  the  date  of  this  report.  These  are  qualifying  third-party  indemnity  provisions  for  the  purposes  of  the  Companies  Act  2006.  Purchase of the Company’s own shares
The  Company  was  authorised  at  the  2010  Annual  General  Meeting  to  purchase  up  to  37,600,000  of  its  own  10p  ordinary  shares  in the  market.  This  authority  expires  at  the  end  of  the  2011  Annual  General  Meeting.  In  accordance  with  the  Directors’  stated  intention  to  seek  annual  renewal,  a  special  resolution  will  be  proposed  at  the  Annual  General  Meeting  to  renew  this  authority,  until  the  end  of  next  year’s  Annual  General  Meeting,  in  respect  of  up  to  37,600,000  ordinary  shares,  which  is  approximately  10%  of the  Company’s  issued  share  capital  (excluding  treasury  shares)  as  at  20  June  2011  (the  latest  practicable  date  prior  to  the  publication  of  the  Notice  of  Meeting).  The  Directors  consider  it  desirable  that  the  possibility  of  making  such  purchases,  under  appropriate  circumstances,  is  available.  Their  present  intention  is  that  the  shares  purchased  under  the  authority  will  be  held  in  treasury  for  future  cancellation,  sale  for  cash  or  transfer  for  the  purposes  of,  or  pursuant  to,  an  employee  share  plan,  although  in  the  light  of  circumstances  at  the  time  it  may  be  decided  to  cancel  them  immediately  on  repurchase.  The  effect  of any  cancellation  would  be  to  reduce  the  number  of  shares  in  issue.  For  most  purposes,  while  held  in  treasury,  shares  are  treated  as  if  they  have  been  cancelled  (for  example,  they  carry  no  voting  rights  and  do  not  rank  for  dividends).
Following  approval  of  the  Performance  Share  Plan  (PSP)  at  the  2005  Annual  General  Meeting,  the  Directors  made,  and  intend    to  continue  to  make,  routine  purchases  of  Halma  shares  in  the  market  for  holding  in  treasury  until  required  for  vesting  under    the  PSP .  In  the  year  to  2  April  2011,  1,793,572  shares,  with  a  nominal  value  of  £179,357.20,  which  is  0.5%  of  the  Company’s  issued  share  capital  as  at  20  June  2011  (the  latest  practicable  date  prior  to  the  publication  of  the  Notice  of  Meeting),  were  purchased  in  the  market  for  treasury.  Otherwise,  the  Directors  have no  present  intention  of using  this  authority.  In  reaching  a  decision  to  purchase  shares,  the  Directors  will  take  into  account  the Company’s  cash  resources,  capital  requirements  and  the  effect of  any  purchase  on  the  Company’s  earnings  per  share.  It is anticipated  that  renewal  of  the  authority  will  be  requested  at subsequent  annual  general  meetings.
As  at  20  June  2011,  which  is  the  latest  practicable  date  prior  to  the  publication  of  the  Notice  of  Meeting,  options  were  outstanding  to  subscribe  for  a  total  number  of  2,975,991  ordinary  shares,  or  0.8%  of the  Company’s  issued  share  capital.  If  the  proposed  authority  were  to  be  used  in  full  and  all  of  the  repurchased  shares  were  cancelled  (but  the  Company’s  issued  share  capital  otherwise  remained  unaltered),  the  total  number  of  options  to  subscribe  for  ordinary  shares  at  that  date  would  represent  approximately  0.9%  of the  Company’s  issued  share  capital  (excluding  treasury  shares).

Auditors

Annual Report conﬁrms that: 
–  so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and 
–  the Director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have 
taken as a director in order to make himself/herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information. 
This conﬁrmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of s418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in ofﬁce 
as auditors and a resolution to reappoint them will be proposed at 
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

70 Directors’ Report Governance
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial 
statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the Directors are 
required to prepare the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have 
elected to prepare the parent company ﬁnancial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable 
law). Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
accounts unless they are satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Company and of the proﬁt or loss of the 
Company for that period.
In preparing the parent company ﬁnancial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 – make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 – state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the ﬁnancial statements; and
 – prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the Group ﬁnancial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
 – properly select and apply accounting policies;
 – present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
 – provide additional disclosures when compliance with the speciﬁc 
requirements in IFRSs are insufﬁcient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s ﬁnancial position and ﬁnancial 
performance; and
 – make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the ﬁnancial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements  
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement 
We conﬁrm that to the best of our knowledge:
 – the ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant 
ﬁnancial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
 – the management report, which is incorporated into the 
Directors’ Report, includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as  
a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.

Directors’ Responsibilities Independent Auditor’ s Report to 
the Members of Halma p.l.c.  
We have audited the Group financial statements of Halma p.l.c. for the 52 week period ended 2 April 2011 which comprise the Consolidated 
Income Statement, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the related notes 1 to 31. The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.  
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for 
our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Group financial statements: 
− give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 2 April 2011 and of its profit for the 52 week period then ended; 
− have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and 
− have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the Group financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
− certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
− we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
− the Directors’ Statement contained within Corporate Governance in relation to going concern; 
− the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008 
Combined Code specified for our review; and 
− certain elements of the report to the shareholders by the Board on Directors’ remuneration. 
Other matters 
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Halma p.l.c. for the 52 week period ended 2 April 2011 
and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

Treasury shares are ordinary shares in Halma p.l.c. purchased by the Company and held to fulfil the Company’s obligations under the 
performance share plan. At 2 April 2011 the number of treasury shares held was 1,847,368 (2010: 1,130,036) and their market value was 
£6,558,156 (2010: £2,926,793). 
The Capital redemption reserve was created on repurchase and cancellation of the Company’s own shares.  
The Hedging and translation reserve is used to record differences arising from the retranslation of the financial statements of foreign 
operations and the portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments that are deemed to be an 
effective hedge. Other than a net charge of £281,000 (2010: charge of £47,000), all amounts at year end relate to translation movements. 
The Other reserves represent the provision established in respect of the value of the equity-settled share option plans and performance 
share plan.

75 Accounting Policies 
Basis of accounting 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted for use in the 
European Union (EU) and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS legislation and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 that are 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS and International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations issued and effective at the time of preparing these accounts. 
The principal Group accounting policies are explained below and have been applied consistently throughout the years ended 3 April 2010 
and 2 April 2011 other than those noted below. 
The Group accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as described below under the heading ‘Derivative 
financial instruments and hedge accounting’. 
New, revised or changes to existing standards which have been adopted by the Group in the year 
ending 2 April 2011 
The Group has adopted IFRS 3 (Revised) ‘Business Combinations’ for transactions arising after 3 April 2010. This has changed the treatment 
of contingent purchase consideration and acquisition-related costs. The adoption of IFRS 3 (Revised) has been applied prospectively and has 
had no material impact on assets, profit or earnings per share in the year ended 2 April 2011. Had this accounting policy change not arisen, 
then acquisition related costs of £1,268,000 would have been capitalised within goodwill arising on acquisition and operating costs reduced 
and profit before tax increased by the same amount. Basic earnings per share would have been 0.34p per share higher at 19.57p per share. 
Adjusted earnings per share, as defined, would not differ from that presented. 
Previously, transaction costs to effect a business combination were included in the cost of acquisition, but under IFRS 3 (Revised) these 
acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. For transactions relating to acquisitions before 3 April 2010, subsequent adjustments 
to contingent purchase consideration were made against goodwill. However, under IFRS 3 (Revised) unless the contingent purchase 
consideration is classified as equity, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent purchase consideration are recognised in the 
Consolidated income statement. 
Additionally the following new standards and interpretations have been adopted in the current year but have not impacted the reported 
results or the financial position: 
− IFRIC 9 and IAS 39 ‘Embedded Derivatives’ 
− IFRIC 17 ‘Distribution of non-cash assets to owners’ 
− IFRIC 18 ‘Transfers of assets from customer’ 
− IAS 27 (revised) ‘Consolidated and separate financial statements’ 
− IAS 28 (revised) ‘Investments in associates’ 
− Amendment to IAS 32 ‘Classfication of Rights Issue’ 
− Amendments to IAS 39 ‘Elgible Hedged Items’ 
− Amendments to IFRS 1 ‘Additional exemption for first time presentation’ 
− Amendments to IFRS 2 ‘Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions’ 
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these 
financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU): 
− Amendments to IFRS 7, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure’, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011. This standard 
has not yet been endorsed for use in the EU 
− IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments – Classification and Measurement’ 
− IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ 
− IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ 
− IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’ 
− IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ 
− Amendment to IFRS 1, ‘Limited Exemption from Comparative IFRS 7 disclosures for first time adopters’ 
− Amendment to IAS 24, ‘Related Party Disclosures’ 
− Amendment to IFRIC 14, ‘Prepayment on a Minimum Funding Requirement’ 
− IFRIC 19, ‘Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments’ 
− Improvements to IFRSs – 2010 
Halma p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011
76 Financial Statements  
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the 
financial statements of the Group, except for IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, which will introduce a number of changes in the presentation 
of financial instruments. 
IFRS 10 – 13 were issued by the IASB on 12 May 2011 and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 
These pronoucements have not yet been endorsed for use in the EU. The Group has not completed its assessment of the impact of these 
pronoucements on the consolidated results, financial position or cash flows of the Group. 
Going concern 
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained on page 54. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty and critical accounting judgments 
The preparation of Group accounts in conformity with IFRS requires the Directors to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, 
the results of which form the basis of making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from 
other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  
The following three areas of key estimation uncertainty and critical accounting judgment have been identified as having significant risk 
of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the next financial year: 
− Goodwill impairment 
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of cash generating units (CGUs) to which goodwill 
has been allocated. In turn, the value in use calculation involves an estimation of the present value of future cash flows of CGUs. 
The future cash flows are based on annual budgets, as approved by the Board, to which the management’s expectation of market-share 
and long-term growth rates are applied. The present value is then calculated based on management’s judgment of future discount rates. 
The Board reviews these key assumptions (market-share, long-term growth rates, and discount rates) and the sensitivity analysis around 
these assumptions. Further details are provided in note 11.  
− Defined benefit pension scheme liabilities 
Determining the value of the future defined benefit obligation requires judgment in respect of the assumptions used to calculate present 
values. These include future mortality, discount rate, inflation and salary increases. Management makes these judgments in consultation 
with an independent actuary. Details of the judgments made in calculating these transactions are disclosed in note 28.  
− Intangible assets 
IFRS 3 (revised) ‘Business Combinations’ requires that goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalised and included in 
intangible assets. IFRS 3 (revised) also requires the identification of other intangible assets at acquisition. The assumptions involved in 
valuing these intangible assets require the use of estimates and judgements which may differ from the actual outcome. These estimates 
and judgements cover future growth rates, expected inflation rates and the discount rate used. 
Basis of consolidation 
The Group accounts include the accounts of Halma p.l.c. and its subsidiary companies made up to 2 April 2011, adjusted to eliminate  
intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses. The results of subsidiary companies acquired or discontinued are included 
from the month of their acquisition or to the month of their discontinuation. 
Business combinations and goodwill 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control 
is transferred to the Group. For acquisitions after 3 April 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: 
− the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus 
− the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus 
− the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less 
− the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
 
Halma p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011
77  
 
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred. 
Any contingent purchase consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent purchase consideration 
is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value 
of the contingent purchase consideration are recognised in the Consolidated income statement. 
For acquisitions between 4 April 2004 (the date from which the financial statements were reported under IFRS) and 2 April 2010, goodwill 
represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition, including acquisition costs and the fair value of the net identifiable assets 
acquired. Goodwill is not amortised, but is tested annually for impairment. 
Goodwill is recognised as an intangible asset in the Consolidated balance sheet. Goodwill therefore includes non-identified intangible assets 
including business processes, buyer-specific synergies, know-how and workforce-related industry-specific knowledge and technical skills. 
Negative goodwill arising on acquisitions would be recognised directly in the Consolidated income statement. On closure or disposal of an 
acquired business, goodwill would be taken into account in determining the profit or loss on closure or disposal. 
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group elected not to apply IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ to acquisitions prior to 4 April 2004 in its consolidated 
accounts. As a result, the net book value of goodwill recognised as an intangible asset under UK GAAP at 3 April 2004 was brought forward 
unadjusted as the cost of goodwill recognised under IFRS at 4 April 2004 subject to impairment testing on that date; and goodwill that was 
written off to reserves prior to 28 March 1998 under UK GAAP will not be taken into account in determining the profit or loss on disposal or 
closure of previously acquired businesses from 4 April 2004 onwards. 
Investments in associates 
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through 
participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial 
and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not in control or joint control over those policies. 
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting. 
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net 
assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of an associate in excess of the Group’s interest 
in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate) are 
recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. 
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of 
acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment 
as part of that investment. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets 
of the associate at the date of acquisition (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited in profit or loss in the period of acquisition.  
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in 
the relevant associate. Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which case appropriate provision is made 
for impairment.  
Other intangible assets 
(a) Product development costs 
Research expenditure is written off in the financial year in which it is incurred. 
Development expenditure is written off in the financial year in which it is incurred, unless it relates to the development of a new or 
substantially improved product, is incurred after the technical feasibility and economic viability of the product has been proven and the 
decision to complete the development has been taken, and can be measured reliably. Such expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset 
in the Consolidated balance sheet at cost and is amortised through the Consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over its 
estimated economic life of three years. 
Halma p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011
78 Financial Statements Accounting Policies continued  
(b) Acquired intangible assets 
An intangible resource acquired with a subsidiary undertaking is recognised as an intangible asset if it is separable from the acquired 
business or arises from contractual or legal rights, is expected to generate future economic benefits and its fair value can be measured 
reliably. Acquired intangible assets, comprising trademarks and customer relationships, are amortised through the Consolidated income 
statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives of between three and 10 years. 
(c) Computer software 
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant or equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset, and 
is amortised through the Consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over its estimated economic life of between three and 
five years. 
(d) Other intangibles 
Other intangibles are amortised through the Consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives 
of between three and five years. 
Impairment of non-current assets 
All non-current assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired. 
Additionally, goodwill and capitalised development expenditure relating to a product that is not yet in full production are subject to an annual 
impairment test. 
An impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated income statement to the extent that an asset’s carrying value exceeds its recoverable 
amount, which represents the higher of the asset’s net realisable value and its value in use. An asset’s value in use represents the present 
value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset or from the cash generating unit to which it relates. The present value 
is calculated using a discount rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
asset concerned. 
Impairment losses recognised in previous periods for an asset other than goodwill are reversed if there has been a change in the estimates 
used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its carrying 
amount had no impairment loss been recognised in previous periods. Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed. 
Segmental reporting 
An operating segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged in business activities from which it may earn revenues 
and incur expenses, and whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the Chief Executive Officer) 
to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information 
is available. 
Reportable segments are operating segments that either meet the thresholds and conditions set out in IFRS 8 or are considered by the 
Board to be appropriately designated as reportable segments. Segment result represents operating profits and includes an allocation 
of head office expenses. Segment result excludes tax and financing items. Segment assets comprise goodwill, other intangible assets, 
property, plant and equipment (excluding land and buildings), inventories, trade and other receivables. Segment liabilities comprise trade 
and other payables, provisions and other payables. Unallocated items represent land and buildings, corporate and deferred taxation 
balances, defined benefit scheme liabilities, contingent purchase consideration, all components of net cash/borrowings and derivative 
financial instruments. 
Foreign currencies 
The Group presents its accounts in Sterling. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of 
the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates 
prevailing at that date. Any gain or loss arising from subsequent exchange rate movements is included as an exchange gain or loss 
in the Consolidated income statement. 
Net assets of overseas subsidiary companies are expressed in Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year, 
and trading results and cash flows at the average rates of exchange for the financial year. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign 
business is treated as an asset of the foreign entity and is translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year. 
Exchange gains or losses arising on these translations are taken to the Hedging and translation reserve within Shareholders’ funds. 
In the event that an overseas subsidiary is disposed of or closed, the profit or loss on disposal or closure will be determined after taking into 
account the cumulative translation difference held within the Hedging and translation reserve attributable to that subsidiary. As permitted 
by IFRS 1, the Group has elected to deem the Hedging and translation to be £nil at 4 April 2004. Accordingly, the profit or loss on disposal 
or closure of foreign subsidiaries will not include any currency translation differences which arose before 4 April 2004. 
Halma p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rate risk using forward exchange 
contracts. Further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in note 26. 
Derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value through profit and loss (held for trading) unless they are in a designated hedge 
relationship. 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their 
fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Consolidated income statement, unless the derivative 
is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the Consolidated income statement 
depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of highly probable forecast 
transactions or hedges of foreign currency risk of firm commitments (cash flow hedges), or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.  
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as 
a financial liability. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument 
is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets 
or current liabilities. 
Cash flow hedge accounting 
The Group designates certain hedging instruments as cash flow hedges.  
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, 
along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception 
of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument has been or is expected to be highly effective 
in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item.  
Note 26 sets out details of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes and the movements in the hedging 
reserve in equity. 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in 
Other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion as a result of being overhedged is recognised immediately 
in Consolidated income statement.  
Amounts previously recognised in Other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to the Consolidated income 
statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the Consolidated income statement. However, when the forecast 
transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously 
accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or  
non-financial liability.  
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated 
or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in Other comprehensive income at that time is 
accumulated in equity and is recognised, when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised, in the Consolidated income statement. 
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in the 
Consolidated income statement.  
Net investment hedge accounting 
The Group uses US Dollar and Euro denominated borrowings as a hedge against the translation exposure on the Group’s net investment 
in overseas companies. Where the hedge is fully effective at hedging the variability in the net assets of such companies caused by changes 
in exchange rates, the changes in value of the borrowings are recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income and accumulated in 
the Hedging and translation reserve. The ineffective part of any change in value caused by changes in exchange rates is recognised in the 
Consolidated income statement. 
Revenue 
Revenue represents sales, less returns, by subsidiary companies to external customers excluding value added tax and other sales related 
taxes. Transactions are recorded as revenue when the delivery of products or performance of services takes place in accordance with the 
contracted terms of sale.

Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less provisions for impairment and depreciation which, with the exception of 
freehold land which is not depreciated, is provided on a straight-line basis over each asset’s estimated economic life. The principal annual 
rates used for this purpose are: 
Freehold property        2% 
Leasehold properties: 
Long leases (more than 50 years unexpired)     2% 
Short leases (less than 50 years unexpired)     Period of lease 
Plant, equipment and vehicles      8% to 33
1
⁄3% 
Leases 
Leases that confer rights and obligations similar to those that attach to owned assets are classified as finance leases, of which the Group 
has none. All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
Operating lease rentals, and any incentives receivable, are charged to the Consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term. 
Pensions 
The Group makes contributions to various pension schemes, covering the majority of its employees. 
For defined benefit schemes, the asset or liability recorded in the balance sheet is the difference between the fair value of the scheme’s 
assets and the present value of the defined obligation at that date. The defined benefit obligation is calculated separately for each scheme 
on an annual basis by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, and are taken to Other comprehensive income. 
Current and past service costs, along with the impact of any settlements or curtailments, are charged to the Consolidated income 
statement. Interest on pension plans’ liabilities are recognised within finance expense and the expected return on the schemes’ assets 
are recognised within finance income in the Consolidated income statement. 
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to the Consolidated income statement when they fall due. 
Employee share schemes 
Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Group’s share incentive plan, the share option plans and the performance 
share plan. 
(a) Share incentive plan 
Awards of shares under the share incentive plan are made to qualifying employees depending on salary and service criteria. The shares 
awarded under this plan are purchased in the market by the plan’s trustees at the time of the award, and are then held in trust for a 
minimum of three years. The costs of this plan are recognised in the Consolidated income statement over the three-year vesting periods 
of the awards. 
(b) Share option plans 
All grants of options under the 1990 and 1996 share option plans and the 1999 company share option plan (together, the ‘share option plans’) 
are equity settled, and so, as permitted by IFRS 1, the provisions of IFRS 2 ‘Share-Based Payment’ have been applied only to options 
awarded on or after 7 November 2002 which had not vested at 3 April 2005. 
The fair value of awards under these plans has been measured at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model and will not be 
subsequently remeasured. The fair value is charged to the Consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected vesting 
period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will ultimately vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. 
The corresponding credit is to Shareholders’ funds. 
No further awards will be made under the share option plans. 
Halma p.l.c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011
81  
 
(c) Performance share plan 
On 3 August 2005 the share option plans were replaced by the performance share plan. 
Awards under this plan are partly equity-settled and partly cash-settled, and are subject to both market based and non-market based 
vesting criteria.  
The fair value of the equity-settled portion at the date of grant is established by using an appropriate simulation method to reflect the 
likelihood of market-based performance conditions being met. The fair value is charged to the Consolidated income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period, with appropriate adjustments being made during this period to reflect expected and actual 
forfeitures arising from the non-market based performance conditions only. The corresponding credit is to Shareholders’ funds. 
For the cash-settled portion, a liability equal to the portion of the services received is recognised at the current fair value determined 
at each balance sheet date. 
Inventories 
Inventories and work in progress are included at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is calculated either on a ‘first in, first out’ 
or an average cost basis and includes direct materials and the appropriate proportion of production and other overheads considered 
by the Directors to be attributable to bringing the inventories to their location and condition at the year end. Net realisable value represents 
the estimated selling price less all estimated costs to complete and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that 
the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance 
sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows 
estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of the cash flows.  
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable 
is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be 
measured reliably. 
Operating profit 
Operating profit is stated after charging restructuring costs but before the share of results of associates, investment income and 
finance costs. 
Taxation 
Taxation comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Consolidated income statement except to the extent that it relates 
to items recognised directly in Shareholders’ funds, in which case it too is recognised in Shareholders’ funds. Current tax is the expected 
tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or subsequently enacted at the balance sheet date, along with 
any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated income 
statement because it excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes 
and the amounts used for taxation purposes and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method, apart from the following 
differences which are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect 
neither accounting nor taxable profit; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent they will probably not reverse 
in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities, using tax rates and laws, which are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset 
is realised. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that recovery is probable. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, deposits with an initial maturity of less than three months, and bank overdrafts that 
are repayable on demand.  
Dividends 
Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the distribution is approved by the 
Company’s shareholders.

1 Segmental analysis 
Sector analysis 
The Group has three main reportable segments (Health and Analysis, Infrastructure Sensors, and Industrial Safety), which are defined 
by markets rather than product type. Each segment includes businesses with similar operating and marketing characteristics. 
These segments are consistent with the internal reporting as reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer.  
During the year, Radio-Tech Limited was moved from the Group’s Industrial Safety segment to its Health and Analysis segment. The prior 
year segment analysis has therefore been restated to reflect this change and to ensure that the presentation is on a consistent basis.

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies. For acquisitions after 3 April 2010, 
acquisition transaction costs and adjustments to contingent purchase consideration are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Segment profit, before these acquisition costs and the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, is disclosed separately above as this is the 
measure reported to the Chief Executive Officer for the purpose of allocation of resources and assessment of segment performance. 
The amortisation of acquired intangible assets, acquisition transaction costs and adjustments to contingent purchase consideration

Information about major customers 
The Group had no revenue from a single customer, which accounts for more than 3% of the Group’s revenue.  
2 Earnings per ordinary share 
Basic earnings per ordinary share are calculated using the weighted average of 376,608,974 shares in issue during the year (net of shares 
purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares) (2010: 375,485,642). Diluted earnings per ordinary share are calculated using the 
weighted average of 377,365,635 shares (2010: 376,513,219), which includes dilutive potential ordinary shares of 756,661 (2010: 1,027,577). 
Dilutive potential ordinary shares are calculated from those exercisable share options where the exercise price is less than the average 
price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year. 
Adjusted earnings are calculated as earnings from continuing operations excluding the amortisation of acquired intangible assets and 
acquisition costs after tax. The Directors consider that adjusted earnings represent a more consistent measure of underlying performance. 
A reconciliation of earnings and the effect on basic earnings per share figures is as follows:

Organic growth 
Organic growth measures the change in revenue and profit from continuing Group operations. The effect of acquisitions and disposals made 
during the current or prior financial year has been equalised by adjusting the current year results for a pro-rated contribution based on their 
revenue and profit before taxation at the date of acquisition or disposal, and has been calculated as follows:

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit 
from that business combination. Before recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows:

* During the year, Radio-Tech Limited was moved from the Group’s Asset Monitoring sub-sector to its Water sub-sector. The prior year has therefore been restated to reflect this 
change and to ensure that the presentation is on a consistent basis. 
Goodwill values have been tested for impairment by comparing them against the value in use in perpetuity of the relevant CGUs. The value 
in use calculations were based on projected cash flows, derived from the latest budget approved by the Board, discounted at the Group’s 
pre-tax estimated short-term discount rate to calculate their net present value.  
Key assumptions used in ‘value in use’ calculations 
The calculation of ‘value in use’ is most sensitive to the following assumptions, which are the same for all CGUs: 
− Discount rates; 
− Market share during the budget period for the financial year to March 2012; and  
− Growth rate used to extrapolate risk adjusted cash flows beyond the budget period. 
Discount rates are based on the Group’s borrowing and equity profile. The Directors do not currently expect any significant change in the 
present base discount rate of 9.05% (2010: 9.84%). The base discount rate of 9.05%, which is pre-tax and is based on short-term variables, 
may differ from the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) used in long-term return measures such as ROTIC. The base discount rate 
was increased to reflect the size of each business and specific geographic and industry factors, resulting in the impairment testing using 
a rate of 13.05%.  
Market share assumptions are important because, as well as the growth rates (as noted below), management assess how each unit’s 
relative position to its competitors might change over the budget period. Management expects each unit’s position to be stable over the 
projected period. 
Growth rate estimates of respectively 3.25%, 2.0% and 1.25% for the first, second and third year onwards into perpetuity following the 
budget year are based on conservative estimates keeping in view past performance growth. 
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions 
Management believes that no reasonable potential change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any unit 
to exceed its recoverable amount.

Although the Group holds only 15% of the voting rights, Optomed Oy is treated as an associate because the Group is one of three investors 
of which two must approve certain major decisions made by the business. The Group also holds 50% of the equity of PSRM Immobilien AG 
(PSRM), which it acquired as part of the Medicel AG business acquisition. PSRM is treated as an associate, and not a subsidiary, because 
the party holding the remaining 50% is considered to exert more control.  
Both associates have a 31 December year end, although results coterminous with the Group’s year end have been consolidated. 
Details of the Group’s associates at 2 April 2011 are as follows:  
Name of associate Country of incorporation Proportion of ownership interest Principal activity
Optomed Oy Finland 15% Design, manufacture and selling

An impairment has been recorded against the trade receivables which the Group believes may not be recoverable. In the case of trade 
receivables that are past due, management makes an assessment of the risk of non-collection, taking into account factors such as previous 
default experience, any disputes or other factors delaying payment and the risk of bankruptcy or other failure of the customer to meet their 
obligations. For trade receivables that are not past due, taking into account good historical collection experience, management records an 
impairment charge only where there is a specific risk of non-collection. 
The fair value of trade and other receivables approximates to book value due to the short-term maturities associated with these items. 
There is no impairment risk identified with regards to prepayments and accrued income or other receivables where no amounts are 
past due.

Dilapidations and empty property provisions 
Dilapidations and empty property provisions exist where the Group has lease contracts under which the unavoidable costs of meeting its 
obligations under the contracts exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under them. The provisions comprise the Directors’ 
best estimates of future payments: 
a) to restore the fabric of buildings to their original condition where it is a condition of the leases prior to return of the properties; and 
b) on vacant properties, the rental costs of which are not expected to be recoverable from subleasing the properties.  
These commitments cover the period from 2011 to 2028, though they predominantly fall due within five years. 
Product warranty 
Product warranty provisions reflect commitments made to customers on the sale of goods in the ordinary course of business and included 
within the Group companies’ standard terms and conditions. Warranty commitments typically apply for a 12-month period. Any warranties 
longer than 12 months are not significant and the provision represents the Directors’ best estimate of the Group’s liability based on 
past experience.  
Legal, contractual and other 
Legal, contractual and other comprise mainly amounts reserved against open legal and contractual disputes. The Company has on occasion 
been required to take legal or other actions to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties. Provisions are made for the 
expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking into account 
professional advice received, and represent Directors’ best estimate of the likely outcome. The timing of utilisation of these provisions is 
frequently uncertain reflecting the complexity of issues and the outcome of various court proceedings and negotiations. Contractual and 
other provisions represent the Directors’ best estimate of the cost of settling future obligations. Unless specific evidence exists to the 
contrary, these reserves are shown as current. 
However, no provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties against Group companies unless the 
Directors, taking into account professional advice received, assesses that it is more likely than not that such proceedings may be successful.

The UK government's budget statement in March 2011 announced a phased reduction in the main UK corporation tax rate from 28% to 23% 
with the first 2% reduction taking effect from 1 April 2011 being substantively enacted on 29 March 2011. This rate reduction has no material 
impact on the financial statements as at 2 April 2011. No account will be taken of the expected further 3% reduction in UK tax rates until 
substantive enactment of these changes. Until this change and other potential changes are enacted it is not possible to identify the impact 
these changes might have. However, for indicative purposes only, had the UK main corporate tax rate been reduced to 23% the net impact 
on recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities at 2 April 2011 would not have been material.

21 Deferred tax continued 
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £16,079,000 (2010: £13,921,000) relating to the unremitted earnings 
of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timings of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that 
they will not reverse in the forseeable future. Temporary timing differences in connection with interests in associates are insignificant. 
At 2 April 2011 the Group had unused capital tax losses of £808,000 (2010: £871,000) for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised.

Share incentive plan 
Shares awarded under this Plan are purchased in the market by the Plan’s trustees at the time of the award and are held in trust until their 
transfer to qualifying employees, which is conditional upon completion of three years’ service. The costs of providing this Plan are 
recognised in the Consolidated income statement over the three-year vesting period.

Share option plans 
The Group has outstanding issued options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company under a share option plan, approved by shareholders 
in 1999. This share option plan provided for the grant of two categories of option, both of which are subject to performance criteria. 
Section A options are exercisable after three years if the Group’s earnings per share growth exceeds the growth in the Retail Price Index 
plus 3% per annum. Section B options are exercisable after five years if the Company’s earnings per share growth exceeds the earnings 
per share of all but the top quarter of companies which were within a peer group at the date of grant of any option. 
All options lapse if not exercised within 10 years from the date of grant.  
No further awards have been made under the Company share option plan since 3 August 2005. 
Options in respect of 2,975,991 ordinary shares remained outstanding at 2 April 2011 under the 1999 Plan. Subject to the performance 
restrictions on the exercise of options granted under this Plan, options are exercisable for the periods and at the prices set out below:

Under the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 only the options awarded in 2004, 2005 and 2006 under the 1999 Plan have been recognised 
under IFRS 2. The fair value of these options was calculated using the Black-Scholes model using the following assumptions: 
2006 2005 2004
Option section A A B A B
Dividend yield  4% 4% 4% 4% 4%
Expected volatility  25% 25% 25% 25% 25%

Fair value per option (p) 24.70 25.71-27.22 29.25 22.18 25.35
The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historic volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous six years. 
Performance share plan 
The performance share plan was approved by shareholders on 3 August 2005 and replaced the previous share option plans from which no 
further grants can be made. 
Awards made under this Plan vest after three years on a sliding scale subject to the Group’s relative Total Shareholder Return against the 
FTSE 250 excluding financial companies, combined with an absolute Return on Total Invested Capital measure. Awards which do not vest 
on the third anniversary of their award lapse. 
A summary of the movements in share awards granted under the performance share plan is as follows: 
 
2011

Outstanding at end of year 4,385,681 4,263,672
Exercisable at end of year – –
The weighted average share price at the date of awards vesting during the year was 271.4p (2010: 197.0p). 
The performance shares outstanding at 2 April 2011 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.4 years (2010: 1.5 years). 
The fair value of these awards was calculated using an appropriate simulation method to reflect the likelihood of the market-based 
performance conditions, which attach to half of the award, being met, using the following assumptions: 
2011 2010 2009
Expected volatility (%) 27% 27.5% 25%

* Tax assets and liabilities of acquisitions in the same tax jurisdiction have been offset where applicable. 
Due to their contractual dates, the fair value of receivables acquired (shown above) approximates to the gross contractual amounts 
receivable. The amount of gross contractual receivables not expected to be recovered is immaterial.  
There are no material contingent liabilities recognised in accordance with paragraph 23 of IFRS 3 (Revised). 
£1,293,000 of the goodwill arising on acquisitions in the year is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
Together, these acquisitions contributed £6,910,000 of revenue and £1,503,000 of profit after tax for the year ended 2 April 2011. If these 
acquisitions had been held since the start of the financial year, it is estimated the Group’s reported revenue and profit after tax would have 
been £25,637,000 and £7,592,000 higher respectively. 
Adjustments were made to the book values of the net assets of the companies acquired to reflect their provisional fair values to the Group. 
Acquired inventories were valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value adopting Group bases and any liabilities for warranties relating 
to past trading were recognised. Other previously unrecognised assets and liabilities at acquisition were included and accounting policies 
were aligned with those of the Group where appropriate. 
The adjustment to goodwill arising on prior year acquisitions related to revisions to the estimated contingent purchase considerations 
payable on Fiberguide Industries, Inc (£1,478,000) and SphereOptics LLC (£459,000).

On 8 March 2011, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Medicel AG, together with its subsidiary Robutec GmbH and 
a 50% owned associate PSRM Immobilien AG (together known as Medicel). Medicel is based in Switzerland and is a leader in the design 
and manufacture of single use injector devices for lenses used in cataract surgery. Medicel forms part of the Health and Analysis sector 
and was acquired to extend the Group’s presence in the ophthalmic surgical instrument market which is forecast to see continued growth. 
The excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the assets acquired is represented by customer-related and 
trademark intangibles of £24.2m and £5.1m respectively, with residual goodwill arising of £38.3m. The goodwill represents the value of the 
acquired workforce and the opportunity to extend Halma’s capability in the medical market. 
The initial consideration was CHF70,000,000 followed by contingent consideration payable on or around May 2012, May 2013 and May 2014 
totalling between CHF nil and CHF30,000,000 dependent on the profits of the acquired business for each of the three years up to March 
2014. The Directors estimate that the maximum earnout of CHF30,000,000 will be paid. 
The Medicel acquisition contributed £576,000 of revenue and £146,000 profit after tax for the year ended 2 April 2011.

On 16 December 2010, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Accudynamics LLC (ADL). ADL is based in Massachusetts, 
USA and manufactures components primarily for the medical diagnostics system and device markets. ADL forms part of the Health 
and Analysis sector and was purchased for the reasons (a) to (c) below. The excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the 
fair value of the assets acquired is represented by customer-related intangibles of £7.2m with residual goodwill arising of £12.8m. 
The goodwill represents: 
a) the value of the acquired workforce; 
b) the ability to offer OEM customers integrated sub-assemblies incorporating components from different Halma companies; and 
c) the ability to exploit the Group’s existing distribution arrangements, particularly outside of North America. 
The initial consideration was US$24,775,000 followed by contingent consideration payable on or around May 2011 of between US$nil and 
US$7,000,000 dependent on the earnings growth of the acquired business for the nine months up to March 2011. The maximum earnout 
of US$7,000,000 was paid in June 2011. 
The ADL acquisition contributed £2,833,000 of revenue and £561,000 of profit after tax for the year ended 2 April 2011.

On 2 November 2010, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Alicat Scientific, Inc. (Alicat). Alicat is based in Arizona, USA 
and is a leading manufacturer of mass flow meters, mass flow controllers, laminar flow meters, volumetric flow meters, pressure meters 
and gauges used in life science and industrial applications requiring high precision measurement of fluid flows. Alicat forms part of the 
Health and Analysis sector and was acquired for the additional strength it brings to our Fluid Technology product range. The excess of the 
fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the assets acquired is represented by customer-related and trademark intangibles 
of £4.9m and £1.5m respectively with residual goodwill arising of £11.0m. The goodwill represents the value of the acquired workforce, 
cross-selling opportunities and the ability to exploit the Group’s existing distribution arrangements, particularly in Asia. 
The initial consideration was US$26,254,000. There are no contingent consideration payment arrangements. 
The Alicat acquisition contributed £2,958,000 of revenue and £789,000 of profit after tax for the year ended 2 April 2011.

but is subject to further consideration based on net asset valuations and contingent consideration. Guromed is a distributor of diagnostic 
instruments. The acquired business is within the Health and Analysis sector. 
The excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the assets acquired is represented by customer-related and 
trademark intangibles of £0.7m and £0.9m respectively, with residual goodwill arising of £2.9m. The goodwill represents the value of the 
acquired workforces, cross-selling opportunities, and the ability to exploit the Group’s distribution arrangements. 
Together, the above acquisitions contributed £543,000 of revenue and £7,000 of profit after tax for the year ended 2 April 2011.

Policy 
The Group’s treasury policies seek to minimise financial risks and to ensure sufficient liquidity for the Group’s operations and strategic 
plans. No complex derivative financial instruments are used, and no trading or speculative transactions in financial instruments are 
undertaken. Where the Group does use financial instruments these are mainly to manage the currency risks arising from normal 
operations and its financing. Operations are financed mainly through retained profits and, in certain geographical locations, bank 
borrowings. Foreign currency risk is the most significant aspect for the Group in the area of financial instruments. It is exposed to a lesser 
extent to other risks such as interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks 
and these policies are summarised below. The Group’s policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the financial year. 
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted (including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and 
the bases of recognition income and expenses) for each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed 
in the Accounting policies note.  
Capital risk management 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return 
to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes 
the borrowings disclosed in note 17 to the Accounts, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, 
comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. 
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements. 
Foreign currency risk 
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk as a consequence of both trading with foreign companies and owning subsidiaries located 
in foreign countries. 
The Group earns a significant proportion of its profit in currencies other than Sterling. This gives rise to translational currency risk, where 
the Sterling value of profits earned by the Group’s foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with the strength of Sterling relative to their operating 
(or ‘functional’) currencies. The Group does not hedge this risk, so its reported profit is sensitive to the strength of Sterling, particularly 
against the US Dollar and Euro. The Group also has transactional currency exposures. These arise on sales or purchases by operating 
companies in currencies other than the companies’ operating (or ‘functional’) currency. Significant sales and purchases are matched 
where possible and a proportion of the net exposure is hedged by means of forward foreign currency contracts. 
The Group has a significant investment in overseas operations in the USA and EU, with further investments in Australia, New Zealand, 
Singapore, Switzerland, China and India. As a result, the Group’s balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries’ exchange 
rates. Where significant and appropriate, currency denominated net assets are hedged by currency borrowings. These currency exposures 
are reviewed regularly.  
Interest rate risk 
The Group is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and cash deposits. Where bank borrowings are used to finance 
operations they tend to be short term with floating interest rates. Borrowings used to provide longer term funding are drawn on 
the Group’s loan facilities and have fixed interest rates with maturities of not more than one year. 
Surplus funds are placed on short-term fixed rate deposit or in floating rate deposit accounts. 
Credit risk 
Credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The 
Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. 
Credit ratings are supplied by independent agencies where available, and if not available, the Group uses other publicly available financial 
information and its own trading records to rate its major customers. The Group’s exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are 
continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties. Credit exposure 
is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed regularly. 
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas. Ongoing credit 
evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover 
is purchased.  
The carrying amount of trade, tax and other receivables, derivative financial instruments and cash of £153,630,000 (2010: £130,699,000) 
represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk as no collateral or other credit enhancements are held. 
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings 
assigned by international credit-rating agencies.

Liquidity risk 
The main source of long-term funding for the Group is its unsecured revolving credit facility for £165m, which is a five-year facility 
to February 2013, with a small syndicate of its principal bankers. 
The Group has a strong cash flow and the funds generated by operating companies are managed regionally based on geographic location.  
Funds are placed on deposit with secure, highly-rated banks. For short-term working capital purposes, most operating companies utilise 
local bank overdrafts. These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility. Because of 
the nature of their use, the facilities are typically ‘on demand’ and as such uncommitted. Overdraft facilities are typically renewed annually. 
Currency exposures 
Translational exposures 
It is estimated, by reference to the Group’s US Dollar and Euro denominated profits, that a one per cent change in the value of the US Dollar 
relative to Sterling would have had a £337,000 (2010: £285,000) impact on the Group’s reported profit before tax; and a one per cent change 
in the value of the Euro relative to the Sterling would have had a £204,000 (2010: £204,000) impact on the Group’s profit before tax for the 
year ended 2 April 2011. 
Transactional exposures  
The Group has net foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities that are assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency 
of the underlying company. These comprise cash and overdrafts as well as certain trade receivable and payable balances. These foreign 
currency monetary assets and liabilities give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the Consolidated income statement 
as a result of movement in exchange rates. The exposures are predominantly Euro and US Dollar. Group policy is for a significant portion 
of foreign currency exposures, including sales and purchases, to be hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts in the company in which 
the transaction is recorded.  
Interest rate risk profile 
The Group’s financial assets which are subject to interest rate fluctuations comprise interest bearing cash equivalents which totalled 
£3,190,000 at 2 April 2011 (2010: £2,344,000). These comprised Sterling denominated deposits of £2,700,000 (2010: £1,591,000), and Euro, 
US Dollar and other currency deposits of £490,000 (2010: £753,000) which are placed on local money markets and earn interest at market 
rates. Cash balances of £39,420,000 (2010: £28,979,000) earn interest at local market rates. 
The financial liabilities which are subject to interest rate fluctuations comprise bank loans, bank overdrafts and certain unsecured loans, 
which totalled £79,688,000 at 2 April 2011 (2010: £22,241,000). All bank loans bear interest at floating rates or fixed rates where the fixed 
period is typically no more than three months. Interest rates are based on the LIBOR of the currency in which the liabilities arise plus 
a small margin. Bank overdrafts bear interest at local base rates.

Total interest bearing financial liabilities 79,688 22,241
At 2 April 2011 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would reduce the Group’s profit before tax 
by £478,000 (2010: £510,000).  
Maturity of financial liabilities 
With the exception of the contingent purchase consideration, other payables, provisions and borrowings due after one year, all of the Group’s 
financial liabilities mature in one year or less or on demand. The total of the contractual contingent purchase consideration due after one 
year includes £8,164,000 (2010: £946,000) due between one and two years, with the balance of £13,290,000 (2010: £893,000) due between two 
and five years. Other creditors due after more than one year include £725,000 (2010: £1,758,000) due between one and two years, £284,000 
(2010: £279,000) due between two and five years, with the balance of £684,000 (2010: £678,000) due after more than five years.

Borrowing facilities 
The Group’s principal source of long-term funding is its unsecured five-year £165 million revolving credit facility, which expires in 
February 2013. 
Short-term operational funding is provided by cash generated from operations and by local bank overdrafts. These overdraft facilities 
are uncommitted and are generally renewed on an annual or ongoing basis and hence the facilities expire within one year or less. 
The Group’s undrawn committed facilities available at 2 April 2011 were £100,312,000 (2010: £158,762,000) of which £15,000,000 
(2010: £15,686,000) mature within one year and £85,312,000 (2010: £143,076,000) between two and five years. 
UK companies have cross-guaranteed £17,670,000 (2010: £20,684,000) of overdraft facilities of which £nil (2010: £169,000) was drawn. 
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities 
As at 2 April 2011 and 3 April 2010 there were no significant differences between the book value and fair value (as determined by market 
value) of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities.

The fair value of the floating and fixed rate borrowings approximate to the carrying value because interest rates are reset to market rates at 
intervals of less than one year.  
The fair value of the derivative financial instruments is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow, using readily available 
market data and represents a level 2 measurement in the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.

Hedging 
As explained previously, the Group’s policy is to hedge significant sales and purchases denominated in foreign currency using forward 
currency contracts. These instruments are initially recognised at fair value, which is typically £nil, and subsequent changes in fair value 
are taken to the Consolidated Income Statement, unless hedge accounted. 
The following table details the forward foreign currency contracts outstanding as at the year end, which all mature within one year and 
therefore the cash flows and resulting effect on profit and loss are expected to occur within the next 12 months:

Market risk 
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Group enters into 
derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk, including: 
− forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the export of goods to and from the USA, mainland 
Europe and the UK; and 
− foreign exchange loans to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on translation of the Group’s investment in foreign operations which 
have the Euro and Swiss Franc as their functional currencies. 
Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis as described below.  
There has been no change to the Group’s exposure to market risks or in the manner in which these risks are managed and measured.  
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis 
The Group is mainly exposed to the currency of the USA (US Dollar currency) and the currency of Mainland Europe (Euro currency).  
The carrying amount of the Group’s Euro and US Dollar denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are 
as follows: 
Assets Liabilities

US Dollar 95,572 82,589 23,308 16,973
If Sterling increased by 10% against the US Dollar and the Euro, profits before taxation and other equity would decrease as follows: 
US Dollar Euro

Profit 3,097 2,620 1,871 1,871
Other equity 6,144 6,951 4,655 13,706
The profit sensitivity arises mainly from the translation of overseas profits earned during the year. 10% is the sensitivity rate which 
management assesses to be a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s profit sensitivity has increased against 
the US Dollar because more of the Group’s profits are earned in this currency.  
27 Commitments 
Capital commitments 
Capital expenditure authorised and contracted at 2 April 2011 but not provided in these accounts amounts to £920,000 (2010: £740,000). 
Commitments under operating leases 
The Group has entered into commercial leases on properties and other equipment. The former expire between April 2011 and November 
2014 and the latter between April 2011 and November 2028. Only certain property agreements contain an option for renewal at rental prices 
based on market prices at the time of exercise.

28 Retirement benefits 
Group companies operate both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes. The Halma Group Pension Plan and the Apollo 
Pension and Life Assurance Plan have defined benefit sections with assets held in separate trustee administered funds. Both of these 
sections were closed to new entrants during 2002/03 and a defined contribution section was established within the Halma Group Pension 
Plan. Defined contribution schemes are mainly adopted in overseas subsidiaries. 
Defined contribution schemes 
The amount charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of defined contribution schemes was £2,495,000 (2010: £2,433,000) 
and represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans. The assets of the schemes 
are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees. Where there are employees who leave the schemes prior 
to vesting fully in the contributions, the ancillary contributions payable by the Group are reduced by the amount of forfeited contributions. 
Defined benefit schemes 
The Group operates defined benefit schemes for qualifying employees of its UK subsidiaries. Under the schemes, the employees are entitled 
to retirement benefits of up to two-thirds of final pensionable salary on attainment of a retirement age of 60, for members of the Executive 
Board, and 65, for all other qualifying employees. No other post-retirement benefits are provided. The schemes are funded schemes. 
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Halma Group Pension Plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation was 
carried out at 1 December 2008 by Mr Adrian Gibbons, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries. The present value of the defined benefit obligation, 
the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method. Mr Gibbons also carried out 
the 1 April 2009 actuarial valuation of the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan on the same basis. 
The projected unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the scheme liabilities make allowance for projected 
earnings. The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) is an actuarial measure of the present value for service already rendered but differs 
from the projected unit credit method in that it includes no assumptions for future salary increases. At the balance sheet date the gross 
accumulated benefit obligation was £177m.  
An alternative method of valuation is a solvency basis, often estimated using the cost of buying out benefits at the balance sheet date with 
a suitable insurance company. This amount represents the amount that would be required to settle the scheme liabilities at the balance 
sheet date rather than the Group continuing to fund the ongoing liabilities of the scheme. The Group estimates that this would amount 
to £268m.

The overall expected rate of return is a weighted average. 
In July 2010, the UK government announced that CPI should be used as the basis for statutory minimum pension increases. The impact 
of the change to CPI (from RPI) for the UK plan, where the pension rules mandate inflation according to the deemed statutory index, 
was a credit to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure of £2.5m. 
In conjunction with the trustees, the Group has recently conducted an asset-liability review for its defined benefit pension scheme. 
The results of this review are used to assist the trustees and the Group to determine the optimal long-term asset allocation with regard to 
the structure of the liabilities of the scheme. They are also used to assist the trustees in managing the volatility in the underlying investment 
performance and risk of a significant increase in the defined benefit deficit by providing information used to determine the scheme’s 
investment strategy.  
As a consequence, the Group will be giving more emphasis to a closer return matching of scheme assets and liabilities, both to ensure the 
long-term security of our defined benefit commitment and to reduce earnings and balance sheet volatility.

The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid to the schemes during the year ending 31 March 2012 is £8.5m. 
The levels of contributions are based on the current service cost and the expected future cash flows of the defined benefit scheme. 
The Group estimates the scheme liabilities on average to fall due over 19 and 25 years, respectively, for the Halma and Apollo plans. 
29 Disposal of businesses 
The Group did not dispose of any businesses during the year. During 2010, the Group disposed of part of its Asset Monitoring business for 
£520,000 with a profit on disposal of £407,000. There was an additional write down on a prior year disposal of £25,000. Due to the nature and 
size of these disposed operations, they were not separately disclosed as discontinued operations as defined by IFRS 5. 
30 Events after the balance sheet date 
On 9 May 2011 the Group acquired Kirk Key Interlock Company, LLC (Kirk Key) for a cash consideration of US$14.7m. Kirk Key 
manufactures and sells key interlocks and key interlock systems. Due to the proximity of the acquisition date to the date of approval of the 
Annual Report, it is impracticable to provide further information.

11 4 Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts continued Independent Auditor’ s Report to the 
Members of Halma p.l.c. 
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Halma p.l.c. for the 52 week period ended 2 April 2011 which comprise 
the parent company Balance Sheet and the related notes C1 to C12. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent 
company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the Financial Statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report. 
Opinion on Financial Statements 
In our opinion the parent company financial statements: 
− give a true and fair view of the state of the parent company’s affairs as at 2 April 2011; 
− have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
− have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
− the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and 
− the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
parent company financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: 
− adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or 
− the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or 
− certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
− we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Halma p.l.c. for the 52 week period ended 2 April 2011.

11 6 Financial Statements Notes to the Company Accounts 
 
C1 Accounting Policies 
Basis of preparation 
The separate Company financial statements are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006 and have been prepared on the historical 
cost basis and comply with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law. The principal Company accounting policies have been 
applied consistently throughout the current and preceding years and are described below. 
Related parties 
The Company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ from disclosing transactions with other members of the 
Halma Group. 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currency are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates prevailing at that date. Any gain or loss arising 
from subsequent exchange rate movements is included as an exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss account. 
Share-based payments 
The Company has adopted FRS 20 and the accounting policies followed are in all material respects the same as the Group’s policy under 
IFRS 2. This policy is shown on page 81. 
Investments 
Investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment. 
Fixed assets and depreciation 
Fixed assets are stated at cost less provisions for impairment and depreciation which, with the exception of freehold land which is not 
depreciated, is provided on all fixed assets on the straight-line method, each item being written off over its estimated life. The principal 
annual rates used for this purpose are: 
Freehold property     2% 
Plant, equipment and vehicles   8% to 20% 
Leases 
The costs of operating leases of property and other assets are charged as incurred. 
Pensions 
The Company makes contributions to defined contribution pension plans, which are charged against profits when they become payable. 
The Company also participates in a Group-wide defined benefit pension plan. This plan is operated on a basis that does not enable 
individual companies to identify their share of the underlying assets and liabilities, and in accordance with Financial Reporting 
Standard 17 the Company accounts for its contributions to the plan as if it was a defined contribution plan. 
Taxation 
Taxation comprises current and deferred tax. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable, on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted, or substantially enacted, at the balance 
sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
The Company provides for tax deferred because of timing differences between profits as computed for taxation purposes and profits 
as stated in the accounts, on an undiscounted basis. Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in 
the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially 
enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are only recognised if recovery is considered more likely than not on the basis 
of all available evidence. 
Bank borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including 
direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in profit or loss and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the 
extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.

The increase in the current year of £46,310,000 related to the Company’s increased investment in one of its subsidiaries. The reduction in 
the prior year related to write down of investments in non-trading subsidiary companies after one company’s reserves were distributed as 
dividends to Halma p.l.c. and three other companies’ trade, assets and liabilities were transferred to fellow subsidiary companies.  
Details of principal subsidiary companies are set out on pages 124 to 127. Halma p.l.c. owns 100% of the ordinary share capital of all its 
subsidiaries, which are incorporated in Great Britain, other than those listed below, where they principally operate. All of the companies’ 
interests below are held by subsidiary companies.

Investor information 
Visit our website, www.halma.com , for investor information and Company news. In addition to accessing financial data, you can view and 
download Annual and Half Year Reports, analyst presentations, find contact details for Halma senior executives and subsidiary companies 
and access links to Halma subsidiary websites. You can also subscribe to an e-mail news alert service to automatically receive an e-mail 
when significant announcements are made. 
Shareholding information 
Please contact our registrars, Computershare, directly for all enquiries about your shareholding. Visit their Investor Centre website for 
online information about your shareholding (you will need your shareholder reference number which can be found on your share 
certificate or dividend tax voucher), or telephone the registrars direct using the dedicated telephone number for Halma shareholders 
(+44 (0)870 707 1046). 
Dividend mandate 
Shareholders can arrange to have their dividends paid directly into their bank or building society account by completing a bank mandate 
form. The advantages to using this service are: the payment is more secure than sending a cheque through the post; it avoids the 
inconvenience of paying in a cheque and there is no risk of lost, stolen or out of date cheques. A mandate form can be obtained from 
Computershare or you will find one on the reverse of the tax voucher of your last dividend payment. 
Dividend reinvestment plan 
The Company operates a dividend reinvestment plan (‘DRIP’) which offers shareholders the option to elect to have their cash dividends 
reinvested in Halma ordinary shares purchased in the market. You can register for the DRIP online by visiting Computershare’s Investor 
Centre website (as above) or by requesting an application form direct from Computershare. Shareholders who wish to elect for the DRIP 
for the forthcoming final dividend, but have not already done so, should return a DRIP application form to Computershare no later than 
3 August 2011. 
American Depositary Receipts 
The Halma p.l.c. American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are traded on the Over The Counter market (OTC) under the symbol HLMLY. 
One ADR represents three Halma p.l.c. ordinary shares. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is the depositary. If you should have any queries, 
please contact: 
JPMorgan Chase & Co, PO Box 64504, St Paul, MN 55164-0504, USA. E-mail: jpmorgan.adr@wellsfargo.com. Telephone number for 
general queries: (800) 990 1135. Telephone number from outside the USA: +1 651 453 2128. 
Electronic communications 
All shareholder communications, including the Company’s Annual Report and Accounts, are made available to shareholders on the 
Halma website and you may opt to receive e-mail notification that documents and information are available to view and download rather 
than to receive paper copies through the post. Using electronic communications helps us to limit the amount of paper we use and assists 
us in reducing our costs. If you would like to sign up for this service, visit Computershare’s Investor Centre website, selecting ‘Electronic 
Shareholder Communications’ and follow the registration process. You may change the way you receive communications at any time by 
contacting Computershare. 
Share dealing facilities 
A low cost telephone dealing service has been arranged with Stocktrade which provides a simple way for buying or selling Halma shares. 
Basic commission is 0.5% up to £10,000, reducing to 0.2% thereafter (subject to a minimum commission of £15). For further information 
please call 0845 601 0995 and quote reference Low Co0198. 
Annual General Meeting 
The 117th Annual General Meeting of Halma p.l.c. will be held in the Ballroom at The Berkeley Hotel, Wilton Place, London SW1X 7RL on

FORM OF PROXY INSERT Curidium is a company focused on 
identifying targeted medicines to 
treat patients more effectively.
Through the application of its proprietary technology, 
Homomatrix
®
, Curidium analyses biological data 
(gene expression / protein data) from patients 
suffering from complex or multi-factorial diseases. 
Patient populations with complex disorders are 
known to be heterogeneous and only certain 
subgroups of patients respond to a specific 
treatment. Curidium believes that Homomatrix
®
 
will ultimately allow for the development of the 
right drug for the right patient. 
Curidium Medica plc was formed by the reverse 
acquisition of Curidium Limited by Cielo Holdings 
plc and the re-admission of the enlarged Group 
to the Alternate Investment Market of the London 
Stock Exchange on 6
th
 July 2006. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS
• Reverse takeover and re-admission of enlarged Group to AIM.
• Expanded research programmes in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
• Management team enlarged.
• Identiﬁcation of four unique patient subgroups in schizophrenia
and bipolar disorder.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I am very pleased to say that 2006 has seen signiﬁcant and very positive developments for 
Curidium Medica plc. Through the application of the Company’s Homomatrix
®
 technology, 
efforts to bring the right drug to the right patient have been substantially advanced.
within the biopharma industry to commercialise the 
resultant intellectual property. Curidium is now in the 
position to offer support in the area of drug discovery 
and development as well as provide unique and novel 
drug targets to the industry in the schizophrenia/bipolar 
disorder area. The Company naturally intends to broaden 
its efforts and is examining other diseases that could 
be amenable to Homomatrix
®
 analysis. 
Overall, the area of personalised medicine and targeted 
drug therapy is an exciting and expanding arena. While 
we believe that we are well positioned and poised to 
exploit our knowledge, expertise and Homomatrix
®
 
technology, we are aware that this is an area that will 
become increasingly competitive. 
Results The ﬁnancial results for the year ended 31
st
 
December 2006 were in line with our expectations 
and show a healthy increase of 147% in Research 
and Development expenditure to £304,712 (2005: 
£123,212). Losses before tax increased to £945,036 
(2005: £224,716) reﬂecting the increase in R&D and 
the costs of the reverse take over and associated 
private placing. Cash burn has been and is closely 
monitored and the Group consumed £627,290 cash 
in the year (2005: £245,049).
In closing, I would especially like to thank the directors 
and staff at Curidium for all of their hard work and 
commitment during this past year and to thank our 
shareholders for their ongoing support. I wish my 
successor Dr Gosse Bruinsma and all the staff best 
wishes for the future.

th
 April 2007
In July, the reverse acquisition of Curidium Limited by 
Cielo Holdings plc was accomplished which resulted 
in the listing of the enlarged group on AIM. This was 
accompanied by a private placement, strengthening 
the ﬁnancial foundation of the Company. As the 
ﬁnal element of the transition to a public market a 
process was initiated to strengthen the executive 
management of Curidium. I am therefore delighted by 
the appointment of Dr Gosse Bruinsma as Executive 
Chairman. With signiﬁcant relevant clinical experience 
and as the former CEO of Axonyx Inc a specialist 
CNS focused, US listed biotech, Gosse brings the 
necessary experience to lead Curidium forward in 
the next stage of its growth. 
The development of Curidium’s core technology, 
Homomatrix
®
, was completed during the course of the 
year to the stage of being a fully automated data analysis 
system. Its applicability and unique approach to assess 
large gene expression datasets of heterogeneous patient 
populations was successfully validated in schizophrenia/
bipolar disorder patients. Homomatrix
®
 repeatedly 
showed that within these diseases there are in fact distinct 
and signiﬁcantly different subgroups of patients; each 
subgroup potentially responsive to different drugs or drug 
combinations. These ﬁndings are important as there is 
much concern at regulatory and pharmaco-economic levels 
that currently marketed drugs are wanting as many patients 
simply do not respond adequately to their prescribed 
treatment. Homomatrix
®
 analyses of gene expression 
data may lead to the development of diagnostic tools 
that in turn allow the prescription of the right drug to 
the diagnosed patient with consequent improvements 
in clinical outcome and cost effectiveness.
The Company is ﬁnalising its investigation and review 
of these exciting ﬁrst Homomatrix
®
 analysis results 
and has initiated a business development programme  6 www.curidium.com
The test is aimed to help drug prescribers, such 
as psychiatrists, to select the most effective drug 
treatment for a patient; an approach that should beneﬁt 
both patients as well as healthcare payers. This is an 
exciting development as drugs presently used to treat 
heterogeneous human diseases, such as schizophrenia 
or bipolar disorder, are often effective in only a minority 
of patients and may cause serious side effects. 
Curidium, using its core technology, Homomatrix
®
, to 
analyse gene expression proﬁles, initially demonstrated 
the existence of four different patient groups in the brain 
samples (obtained post-mortem) from two independent 
cohorts of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients. These 
subgroups were found to be represented by four statistically 
signiﬁcantly different gene expression proﬁles. 
We extended these studies of brain samples by 
investigating samples of blood from schizophrenia and 
bipolar disorder patients with the aim to develop: 
1.  A diagnostic blood test that could provide physicians 
with information on the patient subgroup a patient 
belongs to, and
2.  A guide, for physicians, as to which drug would most 
likely be effective for each patient, and 
3.  A tool to help the pharmaceutical industry develop 
novel and effective drug treatments for speciﬁc 
patient groups
During 2006, Curidium has invested its resources towards the development of a diagnostic 
blood test that could enable the classiﬁcation of a schizophrenia or bipolar disorder patient 
into one of four different patient subgroups. 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
Figure 1: 3-D Overview of the Four Different 
Schizophrenia / Bipolar Disorder Patient Subgroups 
as Identiﬁed in Blood Samples.
Schizophrenia/bipolar disorder patients, characterised 
by their different gene expression proﬁles in blood, 
have been mapped in a 3-D space. The subgroups 
have been indicated in different colours. 
The gene expression profiles of the subgroups, 
identiﬁed using Curidium’s Homomatrix
®
 technology, 
were found to be statistically signiﬁcantly different. 
The analysis of the blood samples again identiﬁed four 
distinct patient subgroups (see Figure 1) with statistically 
signiﬁcantly different gene expression proﬁles (Figure 2). 
We believe that this is the ﬁrst time that the existence 
of four distinct subgroups has been demonstrated 
using gene expression proﬁles in blood samples of 
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients. Figure 1 7 curidium annual report & accounts 2006
We are now studying the gene networks and disease mechanisms that underlie the speciﬁc 
expression proﬁles for each of the patient subgroups in order to identify the most suitable 
drug targets for each. This approach may lead to the development of drugs that can 
speciﬁcally and effectively treat the different patient groups.
 
Figure 2: Overview of the Different Gene Expression 
Proﬁles in Blood Samples from Schizophrenia / 
Bipolar Patients
Graphic overview of the different blood gene 
expression proﬁles found in schizophrenia/ bipolar 
disorder patients.
Each bar represents a gene whose expression is 
altered in that patient subgroup. The colours indicate 
the different gene clusters a gene belongs to, which 
in turn may indicate different gene networks and 
mechanisms involved in a subgroup. 
A selection of these genes will be used for the development 
of a blood diagnostic test that may be used to classify a 
patient in one of the four patient subgroups. 
As the regulatory agencies and pharmaco-economic 
pressures increasingly call for more effective drugs, we 
believe that “personalised” or “targeted” medicines 
represent the next generation of drugs. 
We, at Curidium, have set out to fully exploit our core 
Homomatrix
®
 technology to develop, in partnership 
with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, 
targeted medicines for speciﬁc patient subgroups for 
a range of heterogeneous human diseases, including 
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. 
Finally, 2006 has been an important year for Curidium 
with the completion of the reverse takeover by Cielo 
Holdings and Curidium Medica’s listing on AIM. 
The newly raised funds have allowed the Company 
to automate, and validate Homomatrix
®
, and to 
initiate the execution of our business strategy as 
well as strengthen our position as a personalised 
medicine company.
These successes have called for an expansion of 
Curidium’s management team and board of directors 
and I am very pleased with the arrival of Dr Gosse 
B. Bruinsma as Executive Chairman and Dr Phyllis 
Whiteley as non-executive director of Curidium 
Medica plc. I am indebted to our outgoing chairman, 
Simon Cartmell, who I would like to thank for his 
commitment and efforts over the past three years 
supporting the growth of the Company from its 
very early stages. I wish him all the best in his other 
healthcare endeavours.

The Directors have pleasure in submitting this report together with the accounts of Curidium Medica plc (‘the Company’) and its subsidiary 
undertakings (together ‘the Group’) for the period ended 31
st
 December 2006.
Principal Activities and Results
The Group’s principal activity is the development and commercialisation of companion diagnostics and of targeted medicines to treat 
patients more effectively.
Through the application of its proprietary technology, Homomatrix
®
, Curidium analyses biological data (gene expression /protein data) from 
patients suffering from complex or multi-factorial diseases. Patient populations with complex disorders are known to be heterogeneous 
and only certain subgroups of patients respond to a speciﬁc treatment. Curidium believes that Homomatrix
®
 will ultimately allow for the 
development of the right drug for the right patient. The Company ﬁles patents around the genes and drug targets that are associated with 
the speciﬁc subgroups of patients.
The Group loss after taxation amounted to £884,306.
Review of the business
A review of the business of the Group, together with comments on future developments is given in the Chairman’s Statement on page 5 
and the Chief Executive’s Report on pages 6 and 7.
Research and Development
The Group’s activities in this ﬁeld relate to the development of Homomatrix
®
, the Group’s proprietary technology for identifying the 
underlying mechanisms of human diseases. Since the balance sheet date the Group has announced that it has identiﬁed four unique 
patient subgroups in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, based on two brain studies and a blood study. The Directors believe this to be 
an important discovery that could improve the development of effective drug therapies for these conditions and will continue to focus its 
Research and Development activities in this area.

Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. Company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements 
for each ﬁnancial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and Group and of the proﬁt or loss for that 
period.  In preparing those ﬁnancial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
ﬁnancial statements;
• prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial 
position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.  They have 
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect 
fraud and other irregularities.
DIRECTORS’ REPORT 11 curidium annual report & accounts 2006
Financial risk management policies
Financial risk factors and management
The Group’s principal ﬁnancial instruments comprise cash and short-term deposits. The main purpose of these ﬁnancial instruments is to 
provide working capital and investment funds for the Group’s business and product development activities. The Group has various other 
ﬁnancial instruments such as trade and other receivables and trade and other payables, which arise directly from its operations.
Interest rate risk
The main risk arising from the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments is changes in interest rates. The Board’s policy toward cash deposits is to deposit 
cash short term in interest bearing bank deposit accounts.
Credit risk
The Group’ s credit risk is primarily attributed to other receivables. The maximum credit risk exposure of the Group comprises the amounts presented 
in the balance sheet that are stated net of provisions, where appropriate. A provision is made where there is an identiﬁed loss event which, based 
on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of future cash ﬂows. The majority of the Group’ s other receivables are with 
public bodies (HM Revenue and Customs). The Group does not consider these counterparties to be a signiﬁcant credit risk.
Statement to Auditors
As far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware and they have taken 
all the steps they ought to have taken as Directors in order to make themselves aware of any relevant information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.

In addition we report to you if in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding the directors’ remuneration and other 
transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report, comprising only the Directors’ report and Chairman’s statement, and consider 
the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements. 
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An 
audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements. It also includes 
an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements, and of 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide 
us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in 
the ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the group's and 
the parent company's affairs as at 31
st
 December 2006 and of the group and the parent company’s loss for the period then ended; 
• the ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the group ﬁnancial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation;
• the information given in the Directors' Report is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements

CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW INFORMATION
SUMMARY CASH FLOW STATEMENT 17 curidium annual report & accounts 2006
1) GENERAL INFORMATION 
Curidium Medica plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985. The address of the registered 
ofﬁce is given on page 9. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Chairman’s Statement on page 
5 and in the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s review on pages 6 and 7. 
These ﬁnancial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
the group operates. There are no foreign operations in the Group. 
2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Basis of Accounting 
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) for the ﬁrst time. 
The disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRSs are given in note 25. 
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Change of Name
At an Extraordinary General Meeting held on the 5
th
 July 2006 the Company changed its name from Cielo Holdings plc to Curidium Medica plc.
Basis of Consolidation 
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements incorporate the ﬁnancial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its 
subsidiaries) made up to 31
st
 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the ﬁnancial and 
operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain beneﬁts from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. 
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identiﬁable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deﬁciency of 
the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identiﬁable net assets acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to proﬁt and loss 
in the period of acquisition. The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minority’s proportion of the fair values of the assets and 
liabilities recognised. Subsequently, any losses applicable to the minority interest in excess of the minority interest are allocated against 
the interests of the parent. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
On 5
th
 July 2006 the shareholders approved the business combination of the Company and Curidium Limited, under the AIM rules and 
IFRS this transaction meets the criteria of a Reverse Takeover. The consolidated accounts have therefore been presented under the Reverse 
Accounting principles of IFRS 3 and show comparatives for Curidium Limited. The ﬁnancial statements for Curidium Medica plc are shown 
in notes 26 to 40. For ﬁnancial reporting purposes Curidium Limited (the legal subsidiary) is the aquirer and Curidium Medica plc (the legal 
parent) the acquiree.
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements prepared following the reverse are issued in the name of Curidium Medica plc, but they are a 
continuance of the ﬁnancial statements of Curidium Limited. Therefore the assets and liabilities of Curidium Limited have been recognised 
and measured in these consolidated ﬁnancial statements at their pre-combination carrying values. The retained earnings and other equity 
balances recognised in these consolidated ﬁnancial statements are the retained earnings and other equity balances of Curidium Limited 
immediately before the business combination.
The amount recognised as issued equity instruments in these consolidated ﬁnancial statements has been determined by adding the issued 
equity of Curidium Limited immediately before the business combination to the cost of the consideration as set out on note 19. However, 
the equity structure appearing in these consolidated ﬁnancial statements (the number and type of equity instruments issued) reﬂect the 
equity structure of Curidium Medica plc, including equity instruments issued by the Company to effect the consolidation.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with 
those used by the Group. 
Control
Curidium Medica plc is listed on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange.  At the date of the Annual Report in 
the Directors’ opinion there is no controlling party.
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identiﬁable 
assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in proﬁt or 
loss and is not subsequently reversed. 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2006 18 www.curidium.com
Revenue Recognition 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services 
provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes. 
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed. Sales of services are recognised when the service has been 
performed and invoiced.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, 
which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the ﬁnancial asset to that asset’s 
net carrying amount. 
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established. 
Foreign Currencies 
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At 
each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing 
on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated 
at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net proﬁt 
or loss for the period, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are 
recognised directly in equity. 
Loss from Operations 
Loss from operations is stated before investment income and ﬁnance costs. 
Taxation 
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁt for the year. Taxable proﬁt differs from net proﬁt as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁt, and is accounted for using the balance sheet 
liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such 
assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax proﬁt nor the accounting proﬁt.
 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests 
in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which 
case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. 
Internally generated Intangible Assets - Research and Development Expenditure 
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. 
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s Homomatrix
®
 development is recognised only if all of the following 
conditions are met: 
• an asset is created that can be identiﬁed (such as software and new processes); 
• it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic beneﬁts; and 
• the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably. 
Internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Where no internally-generated intangible 
asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2006 19 curidium annual report & accounts 2006
Patents and Trademarks 
Patents and trademarks are measured initially at purchase cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. 
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill 
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated 
in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash ﬂows that are independent from 
other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with 
an indeﬁnite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂows 
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks speciﬁc to the asset for which the estimates of future cash ﬂows have not been adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the 
relevant asset is carried at a re-valued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment 
loss is treated as a revaluation increase. 
Financial Instruments 
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts. 
Trade payables 
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value. 
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Share-based Payments 
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been 
applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7
th
 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1
st
 January 2005. 
The Group issues equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are 
measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. 
Fair value is measured by use of a binomial model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best 
estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. 
A liability equal to the portion of the goods or services received is recognised at the current fair value determined at each balance sheet 
date for cash-settled share-based payments. 
3) REVENUE 
The Group had no revenue during the year ended 31
st
 December 2006 (2005: Nil). 
4) BUSINESS AND GEOGRAPHICAL SEGMENTS Business Segments 
For management purposes, the Group is currently organised into a single operating business and only operates in the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Consequently no further business and geographical segmentation is provided.  20 www.curidium.com

Goodwill arose in the current year from the Reverse Acquisition of Curidium Medica plc where by the investors in Curidium Limited acquired 
effective control of the Company. The members, at an EGM, approved the reverse acquisition on the 5
th
 July 2006 and the Company’s 
enlarged share capital was admitted to AIM.  The valuation of the Parent under reverse accounting rules was £1,868,368 and at the date of 
acquisition Curidium Medica plc had net operating assets of £770,826 giving rise to goodwill on consolidation of £1,097,452.
An impairment review was conducted by the Directors of the Company on the 16
th
 March 2007 and it was concluded, after due consideration, 
that the business prospects, market potential and product development were in line with expectations set at the time of acquisition. It was 
therefore concluded that no impairment of Goodwill had incurred as at the balance sheet date.

12) OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. 
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the development of Group’s Homomatrix
®
 tool, the Company’s core technology, is 
recognised only if all of the following conditions are met: 
• an asset is created that can be identiﬁed (such as software and new processes);
• it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic beneﬁts; and
• the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably. 
Internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Where no internally-generated intangible 
asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Patents and trademarks are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which is on average ten years.

15) OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS 
Trade and other receivables at the balance sheet date comprise amounts receivable from HM Revenue and Customs in respect of VAT

The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
 
Bank balances and cash comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. 
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value. 
Credit Risk 
The Group’s principal ﬁnancial assets are bank balances and cash and other receivables. 
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative ﬁnancial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings 
assigned by international credit-rating agencies. There is no risk attributable to currency movements as the group holds all funds in UK 
sterling bank accounts.
16) DEFERRED TAX 
No provision for deferred taxation has been made. The potential net asset for tax not provided was as follows:

Expenses incurred in the issue of new equity shares were co-mingled with the costs associated with the Reverse Acquisition by Curidium 
Limited and the re admission to AIM. Consequently it was decided to charge all expenses to the proﬁt and loss account in the year rather 
than charging expenses to the share premium account.

Expenses associated with the reverse acquisition and re listing on AIM have been expensed to current year proﬁt and treated as an 
administration expense.
If the reverse acquisition by Curidium Limited had been completed on the ﬁrst day of the ﬁnancial year, group revenues for the period 
would have been nil and group proﬁt attributable to equity holders of the parent would have been £991,068.

22) SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
Equity-settled share option plan 
The Group plan provides for a grant price equal to the average quoted market price of the Group shares on the date of grant. An option 
will not normally be exercisable during a closed period, and furthermore can only be exercisable in the following relevant proportions if 
the performance conditions (if any) are satisﬁed: 
• one-third (1/3) on the ﬁrst anniversary of the date of grant; 
• one-thirty sixth (1/36) for each month thereafter (until the third anniversary of the date of grant); or 
• the entirety of the option, after the third anniversary of the date of grant. 
Subsisting options will lapse (at the latest) 10 years after the date of grant. 
Options which have vested immediately before either the death of a participant or his ceasing to be an eligible employee by reason of 
injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or dismissal (otherwise than for good cause) shall remain exercisable (to the extent vested) for 40 
days after such cessation (or one year in the case of death), and all non-vested options shall lapse. If the employee leaves for any other 
reason then all of his options (whether vested or not) shall lapse.

Following investigations and enquiries, the Company has been unable to establish the number of options, if any, which remain outstanding 
under the Incite Share Option Scheme. It is the Directors’ belief that up to 960,000 options were granted pursuant to the Incite Share Option 
Scheme, some of which may remain outstanding. In order to be prudent, the Directors have determined to reserve sufﬁcient authorised but 
un-issued share capital for use in the event that the options under the Incite Share Option Scheme are validly exercised. Under rule 7 of 
the Incite Share Option Scheme, on a change of control of the Company, the options will vest and must be exercised within six months of 
the change of control. No share options were exercised in the six months after the reverse take over and the readmission of the Company’s 
share to AIM. It is the Directors’ intention to cancel the Incite Share Option Scheme. Because of the uncertainty regarding the Incite Share 
Option Scheme, the options granted from this scheme have been excluded form the above table.
The inputs into the Black-Scholes model are as follows: 
2006 2005
Weighted average share price 2p - 
Weighted average exercise price 2p - 
Expected volatility 101% - 
Expected life 3 years - 
Risk free rate 4.40% - 
Expected dividends 0p - 
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price since re-admission of the shares to AIM 
on 5
th
 July 2006. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-
transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of £25,573 (2005: nil) related to equity-settled share-based payment.
Payments to other creditors
Share based payments to other creditors totalled £140,000 and details are provided in note 18. 28 www.curidium.com
23) RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES 
The Group does not operate either a deﬁned contribution or deﬁned beneﬁt retirement scheme.

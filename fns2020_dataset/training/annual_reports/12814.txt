Pure Wafer at a glance
The company has an established 
track record, two of the worlds most 
advanced wafer reclaim facilities and a 
blue chip customer base that includes 
the majority of the worlds largest 
semiconductor manufacturers and 
independent foundries. As a business 
partner , Pure Wafer works with its 
customers to design and develop a 
service that delivers reclaimed wafers 
to the exacting specifications and high 
standards required by today’s leading 
semiconductor manufacturers. 
Our history
Pure Wafer was established in 2000 by 
a management team widely experienced 
in the semiconductor industry with the 
backing of strategic investment from 
Venture Capital and Industry partners.
The group floated on AIM in December 
2004 and February 2007 Pure Wafer 
completed the acquisition of a wafer 
reclaim facility in Arizona, US.
Our facilities
The UK business operates from a state of 
the art, purpose built facility situated in 
a technology park in Swansea, Wales and 
is the most advanced plant of its kind in 
Europe. The size of the facility is in excess 
of 4,500m
2
 and includes over 2,000m
2
 of 
production cleanrooms.
The facility in Prescott, Arizona was 
constructed in 1997 and has received 
in excess of $50m of investment since 
then. The high-volume high-tech fab 
was originally designed for 200mm and 
smaller diameter wafer reclaim services, 
but following the acquisition by Pure 
Wafer in 2007 capability to reclaim 
300mm wafers has been installed.
We have installed the latest generation 
of tools available on the market, with 
the most advanced equipment as used 
by integrated chip (IC) and prime silicon 
producers. With the highest technical 
specifications, we are positioned to offer 
the most effective wafer reclaim services 
to our customers with minimal silicon 
removal. This enables our customers to 
maximise the number of times a test 
wafer can be reclaimed.
Pure Wafer is a worldwide leader in the provision of 300mm 
wafer reclaim services. These services enable semiconductor 
manufacturers to gain efficiencies through the increased use 
of silicon test wafers within their production processes. Annual report and accounts 2011  Pure Wafer plc       3
Our process
At Pure Wafer our process for reclaiming 
test wafers involves the following key 
stages:
Inspection of the wafers for defects •	
and classification by type of 
contaminant to be removed
Submersion in a precise mix of •	
chemicals appropriate to remove the 
contaminant 
Assessment of flatness and •	
correction of defects using Pure 
Wafer’s advanced polishing processes
Cleaning and drying •	
Final quality inspection and •	
packaging for return to the customer
Wafer reclaim
During the many stages of the manufacturing process of 
semiconductors, large quantities of test wafers are used to check 
the accurate calibration of equipment. These test wafers are a key 
consumable in the manufacture of semiconductors and the ability 
to reclaim them through Pure Wafer’s advanced process provides 
manufacturers with the opportunity to reduce costs.
The semiconductor industry transition to 300mm wafers in now 
well advanced. In order for manufacturers to continue to increase 
functionality at a reduced cost, the industry has sought to increase 
the size of wafers on which semiconductors are manufactured. 
300mm wafer processing now represents the fastest growing area 
of the semiconductor industry.
However , wafer reclaim is a highly specialised and technically 
sophisticated process. Only a few companies worldwide are 
able to meet the exacting standards required by semiconductor 
manufacturers for the reclaim of 300mm wafers, of which Pure 
Wafer is one. 4       Pure Wafer plc   Annual report and accounts 2011
Chairman’s statement
Introduction
The year to 30 June 2011 saw the 
semiconductor industry move from 
recovery to growth with Pure Wafer 
continuing to benefit from the additional 
volume business from all geographical 
areas in which we trade and with all 
customers across the various sectors of 
the industry. 
The industry growth in general and the 
projected increasing worldwide demand 
for hand held devices and tablets also 
prompted some of our major customers 
to announce extensive capital expenditure 
plans for new 300mm manufacturing 
facilities coming on line between now and 
2014 both in Asia and North America. 
These announcements and actions give 
exciting long term prospects for Pure 
Wafer .
During the financial year as volume 
demand strengthened and the confidence 
in a period of sustained growth returned 
there has been an acceptance of selling 
price increases across the customer 
base and an acknowledgement that 
the low prices of previous periods were 
unsustainable for the industry. The 
Group has therefore been successful in 
implementing price increases across its 
customer base.
The unfortunate events in Japan following 
the tsunami in February resulted in 
additional business for Pure Wafer in 
our fourth quarter, as our customers 
looked to ensure that their reclaim wafer 
supply was maintained as our Japanese 
competitors struggled to maintain their 
service.
During the financial year we saw the Pure 
Wafer solar panel business successfully 
achieve full accreditation under the 
Microgeneration Certification Scheme 
(MCS) for all our solar products and 
our solar installations. This enables 
our customers to take advantage of 
the UK Government’s feed-in-tariff. The 
accreditation of our products provides us 
with a strong platform on which to build. 
Financial results
•  T urnover $29.7m (2010: $24.8m)
• EBITDA $3.2m (2010: $1.3m (pre 
restructuring charges))
• Operating loss $3.8m (2010: $6.8m)
• Pre-tax loss $5.1m (2010: $8.0m)
• Basic loss per share 3.6c (2010: loss 
per share 5.1c) 
The results show significant improvement 
on prior years, and the board is 
encouraged by the actions of the 
management team during the period to 
take advantage of the market conditions 
to maximise revenue and to continue 
reducing costs across all sectors of the 
business. 
Group Funding
During the period we successfully 
completed negotiations with our bank 
and asset funders of a further financial 
restructuring package which will assist 
the management of our working capital 
requirement, arising from the increased 
volumes of wafer reclaim and the 
potential growth in our solar business. 
The financial agreements comprise a 
further 6 months of capital payments 
holiday on the asset based debts and a 
rescheduling of the capital repayments 
over a 42 month period commencing on 
1st January 2012 and concluding by 30th 
June 2015. The agreement also includes 
an increased bank overdraft facility of up 
to £1.7million ($2.7million). 
The Company’s existing bank debt 
continues to be repaid in accordance 
with the original restructuring agreement 
completed in August 2009.
The latest financial restructuring 
agreement further demonstrates the 
commitment that the bank and asset 
funders have to Pure Wafer and shows 
a confidence in the recovery of the 
business, and I would like to thank them 
for their support.
Management
I would like to thank the entire team for 
their support and efforts during a year 
in which activity levels increased and our 
solar products were accredited.
Outlook
The current period has commenced 
strongly with a continuation of high 
volumes enjoyed during our fourth 
quarter. It is particularly pleasing that 
high and stable volumes are being seen 
from our customers in all geographical 
regions, this together with the 300mm 
manufacturing facilities currently under 
construction by the semiconductor 
industry and in some cases nearing 
completion, gives an optimistic long term 
outlook.
On the flip side the worldwide fear of a 
second recession due to the uncertainty 
in the financial markets and the effect 
of this on consumer confidence has 
The Semiconductor Industry’s move from recovery 
to growth has been reflected in our results. Annual report and accounts 2011  Pure Wafer plc       5
prompted the industry to consider its 
levels of inventory. Many industry analysts 
are predicting a short term industry 
slowdown during our second quarter 
with full production returning during 
the beginning of the second half of our 
financial year .
The launch of our solar products is a 
very exciting time for Pure Wafer because 
we believe that the renewable energy 
market has massive potential growth both 
globally and significantly here in the UK, 
underpinned by the introduction of the 
government backed feed-in-tariff in April 
2010. The 2012 financial year has started 
well, following successful accreditation 
of our products in 2011, a number of 
solar installations have been completed. 
Our order book is building with a mix 
of domestic and large commercial 
installations. We have been successful 
in being awarded a contract for a local 
community housing scheme for roof-top 
solar PV systems with a potential value of 
up to £1million and are well placed to win 
other major solar contracts in the public 
sector all for completion this forthcoming 
financial year .
These factors together with our financial 
restructuring providing additional working 
capital, gives Pure Wafer a strong 
foundation on which to move forward.

Chief Executive’s review
Operational Review
The financial year to June 2011 continued 
the upward trend that we enjoyed during 
last financial year with continued growth 
in volumes across all diameter sizes of 
wafers both in Swansea and Prescott as 
the semiconductor industry continued to 
grow. 
Volume sales for the Group grew during 
the period with 300mm wafer reclaim 
up by 27% when compared to the prior 
year , and 200mm wafer reclaim up 24%. 
Whilst we were encouraged by the volume 
sales for the first half of the year, the 
second half of the year saw even stronger 
growth with increases on 300mm of 22% 
when compared to the first half.
A significant challenge for our operational 
teams was to process the additional 
and growing volumes whilst maintaining 
the cost reductions and benefits gained 
during the prior periods, in a market 
where our suppliers were requesting 
price increases for the majority of our 
consumable items. I am very pleased to 
report that we managed to build on our 
past successes and reduce costs per 
wafer even further by 10% compared with 
the prior financial year . These cost savings 
were in part due to economies of scale 
but also due to successful engineering 
activities to reduce consumable usage 
and costs within our processes, all 
without affecting the quality of the 
Group’s product offering.
The processing of the increased volumes 
was also achieved with a modest increase 
in headcount and thus Pure Wafer 
benefited from cost efficiencies as record 
levels of productivity were achieved in 
both the Swansea and Prescott facilities. 
I would like to thank all our employees 
for their hard work and support during 
the year, enabling Pure Wafer to continue 
to trade competitively throughout this 
period.

Swansea site, UK
The Swansea site continued to see 
growing demand from our European and 
Asian customers during the period with 
300mm volume sales growing by 28% 
compared to the prior year and 200mm 
volume sales increasing by 15%. The 
second half of the financial year showed 
strong growth compared to the first half 
for our 300mm volumes with a 26% 
increase whilst the 200mm volumes 
dropped by 20% as one of our major 
customers completed their transition 
from 200mm to 300mm manufacturing. 
Prescott site, Arizona, USA
The Prescott, Arizona facility is now 
running large scale 300mm production, 
and has made significant progress in 
increasing our 300mm wafer reclaim 
market share in the US, where we are 
actively engaged with every major 
300mm integrated chip manufacturer 
who have a manufacturing presence in 
the US. Volume sales grew for the period 
with 300mm up by 23% when compared 
to the prior year and 200mm up by 29%. 
With the quality of our offering equal to 
the stringent requirements of our blue 
chip customer base we envisage further 
significant market gains.
With the Group’s current installed 
capacity for 300mm and smaller 
diameter wafers at Pure Wafer’s high 
quality facilities in Swansea and Prescott, 
Arizona, together with the reduced cost 
per wafer , the Board believe that the 
Company is well placed for future growth.
The increased volume sales has resulted in record 
levels of productivity and a further decrease in our 
costs per unit. Annual report and accounts 2011  Pure Wafer plc       7
Solar pv
This was an exciting year for the Pure 
Wafer solar panel business, during which 
we successfully achieved full accreditation 
of our solar products and our solar 
installations under the Microgeneration 
Certification Scheme (MCS) following 
delays in the accreditation process, due 
to a lack of testing facilities here in the 
UK. With the MCS accreditation, any 
installation by Pure Wafer or with Pure 
Wafer products enables our customers 
to take advantage of the Government 
feed-in-tariff. We were also able to bed 
in our manufacturing lines. The interest 
and uptake of our products has been 
strong and whilst revenue generation 
during this period has been negligible, 
the foundations are now in place for 
substantial growth. With the solar pv 
market being one of the fastest growing 
sectors in the UK currently, we see this 
as a exciting addition to our portfolio 
of products and are confident that it 
will provide significant revenue and 
profitability to the group.

Financial review
Reporting currency
This is the second year we have reported 
in dollars, the currency of the industry 
we are in. This alignment of functional 
currency and reporting currency allows 
us to produce accounts that are clearer 
and more transparent without the need 
for the large and numerous adjustments 
required at the year end to deal with 
the difference between functional and 
reporting currencies. 
Volumes and Revenue
The volume of 300mm equivalent 
wafers processed at 1,195,000 (2010: 
959,000) was an increase of 25% in the 
year .  Revenue for the year was $29.7m, 
an increase of 20% on last year (2010: 
$24.8m); reflecting the impact of 
increased volumes and increased selling 
prices. An analysis of turnover by origin 
and destination can be found in note 5.
Gross profit
Gross profit stood at $8.3m (2010: 
$5.2m), an increase of 60%, as a result 
of increased volumes processed and the 
cost saving intitiatives implemented in the 
period. 
Operating loss
The operating loss of $3.8m (2010: loss 
of $6.8m) was achieved after incurring no 
restructuring costs. (2010: restructuring 
costs of $0.8m)
Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses of $12.1m 
(2010: $11.2m) for the group show an 
increase on the prior year. This increase 
has been driven principally by rising staff 
costs.
Loss before tax
The loss before tax was $5.1m (2010: 
$8.0m). 
Foreign exchange
We continue to convert as much of the 
cost base as possible to US Dollars in 
order to provide a natural hedge against 
the US Dollar revenue streams. 
Cash flow
Cash flow from operations this year 
showed a net inflow of $1.4m (2010: 
outlow $0.3m). 
The increased volume and reduced cost have 
delivered a gross margin of $8.3m up 60%. Annual report and accounts 2011  Pure Wafer plc       9
Taxation
There is no current tax charge across 
the group. During the year the group 
submitted a claim in respect of qualifying 
Research and Development, the amounts 
received are shown in note 11. Due to the 
losses incurred during the year , the board 
has taken the decision not to recognise 
the deferred tax asset of $9.3m (2010: 
$10.0m) pertaining to accumulated 
losses in the UK as it is not expected to 
be utilised within the foreseeable future.

Directors’ report
The directors present their annual report and the audited financial statements of the group for the year ended 30 June 2011.
Principal activity
The principal activity of the group remains the reclaim of silicon test wafers. The principal activity of the company is as a holding 
company and the provision of management services to the group’s trading subsidiaries.
The consolidated income statement is set out on page 22.
A review of developments affecting the group during the year and its prospects for the future is set out in the Chairman’s statement, 
Chief executive’s review and the Financial review.
Business review
A detailed review of the group’s operations and key performance indicators is contained in the Chairman’s statement on pages 
4 and 5, the Chief executive’s review on pages 6 and 7 and the Financial review on page 8.Information about the use of financial 
instruments by the company and its subsidiaries is given in note 22 to the financial statements. 
Dividends
The directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend (2010: $nil).
Risks and uncertainties 
There are a number of potential risks and uncertainties which could have a material impact on the company’s long-term 
performance.
Market risk
Volumes – in the current climate, there is a risk that sales volumes may decrease if the industry growth is not sustained, leading to 
a reduction in market prices as our competitors compete for existing business. We mitigate the risk by maintaining our standards of 
quality and endeavouring to qualify to provide wafer reclaim services to as many of the major semiconductor manufacturers as we 
can.
Price – competitive pressures create a risk that the market price for wafer reclaim services will fall, affecting our gross margin. 
We mitigate this risk by understanding the production cost for each wafer and only tendering for work at rates that will achieve an 
acceptable return.
Credit risk
The group offers short-term credit to customers and there is a risk that customers will default on payments for services provided. 
The group manages the risk by trading with a wide range of customers in diverse geographical locations and monitoring the 
creditworthiness of customers, both before offering credit terms and during their relationship with Pure Wafer. 
Treasury risk
Interest rate – the group’s borrowings include variable rate term loans and fixed rate finance leases. We mitigate the risk associated 
with our variable rate loans by entering into interest rate swaps. 
Competitor risk
New entrants – the high level of investment required and the related cost of capital makes this unlikely in the current market 
conditions.
Technology risk
As the group operates in a technology sector, there is a risk that the process could be superseded and new capital investment 
required; however, the board feels that this is extremely unlikely in the current market and based on available knowledge of new 
product/technology developments.
Capital structure
Details of the authorised and issued share capital are shown in note 23. The company has one class of ordinary shares which carry 
no right to fixed income. Each share carries the right to one vote at general meetings of the company. 
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding or on the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general

Authority to issue and allot shares
The Companies Act 2006 contains restrictions on the power of the directors to allot a company’s shares. As a result, the directors 
may only issue the shares pursuant to the authority within the statutory terms given by shareholders’ resolutions or contained in 
the Articles of Association. Their power to issue equity shares for cash to persons other than the existing shareholders is similarly 
restricted.
Resolutions to confer these authorities were passed at the previous Annual General Meeting (AGM), not on incorporation. These 
authorities will expire at the conclusion of the next AGM unless previously renewed, varied or revoked by the company in general 
meeting.
Resolutions to renew the authorities will be prepared at the 2011 AGM to be held on 14 December 2011.
Subsequent to the passing of these resolutions, the directors will have the authority to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal 
amount of £757,816 and it will not be necessary for the directors to seek further approval from shareholders to issue shares for 
cash to persons, other than existing shareholders, up to an aggregate nominal amount of £126,303.
Health and safety, environmental and social responsibility
The company has detailed health and safety guidelines which are communicated to all employees, and which are regularly reviewed 
for suitability in the context of the company’s activities.
The group is fully committed to protecting the environment in which we live and work, both ecologically and socially. A formal policy 
is in place with internal management control systems to ensure that this is achieved as best as is practicable, and to ensure that the 
international standard for environmental management ISO 14001 is met.
Charitable and political donations
The group did not make any monetary charitable or political donations during the year .
Going concern
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are 
set out in the Chairman’s statement on pages 4 and 5. The financial position of the group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described in the Finance Review on page 8.  In addition, note 22 to the financial statements includes the 
group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial 
instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The group has recorded a pre-tax loss; however , given the facilities that are currently in place, the group has significant headroom 
above its forecast cash requirement, which will allow it to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain 
outlook. 
The directors have assessed the balance sheet and likely future cash flows of the company and group at the date of approving the 
accounts. This review considered detailed forecasts for the period to 30 June 2013. On this basis the directors have concluded that it 
is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
The key sensitivity in the forecasts includes the achievement of increased sales volumes. The business has experienced an upturn in 
demand for its services and the directors believe that this will be sustained. Sales prices are assumed to remain largely unchanged. 
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group and the company have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the annual report and financial statements.

Corporate governance
The company is listed on AIM and is therefore not required to comply with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
However , the board adopts a number of principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code that it feels are relevant to a business of 
the size and complexity of Pure Wafer plc, as set out below.
During the year the board comprised a non-executive chairman, four executive directors and a further two non-executive directors 
who brought an independent judgement to the group. The roles of chairman and chief executive have been split.
All the directors have access to the advice and services of the company secretary, who is responsible to the board for ensuring that 
board procedures are followed and compliance with applicable rules and regulations. If necessary, independent professional advice 
can be sought by all the directors of the company.
Board responsibilities
The board of directors, which includes three non-executive directors, meets regularly throughout the year. 
S Boyd, E ap Gwilym and P Dolan are considered by the board to be independent non-executive directors.
The board is responsible for overall group strategy, acquisition and investment policy, approval of major capital expenditure projects 
and consideration of significant financing matters. There is a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to the board’s 
jurisdiction. It reviews the strategic direction of the group, its annual budgets, the progress towards achievement of those budgets, 
its forecasts and its capital expenditure programmes. In furtherance of their duties, there are agreed procedures for the directors to 
take independent advice, if necessary, at the company’s expense.
The board considers the Chairman to be Senior Independent Director and the main point of contact to whom concerns of whatever 
nature may be conveyed. In the event that an individual does not wish to raise a concern with him, the board has identified the 
deputy chairman as an independent member of the board to whom such concerns may be addressed.
Audit committee
The company has an audit committee comprising two non-executive directors and the chairman. During the year the committee was 
chaired by P Dolan. The committee provides a link between the board and the group’s auditors on matters falling within the scope 
of the group’s audit. These matters include accounting standards and policies, internal financial control procedures and the group’s 
statutory financial statements, which are intended for publication.
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee comprises the non-executive directors and the chairman and meets at least once a year . During the 
year, the committee was chaired by E ap Gwilym. It is the remuneration committee’s role to establish a formal and transparent 
policy on executive remuneration and to set remuneration packages for individual directors.
Treasury committee
The treasury committee comprises the executive directors. The committee meets on an as-needed basis where speedy approval for 
treasury matters, particularly relating to foreign exchange, is required. The chairman of the committee, P Harrington, reports any 
decisions taken, with justification, to the board as quickly as practicable.
Board meetings
During the year to 30 June 2011, there were eleven board meetings, three audit committee meetings and two remuneration 
committee meetings. Attendance was as follows:

Risk management
The board of directors has overall responsibility for the group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness, whilst 
the role of management is to implement board policies on risk and control. The system of internal control is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure of business objectives. In pursuing these objectives, internal controls can provide only 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The key elements of this system are:
• the audit committee;
• a comprehensive budgeting system, with an annual budget approved by the group board;
• detailed monthly reporting, including forecasting to the group board and comparison of results against budget, with   
 performance monitoring and explanations provided for significant variances; and
• a defined procedure for seeking and obtaining approval for major transactions.
In order to address risk management, a control framework is in place which aims, as best as practicable, to
• safeguard group assets;
• ensure proper accounting records are maintained; and
• provide reliable financial information for internal and external use.
Research and Development
The company undertakes Research and Development activities to continue our process improvements.
Employees
Issues affecting employees are communicated via the management structure to enable employees to be aware of the company’s 
performance, etc. This same method is also used to communicate to employees issues which are likely to affect their interests 
and where possible a full explanation will be given as to the reasons for the actions that are planned and the likely effect on the 
employees.
The company has a recruitment policy in which equal consideration is given to disabled applicants. Full consideration will be 
afforded to disabled applicants and where applicable expert advice and guidance will be sought to enable a disabled applicant to 
take up a position within their capabilities.
Dialogue with shareholders
The company reports formally to the shareholders twice a year, when its half year and full year results are announced, and the 
annual report is sent to shareholders. The annual report is accompanied by notice of the AGM of the company, at which the 
directors are available to take questions, both formally during the meeting and informally after the meeting. The management is 
available for dialogue with major shareholders on the company’s plans and objectives and from time to time meets with them.
Auditors
In the case of each of the persons who are directors of the company at the date when this report is approved:
• so far as each of the directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s auditors are unaware; and
• each of the directors has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director to make themselves aware of any  
 relevant audit information and to establish that the company’s auditors are aware of that information. 
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
A resolution to appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
Approved by the board of directors and signed on behalf of the board:

Introduction
This report sets out Pure Wafer’s executive remuneration policy, structure and details of remuneration received by directors in the 
year ended 30 June 2011. This report is un-audited.

on matters relating to their own remuneration.

necessary to provide a competitive market-based remuneration structure which rewards company and individual performance.
Remuneration packages comprise:
• basic salary;
• annual performance related bonus;
• other benefits; and
• participation in share incentive plans.
Basic salary
Salaries are normally reviewed annually and any changes are effective from July in each year. Pay reviews take into account company 
and individual performance.

committee.
Benefits

3 November 2011 20       Pure Wafer plc   Annual report and accounts 2011
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors are required 
to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors must 
not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of 
the profit or loss of the company for that year. 
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
•  make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•  state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and  
 explained in the financial statements; and
•  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will  
 continue in business.
In preparing the group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
•  properly select and apply accounting policies;
•  present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
 understandable information; 
•  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users to  
 understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial  
 performance; and
•  make an assessment of the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
company’s website www.purewafer .com. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Consolidated statement of directors’ responsibilities Annual report and accounts 2011  Pure Wafer plc       21
We have audited the group financial statements of Pure Wafer Plc for the year ended 30 June 2011 which comprise the the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in 
Equity, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Accounting Policies and the related notes.  
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose.  We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is 
shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes 
an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the group financial statements: 
•  give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 30 June 2011 and of its loss and cash flows for the year 
 then ended;
•  have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and 
•  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the group financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our 
opinion: 
•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Pure Wafer Plc for the year ended 30 June 2011.

As at 30 June 2011 Annual report and accounts 2011  Pure Wafer plc       27
1. General information
Pure Wafer plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the registered 
office is Pure Wafer plc, Central Business Park, Swansea Vale, Swansea SA7 0AB. The nature of the group’s operations and its 
principal activities are set out in the business review and principal activity section on page 10. 
Adoption of new and revised standards
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by 
the European Union as they apply to financial statements of the group for the year ended 30 June 2011 and applied in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention.
The following new standards, new interpretations and amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not 
effective for the financial year beginning 1 July 2010 and have not been early adopted
• IAS 24 (revised) ‘Related party disclosures’ effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011.  This amends the  
 requirements for related party disclosures but is not expected to impact the group significantly.
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments – classification of financial assets and financial liabilities’ effective for periods beginning on or  
 after 1 January 2013.  The group is yet to assess IFRS 9’s full impact however initial indications are that there will not be a  
 material impact on adoption of the standard.
• IFRS 11 – ‘Joint arrangements’ effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.  This standard significantly amends  
 the accounting treatment of joint arrangements but is not expected to impact the group
• IFRS 12 – ‘Disclosure of interests in other entities’ effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.  This alters the  
 disclosure requirements for companies holding investments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and other entities.  It will amend  
 the disclosures of the company but is not expected to have a significant impact.
• IFRS 13 – ‘Fair value measurements’ effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.  This standard applies to all fair  
 value amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and may, therefore, have an impact on the group.  The company has  
 not yet assessed this potential impact.
• Annual improvements 2010 effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011. These are minor amendments to various  
 accounting standards and are not expected to impact the group.
• Amendment to IFRS 1 ‘First-time adoption – exemption for severe hyperinflation and removal of fixed dates’ effective for periods  
 beginning on or after 1 July 2011.  This is not expected to impact the group 
• Amendment to IFRS 7 – ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures –disclosures on transfers of financial assets’ effective for periods  
 beginning on or after 1 July 2011.  This is not expected to impact the group.
• Amendment to IAS 12 ‘Income taxes – deferred tax accounting for investment properties’ effective for periods beginning on or  
 after 1 January 2012.  This is not expected to impact the group.
 Amendment to IFRIC 14 ‘Pre-payments of a Minimum Funding Requirement’ effective for periods beginning on or after 1  
 January 2011.  This is not expected to impact the group.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These accounting policies are based on the IFRS, IAS and IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the EU (collectively “IFRS”).  
Going concern
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are 
set out in the Chairman’s statement on pages 4 and 5 The financial position of the group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described in the Finance Review on page 8. In addition, note 22 to the financial statements includes the 
group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial 
instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The current economic environment remains challenging. The group has recorded a pre-tax loss; however, given the facilities that are 
currently in place, the group has significant headroom above its forecast cash requirement, which will allow it to manage its business 
risks successfully despite the current uncertain outlook. 
The directors have assessed the balance sheet and likely future cash flows of the company and group at the date of signing the 
audit report. This review considered detailed forecasts for the period to 30 June 2013. On this basis the directors have concluded 
that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. . 
The key sensitivity in the forecasts includes the achievement of increased sales volumes. The business has experienced an upturn in 
demand for its services and the directors believe that this will be sustained. Sales prices are assumed to remain largely unchanged.  
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group and the company have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the annual report and financial statements.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Going concern (continued)
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise Pure Wafer plc (the company) and its subsidiary undertakings, Pure Wafer 
International Limited and Pure Wafer , Inc.
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the company. Control exists when the company has the power to govern the financial 
and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The financial statements of subsidiaries are 
included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries. The cost of an acquisition is measured 
at the fair value of the consideration plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. The excess of the cost of the acquisition 
over the group’s share of the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the subsidiary acquired is recorded as goodwill. Intra-group 
transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated; unrealised losses are also 
eliminated unless costs cannot be recovered. Where necessary, accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed to ensure 
consistency with the policies adopted by the group.
Segmental reporting
Operational segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision 
maker . The chief operating decision maker , who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing the performance of operating 
segments, has been identified as the board members that make strategic decisions. The Solar business is not deemed to be a 
separate segment for the purposes of the 2011 results as it did not commence commercial trading until after the year-end.
Foreign currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). For the group’s two operating subsidiaries, Pure Wafer 
International Limited and Pure Wafer Inc. this has been determined to be USD. Pure Wafer plc is also reported in USD.
Any translation differences that have arisen since 1 July 2006 are presented as a separate component of equity. As permitted by 
IFRS 1, any differences prior to this date are not included in this separate component of equity. 
Foreign currency transactions are initially recorded at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains 
and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet 
date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when 
deferred in equity as qualifying net investment hedges.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
relevant instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive benefits have expired or been transferred, and the 
group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is 
extinguished.
Non-derivative financial assets are classified as either receivables or cash and cash equivalents. They are stated at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method, subject to reduction for allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. A provision for 
impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts 
due according to the original terms of those receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, and is recognised in the income statement. For interest-bearing 
assets, their carrying value includes accrued interest receivable.
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held on call, together with other short-term highly liquid investments. 
Non-derivative financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method. For borrowings, their carrying 
value includes accrued interest payable, as well as any unamortised issue costs.
The group transacts derivative financial instruments to manage the underlying exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks. 
The group does not transact derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. However , as the group has decided not to hedge 
account for its derivative financial instruments as permitted under IAS 39, they are accounted for through the income statement. 
Derivative financial assets and liabilities are stated at fair value, which includes accrued interest receivable and payable where 
relevant. Changes in fair values are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Financial liabilities and issue costs
All borrowings are initially stated at the fair value of the consideration received after deduction of issue costs. Issue costs are 
charged as a finance charge to the income statement on a constant yield basis over the term of the borrowings. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue, which represents the value of goods and services supplied, excluding value added tax and trade discounts, is recognised 
on completion of the service or despatch of goods sold. In respect of the provision of wafer reclaim services, the service is deemed 
to be complete at the point that the wafers are despatched for return to the customer. In the case of Solar products, revenue will be 
recognised when installation works at customer sites have been completed.

As at 30 June 2011 continued Annual report and accounts 2011  Pure Wafer plc       29
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, where 
it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle that obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount 
can be made.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the 
restructuring has either commenced or has been publicly announced. Future operating losses are not provided for .
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by 
considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one 
item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
Share based payments
The company operates an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan. The fair value of the employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is 
determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for 
example, profitability and sales growth targets).  
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share 
premium when the options are exercised.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are shown in the balance sheet at their historical cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition and installation of the items. 
Subsequent costs are included in the assets’ carrying amounts or recognised as a separate asset as appropriate only when it is 
probable that future economic benefits associated with them will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured 
reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Depreciation is provided so as to write off the initial cost of each asset to its residual value on a straight line basis over its estimated 
useful life as follows:
Long leasehold buildings  15 years
Fixtures and fittings  5 years
Plant and machinery  4–10 years
Computer equipment  3 years
Motor vehicles   5 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, by the directors, at each balance sheet 
date. Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down immediately to 
its recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amounts. These are 
included in the income statement.
Government grants
Government grants are recorded initially as deferred income and recognised in the income statement in line with the expense to 
which they contribute. For grants in respect of the purchase of property, plant and equipment, the deferred income is released over 
the life of the related assets. For grants in respect of staff costs, the deferred income is released over the monitoring period of the 
grant offer .
Intangible assets – goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets and liabilities acquired 
both tangible and intangible.
Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Any impairment is 
recognised immediately in the income statement and cannot be subsequently reversed. Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash-
generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. Gains or losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of 
goodwill relating to the entity sold. 
Internally generated intangible assets – research and development
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the group’s development is recognised only if all of the following conditions are 
met: an asset is created that can be separately identified; it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; 
and the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful lives. Where no internally-generated 
intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. 30       Pure Wafer plc   Annual report and accounts 2011
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Intangible assets – other
These consist mainly of process development costs capitalised. The assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected 
useful economic life of five years. The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, by the 
directors, at each balance sheet date.
Impairment of assets
Assets that have an indefinite life are not subject to amortisation and are tested at least annually for impairment. Assets that are 
subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the carrying amount of 
the asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in 
use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash 
flows (cash-generating units).
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. 
The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour , other direct costs and related production 
overheads (based on normal operating capacity) but excludes borrowing costs. Work in progress is valued to reflect the historical 
yield from the reclaim process. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the 
estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
Leasing
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the group at their fair value, or, if lower, at the present value of the 
minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the 
balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease 
obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the lease 
term.
Restructuring costs
Certain costs are classified as relating to restructuring where they relate to the incremental cost of undertaking a significant change 
to the operations or staff structure of the business. 
Operating loss
Operating loss is stated after charging restructuring costs, but before investment income, finance costs and foreign exchange gains 
and losses.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that 
necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the costs of those assets, until 
such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is 
deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Cash and cash equivalents
In the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at all banks and bank 
overdrafts. In the consolidated balance sheet, bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
Taxes
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year , using tax rates substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements, and the tax base. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will 
be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Deferred tax is determined using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, and are 
expected to apply when the deferred tax liability is settled or the deferred tax asset is realised.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Taxes continued
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of 
the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in 
the foreseeable future.
Tax is recognised in the income statement, except where it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is 
recognised in equity.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in 
equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 
Pensions
The company operates a defined contribution scheme that is available to all staff upon the completion of any probationary period.
3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the directors are required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in 
the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods 
if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are 
discussed below..
Impairment of non-current assets
Determining whether goodwill, property, plant and equipment, or intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value 
in use of the cash generating units (CGUs) to which those assets are allocated. The group has two separate CGUs, representing 
the UK and the US businesses. The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise 
from the cash generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. The carrying amount of goodwill was 
$6.63m and property plant and equipment was $30.97m at the balance sheet date. 
The group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the first three 
years assuming growth based on detailed sales and cost forecasts. The cash flows are extrapolated in perpetuity assuming a 2.25% 
growth rate representing the directors’ estimate of the average long-term growth rate for the markets in which the group operates. 
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows of each of the CGUs as defined above was based on the group’s pre tax weighted 
average cost of capital of 8.9%.  
For both CGUs, the impairment review is sensitive to the forecast level of sales. Sales are planned to increase as demand continues 
to return to the market through the three year forecast period. The impairment review includes significant headroom to address this. 
There is a risk of impairment if sales were to fall more than 40% below expectation.
The review of the UK CGU is also sensitive to discount rate and the forward USD rate. Were the discount rate to increase to above 
17.1% or the long-term USD forward rate to rise above $1.83, there would be a risk of impairment.
Based on the assumptions made by the directors, no impairment has been booked.
Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments
As described in note 22, the directors use their judgement in selecting appropriate valuation techniques for financial instruments 
not quoted on an active market. Valuation techniques commonly used by market practitioners are applied. For derivative financial 
instruments, assumptions are made based on quoted market rates adjusted for specific features of the instrument. Other financial 
instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the assumptions supported, where possible, by observable 
market prices or rates. The fair value of financial instruments at the balance sheet date was a net liability of $5,000 (2010: 
$55,000).   32       Pure Wafer plc   Annual report and accounts 2011
Deferred tax
The group has tax losses of some $9.3m available for offset against future UK taxable profits. In determining the value of the 
deferred tax asset that can be attributed to these losses, the directors have to estimate likely future taxable profits and the period 
over which the asset may be recovered. The directors consider the most up-to-date forecasts for the UK business and assess the 
risks inherent in achieving those forecasts. At the balance sheet date, no deferred tax asset has been recorded. The deferred tax 
asset may be recognised again in future if there is an improvement in the forecast taxable profits. 
3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
Key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
Useful life of property, plant and equipment
The group’s plant and machinery is amortised over a period of seven to ten years. In estimating the life of the equipment, the 
directors have to consider the likely period over which the technology will be used in the market and the ability of the business to 
maintain the equipment to an appropriate condition for use. Were the technology to be superseded in a much shorter timeframe 
than this, the carrying value would need to be depreciated over a shorter timeframe, resulting in an increase in the annual 
depreciation charge.

5. Business and geographical segments 
Business and geographical segments are reported in a manner consistent with internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating 
Decision-Maker , which has been identified as the Pure Wafer Plc Board.
The group’s activities and turnover primarily consist of the reclamation and reprocessing of silicon test wafers, in the UK and the 
US, for external customers. The Solar business is not deemed to be a separate segment for the purposes of the 2011 results as it 
did not commence commercial trading until after the year-end.
For management purposes, the group is organised into two operating divisions based on the geographical territory of origin. These 
divisions are the basis on which the group reports its primary segment information.

Goodwill, which relates to the February 2007 acquisition of the group’s US business, is denominated in US Dollars (USD) and is 
considered to represent a single cash generating unit (CGU).
Goodwill is reviewed annually or when other events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully 
recoverable.
The recoverable amount of this CGU is determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use 
calculation are those regarding the discount rate, growth rate and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs. Management 
estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the CGU. The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based 
on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the board for the first three 
years assuming growth based on detailed sales and cost forecasts. The cash flows are then extrapolated in perpetuity assuming a 
2.25% growth rate which the directors’ believe represents the long term average growth rate for this CGU and the market in which 
it operates. The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is based on a pre tax weighted average cost of capital of 8.9% which 
reflects the overall business risks associated with this CGU.
The impairment review is sensitive to the forecast level of sales. Sales are planned to increase as demand returns to the market 
through the three year forecast period. 
Other intangibles
Other intangibles represent costs associated with process development. With the exception of Solar development costs, capitalised 
costs are amortised over their useful economic life which is estimated at five years. 
Solar development costs totalling $741k were capitalised in the period. Solar development costs have not yet been amortised 
as the solar division has not yet commenced commercial trading. 38       Pure Wafer plc   Annual report and accounts 2011

Trade receivables continued
T otal trade receivables (net of allowances) held by the group at 30 June 2011 amounted to $5,968k (2010: $3,871k).
The average credit period taken on sale of goods is 73 days (2010: 61 days). The group has provided fully for all receivables which 
are considered impaired. Management performs a detailed review of the trade receivables ledger across the group at least twice 
annually to assess receivables that are past due and not recoverable. 
Before accepting any new customer, the group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s credit 
quality and defines credit terms by customer . Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year , $1,360k (2010: $526k) is 
due from the group’s largest customer. There are no other customers who represent more than 10% of the total balance of trade 
receivables. 
Included in the group’s trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying amount of $1,537k (2010: $161k) which are past 
due at the reporting date for which the group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in the credit quality and 
the amounts are still considered recoverable. The group does not hold any collateral over these balances. The average age of these 
receivables is 113 days (2010: 90 days).

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable 
from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer 
base being large and unrelated. Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the 
allowance for doubtful debts.

The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value. 
Deferred taxation
Due to the losses incurred during the current and prior years, the board has taken the decision not to recognise the deferred tax 
asset for losses carried forward, as they are not expected to be utilised within the foreseeable future. At 30 June 2011 due to the 
existence of capital allowances, current taxable profits do not support recognition of this asset.
The value of the unrecognised deferred tax asset relating to tax losses of the UK business at 30 June 2011 is $9.3m (2010: 
$10.0m). 40       Pure Wafer plc   Annual report and accounts 2011

Capital risk management
The group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to minimise the cost of 
capital.
The capital structure of the group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 20, cash and cash equivalents 
and equity directly attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as 
disclosed in the statement of changes in equity. 
The group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by equity. Net debt 
comprises the borrowings disclosed in note 20 less cash and cash deposits. Equity comprises issued capital, reserves and retained 
earnings as disclosed in the statement of changes in equity.
The gearing ratio at the year end are as follows:
2011

22. Financial instruments continued
Financial risk management objectives
The group’s financial instruments comprise bank loans, finance leases, derivative financial instruments and trade receivables and 
trade payables that arise already from its operations. The purpose of the instruments is to raise finance for group activities. 
The group seeks to minimise the effects of financial risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge known exposures. The 
interest rates on bank loans are managed through the use of interest rate swaps and interest on the remaining financial liabilities 
are fixed. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the group’s policies approved by the board of directors, which provide 
written principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial 
instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity. The group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative 
financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Market risk
The group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 
The group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, 
including:
•       interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates.
Foreign currency risk management 
The group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. 
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts. 
The carrying amounts of the group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date 
are as follows:
2011

2010
$000
Monetary assets
Euro 227 48
Sterling 120 -
Monetary liabilities
Euro 142 100
Sterling 4,275 1,844
Yen 75 110
Interest rate risk management
The group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. The risk is 
managed by the group maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, by the use of interest rate swap 
contracts to fix the interest rate on the floating rate loans. 
The group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management 
section of this note. 
Interest rate swap contracts
Under interest rate swap contracts, the group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts 
calculated on agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the risk of higher interest rates on the 
fair value of issued fixed rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held. The fair value of interest 
rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the 
credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below. The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the 
end of the financial year. The current contracts were matched to the original payment profiles for the group debt, with the financial 
restructuring package that has taken place after the year end these are no longer matched. The directors will consider the impact of 
the mismatch in evaluating the interest rate strategy going forward.
The group has entered into interest rate swap agreements in respect of the bank loans. 
The company has one interest rate swap contract. This expires on 12 February 2012; the fair value of the contract as at 30 June 
2011 was a liability of $5,000 (2010: $20,158). The contract is net settled. 
Credit risk management
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the group. The 
group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties. The group only transacts with major high street banks. 
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse geographical areas. Ongoing credit evaluation is 
performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable. The group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to a single 
counterparty (the details are disclosed in note 16).  44       Pure Wafer plc   Annual report and accounts 2011
22. Financial instruments continued
Liquidity risk management
The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by 
continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. 
Liquidity and interest risk tables
The following tables detail the group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities. The tables have been 
drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the group can be required 
to pay. The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.

Note 20 describes that the majority of the group’s interest bearing debt is denominated in USD.
With the exception of financial assets as disclosed in note 16, financial assets are current and are non interest bearing. 
Fair value of financial instruments
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:
• foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted 
 interest rates matching maturities of the contracts;
•  interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the   
 applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates; and
• the carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost approximates to their fair value.

We have audited the parent company financial statements of Pure Wafer plc for the year ended 30 June 2011 which comprise 
the Balance Sheet, the Accounting Policies and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent 
company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose.  We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error . This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the parent company financial statements: 
•  give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 30 June 2011;
•  have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
•  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the parent company financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the parent company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our 
opinion:  
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been  
 received from branches not visited by us; or 
•  the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

1. Accounting policies – company
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards. The particular 
accounting policies adopted, which have been applied consistently throughout the current and the prior financial year , are described 
below.
Going concern
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are 
set out in the Chairman’s statement on pages 4 and 5. The financial position of the group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described in the Finance Review on page 8. In addition, note 22 to the financial statements includes the 
group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial 
instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. 
As described in the Chairman’s statement on pages 4 and 5 , the current economic environment remains challenging. The group has 
recorded a pre-tax loss; however , given the facilities that are currently in place, the group has significant headroom above its forecast 
cash requirement, which will allow it to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain outlook. 
The directors have assessed the balance sheet and likely future cash flows of the company at the date of signing the audit report. 
This review considered detailed forecasts for the period to 30 June 2013. On this basis the directors have concluded that it is 
appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. 
The key sensitivity in the forecasts includes the achievement of increased sales volumes. The business has experienced an upturn in 
demand for its services and the directors believe that this will be sustained. Sales prices are assumed to remain largely unchanged. 
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group and the company have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the annual report and financial statements. 
Accounting convention
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention modified for the fair value of share based payments. 
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries and associates are held as fixed assets and are stated at cost less provision for any impairment.
Cash flow statement
Under Financial Reporting Standard No. 1 (revised 1996), the company is not required to prepare a cash flow statement as a group 
cash flow statement has been included in the financial statements of the group. 
Share based payments
The Company operates an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan.  The fair value of the employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.  The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is 
determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for 
example, profitability and sales growth targets).  
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share 
premium when the options are exercised.
Taxation
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred taxation is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or 
a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law. Timing 
differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in 
which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are not discounted.

5. A proxy does not need to be a member of the company but must attend the Meeting to represent you. Details of how to appoint  
  the Chairman of the Meeting or another person as your proxy using the proxy form are set out in the notes to the proxy form.  
  If you wish your proxy to speak on your behalf at the Meeting you will need to appoint your own choice of proxy (not the  
  Chairman) and give your instructions directly to them.
6. You may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. You may  
  not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. T o appoint more than one proxy, please complete  
  and return the enclosed form of proxy and return it to Capita Registrars, PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham,  Kent BR3  
  4TU in accordance with the instructions thereon.
7. A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the  
  resolution. If no voting indication is given, your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. Your proxy will vote  
  (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put before the Meeting.
Appointment of proxy using hard copy proxy form
8. The notes to the proxy form explain how to direct your proxy to vote on each resolution or withhold their vote.
  T o appoint a proxy using the proxy form, the form must be:
  • completed and signed;
  • sent or delivered to Capita Registrars, PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU in accordance with the   
    instructions thereon; and
  • received by Capita Registrars (at the above address) no later than 11am on 12 December 2011.
In the case of a member which is a company, the proxy form must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an 
officer of the company or an attorney for the company.
Any power of attorney or any other authority under which the proxy form is signed (or a duly certified copy of such power or 
authority) must be included with the proxy form.
Appointment of proxy by joint members
9. In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment  
  submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint  
  holders appear in the company’s register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).
Changing proxy instructions
10.  T o change your proxy instructions simply submit a new proxy appointment using the methods set out above. Note that the  
  cut-off time for receipt of proxy appointments (see above) also applies in relation to amended instructions; any amended proxy  
  appointment received after the relevant cut-off time will be disregarded.
  Where you have appointed a proxy using the hard-copy proxy form and would like to change the instructions using another hard- 
  copy proxy form, please contact Capita Registrars on 0871 664 0300 (calls cost 10p per minute plus network extras. Lines are  
  open 8.30am to 5.30pm Monday-Friday).
  If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment, the appointment received last before the latest time for the receipt of  
  proxies will take precedence. 58       Pure Wafer plc   Annual report and accounts 2011
Termination of proxy appointments
11. In order to revoke a proxy instruction you will need to inform the company using the following method:
  •  By sending a signed hard copy notice clearly stating your intention to revoke your proxy appointment to Capita Registrars,  
   PRX, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU. In the case of a member which is a company, the revocation notice  
   must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer of the company or an attorney for the  
   company. Any power of attorney or any other authority under which the revocation notice is signed (or a duly certified copy  
   of such power or authority) must be included with the revocation notice.
   The revocation notice must be received by Capita Registrars no later than 11am on 12 December 2011.
   If you attempt to revoke your proxy appointment but the revocation is received after the time specified, then, subject to the  
   paragraph directly below, your proxy appointment will remain valid.
   Appointment of a proxy does not preclude you from attending the Meeting and voting in person. If you have appointed a  
   proxy and attend the Meeting in person, your proxy appointment will automatically be terminated.
Corporate representatives
12. A corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise, on its behalf, all its  
  powers as a member provided that no more than one corporate representative exercises powers over the same share.
Issued shares and total voting rights
13. As at 12:00 noon on 1 November 2011, the company’s issued share capital comprised 126,302,693 ordinary shares of 2p  
  each. Each ordinary share carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of the company and, therefore, the total number of  
  voting rights in the company as at 12:00 noon on 1 November 2011 is 126,302,693.
  The website referred to in note 2 will include information on the number of shares and voting rights.
Questions at the Meeting
14. Under section 319A of the Companies Act 2006, the company must answer any question you ask relating to the business being  
  dealt with at the meeting unless:
  •  answering the question would interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential  
   information;
  •  the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question; or
  •  it is undesirable in the interests of the company or the good order of the meeting that the question be answered.
Voting
15. Voting on all resolutions will be conducted by way of a poll rather than on a show of hands so that the votes of all shareholders  
  attending in person or by proxy are properly taken into account.

DTZ people are amongst the best in 
our industry, and we are proud of the 
talent and commitment of our teams 
around the world.
Training
Continuous learning is paramount to  
how we do business at DTZ. Our staff  
are keen to attain the highest standards 
for their clients and each other, so we 
make sure learning is provided at all  
levels from the most fundamental  
(but vital) e.g., health and safety through  
to professional skill enhancement in 
partnership with the Royal Institution  
of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). No 
individual has the same learning and 
development needs and our broad suite 
of training tools and methods reflects this. 
Motivation
DTZ has evolved its people strategy  
to ensure that each person’s role is 
meaningful and is enhanced by the 
global nature of the firm. Through our 
Power of One approach to delivering  
for clients and to developing our people, 
our staff are able to work wherever in  
the world our clients need us to be, and 
wherever there are opportunities for them 
to build their own experiences and 
expertise. To enable this to happen we 
have globalised our people processes  
so that talent, regardless of location,  
is always recognised, rewarded  
and encouraged.
Incentivisation
Retaining our talent through ensuring 
our global reward packages are not only 
competitive, but flexible and tailored to 
an individual’s needs is a priority at DTZ. 
Throughout the past year, the Global 
Reward team benchmarked DTZ’s 
remuneration and incentive schemes 
against the market to ensure we are  
able to attract and retain the best.  
Our reward strategy is clear, universally 
applied and has helped us retain the 
leading professionals in the marketplace  
for our clients.
Performance
DTZ is a performance-led organisation.  
It rewards performance directly through 
pay, role enhancements and promotion 
– which is what our top talent expects 
and deserves. Further, we recognise  
the importance of providing feedback  
so that individuals may continuously 
develop. To this end we have 
implemented a bi-annual global 
performance management process 
allowing a structured, information-rich 
dialogue between our professionals  
and their line managers; the outputs  
of which are calibrated by the Group 
Executive Committee ensuring attention 
is paid to career development by the 
most senior team.

To be the best firm in

our staff and our 
shareholders – where
we choose to compete.

Money into Property 
For more than 35 years, Money into 
Property has been DTZ’s flagship 
research report, analysing invested 
stock and capital flows into real estate 
markets across the world. The most 
recent report showed that invested 
stock increased globally by 3.4 per cent 
in 2010 after a 3 per cent decline in 2009 
and now stands at over US$11 trillion. 
The chart opposite shows regional 
breakdowns and our short-term 
forecasts for invested stock levels.
The Debt Funding Gap 
DTZ Research was the first to quantify 
the impact of legacy debt re-financing 
issues on local markets in its bi-annual 
report The Debt Funding Gap. In May 
2011, DTZ estimated the global debt 
funding gap to be US$202 billion over 
the next three years, a 17 per cent 
reduction on the previous six months. 
Based on further analysis, it also reported 
a 7 per cent increase in the amount  
of equity available for investment over 
the next three years, double the debt 
funding gap over the same period. 
The DTZ Fair Value Index™ 
In August 2010, DTZ Research launched 
the DTZ Fair Value Index™, the first ever 
forward looking index of commercial 
property values, providing a house  
view on the valuation of 195 global 
markets covering all sectors of commercial 
property. The Q1 2011 index reported  
a global DTZ Fair Value Index™ score  
of 50 out of a maximum of 100, implying 
that property is broadly fair value across 
markets; however, the US, rated 74, and 
Asia Pacific, rated 65, remain relatively 
most attractive.
China Insight 
China is the fastest growing commercial 
property market in the world, 
experiencing unprecedented growth  
and forecast to be the world’s largest 
property market by the end of 2011.  
In 2010 alone, invested stock rose by 
almost 25 per cent. Recognising the 
importance of this market for its clients, 
DTZ publishes reports on national 
trends, regional topical issues and 
regulatory policy changes.
Global property stock returned to growth in 
2010, with Asia Pacific leading and Europe 
and the US lagging behind, highlighting the 
two-speed nature of the global recovery.  DTZ Holdings plc

A global leader in real estate insight DTZ Holdings plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2011 10
The Group started the 2010/11 
financial year with a commitment to 
continue to build on the significant 
corporate progress it had achieved 
in the prior year. Having already 
completed a far-reaching strategic 
review and restructuring programme 
to shape the business for growth, 
the past 12 months were about 
identifying and selectively investing 
in the best opportunities to realise 
this growth for the Group.
Our main focus in this area has been on 
the development of the Group’s client 
services through initiatives such as 
targeted organic expansion into those 
areas where our clients want us to be, 
selective recruitment of high profile real 
estate professionals, and improving our 
sales and client support resources. 
Much progress can be demonstrated. 
At Group level we saw revenue decline 
by 4.1 per cent, mainly as a result of the 
overall slower recovery in the markets 
where the largest share of the Group’s 
operations are situated – namely the UK 
and Continental Europe. However in the 
Group’s second largest market – Asia 
Pacific, the story continues to be one  
of growth. At a Group level, as a result  
of a selective reduction in capacity and 
investment in talent, we have seen 
revenue per Director rise 13.5 per cent. 
Furthermore, in those markets where  
we have not witnessed growth, we are 
confident that our businesses have  
been operationally strengthened during 
the year and will now begin to benefit 
from market recovery over the next  
12 months and beyond. 
Chairman’s 
Statement
“We believe  
our businesses  
which were most

downturn have been

Business Review
Results
As mentioned above, during the course  
of the year the Group experienced varying 
trading conditions across its operations 
resulting in an overall decline in revenues 
for the year ended 30 April 201 1 to  
£341.3 million (2010: £356.0 million).
This reduction in revenues at a Group 
level taken together with our decision  
to maintain investment in the business 
led to a loss before tax and exceptional 
items of £0.6 million (2010: profit  
£3.0 million).
After exceptional items the Group 
reported a loss before tax of £3.4 million 
(2010: loss £23.5 million). 
At EBITDA level the Group was profitable 
at £8.5 million (2010: loss £3.4 million). 
Further details of the results, exceptional 
charges, and the Group’s cash position 
are given in the Financial Review.
In light of the Group’s overall performance 
and the Board’s continued belief that  
it is in the best interests of the Group to 
continue to preserve cash, the Board has 
decided not to declare a final dividend. 
The total dividend for the year is therefore 
nil (2010: nil).
Corporate Development
On 11 May 2011, DTZ confirmed that it 
had received a number of approaches for 
investment in the Company’s shares. On 
20 June 2011 it provided an update to the 
market stating that the Board continues 
to review approaches of interest in the 
Company’s shares, including one from 
Saint George Participations SAS, the 
majority shareholder of DTZ, supported 
by BNP Paribas, and is providing 
information to parties to facilitate their 
investment evaluation processes. 
These discussions remain at an early 
stage and there can be no certainty  
that any proposals will be progressed  
or that any offer will be ultimately made. 
Board Governance
The effectiveness of organisations’ 
corporate governance and risk 
management continues to remain  
under scrutiny in the wake of the  
recent global economic crisis and  
the ongoing exceptional political, 
economic and environmental events  
of the past 12 months. 
While more detail can be found in the 
Statement of Corporate Governance, 
the Board of DTZ, through its balanced 
and representative composition, is  
well placed to ensure that the right 
structures, controls and processes  
are in place to enable it to obtain the 
information it needs to manage the risks 
the Group faces, to monitor progress  
of the Group’s strategy and to be able  
to evaluate its own performance. 
Additionally, following Lorraine Baldry’s 
appointment to the Board last April as 
Non-Executive Director, and as signalled 
this time last year, Lorraine was made 
the Board’s Senior Independent Director 
in August 2010. 
Employees
On behalf of the Board and senior 
management I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank our staff worldwide 
for their continued hard work during the 
course of the year. I am confident that 
their professionalism and dedication  
will continue to serve our clients and 
shareholders well in the year ahead. 
We recognise that the ongoing success 
of the business relies on both retaining 
our top talent, and investing in new 
talent. To this effect over the past  
12 months we have welcomed several 
new senior members to our global client 
facing teams, each of whom brings with 
them a wealth of experience, know-how 
and drive. 
Outlook
At the end of my statement last year  
I spoke about the challenges and 
opportunities we would undoubtedly 
encounter in the coming year.
Whilst progress has been slower than 
we would have wished in addressing 
these, operationally much has been 
achieved and in many of our markets  
we continue to maintain our leading 
market positions. Across all our 
businesses we have exceptional client 
relationships and well respected and 
accomplished professionals.
While there is more work to be done  
at DTZ over the next 12 months and 
beyond, we believe those of our 
businesses which were most affected 
during the downturn, namely the UK  
and CEMEA, have been strengthened 
and will now begin to benefit from a 
continued market recovery. We also 
believe our Asia Pacific and Investment 
& Asset Management businesses will 
continue to deliver solid growth for  
the Group.
 
Overall our outlook does remain 
cautious, particularly given the 
continuing global economic and political 
uncertainty. However, in striving to 
become the best firm in the real estate 
services industry, for our clients, our staff 
and our shareholders, where we choose 
to compete, the Board is committed to 
delivering long term success for all the 
Group’s stakeholders.

Chief 
Executive’s 
Review
“DTZ has been 
restructured and 
refocused. Our goal 
is now to reverse the 
trend of revenue decline 
and achieve profitable 
organic growth.”
Paul T. Idzik 
Group Chief Executive
Last year I acknowledged that, in 
spite of returning to profitability at 
a pre-exceptional operating level, 
this was just the beginning of a long 
journey for DTZ. The opportunities 
and challenges we have encountered 
over the past year have confirmed this 
as the correct outlook. The prevailing 
mood must remain one of caution, 
with transaction lead times remaining 
protracted. This factor, in particular, 
has directly impacted our business 
and the Group reports a 4.1 per cent 
decline in revenue for the year ended 
30 April 2011. However, as a result  
of a focused reduction in headcount, 
revenue per Director has risen  
13.5 per cent across the Group, with 
a smaller but still improved level of 
productivity recorded across all staff.
We have continued to make tangible 
progress in terms of the restructuring  
of the business, while retaining top  
talent and improving financial flexibility. 
Nonetheless, because of the Group’s 
net debt position, constraints remain.  
To some extent this has hampered our 
ability to invest as aggressively as we 
would have liked in order to fully 
participate in the market upturn. Taken 
as a whole, the Group was undeniably  
in a weaker position than its competitors 
when the downturn began to affect the 
industry. I believe that this was a result, 
chiefly, of a previous lack of organic 
investment by DTZ in its people, 
infrastructure, and geographies.

Business Review
The economic recovery is unfolding at 
two speeds, with Asia to the fore and 
the UK and Europe trailing. A similarly 
mixed picture is emerging in property 
markets, both within regions and at 
country level. In Continental Europe, 
Germany, the Nordics and CEE (Central 
and Eastern Europe) are delivering 
strong economic growth, and their 
property markets reflect this. In the  
UK, prime central London property 
continues to attract investors, but the 
regions remain less attractive in a relative 
sense as rental growth is forecast at  
a lower level.
Performance
Group
Reflecting our varied regional 
performances and the continuing 
challenges already mentioned, the 
Group’s revenue for the financial year 
ended 30 April 2011 declined to  
£341.3 million (2010: £356.0 million).
Lower revenues at Group level and our 
commitment to continue to invest in the 
business contributed to an overall loss 
before tax and exceptional items of  
£0.6 million (2010: profit £3.0 million). 
After exceptional items the Group 
reported a much improved position 
recording a loss before tax of  
£3.4 million (2010: loss £23.5 million). 
Asia Pacific
Asia Pacific remained our strongest 
performing market, growing revenues 
to £106.3 million (2010: £98.4 million) 
– led by our best-in-class business in 
China, which is market-leading in terms 
of size and reach. The moves by the 
authorities in mainland China to dampen 
speculation and moderate inflation, as 
well as various measures aimed directly 
at cooling the residential property 
sector have, as we signalled earlier in 
the year, contributed to lower second 
half growth than anticipated at the start 
of the financial year, particularly within 
investment agency. Similar measures 
to cool the residential markets have 
also been employed in Hong Kong 
and Singapore and interest rates are 
already being raised in Australia, India, 
Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand,  
and Vietnam. 
Profit before tax and exceptional items 
remained broadly flat at £8.8 million 
(2010: £8.7 million), reflecting the 
slowdown during the second half of 
the last financial year, as well as our 
investment in organic growth in the 
region including opening new offices  
in China and India.
Economic growth in the region remains 
robust and DTZ’s unrivalled presence 
means it is uniquely positioned to 
participate in – and take advantage 
of – China’s role as a global economic 
powerhouse. Asia Pacific now provides 
over 31.0 per cent of Group revenue, 
and alongside China, our South East 
Asia and India businesses continue to 
deliver strong growth in the region.
UK & Ireland
In the UK & Ireland, the Group has 
one of the broadest regional footprints 
in the industry. While in the long term 
we believe this to be a competitive 
advantage, as it has been in the past,  
in the near term, as a result of the  
slower regional economic recovery  
this has impacted our UK performance. 
Likewise, the performance of our 
property management business, as 
well as our large exposure to the public 
sector has further impacted our results. 
While these factors led to a decline  
in revenue in the UK & Ireland to  
£128.3 million (2010: £145.7 million)  
it is encouraging to report that the  
UK business has maintained its top  
five market position during the year, and 
that productivity per Director has risen 
6.3 per cent. Additionally, in Central 
London, which remains one of the 
largest real estate markets in the world, 
DTZ has a top-tier business and was 
involved in many high profile investment 
transactions in the City and West End. 
Reflecting our decision to invest further 
in the business during the year, in 
both senior fee earning talent and in 
improving our sales and client support 
resources, the business reported 
a reduced profit before tax and 
exceptional items of £3.1 million  
(2010: £8.7 million). 
 
Continental Europe, the Middle East 
& Africa (CEMEA)
In CEMEA we have made some good 
progress, and while revenues during  
the year declined to £87 .3 million  
(2010: £91.5 million), we continue to 
improve the profitability of the business. 
We are selectively adding capacity and 
rebuilding teams; but recruiting the best 
talent takes time. It is heartening that in 
those markets where we are dedicating 
resources, and where we have 
strengthened management teams – 
primarily France, Germany, Sweden, 
Poland, and Belgium – there are now 
clear signs that DTZ is gaining traction. 
The proof of this is in the growth of our 
investment agency business and the 
solid performance of the valuation team, 
which was instructed on landmark 
engagements in Germany during the 
year. The Group has also doubled its 
property management portfolio in 
Poland during the period. In addition,  
the contribution from our affiliate in  
The Netherlands was significant.
I am particularly pleased to report that 
for the second year running the CEMEA 
business has reported an improvement 
in profit before tax and exceptional 
items, turning profitable for the year 
ended 30 April 2011 recording a profit  
of £2.4 million compared to a loss of 
£3.3 million in the prior year and a loss  
of £18.6 million in 2008/09. Additionally 
revenue per Director in the CEMEA 
business also increased during the  
year by 14 per cent.
The Americas
In the Americas, which is largely 
comprised of our Canadian business, 
while we completed some significant 
transactions during the year, overall 
revenues declined to £19.4 million  
(2010: £20.4 million) and we reported  
a loss before tax and exceptional items 
for the region of £1.7 million (2010: profit 
£0.5 million).

The Markets and DTZ 
As I mentioned earlier, there are two 
speeds to the global economic recovery. 
Global GDP growth is expected to 
remain positive at over three per cent 
this year and next, according to 
consensus economic forecasts. The 
locomotive for this is the Asia Pacific 
region and, to a lesser degree, the 
United States. Europe, however, does 
not provide similar cause for optimism, 
with consensus growth forecasts 
remaining below two per cent. Many 
financial market indicators show that 
although the likelihood of a double-dip 
recession continues to recede, 
economic uncertainty is high. There  
is a wide dispersion around the 
consensus forecasts for growth, 
particularly for the US and Europe. 
This is largely the result of two lasting 
impacts from the global financial crisis. 
First, the sovereign debt crisis in Europe 
shows little sign of abating. In spite of 
bail-outs, contagion, debt sustainability, 
bond restructuring and even outright 
default remain legitimate concerns. 
Another uncertainty is what impact  
the withdrawal of unconventional policy 
measures, such as quantitative easing, 
will have in Europe, the US, and the UK. 
Asia’s challenges are quite different. 
Buoyant domestic economies and 
increasing global food prices are stoking 
inflation. India is raising base rates and 
China is using an array of tools in an 
attempt to check rising prices. The 
biggest danger is a policy overreaction, 
which in turn hinders growth. 
The development of the global  
property market in 2010 echoed these 
macroeconomic trends. Asia Pacific 
enjoyed another stellar year. Invested 
stock, the value of investment grade 
commercial real estate, grew by  
14 per cent in spite of declines in  
Japan, according to DTZ’s annual 
Money into Property research report. 
The importance of China to the region is 
reflected by the fact it now has invested 
stock in excess of US$1 trillion and  
that growth in 2010 was a remarkable 
22 per cent. DTZ Research estimates 
that in 2011 invested stock in the Asia 
Pacific region will surpass the US. 
Invested stock in Europe, the US and  
UK was essentially flat in 2010 and  
it remains below the 2007 peak. 
Global investment transaction volumes 
rose by 76 per cent in 2010. Again this 
was largely as a result of record volumes 
in Asia Pacific. UK volumes grew by 
nearly 50 per cent from a low base.  
They are now in line with their long run 
average (1997–2010), but well below the 
cyclical peak. Cross-border investment 
activity has also recovered after two 
years of substantial declines.
For a business that derives large parts of 
its revenues from the Asia Pacific region, 
these are encouraging trends. For DTZ, 
China has become a second home 
market and last year Greater China 
reported 16.4 per cent year-on-year 
growth. The Group continues to 
strengthen its position throughout  
the Asia Pacific region where it now 
operates from 36 cities.
The Group’s global presence also 
means that it is well positioned to  
benefit from the increase in cross-border 
activity. Sentiment is clearly improving 
and liquidity has rebounded. Investors 
took advantage of attractive pricing to 
move back into commercial property in 
2010. Globally, private equity increased 
as a source of capital by 11 per cent 
according to DTZ Research.
The DTZ Fair Value Index™, which  
offers investors insight into the relative 
attractiveness of current pricing in prime 
office, retail and industrial markets, has 
declined to a global score of 50 out of  
a maximum of 100 as at Q1 2011. This 
implies that property is broadly correctly 
priced. Investors will now need to be 
more discriminating and disciplined  
to realise the best opportunities. 
This is an environment in which the 
strength of our Power of One business 
model – whereby we share our 
knowledge, skills and resources across 
service lines and country borders to 
bring the best of our global expertise  
to each and every client engagement – 
can come to the fore.

Business Review
The first quarter of 2010, when the 
global DTZ Fair Value Index™ score 
stood at 67 , was the ideal entry point  
into commercial property. However,  
Asia Pacific remains very attractive,  
with an index score of 65, which  
should continue to support DTZ’s 
market-leading business in the region. 
In Europe and the UK, the DTZ Fair 
Value Index™ score has fallen more 
markedly, but opportunities remain with 
more than 50 per cent of markets in 
both regions still attractive. By attractive 
we mean that returns are expected  
to be at, or above the level, we think 
sufficiently compensate investors for the 
markets’ risk. These include areas where 
DTZ maintains a top tier market position, 
such as London West End and City 
offices. Many attractive opportunities  
in the UK are outside London, which 
should play to the strengths of DTZ’s 
market-leading regional presence. 
Though many core markets in CEMEA 
offer lower value, the best opportunities 
are in those markets where the Group  
is directing the most resources. Many 
German markets are rated attractive  
and over the course of the last  
financial year the Group added  
70 new employees in that country.  
This team is already generating 
significant new business wins. 
Deleveraging continues. During the 
calendar year 2010, according to DTZ’s 
Money into Property report globally, 
loan-to-value (gearing) ratios fell from  
64 per cent to 61 per cent, reflecting 
both a larger proportion of equity and  
a rise in capital values. The normalisation 
of monetary policy, withdrawal of special 
liquidity measures and the requirements 
of Basel III will place additional strain  
on the banking system. Over a third  
of outstanding global property debt  
will mature between the beginning of 
2011 and end of 2013. The increasing 
pressure on lenders is likely to lead  
them to seek creative solutions and 
should provide a further boost to 
transaction activity.  DTZ Holdings plc

Corporate Development 
As announced on 6 August 2010, the 
Group completed its acquisition of the 
20 per cent of DTZ Asset Management 
Europe SAS that it did not already own. 
This action was in line with our stated 
strategy of pursuing profitable revenue 
growth from annuity businesses. 
The Group also acquired a further  
10 per cent interest in Edmund Tie  
& Company Holdings Pte Limited on  
22 November 2010. This took DTZ’s 
holding to 61 per cent. The business 
operates in Singapore, Vietnam, 
Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia. 
South East Asia is a region where the 
Group sees good growth opportunities 
and we are confident this acquisition  
will deliver long-term benefits. 
In Canada, DTZ took full ownership of 
the Montreal operation acquiring the 
outstanding 33 per cent minority stake.
Where the opportunity for profitable 
organic growth exists, DTZ has 
continued to pursue a strategy of 
targeted geographic expansion, 
particularly into those markets where  
our clients need us to be. To this effect, 
the Group opened a new office in 
Changsha in central China, taking the 
number of DTZ offices in Greater China 
to 18. DTZ’s presence in the high growth 
second-tier cities of China is a significant 
point of differentiation for the Group. 
In the Asia Pacific region, DTZ also 
added a fifth city to its Indian coverage 
by opening in Hyderabad. The Group 
has additionally entered into an affiliate 
arrangement with Baltic Property Expert 
to offer real estate services to DTZ 
clients in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. 
Strategy
The long-term strategy of DTZ remains 
unchanged in the current financial year. 
The core objective is to become the best 
real estate services firm for our clients in 
the markets where the Group chooses 
to compete. This will be driven by the 
One Firm approach, as encompassed 
by our corporate tagline – Bringing You 
the Power of One™. 
Strengthened client relationships and the 
provision of a more seamless service will 
not only drive revenues, but will also make 
them sustainable over the cycle, thereby 
enabling us to deliver for shareholders  
and attract further investment. 
At the outset of the last financial year  
we set out three strategic priorities.
Our first was to pursue profitable organic 
growth, with a particular focus on DTZ’s 
two home markets of Greater China and 
the UK, and our annuity businesses – 
Investment & Asset Management and 
Property Management. While at Group 
level revenue declined, it is encouraging 
to see the progress we are making in  
our target markets and I will now review 
our progress in each market in turn.
Greater China has once more been a 
standout success for DTZ delivering 
16.4 per cent year-on-year growth last 
year. DTZ remains the number one 
commercial real estate firm in China  
and it accounts for over 60 per cent  
of the Group’s Asia Pacific revenue. 
Despite the economic headwinds the UK 
business faced, DTZ maintained a top 
five market position, with a strong team  
in London complemented by a broad 
regional footprint and public sector 
coverage, both of which represent  
a point of differentiation and long-term 
competitive advantage for DTZ. 
 
Our Investment & Asset Management 
business has made excellent progress 
during the last financial year, increasing 
revenue contribution to the Group by 
almost 20 per cent. Our aim going 
forward is to broaden the geographic 
reach of the business and add further 
assets under management while 
continuing to deliver investment 
performance, something we are  
well positioned to do. 
While in Poland, DTZ’s property 
management portfolio has doubled 
during the year, progress in property 
management in the UK has been  
slower than expected. However, the 
appointments of a Head of Business 
and a full-time Head of Sales for 
property management, as well as the 
communication we have undertaken 
with clients to understand their needs 
more effectively, are important steps in 
restructuring this business line, realising 
operational efficiencies, and ultimately 
delivering profitable growth. 
Profitable organic revenue growth and 
reversing the downward revenue trend 
at a Group level remains a strategic 
priority. During the past financial year  
we added significant talent to our fee 
earning capacity in our core markets 
and we will continue to invest in senior 
fee earning staff to drive revenue growth. 
Over the next 12 months, alongside  
a continued focus on our annuity 
businesses, China and the UK, 
geographically we will build on the 
progress we have made in strengthening 
our CEMEA business by focusing on 
those markets where we have the 
strongest operations, namely –  
France, Germany, Sweden,  
Poland, and Belgium.

Review

Business Review
Our second strategic priority for 2010/11 
was to embed our cost containment 
initiatives. The cost conscious culture 
introduced two years ago has endured 
during the year and is now deeply 
ingrained across DTZ. We have also 
continued to restructure businesses to 
align with changing market demand, for 
example reducing the cost base of those 
teams which serve the public sector.
Our targets for cost reduction were 
aggressive. I am pleased to report  
that the pre-exceptional operating  
costs to revenue ratio continued to  
fall to 29.6 per cent from 30.5 per cent. 
However, largely a result of the decline  
in Group revenue and the reversal of  
the voluntary salary reduction (VSR)  
and reinstatement of Group pension 
contributions, we have missed our  
target to continue reducing the pre-
exceptional staff costs to revenue ratio, 
seeing an increase to 70.2 per cent  
from 67 .7 per cent. 
Consistent with our aim to selectively 
invest in new talent while further 
improving our cost structure, moving 
forward we are looking to further reduce 
our staff and operating costs to target  
a 10 per cent profit before tax margin 
over the cycle.
The final strategic priority outlined last 
year was to deepen client relationships  
by delivering the benefits of the Power  
of One. Investments have been made  
in sales training, client management 
processes and systems to facilitate cross-
selling and develop a high performance 
sales culture. This is already delivering 
positive results including the increase in 
Director profitability I referenced earlier. 
Additionally I am pleased to report that 
despite the overall reduction in the 
Group’s revenue during the year, the 
number of clients from whom we derive 
revenues in excess of £0.5 million 
increased to 1 1 1 during the year. 
The strength and depth of our long 
established client relationships is 
something for which we are renowned 
and very proud. Embedding the Power 
of One and increasing cross-selling 
across service lines and geographies 
remains one of our strategic priorities  
for the 2011/12 financial year and we  
are confident further progress in this 
area will be achieved in the near future.
Corporate Responsibility
DTZ continues to be fully committed  
to conducting its business in a socially 
responsible manner, balancing 
commercial imperatives with our duties 
to stakeholders and the communities  
in which we operate. One achievement 
in this area over the past 12 months of 
which we are particularly proud is our 
participation, and subsequent Bronze 
rating, in Business in the Community’s 
2011 Corporate Responsibility Index.
The index provides a benchmark of  
a company’s Corporate Responsibility 
activity in the UK and the significant 
year-on-year improvement in DTZ’s 
rating is testament to the importance  
our people place on Corporate 
Responsibility both as employees  
within DTZ, and in the sustainability 
services we deliver for clients. 
Summary
It has been another difficult year, but I am 
encouraged by the continued advances 
that have been made. That said, the 
structural impediments to the Group 
achieving its full potential in terms of 
revenue generation have proved more 
enduring and difficult to overcome than 
anticipated. While we are behind schedule, 
there is a positive momentum in many of 
our key business areas and where further 
work is required, such as in CEMEA, we 
are taking the necessary actions. 
In spite of some headwinds we  
remain confident that we have the  
right strategy in place. Considerable 
progress has already been made and 
we are committed to continuing to work 
towards the goals that we have set. DTZ 
has been restructured and refocused. 
The transformation continues and will 
deliver sustainable growth and 
profitability in the long term.

34.9%
of total revenue
DTZ’s Occupational & Development 
Markets business provides advice 
and transaction support to occupiers, 
landlords, and developers. During 
the year, the business continued to 
maintain market share in our key 
markets and overall revenues were 
stable at £119.0 million (2010: £118.5 
million). Strong results in the Asia 
Pacific region were offset by weaker 
performances in CEMEA and the UK. 
UK & Ireland
DTZ has maintained market share  
in its core London market and high  
profile business wins include the highly 
successful leasing of One New Change 
in the City and Regents Place in  
the West End. London is a global 
marketplace attracting cross-border 
investors and its recovery reflects  
the worldwide economic upturn with 
emerging markets, Asia, and the US  
to the fore. 
Outside London, the property market 
more closely reflects the domestic 
economy, which remains lacklustre. In  
the UK regions the picture is nuanced. 
Cities and regions that are more 
dependent on the public sector, such  
as the north-east, have been particularly 
slow to recover as a result of the cuts to 
local authority budgets. In other regions, 
including the north west of England 
(Greater Manchester) and the west of 
Scotland (Glasgow), there are more 
positive signs as private sector activity 
begins to pick up. DTZ’s regional offices 
will benefit as this recovery gathers pace. 
DTZ advises some of the biggest 
occupiers in the UK including Barclays 
and J.P . Morgan. The Group has 
maintained its market leading position  
in the retail sector and is the leasing 
agent for the landmark Westfield Centre 
in Shepherds Bush (London) and the 
Westfield Stratford City development 
(due to open in September 2011)  
which, with more than 300 stores,  
will be the biggest urban shopping 
centre in Europe. 
The UK industrial market remains 
challenging. There is an overhang  
of available property and supply still 
outstrips demand in many areas. 
However, due to a reducing stock  
of Grade A space, a modest increase  
in pre-leasing may signal the start  
of a turnaround. 
CEMEA
Though revenues fell modestly, activity  
in Europe is accelerating; particularly in 
France, Germany, and Sweden. The  
first phase of the recovery saw investor 
and occupier activity pick up in prime 
properties in major cities such as Paris 
and Frankfurt. More recently this 
recovery has become more broadly 
based, particularly in the retail and  
office market segments. 
Harbour cities such as Antwerp, 
Hamburg, and Rotterdam are also 
seeing increased activity especially in  
the industrial/logistics sector, reflecting 
the global economic recovery. However, 
the business environment remains very 
challenging in the indebted southern 
European economies of Spain and Italy. 
Asia Pacific 
DTZ’s Occupational & Development 
business in Asia Pacific continues to 
grow at a double-digit pace largely as  
a result of mainland China where the 
Group now operates from 16 cities. The 
Chinese commercial real estate market 
is growing at more than 20 per cent 
annually and is forecast to become  
the second biggest market in terms  
of invested stock this year. South East 
Asia has also rebounded strongly from 
the global financial crisis. 
Though measures taken to cool 
residential property prices have 
dampened activity, a relatively small 
amount of DTZ’s business is derived 
from this sector and long-term 
commercial fundamentals remain  
very positive. 
Connectivity around the region has 
improved and DTZ is now acting for  
a number of occupiers intra-regionally, 
including clients from Hong Kong, 
Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. 
DTZ’s global strength in the retail  
sector is winning business with global 
occupiers developing Chinese and 
regional platforms. During the year,  
the office agency team disposed of  
10.6 million sq ft across the region. 
The Americas
DTZ’s North American business  
is focused on Canada where it has  
a network of 18 offices. It has been 
buoyed by both domestic economic 
recovery, and accelerating GDP growth 
in the US. Demand for office space in 
the important market of Greater Toronto 
is healthy with low vacancy. Seven office 
buildings representing 1.8 million sq ft 
were under construction around the  
City in the first quarter of 2011, a rise  
of 0.3 per cent compared to Q4 2010 
and office rents are increasing. 
India 
DTZ has been advising 
Sapient since 2006 and at 
present remains its exclusive 
real estate services provider 
in India. Most recently, the 
DTZ team has been advising 
Sapient on the acquisition 
of a space in Gurgaon which 
Sapient intends to use as an IT 
solutions development centre.  DTZ Holdings plc

Business Review
Professional Services
£87.3m
Revenue (2010: £93.7m)
25.6%
of total revenue
DTZ’s Professional Services 
business comprises property and 
facilities management as well as 
project management and building 
consultancy services to support a 
broad range of corporate, occupier, 
and investor clients. DTZ has one 
of the largest global (excluding US) 
portfolios under management across 
all sectors of commercial property. 
The Group manages more than 270 
retail schemes across Europe, is the 
number one non-domestic property 
manager in mainland China, and 
manages property for half of the 
top 20 occupiers in the world. 
The Professional Services team advises 
two distinct client groups: investors  
and corporate occupiers. For investors, 
DTZ manages the relationship between 
landlord and tenants. While for occupiers, 
the Corporate Real Estate Management 
(CREM) team looks after the interests of 
freeholders and leaseholders. 
While revenue streams are more 
annuity-like than DTZ’s transactional 
businesses, new business opportunities 
inevitably arise when an asset changes 
hands. The continued cautiousness  
of investors and resulting dampened 
transaction volumes have to some 
extent impacted the business and 
contributed to the decline in revenue  
to £87 .3 million (2010: £93.7 million).
UK & Ireland 
Professional Services remains the 
biggest revenue contributor to the  
UK & Ireland business, contributing  
35.3 per cent. Outsourcing of property 
management remains a priority among 
corporate occupiers and continues to 
provide new business opportunities. 
However, as mentioned above, clients 
are erring on the side of caution, which 
means lead times are extended. 
There are, however, signs that business 
is recovering. New mandates included  
a portfolio of distressed assets on  
behalf of a bank and a major pension 
fund portfolio. It is anticipated that 
bank-driven activity could create  
further opportunities. 
To help leverage this recovery and 
deliver future growth, a UK Head of 
Business and a full-time Head of Sales 
for Property Management have been 
appointed and represent important 
steps in restructuring this business line. 
The expectation is that as the business 
is realigned it will resume the growth 
trajectory that has characterised  
historic performance. 
Sustainability is a fast growing area  
of the business. This is partly the  
result of regulation but is also due  
to an increasing awareness of the 
importance of Corporate Responsibility. 
This business is no longer simply about 
a box-ticking approach to compliance 
but is designed to add true financial 
value to property. 
CEMEA
Professional Services accounts for over 
a quarter of overall CEMEA revenue  
for DTZ. The Group is now the number 
one managing agent shopping centre 
manager in Europe. Operating from 19 
offices with 325 staff, in CEMEA DTZ 
manages across all sectors more than 
1,200 properties with 11,500 occupiers 
and a total rent roll of €1 billion. 
The highlight of the year has been the 
progress of the business in Central  
and Eastern Europe. DTZ’s business  
in Poland has doubled and its retail 
management portfolio continues to 
expand. Professional Services has 
appointed a new CEMEA Finance 
Director and a new Head of Strategic 
Property Management in Central and 
Eastern Europe. 
Asia Pacific 
The property management business  
in Asia Pacific in general, and mainland 
China specifically, continues to see 
double-digit growth. DTZ is the largest 
non-domestic property and facilities 
management firm in mainland China 
with more than 3,800 staff operating in 
82 cities across a portfolio of 956 million 
sq ft. However, business generation 
slowed modestly in the first quarter  
of 2011 as government measures to 
control prices and moderate perceived 
speculation in residential property began 
to bite. These measures are having a 
particularly marked impact in tier one 
cities such as Shanghai and Beijing. 
The depth of DTZ’s network in second 
tier cities has benefited the business as 
these locations promise faster growth 
than the more mature cities. The Group 
continues to invest in its Professional 
Services division in the region to take 
advantage of these growth rates and 
meet client demand. Over the course  
of the year a new Head of Property 
Management in North China, Head of 
Property Management in Hong Kong, 
and Head of Project Management for 
Asia Pacific have been hired. 
Poland 
In January 2011 DTZ was 
appointed as property 
manager and leasing agent  
for the retail element (more 
than 200 stores) of Złote 
Tarasy in Warsaw – one of the 
most prestigious shopping 
centres in Poland.

Valuation
£60.9m
Revenue (2010: £60.8m)
1 7.8%
of total revenue
DTZ provides investors, corporate and 
public sector owners, lenders, and 
fund managers with a broad array of 
valuation, appraisal, and due diligence 
services. Clients use valuation advice 
first and foremost to make purchase 
and investment decisions. Valuation 
also provides input into due diligence 
and asset financing and plays an 
important role in stock market listings 
and securitisation.
DTZ’s valuation and appraisal business 
maintains a top-three market share  
in UK and CEMEA and number  
one ranking in mainland China.  
Its performance is inevitably linked to  
global transaction levels. The increase  
in transaction volumes and sharp  
rise in capital available for real estate 
investment, according to DTZ’s latest 
Great Wall of Money report, should 
ensure a continued recovery in  
valuation activity. 
 
However, it is a business that lags the 
cycle. Despite this, the team delivered  
a solid performance during the year  
and reported broadly flat revenues of 
£60.9 million (2010: £60.8 million). The 
business performance of our valuation 
service reflects broader trends in the 
global economy and property markets. 
Activity in the Asia Pacific markets in 
general, and China in particular have 
improved, while the UK and CEMEA 
remain challenging. 
 
The valuations team has responded to 
the downturn in ad hoc business and 
decline in banking and securitisation 
activity by focusing on core client 
groups, such as Real Estate Investment 
Trusts, property fund managers, and 
other institutional investors. These 
revenues have an annuity-like profile  
but there is continuing fee pressure. 
However, as the cycle turns and banks 
and private equity managers become 
more active, DTZ is well positioned  
to participate.
 
The business has won notable new 
mandates as investors rationalise  
their service providers, favouring firms 
with cross-border expertise. To reflect 
this, the valuations business has  
been restructured so that a global 
coordination group based in London is 
now able to draw on best-in-class local 
knowledge through DTZ’s international 
network. This reflects client demand for 
global solutions, delivered locally. 
 
UK & Ireland 
Activity remains concentrated in the 
prime end of the market and central 
London. The trickle down to the regions 
as investors search for yield has been 
slower than expected. However, as the 
economy recovers business should 
increase and DTZ’s strong regional 
presence means the Group is well 
positioned to benefit. 
A particular strength of DTZ is corporate 
recovery and restructuring. It offers 
market-leading advice to banking and 
accounting clients on distressed assets 
focusing on planning, occupation, rent 
collection, management, development, 
and disposal. It has provided strategic 
advice on the disposal of assets worth 
more than £3 billion in the past five 
years. This business area has seen 
increased activity in the UK and should 
see further growth as banks respond  
to the changing regulatory requirements 
of Basel III. 
 
CEMEA 
The CEMEA market remains challenging 
reflecting the high degree of economic 
uncertainty, especially in the southern 
and western periphery of the Eurozone. 
However, economic recovery in northern 
Europe has led to an increase in business 
activity. DTZ’s valuation team in Germany 
has had a particularly strong year, winning 
and advising on some of the largest 
instructions in the market. 
DTZ’s corporate recovery and 
restructuring business is also beginning 
to see an upturn in business in Europe. 
 
Asia Pacific
The valuations business in Asia Pacific 
continues to thrive. Throughout the 
region DTZ valued 121,000 properties 
worth more than US$604.0 billion 
(£386.0 billion) during the course of the 
last 12 months. For DTZ, Hong Kong  
is the biggest market by number of 
properties valued. Japan, Taiwan, 
Thailand, and Singapore are also 
significant markets but, in terms of 
aggregate amount valued, mainland 
China at US$337 billion comprises  
55 per cent of the regional total. 
 
In spite of attempts by the government 
to dampen residential property markets 
in Greater China, opportunities for the 
valuations business continue to be 
buoyed by strong economic growth,  
and an increasing number of Chinese 
enterprises seeking Hong Kong Stock 
Exchange listings. The move to adopt 
International Accounting Standards in 
2012 will also generate valuation 
business.
Germany 
DTZ’s valuation team in 
Frankfurt provided valuation 
services in connection with 
the largest single investment 
transaction carried out in 
Germany in 2010. OpernTurm 
is Frankfurt’s latest landmark 
tower building spanning 42 
floors. OpernTurm was sold 
to an institutional property 
fund advised by J.P. Morgan 
and global investment firm, 
Government of Singapore 
Investment Corporation (GIC).  DTZ Holdings plc

Investment Agency
£39.4m
Revenue (2010: £46.6m)
11.5%
of total revenue
The Investment Agency business 
advises on the acquisition and 
disposal of commercial real estate. 
During the 2010/11 financial year 
the recovery in investment markets 
around the world continued, though 
at an uneven pace. This led to a 
decline in revenues to £39.4 million 
for the year ended 30 April 2011 
(2010: £46.6 million). Prime markets 
in Europe have been buoyant and 
Asia Pacific enjoyed a strong 2010 
– however, government measures 
in mainland China to dampen 
speculation led to a slowdown  
in the region in the second half  
of the last financial year. 
Demand for property in second-tier 
cities in CEMEA, the UK regions, and 
the industrial sector has also been 
lacklustre, though there are nascent 
signs of a revival of investor interest. 
Across markets, the expectations  
of vendors and buyers are now  
close to alignment. 
UK & Ireland
While not reaching the market highs  
of 2007 , 2010/11 has seen clear signs  
of a sustainable recovery in commercial 
property markets. Central London office 
leasing has returned to its long-term 
average and prime rents have moved 
strongly upward. Investment transaction 
volumes in Greater London accounted for 
almost half of the UK total, reflecting the 
tilt toward prime stock in the metropolis. 
The regions continued to lag London 
during the year, but play a vital role in 
helping DTZ win business with clients 
that require real estate advice on a 
national basis. Further, the pipeline of 
prime development in central London  
is half that of last year. This is beginning 
to prompt investors to look beyond the 
capital and prime stock. DTZ expects 
that in the next phase of the investment 
cycle buyers will target regional and 
non-prime assets in the UK. 
CEMEA
Markets improved gradually during  
the second half of the financial year, 
particularly in France, Germany and 
Central and Eastern Europe. Major cities 
are leading the recovery, particularly 
Paris and Frankfurt. The Swedish market 
is also robust. The Netherlands and 
Belgium were in line with expectations. 
However, the lingering sovereign debt 
crisis continues to weigh on investor 
sentiment toward Greece, Ireland,  
Italy, Portugal, and Spain. 
DTZ has seen an increase in instructions 
in Central and Eastern Europe. Poland 
remains the regional hub for the Group, 
but greater coordination with local 
businesses and investment in key staff  
is garnering some success. For example, 
DTZ won a record amount of business in 
the Czech Republic over the year. 
According to DTZ’s Money into Property 
report, the 64 per cent rise in investment 
transaction volumes in Europe in 2010 
was strong, albeit below the 76 per cent 
global increase. Europe is forecast  
to continue to recover in 2011, with  
a 20 per cent increase in volumes. This 
is expected to be the fastest growing 
regional increase as Asia Pacific 
volumes plateau. 
There are also clear signs of an increasing 
interest in Europe among cross-border 
investors. Inter-regional transaction 
volumes rose by 40 per cent in 2010, 
following two years of substantial declines. 
Asia Pacific sovereign wealth and pension 
funds have recently been active.
Asia Pacific
The rebound from the global financial 
crisis began to unfold in mid-2009 and 
continued through 2010 in Asia Pacific 
real estate. However, rising interest rates 
on deposits and loans and increased 
bank reserve requirements in China have 
begun to present a headwind to our 
investment agency business. In spite  
of this, the Asia Pacific investment team 
advised on 34 sizeable transactions with 
an investment value of US$2.3 billion  
in 2010/11. 
In a landmark transaction, DTZ advised 
on the first investment property deal by  
a Chinese insurer following a change in 
regulation in 2011 to permit direct real 
estate investment. Currently, insurance 
company portfolios are heavily weighted 
toward bonds and bank deposits. 
Assuming a conservative five per cent  
of portfolios are directed to property, 
more than US$37 billion could be 
channelled into the market in the next 
three to five years. This is part of a 
broader trend that has seen domestic 
investors become by the far the 
dominant force in the Chinese market. 
DTZ, with its unrivalled coverage in  
18 cities in Greater China is well 
positioned to benefit.
China 
DTZ advised Ping An Property 
& Casualty Insurance 
Company of China, Ltd on 
the acquisition of Central 
Point Phase II, a Grade A 
office building in Chengdu for 
RMB727 million (£70.1 million). 
This was the first investment 
property deal by a Chinese 
insurer following a change in 
regulation in 2011 to permit 
direct real estate investment.  DTZ Holdings plc

Investment & Asset Management 
£16.4m
Revenue (2010: £13.8m)
4.8%
of total revenue
DTZ’s Investment Management and 
Asset Management businesses 
provide discretionary and non-
discretionary real estate investment, 
acquisition, and management 
services. The business aims 
to help clients achieve optimal 
performance in the asset class 
consistent with their risk appetite. 
These risk/return objectives are met 
through partnership and dialogue 
with clients, tailored advice, and 
transaction services. 
Internally, during the course of the 
2010/11 financial year the strategic focus 
was on developing our Investment & 
Asset Management platform, following 
the acquisition of the remaining 20 per 
cent minority shareholding of DTZ Asset 
Management Europe SAS that the 
Group did not own. 
Strategically, the Group remains 
committed to growing its annuity 
businesses and Investment & Asset 
Management had an excellent year.  
Today the business has £6. 1 billion  
(30 April 2010: £5. 1 billion) in property 
assets under management and 
contributed £16.4 million (2010: £13.8 
million) to Group revenues during the year. 
Investor sentiment towards property as 
an asset class continued to improve. In 
the midst of the financial crisis, investors 
who already had exposure took 
advantage of distressed prices to add to 
their portfolios tactically. This continues 
to be a driver for some investment flows. 
An increasing number of investors are 
also viewing the asset class strategically; 
as a diversifying alternative to stocks  
and bonds with an attractive risk/return 
profile and as a hedge against inflation 
risk. This is attracting new investors with 
little previous exposure to real estate. 
As defined benefit plans mature, clients 
are placing greater emphasis on more 
closely matching assets and liabilities. 
This should encourage further demand 
for the asset class. 
DTZ Investment Management
DTZ Investment Management (DTZ IM) 
is based in London and principally 
manages segregated accounts on 
behalf of corporate and local authority 
pension fund clients. In the course of  
the financial year, DTZ IM secured more 
than £1 billion of additional assets under 
management from a combination of new 
and existing clients. Total assets under 
management now exceed £3.3 billion 
(30 April 2010: £2.0 billion), including 
mandated but un-invested allocations. 
The business depends on three critical 
factors: the quality of our investment 
professionals; the investment 
performance track record; and the ability 
to deploy client capital well. DTZ IM has 
secured 11 ‘best performing fund’ 
awards from the Investment Property 
Databank (IPD) over the last 11 years.  
It also had its busiest ever calendar  
year in 2010, completing £700 million  
of investment transactions during  
the period.
DTZ Asset Management 
DTZ Asset Management is based in 
Paris and has a team of 60, dedicated  
to third-party real estate asset 
management in Europe. This 
experienced team advises on a wide 
range of property assets in France, 
Germany, Belgium and Italy. 
The business has had a good year with 
improved revenue contribution and a 
number of new wins. At 30 April 2011  
the business had €3.1 billion (2010:  
€3.6 billion) in assets under management 
and has a strong pipeline of over €500 
million of new mandates that are 
expected to be committed during  
Q1 of the 201 1/12 financial year.
Our asset management team offers 
institutional investors a robust integrated 
platform for real estate management 
offering a full range of services from 
strategy definition, fund structuring, 
acquisitions, value added management, 
and exit strategies. It counts among  
its clients some of the world’s biggest 
property investors including life insurance, 
pension funds, banks, and a large 
spectrum of real estate companies.
UK 
DTZ IM secured a significant 
mandate during the year from 
Glasgow City Council, as 
administering authority  
to Strathclyde Pension Fund, 
to manage its UK real estate 
investments. The Fund has  
a 10 per cent allocation to 
UK real estate, which would 
equate to around £1 billion 
exposure once fully invested.  DTZ Holdings plc

Consulting & Research

of total revenue
Revenues in DTZ’s Consulting & 
Research business declined for  
the year ended 30 April 2011 to  
£18.3 million (2010: £22.6 million) 
reflecting the continued weakness  
in UK consulting as a result of its 
reliance on the public sector. This 
was partially offset by the strength  
of our consulting business in Asia 
Pacific – where we have benefited 
from strong development activity  
and from our leading market position, 
and a growing contribution from  
our research business which has an 
expanding list of blue-chip clients 
who subscribe to our data products.
Consulting 
With 250 consultants throughout DTZ’s 
global network, the Group has one  
of the largest real estate consultancy 
businesses. We advise clients from 
across the private and public sectors, 
focusing on their key property-related 
business issues. Our service offering 
consists of two main elements: 
development consulting and corporate/
occupier consulting. 
In the UK, the government’s 
Comprehensive Spending Review 
(CSR), associated cuts in local authority 
and other public sector budgets, as  
well as the severe restriction on new 
development, inevitably impacted our 
consulting business. To address this 
slowdown, management took action 
ahead of the new financial year, through 
restructuring and reducing the cost  
base of those teams which serve the 
public sector, and increasing the focus 
on providing advice for corporate 
occupier clients. 
In the long term, we strongly believe our 
public sector expertise in the UK is a 
competitive advantage, as evidenced by 
the fact that our development consulting 
business was confirmed during the year 
as the most widely used consultancy in 
public sector regeneration in a survey 
published by Regeneration & Renewal 
magazine. We are confident the 
restructuring of our consulting business 
will enable us to maintain this market 
leading position and benefit the Group 
as the market recovers.
In CEMEA, DTZ’s consulting business  
is delivered from four regional hubs, in 
France, Germany, CEE, and the Middle 
East. While we have seen a softening  
of our revenues in the region, the 
business continues to support our  
other service lines in the region and  
with a strengthened core team we 
believe offers further growth potential. 
 
In Asia Pacific, we have seen strong 
growth by our consulting teams in 
Greater China, South East Asia, and 
India during the last 12 months. In 
particular, DTZ continues to enjoy  
a dominant position in China, where  
the growth of our consulting business  
is underpinned by the opportunities  
arising from three secular trends:  
the development of retail space to  
serve the growing middle class, the 
continued development of transport 
infrastructure, and the accelerated 
growth in commercial real estate  
in second-tier cities.
Research 
Acting as an independent research 
house, DTZ Research provides its  
own views and conclusions on global 
real estate markets through its well 
respected publications and market 
commentaries, and through insights 
delivered to clients across the firm. The 
team tracks the performance of markets, 
provides forecasts of key indicators, and 
delivers industry-leading insights on the 
implication of future trends.
During the year, DTZ’s researchers  
around the globe published quarterly 
coverage on property markets in  
more than 30 countries and 60 cities.  
This comprehensive coverage is 
complemented by flagship annual series 
such as Money into Property, for investors, 
and Global Occupancy Costs and 
Obligations of Occupation, for occupiers, 
as well as subscription data products for 
the world’s leading real estate companies 
and financial institutions.
In August 2010, DTZ Research launched 
the DTZ Fair Value Index™, the first ever 
forward looking index of commercial 
property values, which provides a house 
view on the valuation of 195 global 
markets covering all sectors of 
commercial property. 
The DTZ Fair Value Index™ is updated 
quarterly is well received by clients and 
is regularly referenced by the global  
media. It has also contributed to further 
entrenching DTZ Research’s position  
as the leading source for fundamental 
research on direct real estate markets.

Financial  
Review
The year to 30 April 2011 was 
another challenging period for  
the firm, with revenues falling  
4.1 per cent to £341.3 million (2010: 
£356.0 million). However, as a result 
of the Group’s strong financial 
controls, costs were effectively 
managed, and despite continued 
investment in the business, the 
Group reports a near break-even 
loss before tax and exceptional 
items of £0.6 million (2010: profit 
£3.0 million).
The past 12 months saw continued 
corporate progress as the Group  
further strengthened its financial 
flexibility – securing an additional 
undrawn £10 million mezzanine facility 
from its majority shareholder, SGP  
and renegotiating its bank facilities  
with the Royal Bank of Scotland  
on improved terms. These actions 
enabled continued investment and 
therefore the furtherance of the 
strategic transformation of the Group.
We continued to take action on costs 
and it is pleasing to be able to report  
a further reduction in the Group’s 
pre-exceptional operating costs from 
£108.7 million to £101.0 million, an 
analysis of which is provided below.
After exceptional items the Group 
delivered a much improved position, 
reporting a loss before tax of £3.4 million 
(2010: loss £23.5 million). EBITDA also 
improved to £8.5 million profit (2010: 
loss £3.4 million).

of the Group’s key growth areas. Solid 
performances were also achieved by our 
Occupational & Development Markets 
business which contributed £119.0 
million to Group revenue (2010: £118.5 
million) and our Valuation business 
achieving revenues of £60.9 million 
(2010: £60.8 million). Further detail on

Our CEMEA business, which suffered  
the most during the downturn, and where 
investment to strengthen the business 
continues, delivered a small decline in 
revenues to £87 .3 million (2010: £91.5 
million). However, stringent cost 
management, together with earlier 
restructuring actions, resulted in a 
significant improvement in the region’s 
profit before tax and exceptional items 
performance, with the business reporting 
a profit of £2.4 million compared to a loss 
of £3.3 million in 2010 representing an 
improvement of £5.7 million. 
Our Asia Pacific business delivered 
continued growth with revenues up  
7 .9 per cent to £106.3 million (2010: 
£98.5 million). Asia Pacific remains  
our second largest market after the UK 
& Ireland, contributing 31.1 per cent to 
the Group’s total revenue. The region 
contributed profit before tax and 
exceptional items of £8.8 million  
(2010: £8.7 million). This broadly flat 
performance reflects our continued 
investment in the region.
The Americas region, which is 
predominately comprised of DTZ 
Barnicke, our Canadian business, 
experienced a small decline in revenues 
to £19.4 million (2010: £20.4 million).  
We reported a loss before tax and 
exceptionals for the region of £1.7 million 
(2010: profit £0.5 million).  DTZ Holdings plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2011 26
Costs
Costs before exceptional items 
decreased by £9.0 million, 2.6 per cent, 
to £340.6 million (2010: £349.6 million). 
During the period staff costs declined by 
£1.3 million or 0.5 per cent. The average 
number of directly employed staff 
declined by 261 people year-on-year  
to 3,985 primarily as a result of 
restructuring actions. 
Along with our peers in service 
industries across the world, the Group’s 
largest cost remains staff, which 
accounted for 70.2 per cent of revenue 
compared with 67 .7 per cent in the 
previous year on a pre-exceptional 
basis. This increase is attributable to  
the decline in revenues as well as the  
full year effects of the re-instatement  
of the voluntary salary reduction (VSR) 
and pension freeze which came back  
to full amounts from July 2010. The 
Board remains committed to a long-term  
and sustained reduction in staff costs.
The most significant area of cost 
reduction was seen in pre-exceptional 
operating costs, which declined by  
£7 .2 million or 7 .1 per cent. In addition 
depreciation and amortisation reduced 
by £0.5 million to £7 .1 million. As a 
proportion of revenue, the Group was 
successful in meeting its target to 
operate below 30 per cent. Operating 
costs were 29.6 per cent in the year 
compared with 30.5 per cent in the 
previous year. Again the Group will  
look to improve upon this in the  
current financial year.
2  During the period a review was carried 
out of historic fair value adjustment 
made in connection with the 
acquisition of Donaldsons. Assets and 
Liabilities to the net value of £808,000 
were identified as no longer being 
required. The non-cash adjustment 
was a credit to exceptional items.
Taxation 
The Group’s tax charge has increased  
to £6.5 million (2010: £0.5 million). This 
reflects the tax charged in jurisdictions 
where the Group generated profits and  
a deferred tax charge of £0.8 million 
(2010: credit £4.1 million).
Earnings per Share and Dividends 
Basic earnings per share before 
exceptionals is a loss of 3.50 pence  
per share (2010: profit per share  
0.52 pence). Basic earnings per  
share after exceptional items remains  
a loss per share of 4.59 pence  
(2010: loss 9.82 pence).
The Board continues to believe it is  
in the best interests of the Group to 
continue to maintain the strength of  
its balance sheet and therefore has 
decided not to recommend a final 
dividend for the year to 30 April 2011 
(2010: nil). No interim dividend was paid 
during the year so the total dividend for 
the year is nil (2010: nil).
Foreign exchange movements  
had a significant impact on costs.  
On a constant currency basis, for the 
entire year, our costs decreased to 
£99.4 million, a decrease of £9.1 million 
or 8.4 per cent.
As previously stated, the restructuring 
programme completed during the 
2009/10 financial year was not a ‘one-off’ 
exercise and senior management and the 
Board remain committed to continually 
reviewing the shape of the business  
to ensure it is flexible enough to meet 
changing market conditions and  
client requirements. 
For example over the course of the  
past 12 months the Group continued  
to be negatively impacted by its large 
exposure to the public sector in the  
UK through its consulting business.  
In response, the decision was taken  
to reduce the Group’s cost base in  
this area and restructure the business  
to best reflect market conditions. 
Exceptional Items 
To enable a clearer understanding of the 
Group’s underlying performance and to 
assist comparability between periods, the 
exceptional items have been reported 
separately in the income statement. 
These exceptional items are: 
1  Restructuring and redundancy  
costs as a result of our restructuring 
programme of £3.6 million, of  
which £3.5 million relates to 
redundancy costs.

Acquisitions
During the year, the Group undertook 
the following corporate activity:
 On 6 August 2010, the Group  >
acquired the remaining 20 per cent 
minority interest in DTZ Asset 
Management Europe SAS, part of  
our Asset Management business  
in France 
 On 20 August 2010, the Group  >
acquired the remaining 33 per cent 
minority interest in DTZ Barnicke 
Quebec Ltee, part of our  
Canadian business 
 On 22 November 2010, the Group  >
acquired a further 10 per cent interest 
in Edmund Tie & Company Holdings, 
our South East Asia business to bring 
our total shareholding to 61 per cent.
Pensions 
At 30 April 2011, a deficit of £6.0 million 
was held on the balance sheet (2010: 
£10.2 million). The deficit has decreased 
primarily due to the change in inflation 
measure from RPI to CPI for future 
revaluations of pensions in deferment, 
and actual asset returns being higher 
than expectations.
Cash Flow and Borrowings
In December 2010, the Group entered 
into an agreement with The Royal Bank 
of Scotland to further amend the terms 
of its bank facilities. As a result of the 
renegotiation, the Group has extended 
its £15 million revolving credit facility –  
on improved terms, improved flexibility 
around the amortisation schedule,  
and also improved margin on the  
RBS facilities. In addition, at this time,  
an additional £10 million mezzanine 
facility was secured from SGP . 
As at 30 April 2011, the Group had cash 
and cash equivalents of £42.2 million. 
This compares to £27 .4 million at  
31 October 2010 and £50.6 million  
at 30 April 2010. In addition, the 
Company had a revolving credit facility 
of £15.0 million and £10.0 million under 
the SGP facility at the year-end which 
remain undrawn.
Throughout the year, the average cash 
and cash equivalents for the Group was 
£34.8 million, compared to £40.7 million 
in the prior year.
Net debt at 30 April 2011 was  
£64.0 million (31 October 2010: net debt 
£80.1 million; 30 April 2010: net debt 
£47 .5 million), comprised as follows:

Undrawn facilities 25.0 20.0
At 30 April 2011, the Group’s net assets 
were £43.7 million (2010: £55.4 million). 
Summary
The past 12 months have seen the 
Group continue its transformation. While 
cost containment remains a priority, 
investment during the year has focused 
on opportunities to improve the Group’s 
client services and therefore ultimately 
drive revenue, and on those initiatives 
which will deliver long-term value. 
Although trading remains challenging, 
we have strong market positions in 
those markets where we choose to 
compete and are confident we have  
the right strategy in place to complete 
the turnaround of the business.

Risks and Uncertainties
Financial Risk Management
Key Financial Risks Commentary
The Group has formal financial risk management policies in 
place designed to minimise its financial risks. These policies 
and risks are reviewed annually and appropriate delegated 
authorities are put in place. All material financing transactions 
are subject to approval by the Board. The treasury function 
is not a profit centre and the Group does not undertake 
speculative transactions.
The key financial risks impacting the Group are:
Foreign currency risk
The Group publishes its results in sterling but has a number of overseas businesses operating in foreign currencies. The Group 
does not, at this stage of its development, consider it necessary to hedge the foreign exchange risks arising from the translation 
of overseas trading results into sterling. However, the Board does seek to hedge against the translation of foreign currency 
denominated assets and liabilities by arranging acquisition finance in the same currency. At 30 April 2011, the Group had bank 
and shareholder loans denominated in foreign currencies of £30.1 million in order to hedge against specific investments. 
Interest rate risk
The Group’s current policy is for a minimum of 40.0 per cent of debt to be fixed or capped in a three year period. The Group 
has interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. At the year end, approximately 44.0 per cent of  
the Group’s borrowings were at fixed rates.
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables and investments. The  
Group credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of 
allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event, which,  
based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows. The credit on liquid funds  
and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by 
international credit rating agencies.
Liquidity risk
The Group seeks to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet its long-term strategic objectives. During the year management 
undertook an extremely thorough planning and budgeting process including the Group’s liquidity requirements. The Group 
maintains a working capital model. Sensitivities are modelled taking reasonable account of possible changes in trading 
performance to ensure the Group has adequate resources to meet its working capital requirements for the foreseeable future, 
being at least 12 months. The Group also prepares and monitors rolling forecasts of its liquidity position (comprising undrawn 
borrowing facilities (note 22) and cash and cash equivalents (note 23). This is carried out at local level in the operating 
companies of the Group as well as on a Group consolidated basis. These forecasts have been subject to stress testing  
by management.
Operational Risk Management
Key Operational Risks Nature of Risk Key Controls and Mitigation
The Group’s risk management process is integral to the 
operations of the business and risks are regularly assessed. 
This process is managed by the Group Risk Management 
Committee, which is chaired by the Global Chief Operating 
Officer. The Committee’s remit includes all appropriate 
aspects of risk including financial systems and controls.
It is of course not possible to mitigate completely the risks that 
the Group faces, especially in a rapidly changing economic 
climate, however the principal operational risks are:
Changing market 
conditions
The international property market is cyclical and will be 
impacted by changes in economic activity, interest rates and 
the availability of finance. Additionally the Group remains 
sensitive to the underlying economic environment in the 
markets where it operates. In particular, the Eurozone and the 
UK have seen significant turmoil due to the effects of sovereign 
debt and governmental policies. A significant slowing of 
economic activity could impact real estate markets which 
would potentially impact results.
>  The Group’s geographic spread and range of services  
help mitigate, but cannot eliminate this risk.
>  Management has undertaken a robust planning process 
and implemented stringent performance measures and 
accountabilities to mitigate this risk as much as possible.
Recruitment and 
retention of staff
The Group’s employees are crucial to the success and future 
development of the Company.
>  It is essential the Group rewards and manages the 
development of its employees, thus securing their 
continued contribution to the business.
>  The Group has put in place retention schemes for key staff 
and is constantly reviewing all aspects of its compensation 
and reward structures to ensure its ability to attract and 
retain high performing employees.
Professional standards
The failure to deliver on its contractual obligations to clients 
could expose DTZ to disputes over fee payments and/or 
claims against DTZ for alleged negligence. Like other 
companies operating in the sector the Group faces risks in the 
provision of valuation opinions, where it could be subject to 
claims resulting from alleged over-valuation, and in its property 
management business where DTZ assumes responsibility for 
property and facilities management for client properties and 
could be subject to claims for failure to appropriately deliver 
contracted services.
>  DTZ maintains strong quality management procedures  
to ensure that its services are delivered in a consistent  
and professional manner, and in the UK DTZ is certified  
to ISO9001.
>  DTZ maintains global professional indemnity insurance 
which can respond to claims and protect the Group’s 
exposure to financial loss.  DTZ Holdings plc

Corporate 
Responsibility
DTZ is fully committed 
to conducting its 
business in a socially 
responsible manner, 
balancing our 
commercial interest 
with professional 
integrity and the needs 
of our stakeholders 
– employees, clients, 
suppliers, shareholders 
and the communities  
in which we operate. 
The UK is our largest market and so  
our view is that the UK should set the 
standard for corporate responsibility (CR) 
across our international operations.  
Our membership of Business in the 
Community (BitC) continues to allow us 
access to a number of excellent initiatives, 
whilst offering invaluable support. 
For the third year running we have 
participated in BitC’s CR Index, the 
voluntary, business-led benchmark of 
responsible business practice. DTZ’s 
responses have been independently 
assessed and we are delighted to have 
achieved a Bronze rating with an overall 
score of 72 per cent. This is an increase of 
15 percentage points on last year’s score, 
making DTZ the joint best improver in the 
index. DTZ is also the only real estate 
services firm to participate in the index.
Outside the UK, each country operation 
is responsible for setting its own CR 
agenda, acting in accordance with its 
local environment. Globally our teams 
have taken part in a series of fundraising 
activities during the year. For example, 
led by our Asia Pacific operations, DTZ 
employees worldwide donated funds  
of more than US$50,000 to support  
the victims of the earthquake, and 
consequent tsunami, which struck 
Japan on 11 March 2011. Additionally, 
each DTZ office in Asia Pacific matched 
its people’s efforts, dollar for dollar. 
Similarly in Australia employees donated 
AUS$10,650 for the Queensland  
Flood Appeal.
In the UK our CR activity is focused 
around the four areas of marketplace, 
workplace, community and environment. 2011

Our Marketplace
The importance of sustainability in global 
real estate markets has intensified in the 
past year, driven by increasing legislation 
to reduce carbon consumption, rising 
energy prices and a new emphasis on 
sustainable growth in Asia, particularly 
China. This has created a growing 
marketplace for our sustainability 
services and a demonstration of 
understanding the future impact of 
sustainability on real estate has become 
an essential ingredient in both winning 
new business and procuring services.
We now actively participate in Green 
Building Councils around the world –  
in the Netherlands and China, in Hong 
Kong as an award sponsor, in the UK  
on the Commercial Property Task Group 
and as co-founders of the respective 
Green Building Councils in Sweden and 
India. Additionally, in October 2010, 
focusing on the growing importance of 
measurement and ratings, DTZ launched 
a market briefing, Global Green Ratings, 
to over 180 clients in Shanghai. 
In the UK during the course of the  
last financial year our team helped 50 
investors register for the Carbon Reduction 
Commitment Scheme, completed 500 
Energy Performance Certificates, 150 
Display Energy Certificates and advised on 
numerous Energy Management Systems. 
We have also developed market leading 
expertise on the valuation of renewable 
energy assets and in the appraisal of 
associated developments.
In 2010, DTZ put in place a number  
of procurement initiatives to improve 
sustainability activities with our key 
suppliers. Within our property 
management division, 89 per cent  
of preferred suppliers have attained 
ISO14001 certification for their 
environmental management systems. In 
addition, a new supplier vetting initiative 
has been launched for all other suppliers 
which will include an assessment of 
environmental performance.
Our Workplace
Good progress was achieved during the 
year against the targets we set ourselves. 
As part of worldwide refresh of all of our 
people-related policies, the Group’s 
diversity policy has been updated and 
implemented globally. Endorsed by  
the Group’s Executive Committee, the 
policy demonstrates our commitment to 
developing an environment that is based 
on merit and inclusivity, creating a place 
to work where everyone is welcome and 
has the opportunity to participate fully in 
delivering business success. 
The Topgrading
®
 process for hiring, 
developing, and retaining top performers 
was rolled out globally last year with more 
than 120 professionals trained, and all 
external Director hires recruited through 
this method. Topgrading
®
 has now  
also been rolled into the global, annual 
promotion process for Directors – setting 
high standards for this important career 
transition and providing investment in all 
those who complete the process.
In the field of learning and development, 
three 90-minute modules of face-to-face 
performance training, supported by line 
manager guides, were rolled out globally 
via our HR team. These covered the 
importance of managing performance, 
setting objectives and giving feedback. 
A UK employee opinion survey was 
conducted during the year to gather 
feedback from our employees to  
help shape the development of our 
workplace strategy. The results have 
now been shared with employees and 
specific action plans agreed to address 
the priority issues raised.
DTZ continues to hold the OHSAS18001 
accreditation for the management of 
health and safety in the United Kingdom. 
Work is underway to prepare DTZ offices 
outside of the UK for this accreditation.
Our Environment
DTZ is committed to minimising the 
environmental cost of its activities and  
to working in partnership with clients  
and suppliers to develop best practice 
environmental management. With this aim 
in mind, we have communicated a global 
environmental policy, which establishes 
ground rules for environmental 
management at DTZ.
In 2010/1 1, our operations in the UK  
and Sweden successfully maintained 
certification to the international standard 
for environmental management –  
ISO14001. This standard was also 
successfully achieved by our Hong Kong 
property management team. 
 
Our environmental targets for 2010/1 1 
were UK focused and we implemented 
many new initiatives during the year to  
help achieve these targets. These included 
environmental management training for all 
environmental champions, and working 
with HP to replace existing laptops, power 
supply units and monitors with more 
efficient equipment – reducing both energy 
consumption and electricity charges.
During 201 1/12 we will begin to share best 
practice across the Group and develop 
targets for our major non-UK markets.
For each of our main UK offices, DTZ has 
discussed the implementation of a Green 
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) 
with the managing agents acting on  
behalf of the landlord. Implementation 
unfortunately proved more difficult than 
expected and only limited progress has 
been made. We will seek to address this  
in 201 1/12.
Our Community
DTZ’s contribution to its local 
communities continued to go from 
strength to strength during 2010/11. 
Volunteering has shown a marked 
increase, with employees taking part in 
both individual volunteering and team 
challenges as part of BitC’s ‘Give and 
Gain Day’, the UK’s only national day  
of volunteering. Participation in these 
events not only gives employees a sense 
of community involvement but also helps 
to develop teamwork, which in turn 
benefits our business.
In the UK our corporate charity 
partnership with Shelter, the housing 
and homelessness charity, continued 
throughout the year with employees 
taking part in a number of fundraising 
events. The end of the financial year saw 
our partnership draw to an end having 
reached a fundraising total of £150,000. 
DTZ has also become a foundation 
partner of LandAid, the property 
industry’s charity. 33

Corporate Partnership 
with Shelter
DTZ raised a total of £150,000 during 
its corporate charity partnership with 
Shelter, the homelessness and 
housing charity. Fundraising events  
in which DTZ employees took part 
included an art auction, Shelter’s 
‘Vertical Rush’ up the City of London’s 
Tower 42, marathons, cake sales and 
quiz nights. 
Parkland Preservation 
Project 
Enabled by the Group’s UK 
Volunteering Policy, employees from 
DTZ’s offices in Leeds and Nottingham 
joined forces to help preserve an  
area of parkland at Clumber Park in 
Worksop, north Nottinghamshire. The 
16 strong team spent a day creating a 
large soil and turf mound to protect the 
historic park from erosion by vehicles.
Regeneration Initiative  
in Romania
A team of volunteers from DTZ 
Echinox, DTZ’s business in Romania, 
teamed up with the local Mayor’s 
office in District 6 of Bucharest to  
help plant over 450 trees as part of  
a regeneration initiative on Lacul Morii, 
an island located on the outskirts of 
the capital.
The case studies below are 
examples of DTZ’s commitment 
to working in partnership with its 
local communities.

Statement of Corporate Governance
Compliance with the Combined Code  
on Corporate Governance
Throughout the year ended 30 April 2011, the Company  
has been in compliance with the provisions set out in  
Section 1 of the June 2008 FRC Combined Code on 
Corporate Governance (the ‘Combined Code’) except,  
as specified below, as regards the nomination of a Senior 
Independent Director and the composition of the Audit  
and Remuneration Committees. 
For part of the year, the Company was not in compliance with 
Combined Code provision A.3.3 in that it did not have a Senior 
Independent Director. On 1 August 2010, Ms L I Baldry was 
appointed as Senior Independent Director, bringing the 
Company into compliance with the Combined Code. 
The Board continues to endorse and apply the principles of 
good corporate governance reflected in the Combined Code 
and in accordance with the Combined Code; a narrative 
statement of how the Company has applied the provisions  
of the Combined Code is set out below.
The Board of Directors
The Board comprises Mr T D Melville-Ross, Group Chairman, 
Mr P T Idzik, Group Chief Executive, two other Executive 
Directors, one Senior Independent Director and four  
Non-Executive Directors. There is a separation of the  
roles and responsibilities of the Chairman and the Group  
Chief Executive. 
The Directors submit themselves for election at the first AGM 
after their appointment and for re-election at least every three 
years thereafter. Details of the Directors submitting themselves 
for reappointment at the AGM on 16 September 2011 are 
shown on page 50.
As Chairman, Mr T D Melville-Ross is not considered 
independent, and, owing to the fact that they have  
been nominated by SAS Saint George Participations,  
Mr F Piédelièvre, Mr P G M Derrey and Mr F Tardan are  
not considered independent, but the other Non-Executive 
Directors are considered by the Board to be independent  
of management and free from any business or other 
relationships that could materially interfere with the exercise  
of their independent judgement. Non-Executive Directors  
are appointed for periods of up to three years renewable  
for further periods in appropriate cases. Biographies of  
the Non-Executive Directors appear on pages 34 to 35 and 
demonstrate the calibre and breadth of experience they 
provide to the Company, which complements the industry 
experience of the Executive Directors. Through the Company 
Secretary, all Directors can, if they so wish, take independent 
advice at the expense of the Company.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to  
it for decision that includes:
Approval of annual budgets and strategic plans; >
 The establishment of new businesses or businesses   >
in new geographical areas;
 Acquisitions and disposals, major capital projects and  >
material contracts; and
 Changes to the Group’s capital, corporate or   >
management structure.
All Directors receive written reports prior to each Board 
meeting that enable them to take informed decisions on the 
corporate and business issues which they are considering. 
The Company Secretary is responsible to the Board for 
ensuring that its procedures are followed and is available  
to individual Directors for advice on those procedures.
The Company Secretary supports the Chairman and Group 
Chief Executive in ensuring new Directors receive appropriate 
training and induction to the Company and that ongoing 
training for Directors is provided when a need for such training 
is identified as part of the Board’s annual evaluation process.
Board evaluation
The Board believes it is appropriate to undertake a regular 
performance evaluation of itself, its committees and  
individual directors, under the leadership of the Chairman.  
It has determined that an internal process of evaluation is most 
appropriate, to enable first-hand input from individual Directors 
to be obtained. The last evaluation exercise was undertaken  
in July 2010 in respect of the year ended 30 April 2010. The 
next formal performance evaluation is underway. The Board  
is satisfied that an open dialogue exists between all Board 
members enabling issues to be raised and dealt with as  
they occur rather than waiting for the next formal evaluation 
process and, accordingly, believes that it and its committees 
are operating effectively. 
Board Committees
The Board has established the following Committees, details  
of which are set out below, each with defined terms of 
reference, procedures, responsibilities and powers. Each 
Committee reviews its terms of reference and effectiveness  
at least annually. The minutes of Committee meetings are  
sent to all Directors and oral reports of Committee activities  
are given at Board meetings. The terms of reference of the 
Board Committees are available, on request, from the 
Company Secretary.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Mr P G M Derrey and 
comprises Mr P G M Derrey, Ms A Lesniak and Ms L I Baldry. 
Although Mr P G M Derrey is not considered to be an 
independent Non-Executive Director, the Board considers, 
that in view of his recent and relevant experience and ability to 
devote the necessary time to the role, he has sufficient recent 
and relevant experience to carry out the function as chair of 
the Committee.  DTZ Holdings plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2011    37
Corporate Governance
The external auditors, the Chairman, the Group Chief Executive, 
the Group Finance Director and the Head of Internal Audit 
normally attend meetings of the Committee and the Committee 
also meets separately with the external auditors without 
management present. The Audit Committee discharges its 
responsibilities by meeting at least three times a year to:
 Review the interim and annual financial statements prior   >
to submission to the Board;
 Keep under review the operation and effectiveness of the  >
Company’s internal financial control and accounting policies;
 Monitor and review the effectiveness of the Company’s  >
operational and compliance controls and risk management;
 Review the nature and extent of non-audit services provided  >
by the external auditors; and
Review internal audit plans and reports. >
The Audit Committee also reviews the scope and cost of both 
internal and external audit and makes a recommendation to 
the Board regarding reappointment of the external auditors.
As part of its role in relation to the provision of non-audit 
services by the external auditors, the Audit Committee  
agrees with the external auditors which types of work the 
external auditors are permitted to undertake and monitors  
the nature and extent of non-audit work undertaken by the 
external auditors.
In forming their opinion of the independence and objectivity of 
the external auditors, the Audit Committee takes into account 
the safeguards operating within PwC and that the objectivity  
of the audit engagement partner and audit staff has not been 
impaired. This includes details of changes in external audit 
executives in the audit plan in accordance with the external 
auditor’s policy on rotating audit executives. Regard is given to 
the nature of remuneration received for other services provided 
by PwC to the Company and, inter alia, confirmation is sought 
from them that the fee payable for the annual audit is adequate 
to enable them to fulfil their obligation in relation to the scope  
of the audit.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is chaired by the Chairman and 
comprises the Chairman, Mr F Piédelièvre, Ms A Lesniak  
and Ms L I Baldry.
The Committee meets as and when required to:
 Review the structure, size and composition of the Board   >
and make recommendations as to any changes;
 Keep under review the leadership needs of the Company  >
and consider succession planning for Directors and other 
senior executives;
 Assist in identifying and become involved in the selection  >
process for candidates to fill Board vacancies; and
 Evaluate the time required to be spent by the Non-Executive  >
Directors and ensure that what is required of them is  
clearly specified.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Ms A Lesniak  
and comprises Ms A Lesniak, the Chairman, Ms L I Baldry and 
Mr F Piédelièvre. Although Mr F Piédelièvre is not considered 
to be an independent Non-Executive Director, the Board 
considers that it is appropriate that he be a member of the 
Remuneration Committee in order that the views of SAS Saint 
George Participations, as a substantial shareholder in the 
Company, are reflected in the deliberations of the Committee. 
The Committee meets at least once a year and considers,  
for recommendation to the Board, Company policy on 
remuneration and conditions of service and, within the terms 
of the agreed policy, approves the composition and level  
of remuneration of Executive Directors, the Chairman and  
such other members of the Executive Management as it  
is designated to consider.
When the Committee considers matters relating to an 
individual, that person is not present nor does that person  
act in relation to any matters relating to him or her.
The Directors’ Remuneration Report is on pages 39 to 49.
Meetings
During the year there were seven Board meetings, five Audit 
Committee meetings and six Remuneration Committee 
meetings. Whilst there were no Nomination Committee 
meetings, the Board kept under review the leadership needs  
of the Company and considered succession planning for 
Directors and other senior executives. Attendance at these 
meetings by individual Directors is given in the table below:

investors and analysts. DTZ Holdings plc

Statement on internal control and risk management
The Board takes ultimate responsibility for the Group’s system 
of internal control and risk management. The system of control 
is designed to enable the Board to govern and manage the 
business to achieve the Group’s risk management objectives. 
A system of internal control can provide reasonable but not 
absolute assurance against misstatement or loss.
The Board conducts an annual review of the effectiveness  
of the system of internal control and risk management. The 
review is informed in a number of ways. Our internal Audit 
function provides an independent opinion on the operation  
of controls through the delivery of its audit programme; the 
Group Director of Risk Management and Compliance provides 
a report that explains developments in the system of internal 
control over the preceding 12 months; and managers within 
the organisation, who have responsibility for the operation  
of the system of internal control, provide assurance that it 
operates through ongoing management review processes.
The principal elements of the Group’s system of internal 
control and risk management are:
 The Board and its various Committees have defined  >
financial authorities and operational responsibilities which 
are designed to enable effective decision making and 
organisational control;
 An organisation and management structure operates across  >
the business to enable the delivery of services to our clients 
and operational control of business activities;
 Global policies and procedures which define expected  >
standards and behaviours are being embedded across  
the Group. Our global policy framework includes policies  
on Finance, Operations, People and Business Controls;
 Group Infrastructure functions: Finance, Human Resources  >
and Global Technology Services have been centralised  
and are working to improve the standardisation of  
their respective operational procedures across the  
global operations;
 A formal risk identification process takes place to evaluate  >
and manage the significant risks faced by the Group in 
accordance with requirements of the Combined Code and 
Turnbull Guidance on internal control. A Group risk register 
identifies the risks the business faces, their potential impact, 
likelihood of occurrence and the key controls and action 
plans to mitigate these risks;
 The Group Risk Management Committee meets quarterly   >
to review the management of risk arising out of the Group’s 
activities and to monitor the status of key risks and actions;
 Each of the Group’s regional businesses has a management  >
team which together with respective regional Risk 
Committees meets to consider significant commercial 
matters, including risk management and internal control,  
for the DTZ subsidiaries in their geographic regions;
 DTZ has standardised procedures for the delivery of its main  >
services. These procedures are progressively being rolled 
out across our global operations. The operation of these 
procedures provides assurance on the standard of our 
service delivery. In the UK, these procedures are audited  
to the ISO9001 quality standard;
 An internal audit function, which is subject to the controlling  >
direction of the Audit Committee provides the Audit 
Committee with an independent assessment of the Group’s 
system of internal control, through reviewing how effectively 
key risks are being managed, and assists management in 
the effective discharge of their responsibilities by carrying 
out independent appraisals and making recommendations 
for improvement. Internal audit reviews and testing activities 
are outsourced to BDO;
 Certain aspects of the Group’s activities are also subject to  >
regulatory control by external bodies such as the FSA; and
 The Audit Committee assists the Board in discharging its  >
responsibility to review the system of internal control.
The system of internal control has been in place in DTZ 
Holdings plc for the year ended 30 April 2011, and up to  
the date of the approval of the Annual Report and Accounts.
Health & Safety
The Company recognises that the maintenance of high 
standards of health & safety management is imperative to 
ensure the welfare of its employees. Clients are also placing  
a greater emphasis on health & safety when deciding with 
which service providers they will work. DTZ is committed  
to continuously improving its health & safety performance  
and has attained OHSAS18001 accreditation in the UK  
which is a reflection of the Company’s investment in health  
& safety management.
Managing the environment
The Company regards the promotion of an environmental 
strategy as an important element in operating a successful 
business, not only to minimise its impact on global resources 
but also to maintain good investor and client relations.
We have continued to implement significant improvements  
to help us reduce our negative impact on the environment. 
This has included the introduction of improved waste 
streaming and recycling, energy-efficiency measures and  
the development of advice and support services to our clients. 
We also successfully attained ISO14001 certification for our 
environmental management system in Sweden as well as 
maintaining compliance with the standard in the UK.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Introduction by the Remuneration Committee Chair 
Dear Shareholder,
Following my first full year as Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee, I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 April 2011.  
We will be seeking your approval of the report at the  
AGM in September.
This year we have divided the full report into three sections. 
The first section provides a description of our philosophy, how 
it is implemented and what we have done in the year under 
review. The second section provides further disclosures as 
required by applicable regulations, rules and guidelines. In this 
section you will find detailed information on elements of pay, 
individual Executive Director’s pay and contracts as well as 
details of our all employee share arrangements, our approach 
to shareholding guidelines and external appointments, the 
appointment terms for our Non-Executive Directors and policy 
on Non-Executive Director remuneration including details  
on the membership of the Remuneration Committee (the 
Committee) and our advisers. The third section is the audited 
part of the report. 
We hope that providing information in this way makes the  
report easier to read and understand, whilst also fulfilling 
disclosure requirements.
Our philosophy and approach to remuneration
It remains an overriding priority for both the Committee and  
the Company to provide a policy which enables us to attract, 
retain and develop the top talent required to deliver on our 
goal, which is to become the best real estate services firm for 
our clients in those markets where we choose to compete, 
and to ensure that remuneration arrangements across the 
Group support both our global and local strategic initiatives.
To deliver on this philosophy we have maintained the overall 
structure of our executive reward arrangements, providing 
competitive reward in the markets we operate in.
Furthermore, this year the Committee has worked extensively 
with senior management to consider reward arrangements 
throughout the Company and we are pleased to share with  
you further details on the outcome of this work in the full report 
which follows. 
More generally, having been suspended previously, some 
benefits have returned during the year though appropriate 
changes have been made to ensure competitiveness with 
local markets. 
Executive remuneration in the year under review
While the past 12 months remained challenging in terms  
of trading for the Group with the business experiencing  
varying conditions across its markets, operationally the year 
brought continued corporate progress and an improvement  
in financial flexibility. We also believe those of our businesses 
which were most affected during the downturn have been 
strengthened and will now begin to benefit from a continued 
market recovery.
As you will see, the Committee and Board considered that  
the broad structure of the Executive Directors’ remuneration 
package is appropriate and hence did not need to be 
changed. We further considered that, for the Executive 
Directors, no increases to salary levels were necessary at this 
time, but we will always continue to review them against the 
markets we operate in. As I mentioned last year, voluntary 
reductions in salary taken by the UK based Executive Directors 
returned during this financial year. However, the Group Chief 
Executive suggested, and the Committee accepted, that his 
salary continue for one more year at a reduced level. The 
Executive Directors already hold a significant level of stock  
and hence it was also determined that no performance  
related share awards should be made this year.
Due to the financial circumstances of the Company, the Group 
Chief Executive decided to defer and, subsequently, to waive 
£300,000 of his bonus disclosed as paid in last year’s Annual 
Report. During this year, no bonus award was made to the 
Group Chief Executive. Further, in light of investor concerns,  
the Group Finance Director and Global Chief Operating Officer 
waived the right to the guarantee relating to the unpaid tranche 
of his bonus. The operational stability of the firm is stronger 
and therefore, the Committee agreed that the delivery of 
objectives during the year warranted an award for the Group 
Finance Director and Global Chief Operating Officer. Also  
Asia Pacific business performance meant that our Chairman  
of Asia Pacific’s award was brought in line with those results.
The rest of the report provides more detail on our 
remuneration arrangements.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
continued
This report sets out DTZ’s remuneration policy for Executive 
Directors, its implementation and the amounts paid in 2010/11.  
It has been prepared in accordance with the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008 (the Regulations) and the  
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. 
This report is structured in three parts. Section A provides 
information and explanation on our approach to executive 
remuneration. Section B provides further regulatory 
disclosures as required by the Regulations and Listing  
Rules, and Section C is the audited part of the report.
A resolution to approve the report will be put to shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting on 16 September 2011. 
Section A – Unaudited Information: 
Information and Explanation
Our philosophy
DTZ is a complex, international business operating in a highly 
competitive and cyclical environment which relies heavily on 
the expertise of its people. The Committee seeks to provide 
executive remuneration which enables the Company to attract, 
retain and develop the talent to deliver our objectives and to 
structure executive remuneration in a way which supports the 
delivery of our strategic priorities and, as such, is aligned with 
the interests of our shareholders.
How our philosophy is implemented
To deliver on our philosophy, we aim to provide competitive 
remuneration with an emphasis on rewarding our people for 
their individual contribution to the achievement of our goals, 
which for the current financial year are to: 
 Improve shareholder value by pursuing profitable organic  >
revenue growth in our target markets;
 Improve revenue capture by delivering a  > Power of One 
approach to our clients; and
 Continue to embed the cost and value culture established  >
following our restructuring programme.
Salaries are set in line with the markets in which we compete, 
with considerable emphasis placed on ensuring that the 
conditions under the annual performance related bonus 
encourage and reward for the delivery of our strategy.
In addition to rewarding the individual contribution and  
market value of our people, we firmly believe that a  
significant proportion of total remuneration should be  
linked to the delivery of results and the creation of value  
for our shareholders.
As such we place particular emphasis on Executive Directors 
having a significant shareholding in the Company. The 
following table illustrates the effect of the movement in the 
share price this year on the value of shares owned by, held  
or potentially available under the Company’s share plans 
(including share options) as at 30 April 2011:

C Y Leung 8,600 6,020 2,230
R G Rickert 2,480 740 130
Furthermore, the Committee seeks to deliver reward in the 
form of shares, when appropriate, so as to further reinforce 
this commitment to alignment with shareholders. 
What we’ve done this year
The Committee reviews on an annual basis whether the 
remuneration policy remains appropriate for the relevant 
financial year. Factors taken into account by the  
Committee include:
Market conditions affecting the Company; >
The recruitment market in the Company’s sector; >
Changing market practice; and >
 The views of institutional shareholders and their  >
representative bodies.
During the year, the Committee has worked to consider 
remuneration at both the Company and Executive Director 
level as detailed below.  DTZ Holdings plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2011    41
Corporate Governance
Company remuneration
Given that reward and incentives are the largest costs incurred 
by the Company in the course of its doing business, the 
Remuneration Committee is particularly mindful of its broader 
role to consider pay and conditions elsewhere in the Company 
when considering executive reward and, as such, has had  
an active role in the ‘One firm reward’ initiative undertaken  
by senior management during the year. This initiative was the 
first of its kind in our sector and the results of this initiative are 
that the Committee and Company now have:
 A good view on market pay structures and conditions   >
in the markets in which we operate;
A comprehensive set of benchmarking data; >
 Confidence that the pay structures and incentive  >
arrangements that we have in place in the markets in  
which we operate are both appropriate and competitive,  
and are in line with our Company goals and strategy;
 A complete view on the competitiveness of rewards for   >
our most senior executives worldwide.
Given the Committee’s confidence that the Company’s pay 
and incentive arrangements are currently appropriate for the 
markets in which we compete, we have determined that it 
would be unsuitable at the current time to develop a new 
longer term incentive structure for the Company. This will 
however be kept under review in the current year. 
Executive Director remuneration
The Committee and Board determined during the year that  
the broad structure of the Executive Directors’ remuneration 
package remained appropriate.
In line with our philosophy and approach to remuneration,  
and with consideration to the performance of the Company  
in different markets, it was determined that, for the Executive 
Directors, no increases to salary levels were currently 
appropriate. Following the voluntary reduction in salary taken 
by the UK based Directors last year, the Group Chief Executive 
suggested and the Committee agreed, that it remained 
appropriate for his salary to be maintained at a reduced level 
for the year under review.
For the year under review, the Group Chief Executive received 
no recruitment or replacement awards or guaranteed bonus 
payments, whilst all such payments to the Group Finance 
Director and Global Chief Operating Officer have now been 
made. In light of investor concerns, the Group Finance Director 
and Global Chief Operating Officer waived the right to the 
guarantee relating to the unpaid tranche of his bonus. In 
addition, with reference to last year’s Annual Report, due to the 
financial circumstances of the Company between the dates on 
which the annual performance related bonus was earned, and 
the date upon which it was due to be paid, the Group Chief 
Executive decided to waive £300,000 of his bonus disclosed 
as paid in last year’s Annual Report. 
The Committee has determined that performance in our  
Asia Pacific business has warranted bonus payments for our 
Chairman of Asia Pacific and that 75 per cent of this payment 
should be deferred into shares payable in one year’s time.  
This level of deferral is considerably higher than that typically 
expected under the deferred bonus element of our Long Term 
Reward Plan. The Committee has also determined that the 
delivery of operational objectives during the year warranted  
a bonus payment for the Group Finance Director and Global 
Chief Operating Officer. During this year no payment was 
made to the Group Chief Executive. In addition, upon reaching 
the end of the period for which pension contributions were 
suspended we determined that pension contributions for  
our UK based Executive Directors should be reinstated  
at 10 per cent of salary rather than at the former level of  
15 per cent of salary. Given the significant shareholding  
of our Executive Directors, it was also determined this year  
that no further performance related share awards should be 
made. Furthermore, the Chairman has continued to waive  
25 per cent of his fee and there has been no increase to  
basic fee levels for our Non-Executive Directors this year. 
In addition the Committee considered the impact of the 
remuneration policy, and in particular, the performance  
related arrangements, on the risk taking attitude of  
executives and senior management and determined  
that it remained appropriate. DTZ Holdings plc

Salary 
Basic salaries for Executive Directors are reviewed by the 
Committee annually, with regard to competitive market 
practices and remuneration levels in companies which it 
considers to be comparable by taking into account their size, 
sector, geographical scope and complexity, the Committee’s 
own judgment of the performance of the Group’s businesses 
and the contribution made by individual Directors.
Following this year’s review it was determined that whilst 
market rates of pay have increased in the pay markets we 
consider no increase to salary for the Executive Directors  
was appropriate.
Pensions and benefits 
Mr P T Idzik and Mr R G Rickert are members of the 
Company’s UK non-contributory defined contribution  
pension scheme and are eligible for an employer contribution 
of 10 per cent of gross salary per annum. 
Mr C Y Leung is a member of a local defined contribution 
pension scheme in Hong Kong, to which monthly 
contributions of HK$1,000 are made. 
The other main benefits provided to the Executive Directors 
are the use of a Company car or the provision of a cash 
allowance, medical insurance and life assurance cover and,  
in the case of Mr R G Rickert, certain repatriation benefits. 
Details on all benefits payments to individuals who served  
as Executive Directors during 2010/11 are included in the 
Directors’ emoluments table on page 48.  DTZ Holdings plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2011    43
Corporate Governance
Annual performance related bonus plan
A significant number of staff, including Executive Directors, 
participate in a performance-related bonus plan. Payments 
under the plan are based on the achievement of profit and 
operational targets, which are set so that they are relevant  
both to the specific circumstances of the Company and the 
performance of the individual against their annually agreed 
objectives. In the case of the Executive Directors, any 
performance-related bonus is based on the achievement  
of their personal objectives and Group performance.
Under the Annual Performance Related Bonus Plan, the 
Committee determined that the achievement of stretching 
objectives should result in bonus awards to Mr R G Rickert 
and Mr C Y Leung, and that in respect of Mr C Y Leung,  
75 per cent of this should be deferred into shares which vest  
in one year’s time. This level of deferral is considerably higher 
than that typically expected under the deferred bonus 
component of our Long Term Reward Plan. During this  
year no payment was made to the Group Chief Executive.
With reference to last year’s Annual Report, due to the financial 
circumstances of the Company between the dates on which  
the annual performance related bonus was earned, and the 
date upon which it was due to be paid, the Group Chief 
Executive decided to waive £300,000 of his bonus disclosed 
as paid in last year’s Annual Report.
DTZ 2006 Long Term Reward Plan (the Plan)
No widespread awards under the Plan were made this year. For 
the Executive Directors, the deferred bonus component of the 
Plan was utilised this year as described in the section above, 
whilst the Share Options component of the Plan was utilised  
to deliver the second tranche of sign on options awarded to  
Mr R G Rickert as described in last year’s Annual Report and 
described in detail in the Recruitment and Replacement Awards 
section on page 44. Full details of awards made to the Executive 
Directors are detailed on pages 48 to 49.
The Plan has four components. The arrangements currently  
in place are summarised in the table below and explained in 
detail in the following sections. 
Deferred bonus
This element of the Plan was utilised for the Executive 
Directors this year. Under the Plan, a percentage of any annual 
bonus payable that exceeds a value prescribed each year by 
the Remuneration Committee will be delivered as an award  
of deferred shares, the receipt of which will be dependent  
on continuing employment within the Group over a deferral 
period, typically three years. This element of the Plan 
incorporates the previous deferred bonus arrangements.  
The bonus deferral is intended to ensure that Executives  
do not receive rewards for short-term performance that is  
not sustained. 
Co-Investment
This element of the Plan was not utilised for the Executive 
Directors this year. Under the Plan, the Committee may invite 
selected employees (including Executive Directors) to make  
a further investment in shares which must be held for a three 
year period. Individuals who participate in Co-Investment will 
receive awards of free matching shares. The matching shares 
will vest at the end of the three year retention period, subject  
to the satisfaction of the EPS performance condition, if the 
individual remains in employment with the Group and to the 
extent that he or she has retained his or her Co-Invested shares. 
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) Awards
This element of the Plan was not utilised for the Executive 
Directors this year. LTIP awards are designed to provide a 
long-term focus to senior members of the management team, 
including Executive Directors. Each year, the Committee 
determines individual levels of participation. At the 2009 AGM, 
maximum grants were increased to 250 per cent of annual 
base salary (400 per cent in exceptional circumstances). 
Awards vest at the end of a three year period, providing the 
participant continues to be employed within the Group and  
to the extent that any performance conditions have been  
met over the performance period.

Company Share Option Plan (COSOP) Options
This element of the Plan was utilised to deliver the second 
tranche of sign-on options awarded to Mr R G Rickert as 
described in last year’s Annual Report, and described in  
detail in the following section, but was not utilised for any other 
Executive Directors this year. The Plan provides for the grant of 
market value options. The COSOP comprises a HM Revenue 
& Customs (HMRC) approved section and an unapproved 
section. Options over shares having a face value, at the time  
of grant, of up to the limit specified from time to time by HMRC 
(currently £30,000) will be granted under the HMRC approved 
section and all other COSOP options will be granted under the 
unapproved section.
Any COSOP options granted to Executive Directors would 
normally be subject to the same performance conditions as 
under the LTIP .
Recruitment and replacement awards 
For the year under review, the Group Chief Executive received 
no recruitment or replacement awards or guaranteed bonus 
payments, whilst all such payments to the Group Finance 
Director and Global Chief Operating Officer have now  
been made.
The exceptional turnaround circumstances the Company 
faced at the time it hired the Group Chief Executive and Group 
Finance Director and Global Chief Operating Officer required 
the Committee to attract the best talent available for these 
roles. The Committee determined, at the time, that providing 
market-competitive arrangements was the most appropriate 
course of action but that a major element of the sign-on 
compensation should be equity-based to ensure an immediate 
alignment with the interests of shareholders. 
As such, and as disclosed in previous years’ remuneration 
report under the terms of his appointment, Mr P T Idzik was 
entitled to a guaranteed bonus payment of £300,000 in 
respect of his first year of employment with the Company  
and awards of market-priced share options without further 
performance conditions. Mr P T Idzik also made a significant 
investment in Group shares using his own funds. Also, as 
disclosed in last year’s remuneration report, under the terms  
of his appointment, Mr R G Rickert was entitled to guaranteed 
bonus payments of £925,000 in each of years one and two of 
his employment with the Company, awards of market-priced 
options without further performance conditions to the value  
of £500,000 in respect of each of years 1 and 2 of his 
employment, and two awards of share options under the 
Deferred Bonus element of the Plan as buy-out of the deferred 
shares forfeited as a result of his resignation from Barclays plc. 
Full details of these arrangements have been disclosed in 
previous years’ remuneration reports and details of the awards 
made are shown in the tables on pages 48 to 49.
The Committee recognises that providing guaranteed bonuses 
and market-priced share option awards without further 
performance conditions to Executive Directors would not 
normally be considered UK corporate governance best 
practice. In light of investor concerns, the Group Finance 
Director and Global Chief Operating Officer waived the right  
to the guarantee relating to the unpaid tranche of his bonus. 
All employee share incentive arrangements
At the AGM in September 2006 approval was given to 
implement a new Share Incentive Plan (SIP). This was in order 
to ensure the alignment of all of the Group’s UK employees’ 
interests with those of shareholders, and to provide them with 
an opportunity to invest in the Company. The SIP provides for 
free shares, partnership shares and matching shares but for 
the foreseeable future it is being restricted to the purchase  
by employees of partnership shares.
The SIP is an HMRC approved all-employee scheme under 
which employees must generally participate on similar terms.  DTZ Holdings plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2011    45
Corporate Governance
Individual Directors’ remuneration 
The following pie charts show the balance between salary and 
benefits and other elements of pay for each Executive Director 
based on their current remuneration arrangements. The pie 
charts are based on the actual salary, bonus and benefit 
amounts received during the year. Awards of nil-cost options 
have been included on the basis of the face value of the 
awards at grant. 
Because we have a commitment to pay for performance, the 
balance of fixed to variable pay varies year on year. Relatively 
low bonus payments and no share awards this year means 
that for our UK based Directors, in particular, more of their 
in-year pay was fixed than variable.

Executive Directors’ contracts
It is the Company’s policy to normally provide for a notice 
period of no greater than six months in the service contracts  
of Executive Directors. Executive Directors’ service contracts 
do not normally include provision for a specific payment in the 
event of early termination.
Details of the service contracts of the Executive Directors  
are set out in the table below: 
Name Date of contract Normal notice period
C Y Leung 14 December 2006 6 months
P T Idzik 25 October 2008 3 months
R G Rickert 1 March 2009 6 months
In the event of cessation of employment following a change  
of control of the Company Mr P T Idzik will be entitled to a 
payment of 1.75 times the amount of 12 months’ base salary.
As previously stated, the Committee believed that it was in  
the Company’s and shareholders’ interests to find the best 
international candidate for the role and therefore that some 
compromise of UK best practice was required to recruit this 
candidate. Further, the Committee felt that given the challenge 
of the role and some of the potential outcomes that some 
degree of security in terms of employment was required to  
allow Mr P T Idzik to perform without distractions.
In the event of cessation of employment following a change  
of control of the Company Mr C Y Leung and Mr R G Rickert 
will not be entitled to any payments above the standard 
statutory payments. DTZ Holdings plc

External appointments
The Company recognises that Executive Directors may be 
invited to become Non-Executive Directors of other companies 
and that such appointments can broaden their knowledge  
and experience, to the benefit of the Company. Any such 
appointment must be approved by the Board. An individual 
Director will normally be required to account to the Company 
for fees received in respect of such directorships unless 
otherwise approved.
No Executive Director holds any external appointments that 
would interfere with their duties as Directors of the Group. 
Shareholding guidelines 
The Committee has not established formal shareholding 
guidelines as, in its opinion these would be superfluous at  
this time. Two of the Executive Directors (Mr P T Idzik and  
Mr C Y Leung) hold a substantial number of shares in the 
Company as shown in the table on page 50. All the Executive 
Directors have interests in shares under various share incentive 
arrangements as shown in the tables on pages 48 to 49. 
 
Non-Executive Directors
Fees for the Chairman and the other Non-Executive Directors 
are determined by the Board, having regard to the contribution 
required from and the responsibility taken by Non-Executive 
Directors and current market practice, including the level of 
fees paid to Non-Executive Directors of comparable 
companies. Basic fee levels for Non-Executive Directors 
remain unchanged and the Chairman has continued to  
waive 25 per cent of his fee. Non-Executive Directors holding 
additional roles as the Senior Independent Director, Chair  
of the Remuneration Committee and Chair of the Audit 
Committee are entitled to an additional fee of £5,000 p.a. 
Upon appointment as Senior Independent Director and Chair 
of the Audit Committee, Ms L I Baldry, and Mr P G M Derrey, 
respectively, became eligible for and were paid this additional 
fee. Ms A Lesniak as Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
had her fee increased by £500 to £5,000 p.a. bringing the 
additional fee level for this role to the same level as that for  
the Senior Independent Director and Chair of the Audit 
Committee. Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for 
performance related bonuses or grants of options, and  
their fees are not pensionable. 
All Non-Executive Directors are elected for a term of three 
years unless required under the rotation provisions of the 
Articles of the Company to submit for re-election. The 
appointment of Non-Executive Directors can be terminated  
by either party without notice or compensation.
The dates of appointment of Non-Executive Directors  
are shown in the table below.

Corporate Governance
The membership of the Remuneration Committee during  
the year is shown in the table opposite. All Committee 
members have been selected for their wide sector expertise, 
other Board experience and because they are believed to  
represent the interests of all shareholders in a balanced  
and independent way. 
The Board recognises that Mr F Piédelièvre cannot be 
considered independent owing to the fact that he has been 
nominated by SAS Saint George Participations (SGP). 
However, as explained in the corporate governance section  
of the Annual Report on pages 36 to 38, the Board considers 
it appropriate that the views of SGP , as a substantial shareholder 
in the Company, are reflected in the deliberations of the 
Committee. In accordance with the Code, Mr T D Melville-
Ross is a member of the Committee as he was considered 
independent on appointment as Chairman, but he does not 
chair the Committee. 
The Remuneration Committee has clearly defined terms  
of reference which are available on the Company’s website  
or can be obtained from the Company Secretary. Its main 
responsibilities are to:
 Recommend to the Board the framework or broad policy   >
for the remuneration of the Chairman, the Executive 
Directors, and other senior executives and ensure that 
contractual terms on termination, and any payments made, 
are fair to the individual and the Company, that failure is not 
rewarded and that the duty to mitigate loss is fully recognised;
 Ensure that the remuneration policy provides appropriate  >
incentives to create long-term shareholder value, whilst 
rewarding Executives for their individual contribution in a fair 
and responsible manner, balancing short and long-term 
reward as appropriate;
 Determine the design of, and targets for, Group  >
performance-related pay arrangements operated by the 
Company and the total annual payments under such 
arrangements and, on an ongoing basis, review the 
appropriateness and relevance of remuneration policy  
and make recommendations to the Board for any changes 
to policy, taking advice from external consultants and 
advisers as appropriate; 
 Make recommendations for approval by the Board and  >
shareholders on the design of all share incentive plans,  
and for all such plans determines each year whether awards 
shall be made and, if so, the overall amounts of such 
awards, the individual awards to Executive Directors and 
other designated senior executives, and the performance 
targets to be used;
 Ensure that in determining the design and targets of  >
performance related arrangements the long term interests  
of the Company, and that any risks, are taken into account;
 Determine the policy for, and scope of, pension  >
arrangements for each Executive Director and other 
designated senior executives;
 Approve, in consultation with the Chairman of the Board  >
and/or Group Chief Executive as appropriate, the total 
individual remuneration package of each Executive  
Director and other designated senior executives including 
bonuses, incentive payments and share options or other 
share awards;
 Give due regard to any relevant legal requirements,  >
provisions and recommendations in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the UK Listing Rules and associated 
guidance with regards to executive remuneration matters 
and ensure that all provisions regarding disclosure of 
remuneration, including pensions, as set out in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and the UK Listing Rules,  
are fulfilled;
 Oversee any major changes in employee benefit structures  >
throughout the Company or Group;
 Approve in advance of an appointment any remuneration  >
arrangements for new hires whose remuneration would  
fall within its remit.
In determining the total remuneration packages for Executive 
Directors and other senior executives, the Committee takes 
into account the remuneration policy and levels elsewhere  
in the Group. In particular, the Company aims to provide 
market competitive remuneration across the Group and the 
Committee gives consideration to how pay levels for other 
senior managers as well as how the wider employee 
population compare against each relevant market. 
Advice to the Remuneration Committee

Corporate Governance
Substantial shareholdings
As at 24 June 2011, the Company had been notified of the 
following interests in the Company’s ordinary share capital  
in accordance with Chapter 5 of the UK Listing Authority’s 
Disclosure and Transparency rules:
Employee involvement
The Directors recognise that the key to delivering consistent 
high-quality client services lies in the skill, loyalty and 
motivation of all its employees. It is the policy of the Group  
that all employees are provided with support, advice, training 
and development opportunities to allow them to achieve  
their own potential within the framework of the business.
The Group has made and continues to make substantial 
investment in network information technology, to both  
improve service to clients, and to facilitate good internal 
communications and information sharing.
Employment of disabled persons
The Group has continued its existing policy regarding the 
employment of disabled persons. Full and fair consideration  
is given to applications for employment made by disabled 
persons, taking into account their particular aptitudes and 
abilities and the nature of the work involved. Appropriate 
training is available for disabled employees, including retraining 
for alternative work if necessary for those employees who 
become disabled, to promote their career development within 
the Group.
Donations
During the year, the Group made donations for charitable 
purposes of £102,000 (2010: £54,000). 
Creditor payment policy
It is the Group’s normal policy to pay suppliers within the 
payment terms of the contract, where these have been agreed 
in advance, or within 30 days of the end of the calendar month 
of supply. Sub-contractors, in accordance with their contract 
terms, are paid when the Group is paid. As at 30 April 2011 
creditor days were calculated at 46 days (2010: 46 days).
Directors’ indemnities
The Articles of Association grant indemnities to each of the 
Directors and the Company Secretary to the extent permitted 
by law.
These indemnities are uncapped in amount in relation to 
certain losses and liabilities, which may incur to third parties  
in the course of acting as Directors (or Company Secretary  
as the case may be) or employees of the Company or one  
or more of its subsidiaries and associates.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and financial 
position are set out in the Business Review on pages 10 to 33. 
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity 
position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial 
Review on pages 24 to 27 . In addition, note 23 to the financial 
statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital, its financial risk 
management and its liquidity risk.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking reasonable 
account of possible changes in trading performance, show the 
Group should be able to operate within the level of its existing 
facilities and cash resources for the foreseeable future, being 
at least 12 months from the date of these accounts. As a 
consequence, the Directors are satisfied that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.

Directors’ Responsibilities Statement
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in respect  
of the Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
Directors have prepared the Group and parent company 
financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union. Under company law the Directors must not approve 
the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Company and Group 
for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
 Select suitable accounting policies and then apply   >
them consistently;
 Make judgements and accounting estimates that are  >
reasonable and prudent;
 State whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the  >
European Union have been followed, subject to any  
material departures disclosed and explained in the  
financial statements; and
 Prepare the financial statements on the going concern   >
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the  
company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain  
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
We confirm to the best of our knowledge:
 The financial statements, prepared in accordance with  >
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted  
by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the Company and  
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as  
a whole; and
 The management report, which is incorporated in the  >
Directors’ Report, includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position  
of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties they face.

and Company Cash Flow Statements, the Consolidated and 
Company Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation is applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and, as regards the parent company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions  
of the Companies Act 2006.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation  
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they  
give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with 
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and  
for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, 
accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to 
any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose 
hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.
Scope of the Audit of the Financial Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the group’s and the parent 
company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read  
all the financial and non-financial information in the annual 
report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on Financial Statements
In our opinion:
 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the   >
state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as 
at 30 April 2011 and of the Group’s loss and Group and 
Parent Company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
 the group financial statements have been properly   >
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by  
the European Union;
 the parent company financial statements have been properly  >
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance  >
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and,  
as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
lAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other Matters Prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited  >
has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006;
 the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial  >
year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on Which we are Required to Report  
by Exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to 
report to you if, in our opinion:
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the  >
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have  
not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
 the parent company financial statements and the part of   >
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not  
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified   >
by law are not made; or 
 we have not received all the information and explanations   >
we require for our audit; or
Under the Listing Rules we are Required to Review:
 the directors’ statement contained within the Directors’  >

Financial Statements
Notes to the Financial Statements
1. General Information
DTZ Holdings plc is a Company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act. The address of 
the registered office is 125 Old Broad Street, London EC2N 2BQ. DTZ Holdings plc (the Company) and its subsidiaries (together 
‘the Group’) are one of the world’s leading real estate advisers, providing innovative real estate and business solutions. Further 
information regarding the nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in note 5 and in our Business 
Review on pages 10 to 33.
These financial statements are presented in sterling as this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the  
Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
2. Accounting Policies
2a. Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU), IFRIC Interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair 
value through profit or loss. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving  
a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated 
financial statements are disclosed in note 3.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. This is discussed in the Directors’ Report on page 51, 
under the heading ‘Going concern’.
Basis of Consolidation
The financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries and joint venture undertakings, 
together with the Group’s share of the results of its associates.
(a)  Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect  
of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group  
controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.  
They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for 
the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by 
the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent 
liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. On an acquisition-
by-acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling 
interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets.
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment. Cost is adjusted to reflect changes in consideration arising 
from contingent consideration amendments.  Notes to the Financial Statements
continued
2. Accounting Policies continued
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date 
fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets 
acquired is recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of  
a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure 
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
(b)  Transactions and Non-controlling Interests
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group. For purchases  
from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying 
value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also 
recorded in equity.
When the Group ceases to have control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value, 
with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of 
subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts 
previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly 
disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income 
are reclassified to profit or loss.
If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts 
previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.
(c) Investments in Associates
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding 
of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights but not considered to be a joint venture. Investments in associates are accounted 
for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. The Group’s investment in associates includes 
goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment loss.
The Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share of 
post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative 
post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses  
in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not 
recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest  
in the associates. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset 
transferred. Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies 
adopted by the Group.
Dilution gains and losses arising in investments in associates are recognised in the income statement.
DTZ Holdings plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2011 64 2. Accounting Policies continued
(d) Interests in Joint Ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject 
to joint control, that is when the strategic financial and operating policy decisions relating to the activities require the unanimous 
consent of the parties sharing control. Joint ventures are accounted for using the proportional consolidation method. The Group’s 
share of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the joint venture are combined line by line with similar items in the Group’s 
financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue comprises commissions and fees 
receivable from agency and professional activities, exclusive of sales-related taxes and amounts due to third parties.
Agency commissions are recognised either on the unconditional completion of a contract or when a fee is contractually due. 
Professional fees are recognised on an ongoing basis and are accounted for in accordance with the work in progress accounting 
policy below.
Intangible Assets
(a)  Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially 
recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill in respect of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill relating to associates is included within the carrying 
value of the associate. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-
generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the 
goodwill arose identified according to operating segment.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset might be impaired. Any 
impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not reversed in a subsequent period. For impairment 
losses that are derived in a foreign currency, the impairment loss is calculated at the closing foreign currency exchange rate. 
(b)  Other Intangible Assets
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are valued at fair value on acquisition and amortised over their 
useful life. Amortisation charges are spread on a straight-line basis over the period of the assets’ estimated useful lives using  
the following rates:
Brand  33% – 50% per annum >
Customer relationships and contracts  20% – 50% per annum >
Software  33% per annum  >
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any related impairment losses. 
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition  
for its intended use.
 DTZ Holdings plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2011    65
Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements
continued
2. Accounting Policies continued
Depreciation is provided so as to write-off the cost of property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives,  
on a straight-line basis, using the following rates:
Leasehold improvements  over term of lease, to a maximum of 7 years >
Furniture and equipment  10% to 33% per annum >
Motor vehicles  20% to 25% per annum >
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater than 
its estimated recoverable amount (see below ‘Impairment of Non-financial Assets’). Residual values and useful lives are reviewed 
and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within 
‘Other operating expenses’ in the income statement.
Impairment of Non-financial Assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for 
impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s 
carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less cost to sell 
and its value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are 
separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that have suffered an 
impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
Work in Progress
Work in progress is recognised in relation to professional activities which have not yet been invoiced. Calculation of the work in 
progress and of the income from services rendered is based on a specific review of the services provided, billed and to be billed, 
according to the stage of completion of assignments. No account is taken of work in progress relating to agency activities if the 
recovery of such income is contingent upon the successful completion of the transaction and such completion has not occurred 
at the balance sheet date.
Taxation
The tax charge comprises current tax payable and deferred tax. The current tax charge represents an estimate of the amounts 
payable to tax authorities in respect of the Group’s taxable profits.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and 
the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences 
can be utilised. Assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill, or the transaction (other 
than in a business combination) does not affect either the taxable profit or the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, 
and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is 
probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
DTZ Holdings plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2011 66 2. Accounting Policies continued
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to 
equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Foreign Currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet 
date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the 
balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are 
expressed in sterling using exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the 
average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising are classified as equity and transferred to the translation reserve. 
Such translation differences are released to the income statement in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are, after the date of transaction, treated  
as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.
Borrowing Costs
Borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. Transaction costs associated with 
refinancing bank borrowings are capitalised and amortised over the term of the borrowings. When a facility is renegotiated and 
subsequently qualifies as a new facility, previously capitalised costs are written off to the income statement at the point where  
the old facility is deemed to end.
Bank Borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, 
using the effective interest rate method. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the settlement or 
redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowings in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for 
borrowing costs (see above).
Financial Instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet at fair value when the Group becomes a party  
to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade Receivables
Trade receivables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective 
evidence that the asset is impaired. The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (with the exception of current trade receivables) discounted at the 
effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that  
are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Trade Payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest 
rate method.

Share Capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity  
as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Investments – Financial Assets
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract 
whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially  
at cost including transaction costs.
Investments are classified as either held-for-trading or available-for-sale, and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair 
value. Where securities are held for trading purposes, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in net profit 
or loss for the period. For available-for-sale investments, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised 
directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognised in equity is included in the net profit or loss for the period. Impairment losses recognised in profit or loss  
for equity investments classified as available-for-sale are not subsequently reversed through profit or loss. Impairment losses 
recognised in profit or loss for debt instruments classified as available-for-sale are subsequently reversed if an increase in the  
fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the recognition of the impairment loss.
Retirement Benefit Obligations
Retirement benefit obligations to employees are provided by three principal schemes, which are funded by contributions from 
certain Group companies and employees. Payments are made in accordance with periodic calculations by a professionally 
qualified actuary. Contributions to the defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense on a payable basis.
For the defined benefit scheme, the cost of providing benefits is calculated by a professionally qualified actuary using the 
projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur and are presented 
in the statement of comprehensive income.
The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represent the present value of the defined benefit obligations 
as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows using the rate of 
interest or a high quality corporate bond less the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited  
to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
Capitalised Pension Liability
Provision is made for the capitalised value of future pensions payable to certain surviving spouses of the Bernard Thorpe 
partnership. This is calculated in accordance with advice provided by Lane Clark & Peacock, professionally qualified actuaries, 
on bases appropriate as at the year-end date. In the event of a permanent diminution in the profits of the Group, the liability 
would substantially reduce. Payments in respect of these pensions are charged to the provision.
Leasing
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the income statement in equal annual amounts over the period of the leases.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Share-based Payments
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS1, IFRS2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after  
7 November 2002 that had not vested as of 1 May 2006.
The Group issues share option awards to certain employees and Senior Executives on a periodic basis under the Company 
Share Option Plan (COSOP). The awards are measured at fair value at the date of the grant and are expensed on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The fair value of the share awards is determined using the Black-Scholes option valuation method.
DTZ Holdings plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2011 68 2. Accounting Policies continued
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group 
will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to 
settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Derivative Financial Instrument and Hedge Accounting
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 
The Group uses interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures to interest rate movements. The Group does not use 
derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provides written 
principles on the use of financial derivatives. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows  
are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the cash flow 
hedge of a firm commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then at the time the asset  
or liability is recognised, the associated gain or loss on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity is included in 
the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts 
deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income 
statement as they arise.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity in the foreign currency translation reserve. The 
gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss. Gains and losses deferred in the foreign currency 
translation reserve are recognised in profit or loss on disposal of the foreign operation.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer 
qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is 
retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative 
gain or loss is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
Exceptional Items
Exceptional items are those significant items which are separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a full 
understanding of the Group’s financial performance. Transactions which may give rise to exceptional items are principally gains 
or losses on disposal or closure of investments, subsidiaries and other restructuring activities.

2b. Adoption of new and revised standards
Standards and Amendments Effective in 2011
The Group adopted the following new and amended standards as of 1 May 2010:
– IFRS 3 (revised), ‘Business Combinations’
The main changes to the standard following the revision include the separate accounting of acquisition related costs, changes  
to business combinations achieved in stages and changes to the accounting for business combinations where less than 100% 
of the equity is acquired. These changes did not have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.
– IAS 27 (revised), ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’
The revision specifies that changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in the loss of control must 
be accounted for as equity transactions. For the effect of this standard see note 26.
– IFRS 2009 (improvements)
The improvements to IFRS contains miscellaneous necessary but non-urgent amendments to IFRS. These changes did not 
have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.
– IAS 39 (amendment), ‘Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement’
This amendment makes two significant changes. It prohibits designating inflation as a hedgeable component of a fixed rate debt.  
It also prohibits including time value in the one-sided hedged risk when designating options as hedges. Accordingly, hedging 
strategies involving options need to be re-assessed. This amendment had no impact on the Group or Company financial statements
– IFRIC 17 , ‘Distribution of non-cash assets to owners’ 
This interpretation provides guidance on accounting for arrangements whereby an entity distributes non-cash assets to 
shareholders either as a distribution of reserves or as dividends. IFRS 5 has also been amended to require that assets are 
classified as held for distribution only when they are available for distribution in their present condition and the distribution  
is highly probable. The interpretation did not have a material impact on the Group or Company financial statements. 
Standards, Amendments and Interpretations to Standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted  
by the Group
The following standards and amendments to published standards are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after  
1 May 2011, and have not been early adopted:
– IAS 24 (revised), ‘Related party disclosures’
This standard is mandatory for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011. The revised standard clarifies and simplifies the 
definition of a related party and removes the requirement for government-related entities to disclose details of all transactions  
with the government and other government-related entities. The Group will apply the revised standard from 1 May 2011. 
– IFRS 9 Financial instruments for financial assets
The adoption of IFRS 9 which the Group plans to adopt for the year beginning 1 May 2013 will impact both the measurement 
and disclosure of financial instruments.
DTZ Holdings plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2011 70 2. Accounting Policies continued
– IFRS 2010 (improvements) 
The improvements to IFRS contain miscellaneous necessary but non-urgent amendments to IFRS. These changes are not 
expected to have a material impact on the Group.
– IFRIC 19, ‘Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments’ 
The interpretation clarifies the accounting by an entity when the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated and result in the 
entity issuing equity instruments to a creditor of the entity to extinguish all or part of the financial liability (debt for equity swap).  
It requires a gain or loss to be recognised in profit or loss, which is measured as the difference between the carrying amount  
of the financial liability and the fair value of the equity instruments issued. If the fair value of the equity instruments issued cannot 
be reliably measured, the equity instruments should be measured to reflect the fair value of the financial liability extinguished.  
The Group will apply the interpretation from 1 May 2011, subject to endorsement by the EU. It is not expected to have any  
impact on the Group or the Company’s financial statements.
– IFRIC 14 (amendment), ‘Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement’ 
The amendments correct an unintended consequence of IFRIC 14, ‘IAS 19 – The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding 
requirements and their interaction’. Without the amendments, entities are not permitted to recognise as an asset some voluntary 
prepayments for minimum funding contributions. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to the earliest comparative 
year presented. The Group will apply these amendments for the financial reporting period commencing on 1 May 201 1. 
3. Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty
The preparation of the financial statements necessitates the use of estimates, assumptions and judgements. These estimates, 
assumptions and judgements affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the balance sheet date 
as well as affecting the reported income and expenses for the year. Details of these estimates, assumptions and judgements are 
discussed below:
Impairment of Goodwill and Intangibles
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the higher of value-in-use and the fair value less cost of sale 
of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. The value-in-use calculation requires the Group to estimate 
the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the 
present value. Actual outcomes could vary significantly from these estimates. Estimates used in this analysis are set out in note 
13 to the financial statements.
Retirement Benefit Obligations
The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes as described in note 30 to the financial statements. The 
assets of the schemes are measured at their fair value at the balance sheet date. Scheme liabilities are measured using the 
projected unit credit method, which takes account of projected earnings increases, using actuarial assumptions that give the 
best estimate of the future cash flows that will arise under the scheme liabilities. These cash flows are discounted at the interest 
rate applicable to high-quality corporate bonds of the same currency and term as the liabilities. Any surplus or deficit of scheme 
assets over liabilities is recognised in the balance sheet as an asset (surplus) or liability (deficit). In determining the value of 
scheme liabilities different assumptions could significantly alter the amount of the deficit recognised in the balance sheet and the 
pension cost charged to the income statement. The assumptions adopted for the Group’s pension schemes are set out in note 
30 to the financial statements.

Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements

3. Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty continued
Share Based Payments
Recognition and measurement of share-based payments required estimation of the fair value of awards at the date of grant. 
Judgment is exercised when estimating the number of awards that will ultimately vest and these estimates have a significant 
impact on the amounts recognised in the income statement and balance sheet. To assist in determining each award’s fair value, 
the Directors engage a qualified and independent valuation expert. Assumptions in relation to the number of awards that will 
ultimately vest is based on estimates at the reporting date of the extent to which non market vesting conditions are anticipated  
to be satisfied, anticipated future lapses by leavers and the current intrinsic value of those awards. It recognises the impact of  
the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Income Taxes
As the Group operates across many income tax jurisdictions, judgement is required in determining the consolidated provision  
for income taxes. The Deferred Tax Asset is calculated on an entity or fiscal unity basis and is recognised if based on forecast 
profitability a tax loss can be utilised.
Provisions
The Group and its subsidiaries recognise a provision where it is probable that there is a present (legal or constructive) obligation in 
respect of a past event. Judgment is required to quantify such amounts. The Group recognises significant provisions in relation to the 
following items: onerous leases, deferred consideration, restructuring, professional indemnity claims and dilapidations. The Group has 
internal processes and where appropriate external advice is obtained to determine the appropriate level of provision required.
Trade Receivables
The net accounts receivable amount includes an allowance for doubtful debts. The valuation of the allowance for doubtful debts 
reflects the Group’s estimates of losses arising from the failure or inability of the Group’s customers to make required payments. 
The allowance is based on the ageing of customer accounts, customer worthiness and the Group’s historical write-off 
experience. Changes to the allowance may be required if the financial condition of the Group’s customers improves or 
deteriorates. An improvement in financial condition may result in lower actual write-offs. Historically, changes to the estimate  
of losses have not been material to the Group’s financial position and results.
4. Restatement of Prior Year Accounts
Acquisition Option
On 21 November 2005, DTZ International Limited (a 100 per cent owned subsidiary of DTZ Holdings plc) acquired 46 per cent of 
the issued share capital of Edmund Tie & Company Holding Pte Limited (ETCH), a property advisory business in South East Asia.
As part of this transaction, the parties included a put and call option that would allow the vendor or purchaser the right to  
sell/ buy the remaining interest in ETCH in 10 per cent increments over the option period (deemed to be each year ending  
31 December 2009-2013).
DTZ Holdings plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2011 72 4. Restatement of Prior Year Accounts continued
The put option which involves the vendor requiring DTZ to purchase up to the remaining 49 per cent is capped at SGD 
10,000,000. The cost of exercising the options is calculated by a formula which takes the average profit before tax of the 
preceding three years and applies a multiple to the average to determine a value.
At the time of the acquisition no liability was recognised for this put option. The financial statements of 30 April 2011 reflect this 
liability and comparative periods have been restated to correct this. The effect of this restatement is summarised below.

and was positioned after operating profit/loss. Management have reclassified this amount to other income and moved the 
account to form part of the operating profit/loss. This change has also been reflected in the segmental analysis see note 5.

10. Taxation on Profit/(Loss) on Ordinary Activities continued
Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of temporary differences and losses where it is probable that these assets 
will be recovered.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of timing differences relating to trading losses in subsidiaries where 
there is insufficient evidence that the asset will be recovered. The amount of the asset not recognised is £22,460,000 (2010: 
£11,550,000). The asset will be recovered if sufficient suitable profits are made in the future against which the asset could 
reverse. None of these unrecognised deferred income tax assets have expiry dates associated with them.
The recognition of deferred income tax assets is supported by management’s forecast of the future profitability of the relevant 
business units.
11. Results of the Parent Company
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Income Statement and Statement of Comprehensive Income  
of the parent Company is not presented as part of these accounts. The parent Company’s loss for the year amounted to 
£3,612,000 (2010: profit of £21,906,000).
12. (Loss)/Earnings per Ordinary Share
The basic (loss)/earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to equity shareholders by  
the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year. The diluted (loss)/earnings per ordinary share is calculated  
by adjusting the weighted average number of shares to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

13. Intangible Assets continued
In the prior period, £283,000 was recognised as an impairment charge in connection with the goodwill held in Russia due  
to the operations being disposed of. The Russian goodwill was previously included in the CEMEA cash-generating unit.
For details relating to the current year acquisitions of subsidiaries refer to note 18.
Impairment Testing
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill and intangibles are allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs) 
according to geographic region. A geography based summary of the allocation is presented below:

Total intangible assets 131,955 562 623 133,140
Methodology
Goodwill is not amortised but the Group tests goodwill annually for impairment with the recoverable amount being determined  
from value in use calculations. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the CGUs. 
Cash flow projections are based on financial forecasts approved by management as follows:
Cash flow projections are based on budget and three-year business plans; >
 Cash flow projections beyond that timeframe are extrapolated by applying a consistent growth rate for one year, followed   >
by a growth rate to perpetuity of 1.5% reflecting the expected long-term growth rate in the market;
 The cash flows obtained are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.82% (2010: 11.05%), equivalent to the Group’s  >
weighted average cost of capital. This has been determined as reflecting current market assessments of the time value of 
money and risks specific to the industry and Company.
Key assumptions used to determine the value in use include expected market growth and levels of competition. The values 
assigned to these reflect past experience and expected changes over the timeframe of the business plan.
Sensitivity
Management have applied reasonable sensitivities to the cash flow projections forecast for each CGU and are satisfied that  
no CGUs show indications of possible impairment. The sensitivities were primarily based around reductions in growth rates 
applied to revenues within each CGU.
Results
Based on the impairment analysis performed at 30 April 2011, the Directors are satisfied that no impairment charge is required.

18. Acquisitions 
Asset Management Europe Acquisition
On 6 August 2010, DTZ Holding SA, a wholly owned subsidiary of DTZ Holdings plc, acquired the 20 per cent of DTZ Asset 
Management Europe SAS (AME), which the DTZ Group did not already own. The payment consisted of an initial cash payment 
of EUR 7 ,100,000 (£5,476,000) and a deferred cash consideration dependent on future performance and a final deferred 
payment based upon the market value of AME, the total subject to a maximum of EUR 22,000,000 (£19,100,000). As DTZ had 
control of AME prior to the acquisition of the remaining interest, in compliance with IAS 27 (revised), the difference between the 
purchase consideration and fair value of the 20 per cent interest has been taken as a debit to reserves of EUR 12,100,000 
(£10,787 ,000).
DTZ Barnicke 
On 20 August 2010, DTZ Barnicke Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of DTZ Holdings plc, acquired the 33 per cent of DTZ 
Barnicke Quebec Ltee, which it did not already own. The consideration paid for this acquisition was Canadian $250,000 
(£177 ,000).
South East Asia Acquisition
On 22 November 2010, the Group acquired a further 10 per cent interest in Edmund Tie & Company Holdings Pte Limited (ETCH), 
as the result of the exercise of a Put option by New Horizon Holdings Pte Limited which was granted to it in November 2005. 
Following this acquisition, the Group now holds a 61 per cent interest in the business which operates in Singapore, Vietnam, 
Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. The total consideration for the acquisition was SGD 5,882,000 (£2,833,000) – comprised  
of a cash payment of SGD 2,941,000 (£1,417 ,000) and 3,268,790 shares in DTZ Holdings plc.

Trade Receivables
Total trade receivables (net of allowances) held by the Group at 30 April 2011 amounted to £69,929,000 (2010: £72,319,000). 
The Group has provided fully for all trade receivables over eight months because historical experience is such that receivables 
that are past due beyond eight months are generally not recoverable. Trade receivables between one month and eight months 
are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts determined by reference to past default experience.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large, unrelated and internationally dispersed. 
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts. 
The current year decrease in the allowance for doubtful debts is a result of improved processes around debt collection and 
monitoring that have been initiated during the period.

(1)
  On 14 December 2010, £5,000,000 was drawn down on the existing SGP mezzanine facility – taking the total drawn amount on this facility to £15,000,000. 
As a result, under the terms of the existing facility with RBS, the zero coupon tranche is increased from £20,000,000 to £25,000,000, and the sterling tranche 
is correspondingly reduced.
(2) 
 The revolving credit facility was originally due to expire on 31 January 2010. This facility now matures 31 July 2013 and any amounts drawn down on this 
facility are repayable on that date.
(3) 
 The Company, at its option, can defer amortisation payments due on 31 January 2012 of £5,000,000 and 31 July 2012 of £7,500,000 until July 2014.  
In such circumstances the Company would pay pay-in-kind (PIK) interest margin calculated as the difference between the cash margin payable on the 
amount deferred and 11 per cent.
All facilities are secured on certain current and non-current assets of the Group.
SGP Facility
On 14 December 2010, the Company also entered into an agreement with SAS Saint George Participations (SGP) for an 
additional mezzanine facility of up to £10,000,000. This facility remains undrawn. The mezzanine facility is denominated in Euro.  
It attracts cash interest at EURIBOR +4.0 per cent and a PIK coupon of EURIBOR +7 .0 per cent which rolls up and is paid on 
redemption of the mezzanine loan on or before 30 April 2012. At the Company’s sole discretion, the mezzanine loan, plus unpaid 
interest, can be redeemed by issuing shares to SGP at 27 .0p or the then share price, whichever is lower, or such other price as 
may be agreed by SGP and the Company.
HSBC Facility
On 8 March 201 1, the Group borrowed HKD 55,000,000 from HSBC under two facilities. The first facility is a HKD 20,000,000 
overdraft facility with cash interest of 1.25 per cent over the overnight HKD inter-bank offer rate. The second facility is a five year HKD 
35,000,000 amortising facility with cash interest of 1.00 per cent over HIBOR. The second facility amortises in 20 equal annual 
instalments. Both facilities are secured on DTZ cash balances within the People’s Republic of China. The security provided  
is a standby letter of credit for HKD 55,000,000. Both facilities are repayable on demand and are shown as current liabilities.

Financial Risk Management Objectives
The Group has formal financial risk management policies which cover those financial risks which are considered material to the 
Group’s operations and results. These policies and limits are reviewed annually and to ensure compliance, appropriate delegated 
authorities have been set together with reporting procedures. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, 
including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Foreign Currency Risk Management
The Group publishes its results in sterling but has a number of overseas businesses operating in foreign currencies. The Group 
does not hedge the foreign exchange risks arising from the translation of overseas business results into sterling but will, within 
limits agreed by the Board, hedge against committed transaction foreign currency exposures and the translation exposure of 
foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.

Group Treasury manages a number of bank accounts across a number of currencies within pooling arrangements. At 30 April 
2011, the Group was overdrawn in Sterling balances, which were offset by a number of positive currency balances.
Sensitivity Analysis
A 10% strengthening of Sterling against the following currencies at 30 April 2011 would have increased/(decreased) equity and 
(increase)/decrease loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates 
remain constant. The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2010.

A 10% weakening of Sterling against the above currencies at 30 April 2011 would have an equal but opposite effect to the 
amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant. The Group operates mainly in developed countries 
and a 10% movement in exchange rates is considered reasonable given historical movements.
DTZ Holdings plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2011 92 23. Financial Instruments continued
Interest Rate Risk Management
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. The risk  
is managed by the Group maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings and by the use of interest 
rate swap contracts. The Group’s policy is that a minimum of 40% of debt should be at fixed rates.
If interest rates had been 1% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s loss for the year ended  
30 April 2011 would decrease/increase by £674,000 (2010: decrease/increase by £517 ,000). Further increases in rates would 
have a similar impact on the profit and loss of the Group.
The Group’s exposure to interest rates on financial assets and liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
Interest Rate Swap Contracts
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest 
amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing 
interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate held. 
The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly basis. The floating rate on the interest rate swap is 3 month LIBOR. The Group will settle 
the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis. All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating rate 
interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the Group’s cash flow 
exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings. The Group has the following interest rate swap contracts outstanding:

The two interest rate swaps have been designated and deemed 100% effective as cash flow hedges allowing their fair value to be 
recognised in equity. At 30 April 201 1, the fair value charge deferred in equity for the interest rate swap was £615,000 (2010: £23,000).
Credit Risk Management
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables and investments. The Group’s 
credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for 
doubtful receivables and therefore represents the exposure. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified 
loss event, which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit 
ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Liquidity Risk Management
The Group maintains a debt to capital ratio that has flexibility to allow it to meet its strategic objectives. In addition, policies  
have been set on borrowing levels to net cash requirements and covenants of financing sources to be used. The Group’s 
requirements are reviewed annually or more often if the need arises. Included in note 22 is a description of additional undrawn 
facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.

29. Contingent Liabilities
In common with other comparable professional services businesses, the Group is involved in a number of pending or threatened 
lawsuits arising out of, or incident to, our ordinary course of business.
The Group has recognised a liability in these financial statements for all claims where it is probable costs are to be incurred and 
represents the cost of defending and concluding claims. In accordance with IFRS, when the Group has received notices of 
potential claims where it may be possible that costs could be incurred, the Group does not recognise a liability; it only discloses 
this as a contingent liability. Costs in relation to those specific potential claims are only recognised when they become probable. 
The Group carries professional indemnity insurance and no separate disclosure is made of the cost of claims covered by 
insurance as to do so could seriously prejudice the position of the Group.
30. Retirement Benefit Obligations
Within the UK the Group operates two occupational pension schemes, one of which (the DTZ 2002 Retirement Plan) provided 
benefits based on final pensionable salary but closed to future accrual with effect from 31 October 2009, and the second being 
a defined contribution scheme. In addition the Group operates a personal pension plan open to employees not covered by the 
other two schemes. The assets of all the pension schemes are held separately from those of the Group. Provision is also made 
for the capitalised value of future pensions payable to certain former partners and surviving spouses of the Bernard Thorpe 
partnership (Bernard Thorpe Annuitants).
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. The Group has adopted the revised version  
of IAS19 ‘Employee Benefits’ published in December 2004. As permitted by the revised standard, actuarial gains and losses  
are recognised outside profit or loss and presented in the statement of comprehensive income. The liability recognised in the 
balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation, as reduced by the fair value of assets.
DTZ 2002 Retirement Plan (2002 Plan)
The results of an actuarial valuation as at 30 April 2011 were used by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with IAS19. 
As required by IAS19, the value of the defined benefit obligation and current service cost has been measured using the projected 
unit credit method.
In July 2010, the government announced its intention that future statutory minimum pension indexation would be measured with 
reference to the Consumer Price Index, rather than the Retail Price Index. The 2002 Plan Trustee’s legal advisers have advised 
that, from 1 January 2011, this change will automatically affect the revaluation of pensions prior to retirement. This has been 
reflected in the Group’s assumption as at 30 April 2011 and a gain of £1,300,000 has been recognised as a result, included in 
actual gains on assumptions in the figures below.
The expected rate of return on assets for the financial year ended 30 April 2011 was 6.3% pa (2010: 6.4% pa). This rate is 
derived by taking the weighted average of the long-term expected rate of return on each of the asset classes that the 2002  
Plan was invested in at 30 April 2010.
The estimated amount of total employer contributions expected to be paid to the 2002 Plan during 2011 is £1,100,000  
(2010 actual: £1,050,000).
The following table sets out the key IAS19 assumptions used:

Executive chairman’s statement
As your newly appointed Chairman, may I open 
my report by congratulating Chris Moore on his 
appointment as Chief Executive on 31 December 2007. 
Chris and I have worked together for almost ten years 
and during that time he has had, at one time or 
another, responsibility for almost every area of the 
business. A more qualiﬁed and able “new” Chief 
Executive would be hard to imagine! I therefore 
personally wish him every success in leading us 
toward and hopefully beyond, 1,000 stores.
In 2007, Domino’s Pizza recorded another year of excellent results 
with the opening of 50 new stores and exceptional like-for-like 
sales growth. The Company leveraged its relatively ﬁxed cost
base to generate record proﬁts and, with strong operating cash 
ﬂow and very little capital required by the business, we continued 
our programme of returning surplus cash to shareholders by way
of share buybacks and record dividends.
As I know only too well, this can only be achieved with a great 
team of people behind you. Domino’s Pizza is a rather unique 
business, being almost entirely franchised which means that we 
have a small central team, currently 325, supporting a much larger 
group of franchisees and team members in the stores, currently 
numbering 12,000. One of the huge beneﬁts of franchising is that 
the stores are run by local entrepreneurs who know their local 
market, employ local people and become part of the communities 
in which they operate. 
In a business structured in the way we have chosen, it is equally 
important that we in the centre ensure that we deliver the services 
that are our responsibility to the highest standards. One of the
key functions is the manufacture and distribution of all the food 
items used in our stores. The speciﬁcation we have set ourselves 
is extremely demanding. We deliver fresh food to every one of  
our stores three times a week, at times when the stores are not 
operating. This is a signiﬁcant logistical effort for which we need 
the best facilities and systems. We have therefore recently 
embarked on a major capital expenditure programme that will see 
the doubling in size of our Penrith commissary and the construction 
of a new state-of-the-art commissary on a newly to be acquired
ten acre site in Milton Keynes. When fully operational in late 2009, 
this new commissary will be the most advanced manufacturing
and distribution facility anywhere in the Domino’s Pizza system 
worldwide and will provide our business with signiﬁcant additional 
operating efﬁciencies and resilience. 
Maintenance of the consistently high standards expected of a 
brand such as Domino’s Pizza requires careful monitoring, training 
and investment by both the franchisees and corporate. We have 
therefore launched a number of initiatives in recent years to assist 
our franchisees in achieving the high standards we expect from 
them in the areas of health and safety, employment practices and 
environmental health standards. 
Finally, having opened by welcoming our new CEO, I would like to 
close by paying tribute to our retiring Chairman, Colin Halpern. 
Colin acquired the rights to Domino’s Pizza in the UK and Ireland 
back in 1993. His “feel” for the market and his wise commercial 
counsel have been of invaluable help to me in guiding the business 
to the enviable position we are in today. I am pleased to say that 
we will not be losing this advice, as Colin has agreed to stay on as 
Non-Executive Vice Chairman. I look forward to working with him 
for many years to come. 
Stephen Hemsley
Executive Chairman 7
Chief executive’s report
It is with great pleasure that I present my ﬁrst
report as Chief Executive and I would like to  
open it by thanking the Board and shareholders
for their conﬁdence.
Domino’s Pizza is now a 500-store system which is accessible  
to 55% of UK and Irish households. Our franchisees and in store 
team members and employees in our three commissaries and 
headquarters, have worked with passion to reach this stage and I 
would like to convey my thanks to them at the start of this report. 
The strong performance of our stores against a backdrop of
tough comparatives is representative of two areas of focus
for your Company over the past year: increasingly innovative, 
targeted marketing and tangible improvements to customer
service standards. 
Whilst our 500
th
 store milestone was cause for celebration
across the company, we are mindful of the fact that Domino’s  
is still only halfway to its target of 1,000 stores. I am conﬁdent
that the combination of our talented people, high quality pizza
and market- leading service standards, will deliver against this 
target by 2017.
System Sales 
In 2007 system sales, which are the sales of all stores in the 
Domino’s system in the UK and Republic of Ireland, rose by  
23.4% (2006: 19.7%) to £296.3m (2006: £240.1m). Like-for-like 
sales in the 404 stores open for more than twelve months in both 
periods grew by 14.7% (2006: 9.7% in 357 stores), the highest 
percentage increase recorded since 2001. 
Product innovation
As I mentioned in my introduction, stores have delivered 
impressive sales results thanks, in part, to the effectiveness
of both centralised and localised marketing activity as well as
one of the wettest British summers. This programme was driven 
by a calendar of innovative product development which included 
the hugely popular Meateor pizza, a back-to-basics focus on the 
classic Pepperoni Passion and the rugby-themed Scrummy.
Given the stable central cost base of running the marketing fund, 
more of the franchisees’ contributions to our £15m National 
Advertising Fund were effectively spent on more national TV 
advertising volumes, targeted direct mail and intensive online 
promotion. Considerable effort has also been directed at price 
promotions which, whilst still communicating our reputation for 
premium quality pizza, offer great value to consumers.
Service excellence 
I can also attribute 2007’s sales performance to a measurable 
improvement in customer service standards. Domino’s is not just  
a pizza business, it’s a service business and we recognise that our 
ﬁnancial performance is driven by our service standards. These 
standards must be good enough to make customers talk about us 
and create the vital word of mouth recommendations that generate 
sales. In 2006, we began a programme of training and high value 
incentives designed to help stores improve on the time it takes
to get a customer’s pizza to the door – the single most important 
metric when it comes to evaluating our service standards. We did 
this by improving speed in the store, never on the road, as the 
safety of our team members remains of paramount importance.

Annual Report & Accounts
for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2007 8
Innovation  
E-commerce continues to be our fastest-growing channel to 
market as well as one which enhances store-level proﬁtability 
through labour savings. In 2007, total sales via these platforms, 
which include online and SMS ordering, reached £32.2m (2006: 
£20.1m), an increase of 60.5%. In 2007, e-commerce accounted 
for 16% of our delivered pizzas sold in the UK (2006:13%) and 
generates a higher than average ticket value. The Irish service, 
which was launched in February 2007, is already delivering close
to 5% of delivered sales.
Last year was deﬁned by your Company’s push into digital 
multi-channel retail platforms. We now feature on 16 e-commerce 
platforms including the launch of SMS ordering in August 2007.
Food Cost Pressures
Unprecedented increases in the prices of raw materials since
the middle of 2007, in particular milk and wheat, had a signiﬁcant 
effect on both us and our franchisees. This was exacerbated by
our cheese supplier going into receivership and the consequential 
ending of our ﬁxed price contract. As a result, new supply 
arrangements saw the cost of cheese increasing by over 50%
over the course of the year. Wheat has also recently increased 
signiﬁcantly in price, but by less than the 100% we had feared
and is now ﬁxed for the remainder of the year. The outlook for 
pricing in 2008 looks more stable.
These increases in raw material prices have now been passed
on to our franchisees who have had time to reﬂect them in their 
menu prices. The new menu pricing which fully recovered all cost 
increases, saw increases average around 4%. This new pricing
has been accepted by customers as witnessed by the continued 
momentum in sales since November when prices ﬁrst increased.
Expansion
In 2007 we opened 50 new stores (2006: 46) and closed none 
(2006: two) bringing the year-end store count to 501 stores  
(2006: 451). Whilst we continue to experience some inconsistency 
in planning decisions, this did not signiﬁcantly hamper our expansion 
last year. The aim of many local authorities appears to be the 
regeneration of secondary retail space and this has worked in
our favour, with Domino’s being recognised as a responsible  
and attractive occupant of previously redundant units.
This successful expansion was the result of considerable
efforts, particularly in the fourth quarter, by our expanded  
business development team who have worked in close
conjunction with our existing franchisees to identify sites,
secure planning permission and build stores.
Over 4,300 applications to franchise were received in 2007 but
only 16 went on to be awarded franchises. Our rigorous interview 
process ensures that only the best candidates, with aspirations to 
franchise multiple stores, join our system.
It remains important to your Company that we increase the
number of stores operated by each franchisee so that they have
a viable, long-term business. However, we only allow franchisees 
with the highest standards to expand which in turn assures the 
quality growth of our system. As at 30 December 2007, we had 
144 franchisees (2006: 150), of whom 56 are single unit operators. 
Each franchisee has an average of 3.5 stores. (2006: 3.0 stores). 
This consolidation of the number of stores for each franchisee also 
means that we can manage our growing system more efﬁciently 
and further improve operational gearing.
During 2008, your Company will acquire freehold land for a new 
commissary and headquarters in Milton Keynes and construction is 
expected to complete towards the latter part of 2009. The project 
cost of £25m will be incurred over 2008 and 2009. The commissary 
in Penrith will also be expanded this year at a cost of £4m which 
will double the capacity of that facility. We will also need to expand 
the commissary operation in Naas to meet the increasing demand 
for Domino’s Pizza in Ireland. These developments, combined with 
the addition of a fourth commissary, in the UK, which we expect 
will be needed by 2012, will complete the infrastructure required 
for 1,000 stores.

Store Image
Last year we commissioned a new store design to refresh the 
current image of the estate which was introduced seven years ago. 
We will now begin to roll-out the new image across the system. 
Recent store openings have already started to feature this new 
design and we envisage that up to 100 reﬁts for the older looking 
stores in the system will be implemented in 2008 with the rest of 
the estate being upgraded over the next few years. All such reﬁts 
are funded by the franchisees some of whom may use the facilities 
offered by our in-house leasing company.
The Market
The UK eating out market was estimated by Mintel to be worth 
£30bn in 2007. The home-delivered food market continues to grow 
at a fast pace and in 2007 was worth an estimated £1.5bn which
is a third more than it was just 5 years ago. The extent of current 
research by Mintel predicts that the market is expected to grow
at a compound rate of 7% a year over the next four years. Based 
on these estimates we are currently selling around one in seven
of all home delivered meals. The popularity of home delivered
food shows no signs of slowing down and lifestyle factors such
as longer working weeks, more dual income households, more 
in-home entertainment and more one person households work
in our favour.
Corporate Social Responsibility
Food Quality
We constantly review the quality of our ingredients and have 
pioneered pizza innovation within our market. Last year we
were pleased to complete the removal of both hydrogenated
fats and MSG (Monosodium Glutamate) from all products on
the menu in addition to our long-standing policy of not allowing
any GMO’s (Genetically Modiﬁed Organisms). Our ongoing review 
of ingredients serves to maintain quality standards whilst also 
identifying opportunities to improve the nutrient proﬁle of our food.
Environment
The new commissary in Milton Keynes is being designed to be 
certiﬁed to BREEAM excellence (Building Research Establishment 
Environmental Assessment Method). A third of our truck ﬂeet, 
which deliver food to our stores, are already registered “Euro 5”, 
currently the highest standard in emissions control. It is anticipated 
that half the ﬂeet will be Euro 5 by the end of the current year and 
all trucks will be at this level by 2012. New fuel alternatives, such 
as biodiesel, are constantly being tested.
Currently 80% of our pizza boxes are made with recycled board 
and are 100% recyclable. Furthermore all invoices and statements 
are now sent to our franchisees electronically. Not only is this more 
efﬁcient but is importantly saving substantial paper and wastage in 
the process.
We continue to seek further ways in which our business can 
become more environmentally aware and are about to embark
on a study of the whole business to establish what opportunities 
we have for improvement.
Chief executive’s report contd.
Given the stable central cost base
of running the marketing fund, more 
of the franchisees’ contributions to 
our £15m national advertising fund 
were effectively spent on national 
TV advertising. 13
People
In stores, our franchisees today employ approximately 12,000 team 
members, a large and diverse group of people including some who 
require a short-term income and others looking for a long-term 
career. We rely upon these people to work with a fanatical focus  
on customer service and food quality without which we will lose 
the momentum required to fuel our growth.
Considerable effort continues to be directed at helping franchisees 
to keep pace with ever-changing employment legislation and at 
ensuring that their people beneﬁt from a hard-working environment 
which is still huge fun and very rewarding. We have bolstered the 
support provided to the stores with the appointment of a full-time 
franchisee HR consultant, nationwide seminars, telephone hotlines 
and web-based resources. Improvements to the scope and volume 
of training available to franchisees and in-store teams will serve to 
underline our reputation as a great place to work.
Charity
The phrase ‘Delivering More’ sums up our franchisees’ approach
to developing relationships with their local communities. It is
these local activities that build loyalty and sustain long term 
success. In 2007 our stores have made considerable strides in 
terms of their community relations efforts, driven in particular
by our ﬁrst full year of association with Special Olympics GB
and Special Olympics Ireland. Special Olympics is a major provider 
of sporting opportunities for people with a learning disability and 
provides equality of opportunity for all our athletes regardless of 
ability or degree of disability. The Company also organised and 
funded a number of events aimed at encouraging regional 
participation in Special Olympics activities and promoted the
charity on boxes and menus.
Current Trading and Outlook 
Trading in the ﬁrst six weeks of 2008 has got off to an strong start 
with like-for-like sales up 11.0% (2007: 14.3%). This is particularly 
encouraging given the strong comparatives of last year. E-commerce 
has continued to show robust growth with an increase of 90.6% in 
the same period (2007: 36.2%). E-commerce in the ﬁrst six weeks 
accounted for 21% of all UK delivered sales.
Our store opening programme is looking more encouraging than
at the same stage last year. We have more sites in the pipeline 
with planning than at the same time last year and this gives us 
optimism at this early stage that we are on track to once again 
achieve our target of 50 new store openings this year.
Cash ﬂows remains strong and we have the debt facilities in
place to secure the expansion of our existing commissary in 
Penrith and the investment in our new commissary in Milton 
Keynes. Accordingly it is the Directors’ intention to continue to 
return surplus cash to shareholders by further share buybacks
and dividends.
Your Company is well positioned for another year of strong growth.

Chief ﬁnancial ofﬁcer’s review
The Group’s ﬁnancial statements have been  
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). This is the ﬁrst year  
in which the Group ﬁnancial statements of Domino’s 
Pizza UK & IRL plc have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRS and the comparative amounts for 2006 
have been restated from UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (UK GAAP) to comply with IFRS.
Trading results
Group turnover, which includes the sales generated by the  
Group from royalties, fees on new store openings, food sales, 
ﬁnance lease and rental income, as well as the turnover of 
corporately owned and operated stores, grew by 21.0% to 
£114.9m (2006: £95.0m). 
Group operating proﬁt, including our share of operating proﬁt in 
joint ventures, but before exceptional costs and the accelerated 
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) charge was up 32.7% to £18.8m 
(2006: £14.2m). Exceptional operating costs were incurred as a 
result of your Company’s continuing strategy of exiting its corporate 
stores and amounted to £0.3m (2006: £0.5m). In addition, as a 
result of the rapid growth in proﬁtability and earnings per share 
over the last three years, the performance targets included in the 
2004 LTIP award have been achieved. The early vesting of these 
awards necessitates the acceleration of the 2008 and 2009 charge 
and a charge of £0.2m was incurred in the year (2006: £nil). 
The commissary rebate scheme, ﬁrst launched in 2005 to help our 
franchisees overcome the burden of new external cost pressures, 
continued to beneﬁt the system strongly in 2007. This scheme 
enhances the proﬁtability of franchisees who achieve like-for-like 
sales targets and fully comply with our operating standards. 
Included in Group operating proﬁt is the cost of this rebate which 
amounted to £1.4m (2006: £0.6m). The rebate was substantially 
higher than last year as a result of stronger like-for-like sales.
As highlighted in the Chief Executive’s report, the Group saw 
unprecedented increases in the prices of many raw materials 
towards the latter part of the year. This had an adverse impact to 
our food margin of £0.5m in 2007 as we felt unable to pass those 
increases on as quickly as they came through. Excluding these 
unexpected costs, Group operating proﬁts, before exceptionals, 
would have reached £19.3m, an increase of 35.9%. 
Finally, the Group sold six stores during the year, ﬁve of which 
were in a subsidiary company DP Newcastle & Sunderland Limited. 
The Group generated an exceptional proﬁt on the sale of these 
stores of £0.3m (2006: £0.2m).
Proﬁt on ordinary activities before interest and tax grew by
30.5% to £18.7m (2006: £14.3m). This includes the proﬁt on
the sale of the corporate stores of £0.3m (2006: £0.2m). In 2007 
there was £0.1m of property and legal provision releases relating
to the sale of corporate stores in prior periods (2006: £0.5m).
Proﬁt before tax and the accelerated LTIP charge of £0.2m was  
up 32.1% to £18.7m (2006: £14.2m). Unadjusted proﬁt before
tax was £18.6m (2006: £14.2m) an increase of 30.9%. One of
our key measurements of proﬁtability is the ratio of proﬁt before 
tax to system sales which grew to 6.3% in 2007 from 5.9% in
the previous year. This highlights the strength of the underlying 
operational gearing of our business model.
The tax charge for the year was 28.7% (2006: 29.6%) and is lower 
than the corporation tax rate of 30%, primarily due to the impact of 
the lower tax rate applicable in our Irish subsidiary company.
Proﬁt after tax and minority interest was up 31.3% to £13.2m 
(2006: £10.1m).
Earnings per share and dividend
Basic earnings per share before the accelerated LTIP charge  
of £0.2m and exceptional items were up 39.0% to 8.48 pence. 
(2006: 6.10 pence). Diluted earnings per share before the 
accelerated LTIP charge of £0.2m and exceptional items  
increased by 39.1% to 8.33 pence (2006: 5.99 pence).
Unadjusted basic earnings per share were up 34.5% to 8.38 pence 
(2006: 6.23 pence) and diluted earnings per share were up 34.6% 
to 8.24 pence (2006: 6.12 pence).
£114.9m
Group turnover grew
by 21.0%. 17
In line with our strategy of returning cash not required for the 
growth and expansion of the business to shareholders, the Board
is pleased to recommend a further signiﬁcant increase in the 
dividend payment which, if approved by shareholders, will give a 
ﬁnal dividend of 2.50 pence per share (2006: 1.76 pence per share). 
This would give a total dividend for the year of 4.40 pence per 
share (2006: 3.06 pence per share) a 43.8% increase. The full year 
dividend is 1.9 times covered by proﬁts after tax (2006: 2.1 times).
Subject to shareholders’ approval at the Annual General Meeting
to be held on 24 April 2008 the ﬁnal dividend will be payable on
2 May 2008 to shareholders on the register on 11 April 2008. 
Cash ﬂow and balance sheet 
Our cash position continues to remain strong. Net cash generated 
from operations reached £24.4m, up from £18.8m in 2006. This 
increase was mainly attributable to the higher operating proﬁts
as well as an improvement in working capital.
During the year, outﬂows of £0.1m of net interest, £4.3m of  
taxes and £1.1m of capital expenditure and ﬁnancial investment 
were incurred. 
Overall net cash ﬂow before ﬁnancing was £19.5m. This strong 
cash generation has allowed us to return a further £8.2m to 
shareholders through share buybacks during the year. 
In the year, options over 1.4m shares were exercised generating  
an inﬂow of £0.7m (2006: £0.4m).
DP Capital continued to provide leasing support to franchisees
for the ﬁt-out of new stores and the reﬁt of existing stores, with 
new advances of £1.3m (2006: £1.0m). After repayments, the 
balance outstanding at the year end on these leases was £2.8m 
(2006: £2.6m). These facilities are ﬁnanced by a limited recourse 
loan facility and the amount drawn down at the end of the year 
stood at £2.4m (2006: £2.3m).
At the end of the year, the Group had cash at bank and in hand  
of £14.6m (2006: £10.3m), which taken together with the leasing 
borrowings of DP Capital as noted above of £2.4m, the loans in
the Employee Beneﬁt Trust (“EBT”) of £7.7m and term loan debt  
of £6.0m, gave consolidated net debt of £1.6m (2006: £5.6m). 
After the deduction of the cost of the shares held in the EBT, 
shareholders funds were £9.9m (2006: £8.9m), resulting in a 
gearing ratio of 15.9% (2006: 62.5%). 
Towards the end of the year, the Group also ﬁnalised a £25.0m 
ﬁve-year term loan facility to enable it to ﬁnance the expansion
to its commissary facilities thereby leaving the net cash ﬂows 
generated by operating activities free to return to shareholders. 
This facility had not been utilised at the year end.
Corporate store, associates and subsidiaries
As stated at the preliminary stage last year, your Company  
remains focussed on withdrawing entirely from the operation
of corporate stores. We have an equity interest in ﬁve (2006: six) 
associates and subsidiaries which totals £0.6m (2006: £0.7m) 
involving a total of 30 stores (2006: 34 stores). 
In 2007, our share of post tax proﬁts of associates amounted
to £0.2m (2006: £0.2m).
Share split
On 27 February 2007, the Company announced a sub-division
of its share capital. The Company’s ordinary shares of 5 pence  
each prior to the sub-division were divided into 3.2 new ordinary 
shares of 1.5625 pence. These shares were admitted to trading
on Aim on 27 April 2007.
Intention to move to the Ofﬁcial List
Your Company has grown considerably in the past few years, and 
the Board now feels that it is of a size that is more appropriate to 
be listed on the Ofﬁcial List of the London Stock Exchange. The 
move is expected to take place in the second quarter of this year.
Conclusion
We are particularly pleased with another year of strong growth 
operationally and ﬁnancially. Long term ﬁnancing at competitive 
rates, combined with the strong cash ﬂows generated by the 
business give us both the conﬁdence and the opportunity to 
continue to return funds to shareholders by way of share buybacks 
and dividends.

Report on directors’ remuneration
The Remuneration Committee consists of John Hodson (Chairman), Nigel Wray, Dianne Thompson, Michael Shallow and Colin Halpern.  
It has the primary responsibility to review the performance of executive directors and similar employees and set the scale and structure
of their remuneration. The underpinning objective is to recruit, retain and motivate a top quality team of executive directors and senior
executives through a competitive remuneration structure, which provides incentives to deliver exceptional performance. This is achieved
through offering remuneration packages, which include salaries and bonuses benchmarked against similar companies and a long-term
incentive plan, which provides signiﬁcant reward for achieving stretching targets. These arrangements are described more fully below.
Service agreements
Stephen Hemsley, Lee Ginsberg and Christopher Moore have entered into service agreements with the Company, which are subject to twelve 
month’s notice by the Company. The remuneration packages consist of basic salary, pension contributions, health and life insurance beneﬁts  
and the use of a company car or cash equivalent allowance.
Colin Halpern is seconded to the Company from International Franchise System Inc. (“IFS”) as non-executive vice chairman under the
terms of a management agreement. The agreement is reviewed annually and the level of compensation paid to IFS agreed by the
Remuneration Committee.
The non-executive directors are appointed on three-year agreements with the Company terminable at one weeks notice. Fees for non-executive
directors are set by the Board.

During the period from the end of the ﬁnancial year to 19 February 2008, there have been no changes in directors’ shareholdings or their
interests in share options or reversionary interests.
Directors’ qualifying third party indemnity provisions
During the year the Company had in force an indemnity provision in favour of one or more directors of the Company, against liability in  
respect of proceedings brought by third parties, subject to the conditions set out in the Companies Act 1985. Such qualifying third party
indemnity provision remains in force as at the date of approving the directors’ report. 
Other signiﬁcant shareholders
Directors’ interests in the shares of the Company have been disclosed above. The other signiﬁcant shareholders holding more than 3% of
the shares in the Company, which have been disclosed to the Company are Standard Life Investments Limited which holds a 4.80% interest,  
Ogier Employee Beneﬁt Trustee Limited acting as trustee of the Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc Employee Beneﬁt Trust which holds a 4.07%  
interest and Moonpal Singh Grewal who is the beneﬁcial holder of a 4.48% interest. 
Share-based payment plans
In order to provide employee share incentives in the future the Group had previously adopted two share option schemes, one of which,
the Domino’s Pizza Group Limited (Unapproved) Share Option Scheme, has been in place since 30 March 1999. The Domino’s Pizza Share  
Option (Unapproved) Scheme was introduced on 24 November 1999. 
All participants in the Domino’s Pizza Group Limited (Unapproved) Share Option Scheme were, on admission of the Company to the Alternative 
Investment Market, offered the opportunity to release their options over shares in Domino’s Pizza Group Limited in return for equivalent options 
over ordinary shares in the Company under the Domino’s Pizza Share Option (Unapproved) Scheme. Further details of options outstanding at the 
year end are contained in note 31. 27
The Remuneration Committee has resolved that the exercise of these options which have been granted under the Share Option Schemes will
be subject to the condition that the growth in basic earnings per share (“EPS”) in any ﬁnancial year between grant and vesting exceeds the
growth in the Retail Price Index (“RPI”) in the previous ﬁnancial year by at least 5%.
On 23 March 2004 the Company established the Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc 2003 Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme. Under the scheme 
the Company can grant options to eligible full time employees. The options are only exercisable if the growth in the Company’s EPS during a 
performance year exceeds the growth in RPI during that performance year by at least 5%. The EMI options lapse after 10 years or in certain
other circumstances connected with leaving the Company. For details of the options granted and outstanding see note 31.
The Employee Beneﬁt Trust also operates a long-term incentive plan under which senior executives may be incentivised by the grant to them  
of reversionary interests over a portion of the assets of the trust. These interests are capable of vesting after certain stipulated performance
criteria have been reached (detailed in the Report on Directors’ Remuneration and note 32 – Share-based payment plans). 
On 29 December 2005 the Group introduced a Sharesave scheme giving employees the option to acquire shares in the Company. Employees  
have the option to save an amount per month up to a maximum of £250 and at the end of three years they have the option to purchase shares
in the Company or to take their savings in cash.
Company share buyback programme
During the year the Company continued its programme of buying back its own shares. A total of 3,725,000 (2006: 5,759,827) shares of 1.56p each 
were purchased during the year at a total cost of £8,210,000 (2006: £9,989,000) before expenses of £136,000 (2006: £172,000). This represented
2.3% (2006: 3.5%) of the issued shares of the Company at 30 December 2007. The reason for the purchase of these shares is that the Company
has generated surplus cash and this is being returned to shareholders in the form of a progressive dividend policy and share buybacks. These 
shares have been cancelled and no longer form part of the Company’s issued share capital.
Creditor payment policy 
It is the Group’s policy that payments to suppliers are made in accordance with those terms and conditions agreed between the Group and its 
suppliers, provided that all trading terms and conditions have been complied with. At 30 December 2007, the Group had an average of 21 days
(2006: 18 days) purchases outstanding in trade creditors. 
Corporate governance
The Company is supportive of the principles embodied in the Combined Code prepared and published by the Committee on Corporate Governance
in June 2003, although the rules of the Stock Exchange do not require companies that have securities trading on the Alternative Investment Market 
to formally comply with the Combined Code. The directors have taken note of its provisions insofar as they consider them appropriate to the 
Company and as a result does not fully comply with the revised code. At present the main facets are:
  The Board - at the year end the Company had three executive and ﬁve non-executive directors. The directors hold regular board meetings at 
which operating and ﬁnancial reports are considered. The Board is responsible for formulating, reviewing and approving the Group’s strategy, 
budgets, and major items of capital expenditure and senior personnel appointments.
  Audit Committee - which consists of Michael Shallow (Chairman), Colin Halpern and John Hodson. It meets at least twice each year and is 
responsible for ensuring that the ﬁnancial performance of the Group is properly reported on and monitored, for meeting the auditors and 
reviewing the reports from the auditors relating to the ﬁnancial statements and internal control systems. 
  Remuneration Committee - which consists of John Hodson (Chairman), Nigel Wray, Dianne Thompson, Michael Shallow and Colin Halpern.  
It meets at least twice each year and has a primary responsibility to review the performance of executive directors and senior employees
and set the scale and structure of their remuneration having due regard to the interests of shareholders.
  Going Concern - the directors are satisﬁed that the Group has adequate resources to continue in existence for the foreseeable future and
for this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
  Internal Control - the directors have overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group maintains internal controls to provide reasonable
assurance on the reliability of the ﬁnancial information used within the business and for safeguarding the assets. There are limitations in
any system of internal controls and accordingly, even the most effective system can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance  
with respect to preparation of the ﬁnancial information and the safeguarding of the assets.
The key elements of internal and ﬁnancial controls are as follows:
  Control Environment - the presence of a clear organisational structure and well-deﬁned lines of responsibility and delegation of appropriate
levels of authority.

During 2006, the Special Olympics replaced the successful two-year association with Make-A-Wish Foundation
®
 UK as the Group’s new charity 
of choice. The Special Olympics is a voluntary organisation, which specialises in year-round, local-level sports training for people with learning 
disabilities as well as local, national and international competition. 
The Group is involved with two separate charities, Special Olympics GB and Special Olympics Ireland, in order to create opportunities for 
involvement by team members, right across the system. This is the ﬁrst time both the UK and Ireland have adopted the same charity of choice. 
During 2007 the Group donated a lump sum of £21,000 to Special Olympics GB and £10,000 to Special Olympics Ireland.

Independent auditor’s report 
to the members of Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc
We have audited the group ﬁnancial statements of Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc for the year ended 30 December 2007, which comprise the
Group Income Statement, the Group Balance Sheet, the Group Statement of Changes in Equity and the Group Cash Flow Statement and
the related notes 1 to 36. These group ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company ﬁnancial statements of Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc for the year ended 30 December 2007. 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work  
has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report  
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company  
and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable
United Kingdom law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the group ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and whether the group ﬁnancial statements 
have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in 
the directors’ report is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements. The information given in the directors’ report includes that speciﬁc information 
presented in the Chief Executive’s Report and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer’s Review that is cross referred from the Review of the Business section of  
the directors’ report. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information 
speciﬁed by law regarding director’s remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited group ﬁnancial statements.  
The other information comprises only the directors’ report, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Report and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer’s 
Review. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the  
group ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit 
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the group ﬁnancial statements. It also includes an 
assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the group ﬁnancial statements, and of whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us  
with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the group ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the group 
ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion :
  the group ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the group’s 
affairs as at 30 December 2007 and of its proﬁt for the year then ended; 
 the group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
 the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the group ﬁnancial statements.

1. AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH IFRS
The ﬁnancial statements of Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) for the year ended 30 December 2007 were authorised
for issue by the board of directors on 19 February 2008 and the balance sheet was signed on the board’s behalf by Stephen Hemsley and  
Lee Ginsberg. Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc is a public limited company (“Company”) incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies
Act 1985 (registration number 03853545). The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom and its registered address is Domino’s House, 
Lasborough Road, Kingston, Milton Keynes, MK10 0AB. The Company’s Ordinary Shares are traded on the Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”). 
The Group’s ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by  
the European Union as they apply to the ﬁnancial statements of the Group for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2007.
The principle accounting policies adopted by the Group are set out in note 2.
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The Group’s ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the 
European Union as they apply to the ﬁnancial statements of the Group for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2007 and applied in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985. The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the ﬁnancial statements for the
52 weeks ended 30 December 2007.
This is the ﬁrst ﬁnancial year in which the Group ﬁnancial statements of Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc have been prepared in accordance with IFRS
and the comparative amounts for 2006 have been restated from UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP) to comply with IFRS.
In the interim report for the 26 weeks to 1 July 2007 the Group incorporated its preliminary IFRS ﬁnancial statements for 2006 and the reconciliations 
to IFRS from the previously published UK GAAP ﬁnancial statements; these are repeated in the appendix on pages 71 – 76.
The Group ﬁnancial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds (£000) except when
otherwise indicated.
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that effect the amounts reported for assets and 
liabilities as at balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year. The nature of estimation means that actual 
outcomes could differ from those estimates.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key source of estimation uncertainty that has a signiﬁcant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the next ﬁnancial year is the estimation of share-based payment costs. The estimation of share-based payment costs requires the selection
of an appropriate valuation model, consideration as to the inputs necessary for the valuation model chosen and the estimation of the number of 
awards that will ultimately vest, inputs for which arise from judgments relating to the probability of meeting non-market performance conditions 
and the continuing participation of employees.
Basis of consolidation
The full year consolidated ﬁnancial statements incorporate the results and net assets of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 
the nearest Sunday to 31 December each year. The interim results are prepared for the ﬁrst 26 weeks of the relevant full period.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated 
until the date that such control ceases. Control comprises the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies of the investee so as to obtain 
beneﬁt from its activities and is achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting rights; currently exercisable or convertible potential voting 
rights; or by way of contractual agreement. The ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company and are based on consistent accounting policies. All inter-company transactions 
and balances between Group entities, including unrealised proﬁts arising from them, are eliminated upon consolidation.
Minority interests represent the portion of proﬁt and loss and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and is presented separately 
within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from parent shareholders’ equity.
Interests in associates
The Group’s interests in its associates, being those entities over which it has signiﬁcant inﬂuence and which are neither subsidiaries nor joint 
ventures, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, the investment in an associate is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post acquisition changes in the Group’s share of 
net assets of the associate, less distributions received and less any impairment in value of individual investments. The Group’s income statement 
reﬂects the Group’s share of the associate’s results after tax. The Group statement of changes in equity reﬂects the Group’s share of any income and 
expense recognised by the associate outside proﬁt and loss.
Notes to the group ﬁnancial statements 
At 30 December 2007 37
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associate, representing the excess of the cost of the investment compared to the Group’s share of the 
net fair value of the associate’s identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, is included in the carrying amount of the associate and is not 
amortised. To the extent that the net fair value of the associate’s identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the cost of the 
investment, a gain is recognised and added to the Group’s share of the associate’s proﬁt or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.
Financial statements of associates are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. Where necessary, adjustments are made to bring the 
accounting policies used in line with those of the Group; to take into account fair values assigned at the date of acquisition and to reﬂect impairment 
losses where appropriate. Adjustments are also made in the Group’s ﬁnancial statements to eliminate the Group’s share of unrealised gains and 
losses on transactions between the Group and its associates.
Foreign currencies 
Foreign operations
The income and expenses of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the average rate of exchange ruling during the year. The balance sheet of  
the overseas subsidiary undertaking is translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences
arising, if any, are included within equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as  
income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed.
The Group has utilised the exemption available in IFRS 1 whereby cumulative translation differences are deemed to be zero at the date of transition 
to IFRS.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the 
initial transactions. 
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences 
arising on translation are recognised in the income statement for the period.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identiﬁable  
net assets and contingent liabilities of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognised as an asset on the Group’s balance 
sheet in the year in which it arises and is not amortised. Any goodwill asset arising on the acquisition of equity accounted entities is included within 
the cost of those entities.
Goodwill is recognised on the purchase of further minority interests under the parent entity extension method, whereby the entire difference 
between the cost of the additional interest in the subsidiary and the minority interest’s share of the assets and liabilities reﬂected in the consolidated 
balance sheet at the date of the acquisition of the minority interest is reﬂected as goodwill.
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment, 
at least annually and more frequently if events or changes indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored by management, usually at business 
segment level or statutory company level as the case may be. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying 
amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the unit, 
or of an operation within it.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2006 (the date of transition to IFRS) has been recorded at its carrying amount under UK GAAP , 
subject to being tested for impairment at that date. 
Intangible assets
Computer software
Computer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment loss. Externally acquired computer software and software 
licences are capitalised at the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the speciﬁc software. Internally developed computer software programs 
are capitalised to the extent that costs can be separately identiﬁed and attributed to particular software programs, measured reliably, and that the 
asset developed can be shown to generate future economic beneﬁts. These assets are considered to have ﬁnite useful lives and are amortised on a 
straight line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of each of the assets, considered to be between three and ﬁve years.
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not 
be recoverable. 38
Notes to the group ﬁnancial statements 
At 30 December 2007
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment in value. Cost comprises  
the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset and includes costs directly attributable to making 
the asset capable of operating as intended. 
Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost of the assets to their residual values, on a straight-line method on the following bases:
– Freehold buildings and leasehold properties – 50 years, or the lease term if shorter.
– Plant, equipment, ﬁxtures and ﬁttings and motor vehicles – at rates varying from 10% to 50%.
– Leasehold building improvements – over the life of the lease.
– Freehold land is not depreciated.
Land and buildings under construction and non current assets held for sale are not depreciated.
The assets’ residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate on an annual basis. An item of 
property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic beneﬁts are expected from its use or disposal. Any  
gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset) is included in the income statement in the year that the asset is derecognised.
All property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, when there are indications that  
the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Prepaid short leasehold costs
Prepaid short lease hold property costs are classiﬁed as non-current prepayments. On initial recognition these assets are held at cost and 
subsequently at amortised cost over the length of the lease.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets are classiﬁed as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through sales rather than continuing use. This condition 
is regarded as met if a sale is expected to materialise within twelve months after the balance sheet date and the asset is available for immediate 
disposal in its present condition. Non-current assets classiﬁed as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs 
to sell. After classiﬁcation as assets held for sale, no further depreciation is provided for on the assets. 
Leases
Group as lessee
Leases are classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.
All other leases are classiﬁed as operating leases.
Assets held as ﬁnance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments during the lease term at the inception of the lease. Lease payments are apportioned between the reduction of the lease liability and 
ﬁnance charges in the income statement so as to achieve a constant rate of interest in the remaining balance of the liability. Assets held under 
ﬁnance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the assets and the lease term.
Assets leased under operating leases are not recorded on the balance sheet. Rental payments are charged directly to the income statement. Lease 
incentives, primarily up-front cash payments or rent-free periods, are capitalised and spread over the period of the lease term. Payments made to 
acquire operating leases are treated as prepaid lease expenses and amortised over the life of the lease.
Group as lessor
Assets leased out under operating leases are included in property, plant and equipment and depreciated over their useful lives. Rental income, 
including the effect of lease incentives, is recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Where the Group transfers substantially all the risks and beneﬁts of ownership of the asset, the arrangement is classiﬁed as a ﬁnance lease and a 
receivable is recognised for the initial direct costs of the lease and the present value of the minimum lease payments. As payments fall due, ﬁnance 
income is recognised in the income statement so as to achieve a constant rate of return on the remaining net investment in the lease.
Impairment of assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or when 
annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount 
is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless 
the asset does not generate cash inﬂows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of 
an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, 
the estimated future cash ﬂows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the asset. Impairment losses on continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those 
expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset. 39
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer 
exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed 
only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.  
If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal
is recognised in proﬁt or loss. After such a reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s revised carrying 
amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, for which it is probable that an outﬂow 
of economic beneﬁt will be required to settle the obligation and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably measured. 
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a ﬁrst in, ﬁrst out basis. Net realisable value is based on 
estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred to disposal.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables, which generally have 7 – 28 days terms, are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable 
amount. Provision is made when it is likely that the balance will not be recovered in full. Balances are written off when the probability of recovery
is considered remote.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three 
months or less.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at fair
value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in ﬁnance revenue and 
ﬁnance cost.
Income taxes
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and 
laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the tax bases and the 
accounting bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is calculated on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the
period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences, with the following exceptions:
  where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting proﬁt nor taxable proﬁt or loss;
 in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future; 
and
 deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁt will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or losses can be utilised. 
Income tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the 
income tax is also dealt with in equity. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and 
liabilities and the deferred tax relates to income taxes levied by the same tax jurisdiction on either the same taxable entity, or on different taxable 
entities which intend to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously in each 
future period in which signiﬁcant amounts of deferred tax liabilities are expected to be settled or recovered. 40
Notes to the group ﬁnancial statements 
At 30 December 2007
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Derecognition of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities
A ﬁnancial asset or liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Where an existing ﬁnancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability 
are substantially modiﬁed, such an exchange or modiﬁcation is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new 
liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in proﬁt or loss.
Pensions
The Group contributes to the personal pension plans of certain staff. The contributions are charged as an expense as they fall due. Any contributions 
unpaid at the balance sheet date are included as an accrual at that date. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have 
been paid.
Treasury shares
Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc shares held by the Group are classiﬁed in shareholders’ equity as “treasury shares” and are recognised at cost. 
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the  
original cost being taken to revenue reserves except that where the proceeds exceed the consideration paid then the excess is transferred to
the share premium account. No gain or loss is recognised on the purchase, sale issue or cancellation of equity shares.
The Employee Beneﬁt Trust has waived its entitlement to dividends. The Group will meet the expenses of the trust as and when they fall due.
Revenue recognition
Revenue consists and is recognised as follows:
Pizza delivery – on delivery of pizzas to franchisee customers
Commissary and equipment sales – on delivery to franchisees
Royalties (based on system sales) – on delivery of pizzas by franchisees to customers
Franchise fee income for initial services –  recognised when the services have been substantially performed which is on commencement
of franchisee trading
Finance lease interest income – as set out in lease accounting policy
Rental income on leasehold properties – on a straight line basis in accordance with the lease terms
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic beneﬁts will ﬂow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration net of returns, rebates and value-added taxes.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are generally expensed as incurred. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of an asset
are capitalised while the asset is being constructed as part of the cost of that asset.
The policy is adopted for all assets that meet the deﬁnition of qualifying assets under the standard.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs should commence when:
 expenditures for the asset and borrowing costs are being incurred; and
 activities necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use are in progress.
Capitalisation ceases when the asset is substantially ready for its intended use. If active development is interrupted for an extended period, 
capitalisation is suspended. When construction occurs piecemeal and use of each part is possible as construction continues, capitalisation for
each part ceases on substantial completion of that part.
For borrowing associated with a speciﬁc asset, the actual rate on that borrowing is used. Otherwise, a weighted average cost of borrowings is used. 
Exceptional items
The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement, those material items of income and expense which, because of the 
nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better the 
elements of ﬁnancial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess better trends in ﬁnancial performance.
Share based payments
The Group provides beneﬁts to employees (including Directors) in the form of share based payment transactions, whereby employees render 
services in exchange for rights over shares (“equity-settled transactions”). The cost of the equity-settled transactions with employees and Directors 
are measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which 
ends on the date at which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award. Fair values of employee share option plans are calculated 
using the Black-Scholes and Binomial models. In valuing equity settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than 
conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company (market conditions). 41
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are 
treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisﬁed, provided that all other performance conditions are satisﬁed.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and 
the Directors’ best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest on achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions or in 
the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vested as described above. The movement in the cumulative expense since 
the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with the corresponding increase in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modiﬁed or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost based on 
the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period. In addition, an expense is recognised over the remainder of the 
new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modiﬁcation, based on the difference between the fair value of the original award and the 
fair value of the modiﬁed award, both as measured on the date of the modiﬁcation. No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in the income 
statement for the award is expensed immediately. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date  
is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement. The Group has taken advantage of  
the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 in respect of equity-settled awards so as to apply IFRS 2 only to those equity-settled awards granted after
7 November 2002 that had not vested before 3 January 2005.
New standards and Interpretations not applied
During the year, the IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these  
ﬁnancial statements:
International Accounting Standards (IAS / IFRS)  Effective date
IFRS 8 – Operating segments 1 January 2009
IAS 23 – Borrowing cost (revised) 1 January 2009
IAS 27 – (Revised) Consolidations 1 July 2009
IFRS 3 – (Revised) Business combinations  1 July 2009
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC)
IFRIC 11 – IFRS 2 group and treasury share transactions *  1 March 2007
IFRIC 12 – Service concession arrangements * 1 January 2008
IFRIC 13 – Customer Loyalty Programmes *  1 July 2008
IFRIC 14 – Limit on Deﬁned Beneﬁt Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their interaction * 1 January 2008
* Not yet adopted by the European Union
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Group’s ﬁnancial 
statements in the period of application.
Upon adoption of IFRS 8, the Group will be required to disclose ﬁnancial and descriptive information about its reportable segments. Whilst the 
criteria used to identify the reportable segments differs from that currently applied in accordance with IAS 14, there will be no effect on reported 
income or net assets.
The revisions to IFRS 3 and IAS 27 will impact the way in which acquisitions of minority interests are accounted for that will impact the amount of 
goodwill recognised, the results in the period that an acquisition occurs and future revenues reported. However the size of minority interest 
transactions are not signiﬁcant to the results of the Group.

Recognised below operating proﬁt
Proﬁt on the sale of subsidiary undertakings
During the 2005 ﬁnancial year the Group sold two subsidiary undertakings, DPGS Limited and Triple A Pizza Limited (which included 12 corporate 
stores at the date of the transaction). As a result of this transaction, certain legal and property provisions were made (see note 28).

During the year partial resolution relating to the conditions for the provisions made in relation to the sale of the subsidiary undertakings was 
reached and as a result £58,000 (2006: £454,000) of the provisions created have been released. These are reported in the proﬁt on sale of subsidiary 
undertakings line on the income statement. 
Proﬁt on the sale of non current assets and assets held for sale
The Group disposed of its subsidiary undertaking, DP Newcastle & Sunderland Limited in June 2007, generating a proﬁt of £279,000. The gain in 
respect of this disposal will be chargeable to corporation tax at the statutory rate of 30%.
In addition the Group sold one (2006: three) corporate store resulting in a proﬁt of £6,000 (2006: £159,000). The gain in respect of this disposal
will be chargeable to corporation tax at the statutory rate of 30%.

During the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2007 the Group’s IFRS 2 charge relating to reversionary interests in ordinary shares granted in 2004 has 
increased as the performance targets set are forecast to be achieved earlier than expected, resulting in an accelerated charge of £174,000 (2006: £nil).
This charge was not and will not become deductible for taxation purposes (note 11). This charge had no impact on the cash ﬂow of the Group
during the period.

(c) Temporary differences associated with Group investments
At 30 December 2007, there was no recognised deferred tax liability (2006: nil) for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of the 
Group’s subsidiaries, or its associates, as:
 there are no corporation tax consequences of the Group’s UK subsidiaries or associates paying dividends to their parent companies; and 
  the Group has determined that undistributed proﬁts of its Irish subsidiary will not be distributed in the foreseeable future. The temporary 
difference associated with the investment in the Group’s Irish subsidiary, for which deferred tax has not been recognised aggregate to £3,340,000 
(2006: £1,816,000).
There are no income tax consequences for the Group attaching to the payment of dividends by the Group to its shareholders.

12. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing proﬁt for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the proﬁt attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would have been issued
on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

Earnings per share before exceptional items
The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement, those material items of income and expense which, because
of the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand
better the elements of ﬁnancial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess better the trends in  
ﬁnancial performance.
To this end, basic and diluted earnings from continuing operations per share is also presented on this basis and using the weighted average  
number of shares for both basic and diluted amounts as per the table above. The amounts for earnings per share from continuing operations
before exceptional items are as follows:

Franchisee fees consist of costs relating to the Master Franchise Agreement (“MFA”) with Dominos Pizza Inc and are written off over the term  
of the franchise agreement. The MFA is renewable on a 10 year basis.
As from 1 January 2006, the date of transition to IFRS, goodwill was no longer amortised but is now subject to annual impairment testing
(see note 16).
16. IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF GOODWILL 
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated for impairment testing purposes to cash generating units considered to be at an 
individual store level. This represents the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The recoverable amount of the stores has been determined based on net realisable value, on the grounds that this value exceeded the value in
use calculation.
Net realisable value is based on the average weekly sales of the stores at a multiple range of 30 – 40 less disposal costs. The multiple is based on
the average multiple applicable to the latest 10 stores sold in the franchise community. The multiple is calculated by dividing the sale price of the 
store by the 52-week average weekly sales prior to the sale of the store.  54

given by the Company, DPG Holdings Limited and Domino’s Pizza Group limited. This overdraft facility was repaid during the 2007 ﬁnancial year.
Bank revolving facility
The Group has entered into an agreement to obtain a revolving credit facility from Barclays Bank plc. The limit for this facility is £6,000,000.
The facility is repayable within 3 – 12 months and interest is charged at 0.50% per annum above LIBOR. The facility is secured by share pledges, 
constituting ﬁrst ﬁxed charges over the shares of DPG Holdings Limited and Domino’s Pizza Group Limited as well as negative pledges given  
by the Company, DPG Holdings Limited and Domino’s Pizza Group Limited. 
Bank loans
The Group has entered into an agreement to obtain bank loans and mortgage facilities. These are secured by a ﬁxed and ﬂoating charge over the 
Group’s assets and an unlimited guarantee provided by the Company. At 30 December 2007 the balance due under these facilities was £ 7,721,000 
(2006: £7,500,000) all of which is in relation to the Employee Beneﬁt Trust. During the ﬁnancial year, the terms of this loan were renegotiated and 
transferred from National Westminster Bank plc to Barclays Bank plc. The loan bears interest at 0.50% (2006: 0.625% above National Westminster 
Bank plc base rate) above LIBOR. The loan has a term of 7 years and matures on 31 January 2014. 
Other loans
The remaining loans are repayable in equal instalments over a period of up to 5 years and these loans are unsecured. The interest rate on these 
loans is ﬁxed at an average of 8.5% (2006: 8.2%).

27. OBLIGATIONS UNDER LEASES AND HIRE PURCHASE CONTRACTS (continued)
Operating lease commitments where the Group is lessee
For the stores in the franchisee system, the Group has entered into commercial leases, taking the head lease, and then subletting the properties to 
the franchisees. These leases have an average duration of between 10 and 25 years. Under the terms of the franchise agreement the franchisee is 
granted an initial period of 10 years to operate a Domino’s Pizza delivery store under the Domino’s system. Under the agreement the franchisee also 
has the option to renew for a further 10 years at the end of the initial period, provided at the time of the renewal the franchisee is not in default of 
any material provision of the franchise agreement. In addition the Group has entered into commercial leases on motor vehicles and items of plant, 
machinery and equipment. These leases have an average duration of between 3 and 5 years. Only the property lease agreements contain an option 
for renewal, with such options being exercisable three months before the expiry of the lease term at rentals based on market prices at the time of 
exercise. There are no restrictions placed upon the lessee by entering into these leases.
Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:
At At
30 December 31 December 
2007 2006
£000 £000
Not later than one year 10,070 9,233

Operating lease commitments where the Group is lessor
For the stores in the franchisee system, the Group has entered into commercial leases, taking the head lease, and then subletting the properties to 
the franchisees. These non-cancellable leases have remaining terms of between 5 and 10 years. All leases include a provision for ﬁve-yearly rent 
reviews according to prevailing market conditions.
Future minimum rentals receivable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:

Legal provisions
The legal provisions relate to fees charged in relation to the disposal of subsidiary undertakings as well as outstanding litigation matters arising on 
the sale of stores. The outcome of the litigation is at present uncertain, and a ﬁnal decision is not imminently expected. No estimate of the likely 
outcome of the litigation can yet be made by the directors, but full provision for the potential costs likely to be incurred has been made.
Property provisions
The property provisions relate to outstanding rent reviews, rates, service charges and dilapidation costs for stores sold as part of the sale of 
subsidiary undertakings during prior years. The completion of the outstanding rent and rates reviews vary depending on the lease and on average 
are resolved within 1 – 3 years following the review dates stipulated in the leases. The dilapidation costs are determined at the end of the lease. 
During the year resolution was reached on various of the outstanding items relating to the property provisions, resulting in the release of provisions 
held at the beginning of the year. 60
Notes to the group ﬁnancial statements 
At 30 December 2007
29. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
The Group’s ﬁnancial risk management objectives consist of identifying and monitoring those risks, which have an adverse impact on the value  
of the Group’s ﬁnancial assets and liabilities or on reported proﬁtability and on the cash ﬂows of the Group.
The Group’s principal ﬁnancial liabilities comprise bank loans, bank overdrafts, other loans and ﬁnance leases. The Group has various ﬁnancial 
assets such as trade receivables and cash and short-term deposits, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group has not entered into any derivative transactions such as interest rate swaps or ﬁnancial foreign currency contracts.
It is, and has been throughout 2007 and 2006 the Group’s policy that no trading in derivatives shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments are credit risk, price risk, liquidity risk and cash ﬂow interest rate risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below. In view of the low level of foreign currency 
transactions the Board does not consider there to be any signiﬁcant foreign currency risks.
Credit risk
Due to the nature of customers who trade on credit terms, being predominantly franchisees, the franchisee selection process is sufﬁciently robust
to ensure an appropriate credit veriﬁcation procedure.
In addition, trade debtor balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not signiﬁcant. Since 
the Group trades only with franchisees that have been subject to the franchisee selection process and provide personal guarantees as required 
under the franchisee agreements, there is no requirement for collateral.
Price risk
The Board considers that the Group’s exposure to changing market prices on the values of ﬁnancial instruments does not have a signiﬁcant impact 
on the carrying value of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities. As such no speciﬁc policies are applied currently, although the Board will continue to monitor 
the level of price risk and its exposure should the need occur.
Liquidity risk
The Group aims to mitigate liquidity risk by managing cash generation by its operations with cash collection targets set throughout the Group. 
All major investment decisions are considered by the Board as part of the project appraisal and approval process. In this way the Group aims to 
maintain a good credit rating to facilitate fund raising.
The table below summarises the maturity proﬁle of the Group’s ﬁnancial liabilities at 30 December 2007 based on contractual undiscounted payments.

Interest rate risk
The Board has a policy of ensuring a mix of ﬁxed and ﬂoating rate borrowings. Whilst ﬁxed rate interest bearing debt is not exposed to cash ﬂow 
interest rate risk, there is no opportunity for the Group to beneﬁt from a reduction in borrowing costs when market rates are declining. Conversely, 
whilst ﬂoating rate borrowings are not exposed to changes in fair value, the Group is exposed to cash ﬂow interest rate risk as costs increase if 
market rates rise. 61

Interest rate risk table
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, which all other variables held constant, of the 
Group’s proﬁt before tax (through the impact on ﬂoating rate borrowings). There is no impact on the Group’s equity.

Capital management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it remains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to 
support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital 
structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. No changes were made 
in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 30 December 2007 and 31 December 2006. 
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total capital plus net debt. The Group includes within net debt, 
interest bearing loans and borrowings, bank revolving facilities, less cash and cash equivalents. Capital consists of the equity attributable to the 
equity holders of the parent less the treasury share reserve.

On 24 November 1999 participants in the Domino’s Pizza Group Limited (Unapproved) Share Option Scheme (which had been in place since  
31 March 1999) had the option of exchanging options over shares in Domino’s Pizza Group Limited in return for equivalent options over ordinary 
shares in the Company under the Domino’s Pizza Share Option (Unapproved) Scheme. 
On 23 March 2004, the Company established the Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme (EMI Scheme). Under
the scheme 1,539,200 options were granted at 64.53p, the market price on the date of the grant. The options are only exercisable if the growth
in the Company’s EPS during a performance year exceeds the growth in RPI during that performance year by at least 5%. The EMI options lapse 
after 10 years or in certain other circumstances connected with leaving the Company.
In respect of all outstanding options under these schemes, options may be exercised as follows:
One year after date of grant – maximum 1/3 of options held
Two years after date of grant – maximum 2/3 of options held
Three years after date of grant – in full
The options expire 10 years after the date granted. 
Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc Employee Beneﬁt Trust is established for the beneﬁt of employees. The trust holds and deals in the Company’s shares 
under two share incentive schemes. These are the Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc 2003 Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme and the Domino’s  
Pizza Share Option (Unapproved) Scheme, under which the Company may grant options over ordinary shares to eligible full time employees.
In addition the Group has a Sharesave scheme giving employees the option to acquire shares in the Company. Employees have the option to save 
an amount per month up to a maximum of £250 and at the end of three years they have the option to purchase shares in the Company or to take 
their savings in cash.
The Employee Beneﬁt Trust also operates a long-term incentive plan under which senior executives may be incentivised by the grant to them of 
reversionary interests over a portion of the assets of the trust. During the year further reversionary interests were granted over 5,200,000 (2006: 
3,520,000) shares. At 30 December 2007, the Trust held 6,609,878 (2006: 6,609,878) shares, which had a historic cost of £4,402,810 (2006: £4,215,810). 
These shares had a market value at 30 December 2007 of £11,352,465 (2006: £12,310,900).
At 30 December 2007 reversionary interests over 11,632,000 (2006: 6,640,000) shares in Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc have been granted. Further
details are contained in the Report on Director’s Remuneration. 65
32. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The expense recognised for share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the year to 30 December 2007 is £880,000
(2006: £344,000). This all arises on equity settled share-based payment transactions.
Long Term Senior Executive Incentive Plan
Reversionary interests over assets held in the Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc employee beneﬁt trust are approved and granted, at the discretion of
the trustees, to senior executives. The interests are capable of vesting within a ﬁve year period should certain performance targets be achieved
by the Group.
The following table lists the performance criteria attached to the reversionary interests granted and not vested:

11,632,000
The contractual life of each interest is 5 years.
The trustees have undertaken to ensure that where possible the fair value of reversionary interests, which may be equity-settled, is estimated as at 
the date of granting using a Black Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which they were granted. The following table 
lists the inputs to the model used for the valuations in 2006 and 2007:
2007 2006
Dividend yield (%) 3.8 3.8
Expected volatility (%) 15.0 – 20.0 17.0
Historical volatility – 250 day (%) 18.8 – 24.1 27.3
Risk-free interest rate (%) 5.3 – 5.8 4.4 – 4.8
Expected life of reversionary interests (years) 4.0 3.9 – 4.1
Weighted average exercise price (pence)  210.00p 130.16 – 151.56
Weighted average share price (pence)  210.00p 130.16 – 151.56
The expected life of the reversionary interests is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reﬂects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual 
outcome. No other features of options were incorporated into the measurement of fair value, and non-market conditions have not been included in 
calculating the fair value.
The weighted average fair value of each reversionary interest granted during the year was 32.0p (2006: 20.0p). 
For further details regarding the reversionary interests granted and outstanding, see the Report on Directors’ Remuneration.
Employee Share-option
All other employees are eligible for grants of options, which are approved by the Board.
The options vest over a 3 year period and are exercisable subject to the condition that the growth in basic earnings per share in any ﬁnancial year 
between grant and vesting exceeds the growth in the Retail Price Index in the previous ﬁnancial year by at least 5% (see note 31 for further details).
The contractual life of each option granted is 10 years. There are no cash settlement alternatives and all awards are equity settled. 66
Notes to the group ﬁnancial statements 
At 30 December 2007
32. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (continued)
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted, for the EMI and Domino’s Pizza (unapproved) schemes, is estimated as at the date of granting 
using a Black Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The following table lists the inputs 
to the model used for the valuations for the Domino’s Pizza (unapproved) schemes in 2007:
        2007
Dividend yield (%) 3.8
Expected volatility (%) 20.0
Historical volatility – 250 day (%) 26.7
Risk-free interest rate (%) 5.3
Expected life of reversionary interests (years) 4.0
Weighted average exercise price (pence)  210.00p
Weighted average share price (pence)  210.00p
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reﬂects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual 
outcome. No other features of options were incorporated into the measurement of fair value, and non-market conditions have not been included in 
calculating the fair value.
There were 1,090,536 options granted on 30 March 2007. The weighted average fair value of each option granted in 2007 was 28.1p.
Sharesave scheme
During 2005 the Group introduced a Sharesave scheme giving employees the option to acquire shares in the Company. Employees have the option 
to save an amount per month up to a maximum of £250 and at the end of three years they have the option to purchase shares in the Company or to 
take their savings in cash.
The contractual life of the scheme is 3 years. The fair value of equity-settled options granted, is estimated as at the date of granting using a Binomial 
model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The following table lists the inputs to the model used for 
the valuations for the Sharesave scheme in 2005:
        2005
Dividend yield (%) 3.75
Expected volatility (%) 17.0
Historical volatility – 250 day (%) 28.1
Risk-free interest rate (%) 4.2
Expected life of reversionary interests (years) 3.3
Weighted average exercise price (pence)  75.88
Weighted average share price (pence)  75.88
The expected life of the options is based on an average of exercise period, which is between 3 – 3.5 years.
The expected volatility reﬂects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual 
outcome. No other features of options were incorporated into the measurement of fair value, and non-market conditions have not been included in 
calculating the fair value.
There were no options granted in the year. The weighted average fair value of each option granted in 2005 was 20.6p.  67

appendices 71
Appendix to the group annual report and accounts 
reporting under international ﬁnancial reporting standards
These ﬁnancial statements are the ﬁrst to be prepared by the Company 
using policies in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European 
Union. The comparative ﬁgures have been prepared on the same basis 
and have therefore been restated from those previously prepared under 
UK GAAP . The commentary below details the key changes that have 
arisen due to the transition to reporting under IFRS. The Group’s date of 
transition is 1 January 2006, which is the beginning of the comparative 
period for the 2007 ﬁnancial year. Therefore the opening balance sheet 
for IFRS purposes is that reported at 1 January 2006, as amended for 
changes due to IFRS.
To explain the impact of the transition, reconciliations have been 
included in this appendix that show the changes made to the 
statements previously reported under UK GAAP . The following 
reconciliations are included in this appendix:
1. Reconciliation of Group balance sheet at 1 January 2006 from
UK GAAP to IFRS.
2. Reconciliation of Group balance sheet at 31 December 2006 from
UK GAAP to IFRS.
3. Reconciliation of Group income statement for the 52 weeks ended
31 December 2006 from UK GAAP to IFRS.
The transition from UK GAAP to IFRS does not affect the cash ﬂows 
generated by the Group. The IFRS cash ﬂow statement is presented in 
a different format than that required under UK GAAP . The reconciling 
items between the UK GAAP format and the IFRS format have no net 
impact on the cash ﬂows generated and accordingly reconciliations 
have not been presented.
The accounting policies used for IFRS are set out in note 2 of the
main report.
First time adoption
The Group has applied the provisions of IFRS 1 – First Time Adoption of 
International Financial Reporting Standards which, generally, requires 
that IFRS accounting policies be applied retrospectively in determining 
the opening balance sheet at the date of transition. IFRS 1 contains both 
mandatory and optional exemptions to the principle of retrospective 
application. Where the Group has made use of an exemption it is
noted below.
The Group has taken the following exemptions:
 Share based payments
The Group operates a number of executive and employee share 
schemes. For all grants of share options and awards the fair value 
at the date of grant is calculated using an appropriate pricing model 
and the corresponding expense is recognised over the vesting 
period. The Group has elected to take advantage of the transitional 
provisions of IFRS 2 and has applied the fair value model to all grants 
of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested as 
at 3 January 2005.
 Goodwill and business combinations
The Group has taken the exemption not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively 
to business combinations occurring prior to the date of transition 
to IFRS. Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to this date has been 
retained at its carrying value as at 1 January 2006. The Group under 
the provisions of IAS 36, only recognises impairment. This results in 
the reversal of the goodwill amortisation previously charged to the 
income statement in the 52 weeks to 31 December 2006.
 Cumulative translation differences
Under IAS 21, exchange differences arising on consolidation of 
overseas subsidiaries are required to be recognised as a separate 
equity reserve. The Group has utilised the exemption available in 
IFRS 1 whereby cumulative translation differences are deemed to
be zero at the date of transition to IFRS.
  Use of fair value or revaluation as deemed cost of property, plant 
and equipment, investment properties and certain intangible assets
The standard permits a ﬁrst-time adopter to measure an item in its 
opening balance sheet using an amount based on its deemed costs. 
The Group has taken advantage of this exemption and has adopted 
the historical cost as its deemed cost.
Descriptions of the reconciling items between UK GAAP and IFRS are 
listed below. The amounts of the reconciling items are detailed in tables 
set out beneath each of the reconciliations.
 Assets held for sale
As at date of transition and the comparative periods the Group 
owned various corporate stores, which met the criteria of assets, held 
for sale under IFRS 5. These have been reclassiﬁed to a separate line 
within total assets on the Group balance sheet.
 Intangible assets 
On transition, the Group following the provisions of IAS 36 has 
reclassiﬁed separately identiﬁable computer software assets from 
tangible assets to intangible assets.
 Prepaid operating lease costs 
The Group incurs costs in acquiring property leases. The Group 
previously treated these costs as additions to tangible ﬁxed assets, 
however under IAS 17 they are more correctly described as prepaid 
operating lease charges. Accordingly on transition these expenses 
are reclassiﬁed from tangible ﬁxed assets to prepaid lease charges. 
The charges are amortised over the lives of the operating leases on 
which they were incurred.
 Lease inducements 
The Group under UK GAAP recognised rent-free periods over 
the period to the commencement of the ﬁrst market rent review. 
According to provisions in SIC 15 lease incentives are spread over 
the full term of the lease. As at the date of transition, deferred
income reﬂecting the amount of lease inducements to be taken to 
the income statement in future periods has been recognised on the 
balance sheet.
 Employee beneﬁts 
Under IAS 19 the Group is required to recognise untaken holiday 
pay entitlements. The Group’s holiday year runs from January 
to December and therefore this provision will only impact on the 
Group’s interim accounts. At the year-end, the Group does not 
have an obligation to carry over to the next holiday year or to pay 
employees for untaken holiday.
 Deferred taxation 
On transition, the Group following the provisions of IAS 12 has 
recalculated the deferred tax balances based on the temporary 
method. The most signiﬁcant impact has been the recognition
of deferred tax assets relating to share based payments and roll
over relief.
 Goodwill
The Group has reclassiﬁed goodwill previously recognised under UK 
GAAP on the acquisition of a store as an intangible asset. This relates 
to the right that it had previously granted to the acquiree to use the 
Group’s trade name under a franchise agreement.  72

Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
in relation to the Company ﬁnancial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to prepare  
the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards
and applicable law). The ﬁnancial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the
proﬁt or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing those ﬁnancial statements, the directors are required to: 
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
  state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
ﬁnancial statements; and 
 prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the 
Company and to enable them to ensure that the Company ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Independent auditor’s report 
to the members of Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc
We have audited the parent company ﬁnancial statements of Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc for the year ended 30 December 2007, which
comprise the Company Balance Sheet and the related notes 1 to 10. These parent company ﬁnancial statements have been prepared
under the accounting policies set out therein. 
We have reported separately on the group ﬁnancial statements of Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc for the year ended 30 December 2007.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work  
has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report  
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company  
and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable
United Kingdom law and Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement
of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared  
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the directors’ report is  
consistent with the ﬁnancial statements. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent company ﬁnancial 
statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’ Report. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of  
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the parent company ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to
any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An 
audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the parent company ﬁnancial statements. It 
also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the parent company ﬁnancial 
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us  
with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent company ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in 
the parent company ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
 the parent company ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice,  
of the state of the company’s affairs as at 30 December 2007; 
 the parent company ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
 the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the parent company ﬁnancial statements.

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The parent company ﬁnancial statements of Dominos’s Pizza UK & IRL plc are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985.
The ﬁnancial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice. The balance sheet is presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (£000) except
where otherwise indicated.
No proﬁt and loss account is presented by the Company as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 and the Company has taken
the exemption under FRS 1 not to present a cash ﬂow statement.
Investments
Shares in subsidiary companies and ﬁxed asset investments are stated at cost less provisions for any impairment. Where shares have been
issued as part of the consideration for an acquisition these are accounted for at their nominal value in accordance with the exemption under 
Sections 131 and 133 of the Companies Act 1985. 
Provision is made against the carrying value of investments where there is impairment in value.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where
transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or right to pay less or to receive more, tax,
with the following exceptions:
 Provision is made for tax on gains from the revaluation (and similar fair value adjustments) of ﬁxed assets, or gains on disposal of ﬁxed assets 
that have been rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to dispose
of the assets concerned. However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely 
than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold.
 Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable 
proﬁts from which the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, 
based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Treasury shares
Treasury shares held by the Employee Beneﬁt Trust are classiﬁed in capital and reserves, as ‘Treasury shares held by Employee Beneﬁt Trust’ and 
recognised at cost. Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from 
sale and the original cost taken to revenue reserves except that where the proceeds exceed the consideration paid then the excess is transferred to 
the share premium account. No gain or loss is recognised on the purchase, sale issue or cancellation of equity shares.
The Employee Beneﬁt Trust has waived its entitlement to dividends. 
Share-based payment transactions
Directors of the Company receive an element of remuneration in the form of share based payment transactions, whereby employees render
services as consideration for equity instruments.
The awards vest when certain performance and/or service conditions are met, see note 9 for the individual vesting conditions for the
various schemes.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is 
recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
Fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate pricing model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of
any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company (market conditions). The ﬁnancial effect of awards
by the Company of options over its equity shares to employees of subsidiary undertakings are not recognised by the Company until such options 
are exercised. 
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which
are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisﬁed, provided that all other performance conditions are satisﬁed.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired, 
management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and the number of equity instruments that will ultimately 
vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above. The movement in the cumulative 
expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity. 82
Notes to the company ﬁnancial statements 
At 30 December 2007
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modiﬁed or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost based
on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period. In addition, an expense is recognised over the remainder
of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modiﬁcation, based on the difference between the fair value of the original award
and the fair value of the modiﬁed award, both as measured on the date of the modiﬁcation. No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in the income 
statement for the award is expensed immediately. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date is 
deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.
The Company has taken advantage of the transitional provisions in respect of equity settled awards and has applied FRS 20 only to awards granted 
after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 3 January 2005.
Provisions for liabilities
A provision is recognised when the Company has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outﬂow of 
economic beneﬁts will be required to settle the obligation.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All interest-bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised at net proceeds. After initial recognition debt is increased by the ﬁnance cost in 
respect of the reporting period and reduced by payments made in respect of the debts of the period.
Finance costs of debt are allocated over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.

Bank loans
The Company has entered into an agreement to obtain bank loans and mortgage facilities. These are secured by a ﬁxed and ﬂoating charge over the 
Group’s assets and an unlimited guarantee provided by the Company. At 30 December 2007 the balance due under these facilities was £7,721,000 
all of which is in relation to the Employee Beneﬁt Trust (2006: £7,500,000). During the ﬁnancial year, the terms of this loan was renegotiated and 
transferred from National Westminster Bank plc to Barclays Bank plc. The loans bear interest at 0.50% (2006: 0.625% above National Westminster 
Bank plc base rate) above LIBOR. 84

Legal provisions
The legal provisions relate to fees charged in relation to the disposal of subsidiary undertakings as well as outstanding litigation matters arising on 
the sale of stores. The outcome of the litigation is at present uncertain, and a ﬁnal decision is not imminently expected. No estimate of the likely 
outcome of the litigation can yet be made by the directors, but full provision for the potential costs likely to be incurred has been made.
Property provisions
The property provisions relate to outstanding rent reviews, rates, service charges and dilapidation costs for stores sold as part of the sale of 
subsidiary undertakings during prior years. The completion of the outstanding rent and rates reviews vary depending on the lease and on average 
are resolved within 1 – 3 years following the review dates stipulated in the leases. The dilapidation costs are determined at the end of the lease. 
During the year resolution was reached on various of the outstanding items relating to the property provisions, resulting in the release of provisions 
held at the beginning of the year.

At the Annual General Meeting held on 26 April 2007, a resolution was tabled and passed to subdivide the 80,000,000 ordinary shares of 5p each, 
both issued and unissued, into 256,000,000 ordinary shares of 1.56p each.
During the year 1,402,298 (2006: 1,192,154) ordinary shares of 1.56p each with a nominal value of £21,911 (2006: £18,627) were issued at between 
13.16p (2006: 13.16p) and 210.00p (2006: 107.03p) for total cash consideration received of £700,000 (2006: £403,000) to satisfy share options that 
were exercised. 
During the year the Company bought back a total of 3,725,000 (2006: 5,759,827) ordinary shares of 1.56p each for a total value of £8,346,000 
(including costs of £136,000) (2006: £10,161,000 (including costs of £172,000)). The average price for which these shares were purchased was 
220.39p (2006: 173.44p) per share. 85
9. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The expense recognised for share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the year to 30 December 2007 is £358,000
(2006: £154,000). This all arises on equity settled share-based payment transactions.
Long Term Senior Executive Incentive Plan
Reversionary interests over assets held in the Domino’s Pizza UK & IRL plc employee beneﬁt trust are approved and granted, at the discretion of the 
trustees, to senior executives. The interests are capable of vesting within a ﬁve year period should certain performance targets be achieved by the Group.
The following table lists the performance criteria attached to the reversionary interests granted and not vested:
Interest
represented
Diluted by such 
Grant price earnings Net proﬁt number of
Grant date per interest per share before tax shares
16 December 2004 62.50p 7.50p £17,000,000 1,712,000
31 October 2005 92.19p 8.44p £20,000,000 1,200,000
27 April 2006 151.56p 9.66p £22,300,000 2,720,000
6 March 2007 210.00p 12.50p £28,600,000 3,120,000
8,752,000
The contractual life of each interest is 5 years.
The trustees have undertaken to ensure that where possible the fair value of reversionary interests, which may be equity-settled, is estimated as at 
the date of granting using a Black Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which they were granted. The following table 
lists the inputs to the model used for the valuations in 2006 and 2007:
2007 2006
Dividend yield (%) 3.8 3.8
Expected volatility (%) 15 – 20.0 17.0
Historical volatility – 250 day (%) 18.8 – 24.1 27.3
Risk-free interest rate (%) 5.3 – 5.8 4.4 – 4.8
Expected life of reversionary interests (years) 4.1 3.9 – 4.1
Weighted average exercise price (pence)  210.00p 130.16 – 151.56
Weighted average share price (pence)  210.00p 130.16 – 151.56
The expected life of the reversionary interests is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reﬂects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual 
outcome. No other features of options were incorporated into the measurement of fair value, and non-market conditions have not been included in 
calculating the fair value.
The weighted average fair value of each reversionary interest granted during the year was 32.0p (2006: 20.0p). 
For further details regarding the reversionary interests granted and outstanding, see the Report on Directors’ Remuneration.

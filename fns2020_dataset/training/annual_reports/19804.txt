TLA Worldwide PLC / Annual Report 2015     OVERVIEW AND  
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITY
The Group delivered strong growth in revenue 
and operating income in 2015 across all seg -
ments, which saw an increase in Group revenue 
of 114% to $44.4 million and Group operating 
income of 68% to $35.0 million, with Headline 
EBITDA of $13.4 million for the pe-
riod, an increase of 49%. Excluding 
acquisitions, revenue, operating 
income and Headline EBITDA grew 
organically by 22%, 22% and 10% 
respectively.
The Group has continued to 
focus on its strategy of delivering 
organic growth from the underlying 
business, coupled with selective 
acquisitions designed to increase 
the geographic and business 
spread of TLA’s services. This has 
seen TLA expand significantly into 
the Australian and UK markets, 
initially through securing the first 
International Champions Cup soccer 
tournament in Melbourne played in 
July 2015 and then by the purchase 
of ESP in March 2015 (subsequently 
rebranded into TLA Australia and TLA UK).
ESP has broadened the Group’s reach and 
services. The acquisition has significantly in-
creased the number of employees and its client 
base, to 158 and 884 respectively at the year-
end (2014: 70 and 474 respectively). TLA’s first 
International Champions Cup had 225,000 fans 
attend the event, held at the Melbourne Cricket 
Ground, July 2015. The tournament was played 
over three matches with Real Madrid, overall 
winners over Manchester City and AS Roma. The 
2016 event is in full preparation with Atlético 
Madrid, Juventus and Tottenham Hotspur coming 
to Australia in July 2016.
With the acquisition of ESP, the Group 
completed its rebrand to TLA and finalised the 
integration of operations along with the use of 
the TLA brand across the Group in Australia, the 
UK and USA. This has allowed TLA to provide a 
seamless service to its clients across the Group’s 
geographies, with the greater scale and co-or-
dination of the Group further highlighting TLA’s 
visibility in the marketplace. 
OUTLOOK
Trading so far in 2016 is in line with the Board’s 
expectations and TLA continue to see good mo-
mentum in the business, including an increase in 
TLA’s events programme in 2016. The fundamen-
tal business drivers in the sports marketing and 
athlete representation industry remain strong 
and baseball continues to enjoy excellent for-
ward visibility with a further $174 million of con-
tracts negotiated in 2015. As a result, the Board 
looks to the future with confidence.

to three in 2015, and we have added two new 
agents to the Baseball Representation business 
which will contribute to the future growth 
of this business. The Board believes that the 
fundamentals of our businesses remain solid  
and as a result we look forward with optimism.
17 SPORTS MARKETING 
The Sports Marketing division had a strong year 
with revenue increasing 283% to $29.3 million 
(2014 $7.7 million) and Headline EBITDA increas -
ing by 116% to $9.8 million from $4.6 million in 
2014. Operating income increased to $21.2 million 
(2014: $7.7 million), growth of 175% year over 
year. Its client base grew by 11% to 595 (2014: 534, 
excluding the acquisition of ESP). Organic operat-
ing income growth was 51% to $11.6 million (2014: 
$7.7 million) and Headline EBITDA grew 38% to 
$6.3 million (2014: $4.6 million). 
In 2015 TLA ran and delivered three 
events: the first International Champions Cup 
in Australia, the USA v Canada Ice Hockey 
tour of Australia and the USA v Australia 
Rugby test match in Chicago. In addition 
TLA was successfully able to develop its 
portfolio for 2016 by securing an expand-
ed roster of events for this calendar year: 
The USA Sports Marketing business continues 
to grow with its client base increasing from 207 
to 228. There was growth across all segments of 
the US business, including pleasing progress in 
the rights sales business that the Group estab-
lished the last quarter of 2014 and the media 
advisory business launched earlier in that year.
ELITE SPORTS PROPERTIES
TLA acquired the business and assets of ESP, 
an Australian and UK based sports marketing 
business, for up to $19.5 million in March 2015. 
This is part of the Group's strategy to enhance its 
organic growth prospects with selective acquisi-
tions that complement TLA’s current activities. 
The seamless integration of ESP has diversified 
TLA’s offer and expanded its reach in regions 
such as Australia and the UK. 
ESP is reported within the Sports Marketing 
division. The acquisition increased TLA’s client 
base by 327 at acquisition and added key cli-
ents such as the Australian Football League, 
the National Australia Bank, Cricket Australia, 
Adidas, Rugby World Cup 2015 and a great roster 
of high quality athletes in the UK and Australia.
BASEBALL REPRESENTATION
Revenue increased by 15% to $15.1 million and 
Headline EBITDA for the year was $6.9 million 
(2014: $7.4 million). Operating income was $13.8 
million (2014: $13.1 million). The cost base in this 
business increased as TLA invested in agents 
and developed a pipeline of clients as the Group 
continue to build the long term future of the 
business. These development costs have been 
expensed in the period. 
TLA negotiated $174 million worth of con-
tracts for player-clients during 2015 (2014: $194 
million). The reduction reflects the fact that 
fewer players in our portfolio came off contract 
in 2015. On a four-year cycle, since 2012, TLA has 
secured over $700 million worth of contracts for 
clients, giving Baseball Representation excellent 
 First ever Aviva Premiership Rugby match on US soil 
when London Irish played Saracens in March 2016;
 Tottenham Hotspur, Atlético Madrid and Juventus 
to play in the 2016 International Champions Cup 
tournament in Australia in July 2016. For the first 
tournament TLA partnered with the State Government 
of Victoria and following the success of this event the 
partnership with the State Government of Victoria has 
been extended to 2018; 
 Sydney to host opening match of 2016 American College 
Football season in August 2016, the first time an opening 
match has been played outside the USA;
 2016 Ice Hockey Classic across Australia in June 2016; 
and
 New Zealand All Blacks against the Irish National Rugby 
Union team at Chicago's Soldier Field in November 2016

forward revenue visibility and predict-
ability of earnings in this division over the 
short to medium term. 
22 additional baseball players were 
added to TLA’s client list in 2015 bringing 
the total baseball client list to 289 (2014: 
267). The two recently recruited senior 
agents, mentioned previously, are expect-
ed to add additional high quality clients 
during 2016 and thereafter. 
TLA now represents 94 MLB clients (2014: 
83) and 195 Minor League baseball (MiLB) clients 
(2014: 184), with 17 MiLB clients moving up to 
the majors and several older clients retiring. The 
players called up to an MLB roster is the start 
point from which their initial three-year service 
period starts. At the expiry of this period they 
become eligible for market-related salaries via 
arbitration which TLA assist them to negotiate 
their salaries in return for fees. TLA’s client base 
continues to mature with 6 clients (2014: 3) mov -
ing into arbitration for 2016.
PEOPLE
TLA’s staff are the core of the business and this 
is an area of continued focus for the Group. TLA 
have further built out the teams in the divisions 
the Group started organically, including the 
events, sponsorship and consulting businesses. 
TLA Australia has been invaluable in the delivery 
of the Group’s events programme. 
TLA UK won the UK licensing Award for their 
excellent delivery of the master licensing pro-
gramme for the Rugby World Cup, 2015.
Pleasingly in the US this year, the Group was 
short listed for the prestigious Sports Business 
Journal Awards top five list of “Best in Talent 
Representation Agency” in the United States. This 
is a credit to TLA’s people who had an excellent 
year in representing both their clients and TLA.
Post-period end, TLA hired two MLB agents 
to join the Baseball Representation division. 
Management are delighted that they have joined 
TLA and we expect their established client lists 
to follow them to TLA.
19 This review covers the year ended 31 December 2015.  
For this year the Group reported a statutory profit before tax  
of $2.8 million (2014: profit of $0.4 million). The performance  
at the operating level, before interest, tax, depreciation, 
amortisation and exceptional charges showed a Headline  
EBITDA of $13.4 million (2014: $9.0 million). 
Group Headline EBITDA margin reduced by 5 percentage  
points to 38%. As stated in the interim results announcement,  
this was due to TLA Australia, formerly ESPs Australian  
business, having lower a margin at 33%.
Headline diluted earnings per share increased by 29% to 
6.34 cents from 4.76 cents, after taking into account the 
issue of 13.2 million shares under the Groups LTIP.

21 DIVISIONAL PERFORMANCE
Baseball Representation
Trading for the year ended 31 December 2015 
saw $15.1 million of revenue, a Headline EBITDA 
of $6.8 million, which was impacted by invest -
ment into agents and our portfolio of clients. 
Operating income increased by 5% and statutory 
operating profit of $5.0 million.
Sports Marketing
Trading for the year ended 31 December 2015 
showed revenue of $29.3 million, Headline 
EBITDA of $9.8 million and operating profit of 
$6.9 million. Reported revenues include third 
party costs, mainly relating to the acquired 
merchandise business within ESP. Operating in-
come grew by 177% to $21.2 million. Excluding 
the acquisition, operating income increased by 
50.9%, which reflects the delivery of our new 
events during 2015, including the International 
Champions Cup, in Australia. This was strong 
growth despite the weakening of the Australian 
dollar against the US dollar, which had a foreign 
exchange impact to Sports Marketing’s overall 
performance. Headline EBITDA margin, excluding 
acquisitions, was 54.5%. 
CASH FLOW AND BANKING 
ARRANGEMENTS
Cash balances as at 31 December 2015 were 
$6.3 million (2014: $5.9 million) and net debt 
of $16.4 million (2014: $6.6m). The increase in 
the Group’s debt is due to the cash element of 
the ESP acquisition and integration costs. Cash 
generated from operating activities for the year 
ended 31 December 2015 was $2.0 million (2014: 
$3.0 million).
During the year, TLA secured a new 5 year 
$35 million banking facility. The Group is now 
funded by a term loan of $18.4 million and a re-
volver facility of $15 million of which $4.7 million 
was drawn as at 31 December 2015 (2014: $6.6 
million).
Cash earn-outs payments due for 2015 per -
formance and payable in 2016 total $1.6 million. 
$10.7 million of performance related deferred 
consideration remains payable subject to the 
achievement of certain EBIT targets.
DIVIDENDS
The board proposes a final dividend of 0.8 pence 
per share, giving a total dividend for the year of 
1.0 pence, (2014: 0.8 pence), taking into account 
TLA’s interim dividend of 0.2 pence. The dividend 
will be payable on 8 July 2016 and the ex-divi-
dend date is 26 May 2016.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINIES
The management of the Group and the execution 
of the Group’s strategies are subject to a num-
ber of risks. The key business risks affecting the 
Group are shown below.
Risk management
The significant risks that the Group faces have 
been considered and policies have been imple-
mented to best deal with each risk. The four 
most significant risks are considered to be liquid-
ity, finance cost risk, customer relationship risk 
and management risk.
Liquidity risk
The year-end net debt was $16.4 million (2014: 
$6.6 million) which consisted of cash of $6.3 
million (2014: $5.9 million) less $18.4 million of 
interest bearing loans and a $4.7 million revolver 
(2014: $6.0 million of interest bearing loans and 
$6.6 million of revolver). The Group revolving 
facility is for a total of $15.0 million. The Group’s 
cash and net debt position is continually moni-
tored. The Group entered into a new five-year 
facility with Sun Trust of $35 million comprising 
$20 million of term loan and $15 million revolv -
ing credit facility. The new facility matures on 4 
March 2020. Further details are given in note 15 
to the financial statements.
Finance risk cost
The Group pays finance costs on its bank facili-
ties. These facilities finance costs are a variable 
cost linked to LIBOR plus a margin. Interest rates 
are managed through an interest rate swap. The 
average interest rate on the facilities for the 
Group in 2015 was 2.8% (2014: 4.5%).
Customer relationships risk
The Group has commercial relationships with 
884 clients. Attrition rates are low and rela-
tionships are strong. In the case of baseball 
contracts, any revenues negotiated by the Group 
survive the termination of relationship with a 
client. No client accounts for more than 5% of 
revenue (2014: 6%).
Management risk
It’s likely that changes to members of the senior 
management team would impact on the Group’s 
ability to perform to the expectations within its 
strategy. The Board ensures that the manage-
ment team is appropriately rewarded for its ef-

27 THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee is comprised of
 � Ian Robinson (Chairman)
 � Keith Sadler 
 � Bart Campbell
The Remuneration Committee is not comprised 
of entirely independent non-executive Directors. 
Ian Robinson, whom is affiliated to a major 
shareholder, and Bart Campbell, due to his po-
sition as Executive Chairman, his shareholding in 
the Company and his influence in its formation, 
are not independent under the UK corporate 
governance Code. The Board does consider them 
to act independently as regards remuneration 
issues.
The committee met twice during the year.
The Company Secretary is the secretary to 
the committee.
The committee seeks input from the Chief 
Executive Officer and the Company Secretary. 
The committee makes reference to external 
evidence of pay and employment conditions in 
other companies and is free to seek advice from 
external advisers.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The Group’s policy on remuneration for the 
current year and, so far as is practicable for 
subsequent years, is set out below. However, the 
Remuneration Committee believes that it should 
retain the flexibility to adjust the remuneration 
policy in accordance with the changing needs of 
the business. Any changes in the policy in sub-
sequent years will be detailed in future reports 
on remuneration. The Group must ensure that its 
remuneration arrangements attract and retain 
people of the right calibre in order to ensure 
corporate success and to enhance shareholder 
value. Its overall approach is to attract, develop, 
motivate and retain talented people at all levels, 
by paying competitive salaries and benefits to all 
staff and encouraging its staff to hold shares in 
the group. Pay levels are set to take account of 
contribution and individual performance, wage 
levels elsewhere in the Group and with reference 
to relevant market information. The Group seeks 
to reward its employees fairly and give them the 
opportunity to increase their earnings by linking 
pay to achieving business and individual targets.
As an AIM listed Company, the Company is not required to comply 
with Schedule 8 of the Companies Act. However, in accordance 
with AIM notice 36 the Company has provided, on page 29, the 
necessary disclosure of the Directors’ remuneration earned in 
respect of the financial year by each Director of the Company 
acting in such a capacity during the financial year. The Directors 
also feel it is appropriate to provide the following information to 
shareholders.

Chairman, 
Remuneration 
Committee 
11 April 2016 
ICE HOCKEY CLASSIC 2015

TLA Worldwide PLC / Annual Report 2015     The board believes that share ownership is an 
effective way of strengthening employees’ involve-
ment in the development of the business and bring-
ing together their interest and those of sharehold-
ers and as such anticipates granting a share option 
scheme to key employees in the future. 
Executive Directors are rewarded on the 
basis of individual responsibility, competence 
and contribution and salary increases also take 
into account pay awards elsewhere in the Group 
as well as external market benchmarking. 
During the year to 31 December 2015 there 
were four Executive Directors:
 � Bart Campbell (Executive Chairman)
 � Michael Principe (CEO)
 � Greg Genske (Executive Director)
 � Donald Malter (CFO)
Messrs Principe and Genske participate in the 
Company’s healthcare scheme. 
Performance-related elements form a sub-
stantial part of the total remuneration packages 
and are designed to align Directors’ interest with 
those of shareholders. In line with best practice 
and to bring the Directors’ and shareholders’ in-
terest further into line, Executive Directors and 
the management team are encouraged to main-
tain a holding of ordinary shares in the Group.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS FEES
The Board determines fees for Non-Executive 
Directors annually, taking advice as appropriate 
and reflecting the time commitment and respon-
sibilities on the role. Non-Executive Directors’ 
fees currently comprise a basic fee of £30,000 
per annum. In addition, Non-Executive Directors 
are paid £5,000 per annum for each committee 
that they sit on.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate 
in any pension schemes or LTIP. The Group re-
imburses the reasonable expenses they incur in 
carrying out their Directors’ duties.
REMUNERATION COMPONENTS – 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
A significant proportion of each Executive Directors’ 
remuneration is performance related. The main 
components of the remuneration package for 
Executive Directors are:
 � Basis salary
 � Annual bonuses
 � LTIP
BASIC SALARY 
Basic salary is set by the Remuneration 
Committee by taking into account the responsi-
bility, individual performance and experience of 
the Executive Director, as well as market practice 
for executives in a similar position. Basic salary 
is reviewed (but not necessarily increased) annu-
ally by the Remuneration Committee.
BONUSES
The Executive Directors are eligible to partic-
ipate in annual bonuses. The range of award 
is based on salary. For each of the Executive 
Directors’ the percentage is as follows:
 � Bart Campbell: up to 50%
 � Michael Principe: up to 50%
 � Greg Genkse: No bonus
 � Donald Malter: up to 16.67%
The performance requirements for the ability to 
earn a bonus are set by the committee annually 
and are quantitative related.
SHARE INCENTIVE
The committee believes that the award of 
shares aligns the interest of participants and 
the shareholders. An LTIP for Messrs. Campbell, 
Principe and Mighty was put into place on 19 
December 2013, reflecting the terms set out in the 
Company’s admission document. A further award 
under the LTIP was made in September 2015.
The board believes that share ownership is 
an effective way of strengthening employees’

31 THE BOARD
The Board of TLA Worldwide plc is comprised of 
the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, the 
Chief Financial Officer, an Executive Director and 
three Non-Executive Directors. Short biographi-
cal details of each Director are set out on pages 
24 and 25. The Board is responsible to the share-

are subject to Board approval.
The role of the Chief Executive and Chairman 
are separate and there is a clear division of 
their responsibilities. All directors are subject 
to re-election every three years. The Company 
has additionally supplemented this with the 
good practice of one third of the total number of 
Directors standing for re-election at each Annual

AGM and, being eligible for re-election, offer 
themselves for re-election. Ian Robinson offers 
himself for election.

governance code (“the Code”) issued by the Financial Services 
Authority in September 2014 the Group is committed to high

Based on this assessment, the Directors are sat-
isfied that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foresee-
able future, being a period of at least 12 months 
from the signing of these accounts. For this rea-
son they continue to adopt the giving concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements.
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
The Board recognises the growing awareness of 
social, environmental and ethical matters and 
it endeavours to take into account the interests 
of the Group’s stakeholders including investors, 
employees, suppliers and business partners when 
operating the business.
EMPLOYMENT
At a subsidiary level each individual Company has 
established polices which address key corporate 
objectives in the management of employee re-
lations, communications and employee involve-
ment, training and personal development and 
equal opportunity. The Board recognizes its legal 
responsibility to ensure the wellbeing, safety and 
welfare of its employees and to maintain a safe

TLA Worldwide PLC / Annual Report 2015     RALLY AUSTRALIA
35 Company law requires the Directors to prepare fi-
nancial statements for each financial year. Under 
that law the Directors are required to prepare 
the Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elect-
ed to prepare the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable 
law). Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the accounts unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of 
the company for that period. 
In preparing the parent company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
 � select suitable accounting policies and then 
apply them consistently;
 � make judgments and accounting estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent;
 � state whether applicable UK Accounting 
Standards have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
 � prepare the financial statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the company will continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires 
that Directors:
 � properly select and apply accounting policies;
 � present information, including accounting pol-
icies, in a manner that provides relevant, reli-
able, comparable and understandable information; 
 � � provide additional disclosures when compli-
ance with the specific requirements in IFRSs 
are insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the entity’s financial 
position and financial performance; and
 � make an assessment of the company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping ade-
quate accounting records that are sufficient to 
show and explain the company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial state-
ments comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the company and hence for taking rea-
sonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 � the financial statements, prepared in accor-
dance with the relevant financial reporting 
framework, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit 
or loss of the company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole; 
and
 � the strategic report includes a fair review of 
the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the company and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face.
 � By order of the Board.
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.

ing FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”. 
This report is made solely to the company’s 
members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept 
or assume responsibility to anyone other than

RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES  
OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITOR
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is 
to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF  
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial state-
ments sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from ma-
terial misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
and the parent company’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant ac-
counting estimates made by the Directors; and 
the overall presentation of the financial state-
ments. In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the annual report to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any informa-
tion that is apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent mate-
rial misstatements or inconsistencies we consider 
the implications for our report.

43 GENERAL INFORMATION
TLA Worldwide PLC (the “Company”) is in-
corporated in the United Kingdom under the 
Companies Act. The Company and its subsidiar-
ies’ (together the “Group”) principal activities 
are set out as part of the business review on 
pages 20 to 23. These financial statements are 
presented in US Dollars because that is the cur-
rency of the primary economic environment in 
which the Group operates.
ADOPTION OF NEW  
AND REVISED STANDARDS
In the current year, the following new and re-
vised standard and interpretations have been 
adopted:
 � Amendments to IAS 19: Defined Benefit Plans: 
Employee Contributions
 � Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010 – 2012 
cycle
 � Annual improvements to IFRSs 2011 – 2013 
cycle
None of the new or revised standards that have 
been adopted affected the amounts reported in 
the financial statements. At the date of authori-
sation of these financial statements the Group 
had not applied the following new and revised 
IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet 
effective:
 � IFRS 9: Financial Instruments
 � IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers
 � IFRS 16: Leases
 � Amendments to IFRS 11: Accounting for 
Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations
 � Amendments to IAS 1: Disclosure Initiative
 � Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification 
of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation
 � Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41: 
Agriculture: Bearer Plants
 � Amendments to IAS 27: Equity Method in 
Separate Financial Statements
 � Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28: Sale or 
Contributions of Assets between an Investor 
and its Associate or Joint Venture
 � Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 
28: Investment Entities: Applying the 
Consolidation Exemption
 � Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2012–2014 
Amendments to: IFRS 5 Non-current Assets 
Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, 
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, 
IAS 19 Employee Benefits and IAS 34 Interim 
Financial Reporting
The Directors have not assessed whether the 
effect of the adoption of the Standards and 
Interpretations listed above will have a material 
impact on the financial statements of the Group 
in future periods. Beyond the information above, 
it is not practicable to provide a reasonable es-
timate of the effect of these standards until a 
detailed review has been completed. 
The accounting policies set out below have, 
unless otherwise stated, been applied consis-
tently to all periods presented in these consoli-
dated financial statements. Judgements made by 
the Directors in the application of these account-
ing policies that have a significant effect on the 
consolidated financial statements together with 
estimates with significant risk of material adjust-
ment in the next year are discussed in note 25.
GOING CONCERN
The Directors have reviewed forecasts for the 
year ending 31 December 2016 and 31 December 
2017. The Directors consider the forecasts to 
be prudent and have assessed the impact on 
the Group’s cash flow, facilities and headroom 
within its banking covenants. Further, the 
Directors have assessed the future funding re-
quirements of the Group, including the payment 
of future earn-outs, and compared the level of 
borrowing facilities. Based on this assessment, 
the Directors are satisfied that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future, being a 
period of at least 12 months from the signing of 
Principal  
Accounting Policies 
44
TLA Worldwide PLC / Annual Report 2015     these accounts. For this reason, they continue to 
adopt the giving concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING 
The financial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs). The financial state-
ments have also been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and 
therefore the Group financial statements comply 
with Article 4 of the EU IAS regulation. 
The financial statements have been prepared 
on the historical cost basis except for the reval-
uation of financial instruments. Historical cost 
is generally based on the fair value of the con-
sideration given in exchange for the assets. The 
principal accounting policies are set out below.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements incorpo-
rate the financial statements of the Company 
and entities controlled by the Company (its 
subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. 
Control is achieved where the Company has the 
power to govern the financial and operating poli-
cies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits 
from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are mea-
sured at their fair values at the date of acquisi-
tion. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over 
the fair values of the identifiable net assets ac-
quired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency 
of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of 
the identifiable net assets acquired (i.e. discount 
on acquisition) is credited to the income state-
ment in the period of acquisition. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or dis-
posed of during the year are included in the 
Consolidated Income Statement from the effec-
tive date of acquisition or up to the effective date 
of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, ad-
justments are made to the financial statements 
of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies 
used into line with those used by the Group. All 
intra-group transactions, balances, income and 
expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are 
accounted for using the acquisition method. The 
consideration for each acquisition is measured at 
the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of 
exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or 
assumed, and equity instruments issued by the 
Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. 
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit 
or loss as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the 
acquisition includes any asset or liability result-
ing from a contingent consideration arrange-
ment, measured at its acquisition-date fair value. 
Subsequent changes in such fair values are ad-
justed against the cost of acquisition where they 
qualify as measurement period adjustments (see 
below). All other subsequent changes in the fair 
value of contingent consideration classified as an 
asset or liability are accounted for in accordance 
with relevant IFRSs. Changes in the fair value of 
contingent consideration classified as equity are 
not recognised.
Where a business combination is achieved in 
stages, the Group’s previously-held interests in 
the acquired entity are re-measured to fair value 
at the acquisition date (i.e. the date the Group 
attains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if 
any, is recognised in profit or loss. 
Amounts arising from interests in the ac-
quiree prior to the acquisition date that have 
previously been recognised in other compre-
hensive income are reclassified to Income 
Statement, where such treatment would be ap-
propriate if that interest were disposed of.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities that meet the condi-
tions for recognition under IFRS 3(2008) are 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition 
date, except that:
 � adeferred tax assets or liabilities and liabil-
ities or assets related to employee benefit 
arrangements are recognised and measured 
in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and 
IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively;
 � liabilities or equity instruments related to the 
replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s 
share-based payment awards are measured 
in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based 
Payment; and
 � assets (or disposal groups) that are clas-
sified as held for sale in accordance with 
IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations are measured in 
accordance with that Standard.
If the initial accounting for a business combina-
tion is incomplete by the end of the reporting 
period in which the combination occurs, the 
Group reports provisional amounts for the items 
for which the accounting is incomplete. Those 
45 provisional amounts are adjusted during the 
measurement period (see below), or additional 
assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new 
information obtained about facts and circum-
stances that existed as of the acquisition date 
that, if known, would have affected the amounts 
recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from 
the date of acquisition to the date the Group 
obtains complete information about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition 
date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
REVENUE
Revenue is measured as the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable and com-
prises amounts billed to clients in respect of 
fees earned and commission-based income fees 
earned from the provision of support services 
to other agents or events promoters (and is 
stated exclusive of any relevant sales taxes); and 
the revenue or the share of revenues on events 
where the Group is a promoter. Revenue is rec-
ognised in line with the provision of relevant 
services under the terms of the contract or in 
the case of events, once the event has occurred 
provided that it is probable that the economic 
benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of 
revenue can be measured reliably.
Revenue can be split into five revenue 
streams:
1. Representation revenue
Representation revenue is generated from a 
commission paid as a percentage of a player’s 
base salary. Base salaries are fees payable by 
clubs to their players. These fees are contractual 
obligations made by the club to pay the player 
for a specific number of seasons. 
Contractual arrangements are reviewed to 
ascertain whether the Group acts as principal 
or agent with regards to third party costs. If the 
relationship is that of agent then the recharge of 
third party costs is not recognised through reve-
nue or cost of sales.
Revenue is recognised at the point the player 
becomes contractually obliged to pay commis-
sion to the Group.
2. Signing bonuses
Signing bonuses are amounts payable by the 
clubs to the player for signing a contract. The 
Group earns a commission based on a percent-
age of the signing bonus. Commission revenue is 
recognised when the player receives the signing 
bonus from the relevant club, at which point the 
player becomes contractually obliged to pay 
commission to the Group.
3. Endorsement revenue
Endorsement revenue is generated from com-
mission calculated as a percentage of fees 
earned by clients for guest appearances, wear-
ing of certain attire or other sponsorship deals. 
Revenue is recognised in the period that the 
associated fees are earned by the player.
4. Sponsorship revenue
Sponsorship revenue is generated from commis-
sion calculated as a percentage of fees earned by 
placing sponsors for certain events. Revenue is 
recognised based on the terms of the individual 
contracts; at the point the commission becomes 
contractually due.
5. Event revenue
Event revenues are generated where the Group 
acts a promoter for an individual event or group 
of events. Revenue is recognised upon comple-
tion of the event, as this is the point when the 
Group becomes entitled to the revenue generat-
ed from that event. 
6. Merchandise
Merchandise revenue is measured at the fair 
value of the consideration received or receivable 
and represents amounts receivable for goods and 
services provided in the normal course of busi-
ness, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related 
taxes. Revenue is reduced for estimated customer 
returns, rebates and other similar allowances.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised 
when all the following conditions are satisfied: 
 � the Group has transferred to the buyer the 
significant risks and rewards of ownership of 
the goods;
 � the Group retains neither continuing mana-
gerial involvement to the degree usually as-
sociated with ownership nor effective control 
over the goods sold;
 � the amount of revenue can be measured 
reliably;
 � it is probable that the economic benefits as-
sociated with the transaction will flow to the 
entity; and
 � the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect 
of the transaction can be measured reliably, 
including commission-based staff costs, in-
cluding salaries, bonuses and social security 
costs, and expenses reimbursed to commis-
sion-based agents

TLA Worldwide PLC / Annual Report 2015     INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and 
net realisable value. Cost comprises direct ma-
terials and, where applicable, direct labour costs 
and those overheads that have been incurred in 
bringing the inventories to their present loca-
tion and condition. Cost is calculated using the 
weighted average method. Net realisable value 
represents the estimated selling price less all 
estimated costs of completion and costs to be 
incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
PROPERTY, PLANT  
AND EQUIPMENT
The fixtures and fittings are stated at cost. 
Depreciation is computed on the straight-line 
method using an estimated useful life ranging 
from three to five years. Repairs and mainte-
nance are charged as an expense in the year in-
curred, and major improvements and new assets 
are capitalized. 
It is assumed that all assets will be used until 
the end of their useful life.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS  
AND GOODWILL
Goodwill arising in a business combination is 
recognised as an asset at the date that control 
is acquired (the acquisition date). Goodwill is 
measured as the excess of the sum of the consid-
eration transferred, the amount of any non-con-
trolling interest in the acquiree and the fair value 
of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest 
(if any) in the entity over the net of the acqui-
sition date amounts of the identifiable assets 
acquired and the liabilities assumed.
If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in 
the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net 
assets exceeds the sum of the consideration trans-
ferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest 
in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s 
previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if 
any), the excess is recognised immediately in prof-
it or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for 
impairment at least annually. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each 
of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to 
benefit from the synergies of the combination. 
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has 
been allocated are tested for impairment annual-
ly, or more frequently when there is an indication 
that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit is less than 
the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment 
loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and 
then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on 
the basis of the carrying amount of each asset 
in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for 
goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable 
amount of goodwill is included in the determina-
tion of the profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets arising from a business 
combination whose fair values can be reliably 
measure are separated from goodwill and amor-
tised based on the future cash flows attributable 
to the individual assets
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful 
life and goodwill are systematically tested for 
impairment at each balance sheet date. Other 
intangibles assets are amortised from the date 
they are available for use. The estimated useful 
lives are as follows:
 � Client contracts – over the life of the contract
 � Customer relationships – 6–8 years
Impairment
For goodwill that has an indefinite useful life 
the recoverable amount is estimated annually. 
For other assets the recoverable amount is only 
estimated when there is an indication that im-
pairment may have occurred. The recoverable 
amount is the higher of fair value less costs to 
sell and value in use.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax 
currently payable and deferred tax. The tax 
currently payable is based on taxable profit for 
the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit 
as reported in the income statement because 
it excludes items of income or expense that 
are taxable or deductible in other years and it 
further excludes items that are never taxable 
or deductible. The Group’s liability for current 
tax is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be pay-
able or recoverable on differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax 
bases used in the computation of taxable profit, 
and is accounted for using the balance sheet lia-
bility method. Deferred tax liabilities are gener-
ally recognised for all taxable temporary differ-
ences and deferred tax assets are recognised to 
47 the extent that it is probable that taxable profits 
will be available against which deductible tempo-
rary differences can be utilised. Such assets and 
liabilities are not recognised if the temporary 
difference arises from the initial recognition of 
goodwill or from the initial recognition (other 
than in a business combination) of other assets 
and liabilities in a transaction that affects nei-
ther the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for 
taxable temporary differences arising on invest-
ments in subsidiaries and associates, and inter-
ests in joint ventures, except where the Group 
is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable fu-
ture. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets 
is reviewed at each balance sheet date and re-
duced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to 
allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates 
that are expected to apply in the period when 
the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the in-
come statement, except when it relates to items 
charged or credited directly to equity, in which 
case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset 
when there is a legally enforceable right to set 
off current tax assets against current tax liabili-
ties and when they relate to income taxes levied 
by the same taxation authority and the Group 
intends to settle its current tax assets and liabil-
ities on a net basis.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES
The individual financial statements of each 
group company are presented in the currency 
of the primary economic environment in which 
it operates (its functional currency). For the pur-
pose of the consolidated financial statements, 
the results and financial position of each group 
company are expressed in US Dollars which is 
the presentation currency for the consolidated 
financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the 
individual companies, transactions in curren-
cies other than the entity’s functional currency 
(foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates 
of exchange prevailing on the dates of the trans-
actions. At each balance sheet date, monetary 
assets and liabilities that are denominated in for-
eign currencies are retranslated at the rates pre-
vailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried 
at fair value that are denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated at the rates prevailing 
at the date when the fair value was determined. 
Non-monetary items that are measured in 
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are 
not retranslated. 
Exchange differences are recognised in the 
Income Statement in the period in which they 
arise except for:
 � exchange differences on foreign currency 
borrowings relating to assets under con-
struction for future productive use, which are 
included in the cost of those assets when they 
are regarded as an adjustment to interest 
costs on those foreign currency borrowings;
 � exchange differences on monetary items 
receivable from or payable to a foreign oper-
ation for which settlement is neither planned 
nor likely to occur (therefore forming part 
of the net investment in the foreign opera-
tion), which are recognised initially in other 
comprehensive income and reclassified from 
equity to Income Statement on disposal or 
partial disposal of the net investment.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated fi-
nancial statements, the assets and liabilities of 
the Group’s foreign operations are translated at 
exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet 
date. Translation differences on non-monetary 
financial assets and liabilities are reported as 
part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation dif-
ferences on non- monetary financial assets, such 
as investments in equity securities classified as 
available for sale, are included in the fair value 
reserve in equity.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising 
on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated 
as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate.
BANK BORROWINGS
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are 
recorded at an amount and the amount of the 
proceeds received net of direct issue costs. 
Finance charges, including premiums payable on 
settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, 
are accounted for on an accruals basis in the 
consolidated income statement using the effec-
tive interest rate method and are added to the 
carrying amount of the instrument to the extent 
that they are not settled in the period in which 
they arose. 
48
TLA Worldwide PLC / Annual Report 2015     FINANCE COSTS
Finance costs of financial liabilities are rec-
ognised in the income statement over the term 
of such instruments at a constant rate of the 
carrying amount.
OPERATING LEASES
Leases where substantially all of the risks and 
rewards of ownership are not transferred to the 
Group are treated as operating leases. Rentals 
under operating leases are charged to the in-
come statement on a straight line basis over the 
period of the lease.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on 
hand and demand deposits and other short term 
highly liquid investments that are readily con-
vertible to a known amount of cash 
and are subject to an insignificant 
risk of changes in value.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial assets and financial liabili-
ties are recognised in the Group’s bal-
ance sheet when the Group becomes 
a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument.
Financial Assets
All financial assets are recognised and 
derecognised on a trade date where 
the purchase or sale of a financial 
asset is under a contract whose terms 
require delivery of the financial asset 
within the timeframe established 
by the market concerned, and are 
initially measured at fair value, plus 
transaction costs, except for those 
financial assets classified as at fair 
value through profit or loss, which 
are initially measured at fair value. 
Financial assets are classified into 
the following specified categories: 
financial assets ‘at fair value through 
profit or loss’ (FVTPL), ‘held-to-maturity’ invest-
ments, ‘available-for-sale’ (AFS) financial assets 
and ‘loans and receivables’. The classification 
depends on the nature and purpose of the finan-
cial assets and is determined at the time of initial 
recognition.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables 
that have fixed or determinable payments that 
are not quoted in an active market are classified 
as ‘loans and receivables’. Loans and receiv-
ables are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less any impairment. 
Interest income is recognised by applying the 
effective interest rate, except for short-term re-
ceivables when the recognition of interest would 
be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are 
assessed for indicators of impairment at each 
balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired 
where there is objective evidence that, as a re-
sult of one or more events that occurred after 
the initial recognition of the financial asset, the 
estimated future cash flows of the investment 
have been affected. 
For listed and unlisted equity investments 
classified as AFS, a significant or prolonged de-
cline in the fair value of the security below its 
cost is considered to be objective evidence of 
impairment. 
For all other financial assets, including re-
deemable notes classified as AFS and finance 
lease receivables, objective evidence of impair-
ment could include:
 � significant financial difficulty of the issuer or 
counterparty; or
 � default or delinquency in interest or principal 
payments; or
 � it becoming probable that the borrower will 
enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation.
For certain categories of financial asset, such 
as trade receivables, assets that are assessed 
not to be impaired individually are, in addition, 
assessed for impairment on a collective basis. 
Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio 
of receivables could include the Group’s past ex-
perience of collecting payments, an increase in 
the number of delayed payments in the portfolio 
past the average credit period of 60 days, as 
well as observable changes in national or local 
economic conditions that correlate with default 
on receivables.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, 
the amount of the impairment is the differences 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the 
present value of estimated future cash flows, dis-
counted at the financial asset’s original effective 
interest rate.
STEVE YOUNG
49 The carrying amount of the financial asset is 
reduced by the impairment loss directly for all 
financial assets with the exception of trade re-
ceivables, where the carrying amount is reduced 
through the use of an allowance account. When 
a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, 
it is written off against the allowance account. 
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously 
written off are credited against the allowance 
account. Changes in the carrying amount of the 
allowance account are recognised in the Income 
Statement.
Debt and equity instruments are classified 
as either financial liabilities or as equity in ac-
cordance with the substance of the contractual 
arrangement. 
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evi-
dences a residual interest in the assets of an en-
tity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity in-
struments issued by the Group are recognised at 
the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are classified as either fi-
nancial liabilities ‘at FVTPL’ or ‘other financial 
liabilities’.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL 
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL 
when the financial liability is either held for trad-
ing or it is designated as at FVTPL.
A financial liability is classified as held for 
trading if:
 � it has been incurred principally for the pur-
pose of repurchasing it in the near term; or
 � on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio 
of identified financial instruments that the 
Group manages together and has a recent 
actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or 
 � it is a derivative that is not designated and 
effective as a hedging instrument. 
A financial liability other than a financial liability 
held for trading may be designated as at FVTPL 
upon initial recognition if:
 � such designation eliminates or significantly 
reduces a measurement or recognition incon-
sistency that would otherwise arise; or 
 � the financial liability forms part of a group of 
financial assets or financial liabilities or both, 
which is managed and its performance is 
evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance 
with the Group’s documented risk manage-
ment or investment strategy, and information 
about the grouping is provided internally on 
that basis; or
 � it forms part of a contract containing one 
or more embedded derivatives, and IAS 
39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement permits the entire combined 
contract (asset or liability) to be designated 
as at FVTPL.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair 
value, with any gains or losses arising on re-mea-
surement recognised in Income Statement. The 
net gain or loss recognised in Income Statement 
incorporates any interest paid on the financial 
liability and is included in the ‘other gains and 
losses’ line item in the income statement. Fair 
value is determined in the manner described in 
note 26. 
Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, 
are initially measured at fair value, net of trans-
action costs. 
Other financial liabilities are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, with interest expense rec-
ognised on an effective yield basis. 
The effective interest method is a method 
of calculating the amortised cost of a financial 
liability and of allocating interest expense over 
the relevant period. The effective interest rate is 
the rate that exactly discounts estimated future 
cash payments through the expected life of the 
financial liability, or, where appropriate, a short-
er period, to the net carrying amount on initial 
recognition.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities 
when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are 
discharged, cancelled or they expire.
TRADE RECEIVABLES
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and 
are stated at their nominal value as reduced by 
appropriate allowances for estimated irrecover-
able amounts.
50
TLA Worldwide PLC / Annual Report 2015     TRADE PAYABLES
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are 
stated at their nominal value.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group entered into an interest rate swap to 
manage its exposure to interest rate risk. Further 
details of derivative financial instruments the 
Group holds are disclosed in note 16.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair 
value at the date a derivative contract is entered 
into and are subsequently re-measured to their 
fair value at each balance sheet date. The re-
sulting gain or loss is recognised in the Income 
Statement immediately.
A derivative with a positive fair value is 
recognised as a financial asset whereas a de-
rivative with a negative fair value is recognised 
as a financial liability. A derivative is presented 
as a non-current asset or a non-current liability 
if the remaining maturity of the instrument is 
more than 12 months and it is not expected to 
be realised or settled within 12 months. Other 
derivatives are presented as current assets or 
current liabilities.
INVESTMENTS
Investments are recognised and derecognised 
on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an 
investment is under contract whose terms re-
quire the delivery of the investment within the 
timeframe established by the market concerned, 
and are initially measured at cost, including 
transaction costs. Investments are classified 
either as available for sale, and are measured 
at subsequent reporting dates at fair value, or 
at amortised cost, where no fair value is readily 
determinable.
Gains and losses on available for sale finan-
cial assets arising from changes in fair value are 
recognised directly in equity, until the security is 
disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at 
which time the cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in equity is included in the net profit 
or loss for the period.
SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
Equity-settled share-based payments to employ-
ees and others providing similar services are
measured at the fair value of the equity instru-
ments at the grant date. The fair value excludes 
the effect of non-market-based vesting condi-
tions. Details regarding the determination of the 
fair value of equity-settled share-based transac-
tions are set out in note 27.
The fair value determined at the grant date 
of the equity-settled share-based payments is 
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vest-
ing period, based on the Group’s estimate of 
equity instruments that will eventually vest. At 
each balance sheet date, the Group revises its 
estimate of the number of equity instruments 
expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-
market-based vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision of the original esti-
mates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such 
that the cumulative expense reflects the revised 
estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to 
equity reserves.
NON-GAAP MEASURES
Headline earnings is defined as profit or loss 
for the year adjusted to add back depreciation, 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets and 
any other acquisition related charges, share 
based payment charges, fair value movement 
on financial derivatives, unwinding of discount 
on deferred consideration and exceptional items.
We believe these non-GAAP measures pro-
vide shareholders with useful information about 
the Group’s trading performance. The reconcili-
ation between operating profit from continuing 
operations and Headline EBITDA is shown on the 
face of the Group Income Statement.
51  SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
The Group reports its business activities in two areas: Baseball 
Representation and Sports Marketing. Unallocated represents  
the Group’s costs as a public company, along with exceptional 
items and acquisition related costs (see note 4). The Group  
derives its revenues in the United States of America, Australia  
and United Kingdom.
Baseball Representation
Primarily assists the on-field activities of base-
ball players, including all aspects of a player’s 
contract negotiation.
Sports Marketing 
Primarily assists with the on-field and off-field 
activities of athletes; it represents broadcast-
ers and coaches in respect of their contract 
negotiations; manages, produces events, primar-
ily in sports, PR and activation, media consultan-
cy and the selling of merchandise, primarily in 
sport.
All of the Group’s revenue arises through 
the rendering of services. In the year ended 31 
December 2015, there were no clients who gen-
erated in excess of 10 percent of total revenue 
(2014: none).

TLA Worldwide PLC / Annual Report 2015     The accounting policies of the reportable seg-
ments are the same as the Group’s accounting 
policies described in the principal accounting 
policies. Segment profit represents the profit 
earned by each segment, central administration 
costs including Directors’ salaries, exceptional, 
acquisition and finance costs, and income tax 
expense. This is the measure reported to the 
Group’s Chief Executive for the purpose of re-
source allocation and assessment of segment 
performance.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units 
(CGUs) that are expected to benefit from that business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill 
had been allocated as follows:
2015  
($000)

Elite Sports Properties 13,134 –
Sports marketing 19,254 6,120
Total TLA Worldwide 42,156 29,022
The Group tests goodwill annually for impair-
ment, or more frequently if there are indications 
that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of all three CGUs 
are determined from value in use calculations. 
The key assumptions for the value in use calcu-
lations are those regarding the discount rates, 
growth rates and expected changes to contrac-
tual revenue and direct costs during the period. 
Management estimates discount rates using 
pre-tax rates that reflect current market assess-
ments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the CGUs.
The unit cash flows were discounted using 
a pre-tax discount rate of 11.5% (2014: 11.5%) 
which the Directors believe adequately reflects 
current market assessment in respect of both 
the time value of money and the risk specific to 
each CGU. This discount factor was considered to 
be appropriate for all the units, given their geog-
raphy and market sector. 
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analy-
sis on the impairment test of each CGU’s carrying 
value. A decline of 15% to cash flows, or an in-
crease in the discount rate to 17% would result 
in the carrying value of goodwill being reduced 
to its recoverable amount.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts 
derived from the most recent financial budgets 
approved by management for the next five years 
and extrapolates cash flows for the following 
five years based on an estimated growth rate 
of 0% (2014: 0%). This rate does not exceed the 
average long-term growth rate for the relevant 
markets.
As a consequence, the Directors do not con-
sider any need for impairment to Goodwill as at 
31 December 2015.

TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
Trade receivables
Amounts receivable from trade customers are 
non-interest bearing and have difference pay-
ment terms depending on the contractual or 
other arrangements with customers, although 
generally terms are 30–60 days.
Trade receivables disclosed above include 
amounts (see below for aged analysis) which 
are past due at the reporting date. The average 
age of these receivables is 60 days (2014: 63 
days). 
The table below sets out the aging of the 
Group’s trade receivables. The Directors consider 
amounts over 60 days, net of provisions, to be 
past due but not impaired.
The Group’s trade receivables are stated after allowance for bad and doubtful debts. This allowance 
has been determined by considering specific doubtful balances and are analysed as follows:
($000)
At 1 January 2014 –
Charges to operating expenses 237
At 31 December 2014 237
Charges to operating expenses 679
At 31 December 2015 916
The provision for irrecoverable trade receivables 
relates to debts that are past due and impaired.
In determining the recoverability of a trade 
receivable the Group considers any change in 
the credit quality of the trade receivable from 
the date credit was initially granted up to the 
reporting date. The concentration of credit risk 
is limited due to the customer base being large 
and unrelated.
The Directors have considered the material 
receivables that are past due dates with senior 
management directly responsible for those 
relationships. On the basis of these discussions 
and the credit control procedures in place the 
Directors consider that these receivables are 
recoverable. The Directors consider that the car-
rying amount of trade and other receivables is 
approximately equal to their fair value.

for trade purchases, ongoing costs and $1.0 mil-
lion (2014: $0.75million) being 4 years’ accrual 
for the 5 years’ loyalty bonus in respect of the 
Agency acquisition. The average credit period 
taken for trade purchases is 38 days (2014: 41 
days). For most suppliers no interest is charged 
on the trade payables for the first 30 days from 
the date of the invoice. Thereafter, interest is 
charged on the outstanding balances at vari-
ous interest rates. The Group has financial risk 
management policies in place to ensure that all 
payables are paid within the pre-agreed credit 
terms.
The Directors consider that the carrying 
amount of trade payables approximates to their 
fair value.
BORROWINGS
A new loan facility of $35 million was secured 
in the year as part of the ESP acquisition. All 
borrowings are denominated in US dollars. The 
other principal features of the Company’s bor-
rowings are as follows:
› interest is charged at 2.25% above US LIBOR;
› the facilities are secured against trade receiv-
ables and contracted revenue;
› the loan repayments are made quarterly over 
the life of the loan plus a final bullet repay-
ment; and
› the facilities are renewable in March 2020.

On 30 June 2015 the Group entered into an inter -

to 4 March 2020 for 50% of the outstanding bal-
ance of it $20 million term loan facility.
The swap is a hedge of the interest rate ex-
penses relating to the Group loans. The contract 
was marked to market on 31 December 2015 and 
had a fair value liability of $14,000 (31 December 
2014: $27,000).

DEFERRED CONSIDERATION
Under the terms of the acquisition agreements in relation to Agency, Legacy, PEG and ESP the 
Company has obligations to the vendors of those businesses as set out below:
2015
 ($000)
2014
 ($000)
Payable in less than one year 1,600 2,591
Payable in one to two years 2,282 2,445
Payable in two to five years 8,484 7,515
Impact of discounting on provisions payable in cash (1,661) (997)
Total deferred consideration payable 10,705 11,544
During the year the Company issued $1,311,300 
(2014: Nil) consideration shares to the vendors 
of PEG (see note 19). 
The cash deferred consideration requires the 
conversion into cash of the EBIT underlying the 
earn-out payment prior to its payment date. To 
the extent this has not been achieved the earn-
out is reduced by the cash shortfall. 
The Group has estimated the fair value of this 
liability based on the anticipated future EBIT of 
each underlying business. This value has then 
been discounted back to present value using 
the Group’s weighted average cost of capital of 
5.22%. 
The Group has the option to settle 30% of 
the $6,298,000 payable to PEG in shares in 
TLA (NY) Inc. In accordance with the terms of 
the exchange Agreement, these shares can be 
exchanged for Ordinary Shares in the capital of 
TLA Worldwide plc at any time at the option of 
the vendors. These payments are made annually 
for the next two years.

shares at a price of 43.36p per share, as part 
consideration for the acquisition of the assets 
and business of ESP. On 30 April the Company 
issued 9,647,307 at a price of 42.75p per share 
in respect of the Group’s LTIP after the 40p share 
price hurdle had been achieved. On the 5 October 
the Company issued the deferred consideration 
shares to the vendors of PEG. 3,226,029 shares 
were issued to the PEG vendors at a share price 
of 25.26p, as set out in the acquisition agreement 
with the PEG Vendors. Also on 5 October the 
Company issued 3,648,624 at a price of 59.5p per 
share in respect of the Group’s LTIP after the 50p 
share price hurdle had been.
The Company has one class of ordinary 
shares, which carry no right to fixed income.
EQUITY
The Share Premium arises from capital raised 
through the issue of ordinary shares to the ex-
tent that the nominal value is exceeded by the 
proceeds of the issue.
Shares to be issued reflects deferred consid-
eration payable in respect to acquisitions. This 
issue is not contingent on any future event and 
is therefore considered an equity item (see note 
17). 
The Employee share reserve arises on the 
issue of shares under the Group’s LTIP scheme.

either directly or indirectly by TLA Worldwide 
PLC unless otherwise stated) in the Group are:

67 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS  
AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
The preparation of financial information in con-
formity with IFRS requires the Group to make 
certain judgements, estimates and assump-
tions about the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities that are not readily apparent from 
other sources. These estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience 
and other factors that are considered to be rel-
evant. Actual results may differ from these esti-
mates under different assumptions or conditions.
The estimates and underlying assumptions 
are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to 
accounting estimates are recognised in the peri-
od in which the estimate is revised if the revision 
affects only that period or in the period of the 
revision and future periods if the revision affects 
both current and future periods. The Directors 
consider that the most significant area of ac-
counting estimate relates to trade receivables, 
where clients have not settled in accordance 
with standard terms and conditions, and, the 
Directors have evaluated each balance receiv-
able and made provisions for doubtful debts 
where appropriate, in accordance with experi-
ence of the normal basis on which such balances 
are settled.
Critical judgements in applying  
the group's accounting policies
The following are the critical judgements, apart 
from those involving estimations (which are 
dealt with separately below), that the Directors 
have made in the process of applying the Group’s 
accounting policies and that have the most 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in 
financial statements.
Impairment of goodwill
The carrying amount of goodwill is $40.2 million. 
The Directors are confident that the carrying 
amount of goodwill is fairly stated, and have car-
ried out an impairment review (note 10).
Other intangible assets
The valuation of client relationships and client 
contracts is based on key assumptions, which 
the Directors have assessed, and are satisfied 
that the carrying value of these assets is fairly 
stated (see note 11). An impairment review has 
been carried out.
Fair value on acquisition
On acquisition management are required by 
IFRS3 to assess the fair value of assets and 
liabilities acquired. These assets and liabilities 
are often held at historical cost, which in some 
instances does not equal fair value. The Directors 
have assessed the fair value of assets and liabili-
ties in respect of the acquisition of the trade and 
certain assets. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and 
other key sources of estimation uncertainty at 
the reporting period, that may have a significant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the car-
rying amounts of assets and liabilities within the 
next financial year, are discussed below.
Deferred consideration
The Directors have provided an estimate of the 
amount payable in respect of deferred contin-
gent consideration. The valuation of this liability 
is based on future earnings of each acquired 
business. Management apply judgement in es-
timating the anticipated future cash flows and 
subsequent amounts payable. See note 17.
Trade receivables 
The Group’s customers include athletes, talent 
and large corporations. Whilst dependant on its 
most high profile clients the board believe that 
it has structures in place to mitigate the risk of 
non-payment. In addition the regulatory frame-
work around Major League Baseball in particular 
underpins this confidence. Historically there 
have been few instances of non-payment with 
late payers settling outstanding balances in an 
acceptable time frame. The enlarged group has 
over 884 clients which spread the risk going for-
ward. It is a focus of the Board to closely monitor 
receivables as part of its KPIs.

TLA Worldwide PLC / Annual Report 2015     FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES 
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that 
entities in the Group will be able to continue as 
going concern while maximising the return to 
shareholders through the optimisation of the 
debt and equity balance. The Group’s overall 
strategy remains unchanged from 2014.
The capital structure of the Group consists 
of net debt, which includes the borrowings dis-
closed in note 15 after deducting cash and cash 
equivalents, and equity attributable to equity 
holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, 
reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in 
the statement of changes in equity. 
The Group is not subject to any externally 
imposed capital requirements.
Debt is defined as long and short-term bor-
rowings (excluding derivatives) as detailed in 
note 15.
Equity includes all capital and reserves of the 
Group that are managed as capital.
Significant accounting policies
Details of the significant accounting policies 
and methods adopted (including the criteria for 
recognition, the basis of measurement and the 
bases for recognition of income and expenses) 
for each class of financial asset, financial liabil-
ity and equity instrument are disclosed within 
the principal accounting policies section of  
this report.

Current tax payable 1,662 953
46,253 29,430
All of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities, 
excluding derivative financial instruments, are 
held at amortised cost. The Directors are of the 
opinion that there is no material difference be-
tween the book value and the fair value of any of 
these assets or liabilities.
The Group’s international operations expose 
it to a number of risks that include the effect 
of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, 
credit, and interest rates. As the majority of 
income and expenditure is in USD the main 
exchange risk is translational in effect to the 
earnings and dividends granted, when related to 
the share price in GBP. The Group holds external 
credit, which is discussed below.
25.
69 Interest rate risk
The Group finances its activities through a mix-
ture of retained cash, operating cash flow, bank 
debt and equity finance. The Group monitors 
its exposure to interest rate risk in association 
with the bank debt and when investing its cash 
resources and has taken the decision to fix the 
50% of its outstanding term loan facility at 1.9% 
for period to 4 March 2020. Given this interest 
rate swap, interest rate fluctuations are not cur-
rently seen as sensitivity.
Credit risk
The Group’s customers include athletes, talent 
and large corporations. Whilst dependant on it 
most high profile clients the Board believe that 
it has structures in place to mitigate the risk of 
non-payment. In addition, the regulatory frame-
work around Major League Baseball in particular 
underpins this confidence. Historically there 
have been few instances of non-payment with 
late payers settling outstanding balances in an 
acceptable time frame. The enlarged group has 
over 840 clients which spread the risk going for-
ward. It is a focus of the Board to closely monitor 
receivables as part of its KPIs.
Liquidity risk
The Group has continued to maintain positive 
cash resources well above working capital re-
quirements, providing a strong balance sheet 
visible to the Group’s customer base, but also en-
suring sufficient available funds for operations, 
potential expansion or the potential financing of 
small acquisitions.
The following tables detail the Group’s re-
maining contractual maturity for its non-deriv-
ative financial liabilities with agreed repayment 
periods. The tables have been drawn up based 
on the undiscounted cash flows of financial lia-
bilities based on the earliest date on which the 
Group can be required to pay.

TLA Worldwide PLC / Annual Report 2015     Currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on foreign currency trading and the Group’s exposure to curren-
cy risk at the year-end can be illustrated by the following:

SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
Equity-settled share option scheme
In December 2013 the Company entered into a 
Long Term Incentive Scheme (“LTIP”) for cer-
tain employees of the Group. The first award 
under the LTIP was split into three tranches, 
exercisable when the share price reaches 
an average of £0.40, £0.50 and £0.60 for a 
three-month period respectively. The period 
for vesting of this award is five years from the 
Company’s IPO date of 8 December 2011. If the 
award remains unexercised after this period 
they expire. The award is forfeited if the em-
ployee leaves the Group before the award vests.  
In September 2015 a second award under 
the LTIP was made. This was also split into three 
tranches, exercisable when the share price 
reaches an average of £0.60, £0.70 and £0.80 for 
a three-month period respectively. The period 
for vesting of this award is two years from 30 
September 2015. If the award remains unexer -
cised after this period they expire. The award is 
forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before 
the award vests. 
Details of the LTIP awards outstanding during the year are as follows.

71 The awards outstanding at 31 December 2015 
had an exercise price of between £0.01 and £0.03 
and a weighted average remaining contractual 
life of 18 months. The aggregate of the estimated 
fair values of the first award is $1.79 million and 
the fair values of the second award is $4.55 mil-
lion. The inputs into the Monte Carlo model, as at 
the date of the LTIP being entered into, prior to 
the date of are as follows:
First Award 2015 2014
Weighted average exercise price £0.01–£0.03 £0.01
Expected volatility 15.9–30% 30.0%
Expected life 2–3 years 3 years
Risk-free rate 2.5–4.3% 4.3%
The group recognised total expenses of $1.29 
million (2014: $581,000) related to equity-set -
tled share-based payment transactions.
If the first award hurdle of £0.40 under the 
LTIP did not vest during the five-year period on 
the expiry of the LTIP an option over 5,998,683 
shares of the Company had been granted to the 
founders at an exercise price of 1p if satisfied by 
existing shares or 2p if satisfied by new shares 
As the £0.40 tranche under the first award has 
vested during the year the option automatically 
expired.
The group recognised total expenses of $1.02 
million (2014: $0.84 million) related to equi-
ty-settled share-based payment transactions.
ACQUISITIONS 
Elite Sports Properties ("ESP")
On 19 March 2015 the Group acquired the trade, 
assets and certain liabilities of Elite Sports 
Properties Holdings Pty Ltd, an Australian ath-
lete representation and sports marketing compa-
ny, and 55% of the share capital of Elite Sports 
Properties Merchandise Pty Limited (together 
“ESP”), for a total maximum consideration of 
AUD25.5 million payable over five years. Under 
the terms of the deal, the Group is paying up 
to AUD25.5 million for ESP, comprising an ini-
tial consideration of AUD13.5 million, of which 
AUD10.1 million is in cash and the balance by 
way of the issue of 3,939,800 ordinary shares 
of 2p each in TLA (“Shares”). The Shares were 
priced at 43.36p each, being the average closing 
market price over the seven days prior to com-
pletion of the deal. The further consideration of 
up to AUD12 million, of which half is payable on 
certain performance conditions being achieved 
for the three years ending 31 December 2017 and 
the balance subject to certain performance con-
ditions being achieved for the five years ending 
31 December 2019. Future earn out payments 
will be satisfied 75% cash and 25% in shares. The 
Group has an option to acquire the 45% of the 
equity of Elite Sports Properties Merchandise 
Pty Limited that it does not own from the first 
anniversary of acquisition.
ESP contributed $19.1 million to revenue; $9.7 
million to operating income; and $1.5 million 
to profit before tax for the period between the 
date of acquisition and the year end. Acquisition 
related costs (included in administrative ex-
penses and exceptional costs) amounted to  
$0.79 million.

TLA Worldwide PLC / Annual Report 2015     The carrying value and the fair value of the net assets of the acquisition were as follows:
*Converted at AUD/USD rate of 0.7797
The accounting policy alignment related to align-
ing ESP revenue recognition to that of the Group.
Fair value adjustments primarily comprise 
of recognition of intangibles fixed assets and 
associated deferred tax, together with certain 
adjustments to working capital items.
The goodwill is attributable to the work 
force, expected synergies and other intangible 
assets which do not qualify for separate recog-
nition. None of the goodwill is expected to be tax 
deductible.
The fair value of the 3,939,800 ordinary 
shares issued as part of the consideration was 
AUD3.66 million was determined by the amount 
of shares issued multiplied by the share price on 
the day of the transaction exchanged to AUD on 
the same day. 
The contingent consideration payable is 
based on the average EBIT for 3 years and the 5 
years ending 31 December 2017 and 31 December 
2019. The future potential range of the discount -
ed payment that the Group will have to make 
under the contingent consideration arrangement 
is between AUD nil and AUD 12 million. The fair 
value of the of the contingent consideration ar-
rangement of AUD 4.4 million is based current 
forecast performance of ESP over the period to 
31 December 2019.

75 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The Company meets the definition of a qualifying 
entity under Financial Reporting Standard (FRS 
101) ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ issued by 
the Financial Reporting Council. Accordingly, in 
the year ended 31 December 2015 the Company 
has changed its accounting framework from 
pre-2015 UK GAAP to FRS 101 and has, in doing 
so, applied the requirements of IFRS 1.6-33 and 
related appendices. These financial statements 
have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101. 
In preparing the opening and subsequent FRS 
101 Balance Sheet no conversion adjustments 
were required from UK GAAP. 
As the Company previously applied the FRS 1 ex -
emption from presenting a Cash Flow Statement 
under UK GAAP, no cash flow has been provided.
As permitted by Section 408 of the 
Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected 
not to present its own profit and loss account for 
the year. The Company’s profit and loss account 
was approved by the Board on 11 April 2016. The 
Company reported a profit for the year ended 31 
December 2015 of $2.0 million.
The principal accounting policies of the 
Company are set out below. 
Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost, less 
provision for impairment.
Classification of financial instruments 
issued by the Company
Financial instruments issued by the Company 
are treated as equity (i.e. forming part of share-
holders’ funds) only to the extent that they meet 
the following two conditions:
 � They include no contractual obligations 
upon the Company to deliver cash or other 
financial assets or exchange financial assets 
or financial liabilities with another party 
under conditions that are potentially unfa-
vourable to the Company; and
 � Where the instrument will or may be settled 
in the Company’s equity instruments, it is 
either a non-derivative that includes no ob-
ligation to deliver a variable number of the 
Company’s own equity instruments or is a 
derivative that will be settled by the Company 
exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other 
financial assets for a fixed number of its own 
equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, 
the proceeds of issue are classified as financial 
liability. Where the instruments for call up share 
capital and share premium account excludes 
amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial 
liabilities are dealt with as part with as part of 
finance expenses. Finance payments associated 
with financial instruments that are classified in 
equity are dividends and are recorded directly in 
equity.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises 
current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the 
profit and loss account except to the extent that 
it relates to items recognised directly in equity in 
which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected on all tax payable 
on the taxable income for the year, using tax 
rates enacted or subsequently enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax 
payable in respect of the previous year.
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing dif-
ference where the transactions or events that 
give the Company an obligation to pay more tax 
in the future, or a right to pay less in the future, 
have occurred by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax assets are recognised when it is 
more likely than not that they will be recovered. 
Deferred tax is measured using rates of tax that 
have been enacted or subsequently enacted by 
the balance sheet date.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded 
at the rate of exchange at the date of the trans-
action or, if hedged, at the forward contract rate. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are 
reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that 
date or , if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.

Notes to the notice of annual  
general meeting
1. Entitlement to attend and vote
Only those members registered on the 
Company’s register of members at: 
›  6.00 pm (London time) on 20 June 
2016; or,
›   if this meeting is adjourned, at 6.00 
pm (London time) on the day two 
business days prior to the adjourned 
meeting, shall be entitled to attend 
and vote at the meeting.
2. Appointment of proxies
If you are a member of the Company 
at the time set out in note 1 above, you 
are entitled to appoint a proxy to exer-
cise all or any of your rights to attend, 
speak and vote at the meeting and you 
should have received a proxy form with 
this notice of meeting. You can only ap-
point a proxy using the procedures set 
out in these notes and the notes to the 
proxy form.
A proxy does not need to be a 
member of the Company but must 
attend the meeting to represent you. 
Details of how to appoint the chairman 
of the meeting or another person as 
your proxy using the proxy form are 
set out in the notes to the proxy form. 
If you wish your proxy to speak on your 
behalf at the meeting you will need to 
appoint your own choice of proxy (not 
the chairman) and give your instruc-
tions directly to them.
You may appoint more than one 
proxy provided each proxy is ap-
pointed to exercise rights attached to 
different shares. You may not appoint 
more than one proxy to exercise rights 
attached to any one share. To appoint 
more than one proxy, please refer to 
the notes to the proxy form.
A vote withheld is not a vote in law, 
which means that the vote will not be 
counted in the calculation of votes for 
or against the resolution. If no voting 
indication is given, your proxy will vote 
or abstain from voting at his or her 
discretion. Your proxy will vote (or ab-
stain from voting) as he or she thinks 
fit in relation to any other matter 
which is put before the meeting.
3. Appointment of proxy using hard 
copy proxy form
The notes to the proxy form explain 
how to direct your proxy how to vote 
on each resolution or withhold their 
vote.
To appoint a proxy using the proxy 
form, the form must be:
›  completed and signed;
›  sent or delivered to Neville Registrars 
Limited at Neville House, 18 Laurel 
Lane, Halesowen, B63 3DA; and
›  received by Neville Registrars no 
later than 8.30 am (London time) 
two business days prior to the meeting.
81 In the case of a member which is a 
company, the proxy form must be exe-
cuted under its common seal or signed 
on its behalf by an officer of the com-
pany or an attorney for the company.
Any power of attorney or any other au-
thority under which the proxy form is 
signed (or a duly certified copy of such 
power or authority) must be included 
with the proxy form.
4. Appointment of proxies through CREST
CREST members who wish to appoint a 
proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST 
electronic proxy appointment service 
may do so for the meeting and any 
adjournment(s) of it by using the pro-
cedures described in the CREST Manual 
(available from https://www.euroclear.
com/site/public/EUI). CREST Personal 
Members or other CREST sponsored 
members, and those CREST members 
who have appointed a voting service 
provider(s), should refer to their CREST 
sponsor or voting service provider(s), 
who will be able to take the appropri-
ate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment 
made by means of CREST to be valid, 
the appropriate CREST message (a 
“CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be 
properly authenticated in accordance 
with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s 
(“EUI”) specifications and must con-
tain the information required for 
such instructions, as described in the 
CREST Manual. The message must be 
transmitted so as to be received by 
the issuer’s agent (ID 7RA11) by 8.30 
am (London time) two days prior to 
the meeting. For this purpose, the 
time of receipt will be taken to be the 
time (as determined by the timestamp 
applied to the message by the CREST 
Applications Host) from which the 
issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the 
message by enquiry to CREST in the 
manner prescribed by CREST.
CREST members and, where appli-
cable, their CREST sponsors or voting 
service providers should note that 
EUI does not make available special 
procedures in CREST for any particu-
lar messages. Normal system timings 
and limitations will therefore apply in 
relation to the input of CREST Proxy 
Instructions. It is the responsibility of 
the CREST member concerned to take 
(or, if the CREST member is a CREST 
personal member or sponsored mem-
ber or has appointed a voting service 
provider(s), to procure that his CREST 
sponsor or voting service provider(s) 
take(s)) such action as shall be neces-
sary to ensure that a message is trans-
mitted by means of the CREST system 
by any particular time. In this con-
nection, CREST members and, where 
applicable, their CREST sponsors or 
voting service providers are referred, 
in particular, to those sections of the 
CREST Manual concerning practical 
limitations of the CREST system and 
timings.
The Company may treat as invalid 
a CREST Proxy Instruction in the cir-
cumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)
(a) of the Uncertificated Securities 
Regulations 2001.
5. Appointment of proxy by joint 
members
In the case of joint holders, where 
more than one of the joint holders pur-
ports to appoint a proxy, only the ap-
pointment submitted by the most se-
nior holder will be accepted. Seniority 
is determined by the order in which 
the names of the joint holders appear 
in the Company’s register of members 
in respect of the joint holding (the first-
named being the most senior).
6. Changing proxy instructions
To change your proxy instructions sim-
ply submit a new proxy appointment 
using the methods set out above. Note 
that the cut-off time for receipt of 
proxy appointments (see above) also 
apply in relation to amended instruc-
tions; any amended proxy appointment 
received after the relevant cut-off time 
will be disregarded.
Where you have appointed a proxy 
using the hard-copy proxy form and 
would like to change the instructions 
using another hard-copy proxy form, 
please contact Neville Registrars 
Limited at Neville House, 18 Laurel 
Lane, Halesowen, B63 3DA.
If you submit more than one valid 
proxy appointment, the appointment 
received last before the latest time 
for the receipt of proxies will take 
precedence
7. Termination of proxy appointments
In order to revoke a proxy instruction 
you will need to inform the Company 
by sending a signed hard copy notice 
clearly stating your intention to revoke 
your proxy appointment to Neville 
Registrars Limited at Neville House, 
18 Laurel Lane, Halesowen, B63 3DA. 
In the case of a member, which is a 
company, the revocation notice must 
be executed under its common seal or 
signed on its behalf by an officer of the 
company or an attorney for the compa-
ny. Any power of attorney or any other 
authority under which the revocation 
notice is signed (or a duly certified 
copy of such power or authority) must 
be included with the revocation notice.
The revocation notice must be 
received by Neville Registrars no later 
than 8.30 pm (London time) two days 
prior to the meeting.
If you attempt to revoke your 
proxy appointment but the revocation 
is received after the time specified 
then, subject to the paragraph directly 
below, your proxy appointment will 
remain valid.
Appointment of a proxy does 
not preclude you from attending the 
meeting and voting in person. If you 
have appointed a proxy and attend the 
meeting in person, your proxy appoint-
ment will automatically be terminated.
8. Corporate representatives
A corporation which is a member can 
appoint one or more corporate rep-
resentatives who may exercise, on its 
behalf, all its powers as a member pro-
vided that no more than one corporate 
representative exercises powers over 
the same share.
9. Communication
Except as provided above, members 
who have general queries about 
the meeting should contact Neville 
Registrars Limited on 0121 585 1131 (no 
other methods of communication will 
be accepted).
You may not use any electronic 
address provided either:
›  in this notice of annual general 
meeting; or 
›  any related documents (including the 
proxy form), to communicate with 
the Company for any purposes other 
than those expressly stated.

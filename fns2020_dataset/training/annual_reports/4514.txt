Turnover:
2001/2002
I am pleased to report that De Vere Group
once again made good progress during
the year in a very difficult trading market.
Central to this progress was continued
sales growth despite these testing
conditions, especially in the hotel market,
and Greens moving into profit as
expected. Both our hotel brands continue
to outperform the market with De Vere
Hotels once again increasing its RevPAR
premium. 
One of the key highlights of the year was
the successful staging of the 34th Ryder
Cup Matches at The De Vere Belfry in
September. This event showcased the 
De Vere brand to a global audience and
can only have increased brand awareness
as a result. The expansion of the Group
continues on schedule with the opening
during the year of the 14th Village Hotel
and Leisure Club and four new Greens
Health & Fitness clubs. I am also delighted
to report that the refurbishment of the 
De Vere Cavendish St. James’s has been
completed. 
Group turnover for the year ended 
29 September 2002 was £293.9 million,
an increase of 7.3% (2001: £273.8
million), whilst EBITDA before exceptional
items rose by 7.2% from £70.0 million to
£75.0 million. Operating profit from
continuing operations on a pre-
exceptional basis was up 4.2% to 
£51.9 million from £49.8 million. Profit
before tax was £38.5 million compared
with a loss last year of £18.1 million.
Earnings per share, excluding exceptional
items, were 23.55 pence (2001: 21.22
pence restated).
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final
dividend of 7.35 pence per ordinary
share, which, when taken together with
the interim dividend of 3.95 pence,
represents a total dividend of 11.30 pence,
an increase of 6.6%. This is payable on 
21 February 2003 to shareholders on the
register on 24 January 2003. 
Board
David Reid retired from the Board in 
April 2002 and, on behalf of the Group, 
I would like to thank him for his long 
and valued contribution. In the following
month we were delighted to welcome
Debbie Howard as a Non-executive
Director, who brings an added dimension
to the Board through her experience as
Group Human Resources Director of 
RAC plc.
People
On behalf of the Board, I would like to
thank all the Group’s employees for their
commitment, support and enthusiasm in
playing their part to help the Group
achieve its goals of delivering excellent
service to our customers and, in so doing,
creating value for our shareholders.

G&J Greenall 0.3 I am delighted to report that all the
Group’s brands made steady progress
during the year despite the slowing UK
economy. Both Village Hotels & Leisure
Clubs and Greens Health & Fitness
continued their organic growth and 
De Vere Hotels continued to trade 
robustly whilst addressing specific 
projects, including hosting The Ryder Cup
at The De Vere Belfry and the
refurbishment of the De Vere Cavendish
St. James’s. RevPAR for the UK hotel
market as a whole declined by 2.9% in
the provinces and by more than 14% in
London, whilst the health & fitness
market continued to grow. 
The resilience of our two hotel brands
under these market conditions
demonstrates the breadth of their
respective consumer offerings. Both
brands have differing mixes to their
income streams and customers compared
to their peer group and this enhanced
stability, in turn, provides the Group with
a strong competitive edge in difficult
market conditions. During the year, we
maintained our focus on training and also
reorganised our sales force and other
support teams to bring greater
operational efficiencies. This continuing
investment in our staff allows us to deliver
the fundamental skills of any hospitality
business – first class service.
Our commitment to improve all aspects of
our brand delivery resulted in De Vere
Hotels receiving a major award from the
British Development Research Consultants
(BDRC) in December 2001. This recognises
the increasing levels of both awareness
and brand loyalty that exist amongst our
strong and growing customer base.
Hosting The Ryder Cup was a significant
endorsement of the Group’s capabilities
in hospitality management and reinforces
De Vere’s position as a leading hotel and
conference group of outstanding quality.
The tournament, which took place in the
final week of the financial year, provided a
global platform from which to accelerate
the Group’s growing brand awareness,
reaching a worldwide television audience
of one billion including 26% of the UK
population. The Ryder Cup is now the
third largest televised sporting event in
the world. It attracted more than 180,000
visitors to The De Vere Belfry, who
witnessed first-hand the Group’s ability to
manage a world class event as well as an
excellent sporting contest. A high
proportion of these visitors were
influential business decision-makers and,
quite possibly, future conference clients.

De Vere Hotels
At the year end, De Vere had 21 hotels
with 3,298 rooms (2001: 3,316) and
23,500 health & fitness members 
(2001: 22,400), an increase of 4.9%. 
During the year there were few signs of 
a sustainable recovery in demand in the
business and overseas visitor markets.
However, we are very pleased to report
that De Vere’s sales still grew by 1.8% to
£177.8 million (2001: £174.7 million). 
On a like-for-like basis total turnover rose
by 2.1%, whilst RevPAR grew by 1.4% to
£59.58. This compares to a decline in
RevPAR for the provincial hotel market of
2.9%. Like-for-like occupancy was
marginally down by 0.9 points to 74.1%
reflecting weakened demand.
Nevertheless, the average achieved rate
grew by 2.6% to £80.36 as a
consequence of our resilient stance on
pricing across all market segments.
EBITDA, excluding exceptional items,
reduced by 2.0% to £48.4 million (2001:
£49.4 million) and operating profit on the
same basis declined by 3.1% to £35.3
million (2001: £36.4 million). Increases in
business rates due to the rating revaluation
and climate change levy affected the first
half, whilst increased insurance premiums
impacted the whole year.
Although demand in the mid-week
business market was down, for both the
conference and corporate market, there
was a successful switch in focus to the
stronger short-break market, especially
during the first half. This is a testimony to
both our flexible approach and the
breadth of our offering. We continued
with our brand-building campaign over
the summer period and maintained a
robust stance on discounting, which was a
prevalent feature of this market segment. 
The refurbishment of the De Vere
Cavendish St. James’s has been completed
on schedule and the hotel is now
operating with 231 (2001: 250)
bedrooms. The hotel has been
repositioned as a leading 4-star deluxe
hotel in central London and will further
leverage the Group’s extensive client base.
During the refurbishment, the hotel
operated with a reduced number of
bedrooms and experienced similar trading
to the London market in general. The
benefits of the repositioning are already
being experienced both with positive
feedback and, more importantly, in a
steady rise in achieved room rates. 
Building on the success of The Ryder Cup,
the Group has been seeking opportunities
of raising the brand profile on a global
scale and has signed a sales and
marketing alliance with Destination Hotels
& Resorts in the USA. This agreement will
enable us to leverage the brand in the
North American market.
The ongoing and controlled refurbishment
programme of our bedstock and facilities
at a number of our hotels, to maintain the
quality of our estate in line with the 
De Vere brand positioning, will continue.
The steady growth of De Vere Resort
Ownership has been maintained. We have
met our target of building a further 11
lodges during the year, bringing the total
number to 126 at three of our resort
properties. An additional development
phase of six units has begun at De Vere
Slaley Hall for completion in August 2003.

By the year end the number of Village

with 1,243 rooms (2001: 1,089). Health &
fitness membership had grown by 14.9%
to 56,800 members (2001: 49,500).
Turnover for Village rose 13.2% to 
£64.2 million (2001: £56.7 million). On a
like-for-like basis, sales grew by 2.1% and
RevPAR by 0.7% to £40.59, against an
industry decline of 2.9%. On a similar
basis occupancy was down by 1.8
percentage points to 79.2%. Achieved
rates rose by 3.1% to £51.25, the latter
once again reflecting our resilient pricing
stance. EBITDA grew by 9.2% to £19.2
million (2001: £17.6 million) and
operating profit increased by 6.0% to
£13.4 million (2001: £12.6 million).
Like De Vere Hotels, there was a similar
and successful switch in focus, from the
weak corporate market to the more
resilient short-break market. The
performance of Village relative to the
market demonstrates both the strength
and uniqueness of the brand. Village Bury,
which opened in August 2001, has now
delivered a full year’s contribution and is
meeting its targeted returns. Our 14th
Village hotel opened in Newcastle in June
2002 and it too is meeting trading
expectations. 
This hotel also includes some new design
modifications which will be used on
future new builds. A more flexible design
brief has been created which will be
adapted to meet differing local demand.
This, together with a smaller site
requirement, increases the potential of
our brand and expands the range of
possible new sites. 
We are now poised to move into the
South of England, which will be an
important step in the brand’s
development. Contracts have been
exchanged at Maidstone and
Bournemouth. Two further sites in the
Midlands, Perry Barr and North
Birmingham, are subject to planning
consent. There will be a phased opening
programme of these four sites over the
next few years, with the first due to open
in Summer 2004. We are continuing to
seek further sites that will meet our strict
development criteria.

Greens Health & Fitness 
It has been a year of substantial progress
for Greens, our health & fitness brand,
which moved into profit as expected.
During the year, a further four clubs were
opened at Chingford, Gosforth, Shipley
and Leicester and total membership stood
at 59,300 members as at 29 September
2002 (2001: 37,000). Our target of 15
clubs will be achieved by the end of
December with the scheduled opening at
Giffnock, South Glasgow.
Turnover increased by 78.3% to £24.0
million (2001: £13.5 million) with like-for-
like sales up by 13.0%. EBITDA increased
to £4.8 million (2001: £0.5 million) and
an operating profit of £1.3 million was
achieved in the year (2001: operating loss
£1.0 million). 
In a market that is still growing, there was
a successful drive for new members over
the summer months. Average club
membership is over 4,000. After three
years of expansion, the emphasis for the
forthcoming year is on optimising unit
profitability, cash flow and strengthening
Greens’ position as a player at the
premium end of the market.
G&J Greenall
Due to a decline of marginal own label
products in favour of higher contribution
branded products, total sales decreased
by 3.7% to £27.9 million (2001: £28.9
million). Operating profit for the full year
increased, however, by 6.5% to 
£1.9 million (2001: £1.8 million). 
Current Trading & Outlook
During the first eight weeks of the current
financial year, total Group turnover has
increased by 7.4% on 2001. RevPAR on a
like-for-like basis for De Vere Hotels has
increased by 3.7%, with sales up 1.6%.
On a similar basis, RevPAR at Village
Hotels & Leisure Clubs has increased by
2.3%, with sales up by 4.7%. Greens total
sales have increased by 47.1%.
We are pleased with recent trading,
although we remain cautious about
extrapolating a trend because of the
nature of the comparative figures. Looking
ahead, the outlook is still uncertain with
the extent and timing of recovery
remaining difficult to predict. However, we
have confidence that our brands will
continue to outperform the market.

14 DE VERE GROUP PLC FINANCIAL REVIEW
In what has been a tough year for the UK
hotel market the Group has achieved
creditable growth, increasing turnover by
7.3% to £293.9 million (2001: £273.8
million) and operating profit on
continuing activities excluding exceptional
items by 4.2% to £51.9 million (2001:
£49.8 million).
During the year, De Vere Hotels have
mitigated a downturn in the upper
provincial conference and corporate
market with increased short leisure break
business. The Village and Greens brands
have been expanded through the opening
of Village Newcastle and four further
Greens clubs in the year.
The increasing maturity of the existing
Greens units is reflected in an operating
profit of £1.3 million being achieved in the
year (2001: operating loss £1.0 million).
Interest
Net interest charges for the year increased
from £12.7 million to £14.1 million,
primarily due to an increase in Group
borrowings to fund the expansion of
Village and Greens; net interest was
covered 3.7 times by operating profit
before exceptional items (2001: 3.6 times).
Taxation
FRS 19 – Deferred Tax has been
implemented in the accounts for the first
time this year. As a consequence the tax
charge in the profit and loss account
represents 30.2% of profit before
taxation. Prior year figures have been
restated resulting in an increase to the
2001 tax charge of £4.9 million; the net
effect on the prior year adjustment was to
reduce opening net assets by £1.3 million;
see Note 18 for details.
The actual Corporation tax payable is
substantially lower than the profit and
loss charge as a result of the availability of
brought forward tax losses and
accelerated capital allowances on our
capital expenditure programme.
Cash Flow
The principal cash movements deriving
from continuing operations during the
period were an operating cash flow of
£69.2 million before exceptional outflows
of £11.0 million, primarily a special
contribution to the pension scheme, and
net capital expenditure of £50.4 million
resulting from our continuing investment
programme.
Gearing
Gearing at the year end was 40.5%
(2001: 38.7%). Borrowings as at 
29 September 2002 amounted to 
£228.1 million (2001: £211.3 million), 
an increase of £16.8 million.
Treasury 
Group treasury operations are managed
centrally as a service function and operate
within a formal treasury policy approved
by the Treasury Committee. This
committee, which has formal terms of
reference from the Board, is responsible
for the development and review of
treasury policy, procedures and reporting.
The primary objectives of treasury policy
are to ensure that adequate and cost-
effective funding arrangements are
maintained to finance current and
planned future activities and that
exposure to financial risk is minimised.
Funding Arrangements
The 7% Convertible subordinated bonds
mature on 24 September 2003 and,
consequently, have been classified within
current liabilities in the year end balance
sheet.
The Group intends to repay the
Convertible bonds using its existing 
£175 million Revolving Credit Facility and
a new US $100 million loan note facility,
the terms of which have been agreed
subject to final documentation.
At the year end, committed funding of
£290.2 million (2001: £291.0 million) was
in place from both bank and debt market
sources. Of these facilities £120.0 million
was undrawn as at 29 September 2002
(2001: £139.0 million).
Further details of the Group’s borrowings
at the financial year end are disclosed in
Note 15 to the Accounts. 
good results in difficult
market conditions. FINANCIAL REVIEW ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 15
Financial Risk Management
In order to manage the risk of exposure to
fluctuating interest rates and to assist
long-term planning, the Group continues
to maintain the majority of its debt at
fixed rates of interest. To this end, the
Group entered into a £20 million interest
rate swap contract, in March 2002, to fix
rates for five years at 5.31%. An analysis
of fixed rate borrowings is provided in
Note 15 to the accounts. At the year end
61% of borrowings were at fixed rates of
interest.
Changes in floating interest rates will
have a marginal impact on interest
payable by the Group due to the
significant proportion of borrowings
being at fixed interest rates. It is
estimated that a one percentage point
change in floating rates would affect
interest payable during the next financial
year by approximately £1.3 million. 
The proposed $100 million US Private
Placement debt has been hedged to
provide Sterling proceeds of £63.3 million.
The interest cash flows throughout the
term of the debt have also been hedged
as disclosed in Note 15. Aside from these
borrowings, transactions conducted in
foreign currencies are not significant in the
context of the Group’s overall business.
Shareholders’ Returns
Basic earnings per share, excluding
exceptional items, increased by 11.0% to
23.55 pence.
The Board is recommending a final
dividend of 7.35 pence per Ordinary share.
Ordinary dividends for the year of 11.30
pence per share are covered 2.1 times by
earnings before exceptional items (2001:
10.6 pence covered 2.0 times).
Pensions
The financial statements comply with the
transitional disclosure requirements of 
FRS 17 – Retirement Benefits. Note 17 to
the Accounts on pages 47 to 50 disclose
the funding position of the Greenalls
Group Pension & Life Assurance scheme.
This defined benefit scheme is closed to
new members and, due to the mature
profile of membership, 67% of the
investments are now held in fixed interest
gilts and long-dated corporate bonds.
At the year end the scheme’s expected
liabilities have been adversely affected by
a reduction in the long-term discount
rate, applied to estimated future pension
liabilities, from 6.2% to 5.6%.
The next actuarial valuation of the scheme
will take place in April 2003 and the
ongoing funding of the scheme will be
reviewed in conjunction with these
valuation results.
Future Developments
The Group has produced good results for
the year and is well placed to both
expand its Village network and take
advantage of an upturn in the London
hotel market.

Employment Report 
In line with the Group’s objective of
facilitating and supporting a learning
culture, De Vere Hotels, Village Hotels &
Leisure Clubs and G&J Greenall are
accredited Investors in People. The Group is
committed to developing policies which
encourage all employees to achieve job
satisfaction and career development
through doing a worthwhile job well,
knowing that their contribution is valued
and their potential recognised and
developed. It is critical to the Group that
staff enjoy what they do and understand
how they are adding value to the business,
both individually and as part of a team.
The Group emphasises equal opportunities
in recruitment, terms and conditions of
employment, promotion and training for all
employees and encourages them to
develop their full potential regardless of
gender, marital status, social class, age,
colour, national or ethnic origin, religious
belief, sexual orientation or disability.
We actively encourage employees to
participate in the development of the
business and in matters which affect them
through briefings, representative and
consultative groups, employee opinion
surveys and suggestion schemes. Our
continually developing reward and
recognition arrangements include the
opportunity for staff to acquire shares in
the Company.
Health & Safety
Health and safety continues to be of
paramount importance to the Group.
Customer demand for safety is continuing
to grow and the health and safety of our
staff and our guests remains fundamental
to all our activities.
At the beginning of the year we undertook
to complete a review of risk management
systems, both for food safety and health
and safety. Whilst we have achieved this,
we recognise the process will remain
ongoing as we continue to seek to improve
our safety performance.
We also continue to monitor at Board 
level our accident and legal compliance
performance. Reportable accidents are
reviewed, as is local authority enforcement
activity.
We have continued to invest in risk
prevention and risk control measures, and
this, together with our continued
commitment to staff training, is ensuring
that health and safety remains high on
everyone’s agenda. Along with the
continued programme of risk reduction
throughout the estate, we have achieved
our objective to provide a platform from
which to build to continuously improve
safety performance to the benefit of all. REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS

18 DE VERE GROUP PLC REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
Environmental Policy
Energy consumption is our biggest
environmental issue and our continuing
challenge is to minimise energy use. We
benchmark gas and electricity consumption
in sites across the Group and use this
information to apply best practice. Energy
efficiency remains a key feature of our
design, maintenance and refurbishment
programmes.
Various energy efficiency initiatives have
been trialled and implemented during the
year, including alternative heating and
energy management schemes, the active
procurement of energy efficient plant and
equipment, high efficiency boilers and low
energy lighting. As a consequence, at the
majority of sites, average energy usage per
unit has fallen by approximately 3% during
the year.
We also monitor and benchmark water
usage to allow comparisons to be made
between sites and to identify areas where
savings can be achieved.
Our waste conservation programmes are
continuing; the recycling of glass and
paper is being achieved through
nominated group contractors and
compactors have been installed at several
sites to minimise the volume of waste.
We are also working with our supply-chain
and encouraging our suppliers to develop
environmentally superior processes and
packaging to improve overall environmental
performance. This year saw the switch of
our preferred supplier for cleaning
chemicals to a company that have been
innovative in producing a new product line
and alternative packaging to lessen
environmental impact.
Supplier Payment Policy
The Group negotiates payment
arrangements and other terms and
conditions with all of its principal suppliers.
Payments to suppliers are made in
accordance with negotiated arrangements
other than in the event of a dispute. The
number of days purchases outstanding at
29 September 2002 was 57 for the Group
and 52 for the Company.
Charitable Donations and Investment
in the Community
Charitable donations totalled £98,700
(2001: £99,100) during the year and no
donation was made to any political party. 
The Group continues to recognise its
responsibility to the community and
actively encourages employees to involve
themselves in the causes and charities
closest to their own community. A
substantial level of community involvement,
staff commitment and sponsorship activity
is organised through our national network
of hotels, leisure clubs and offices. 
Auditors
In accordance with section 385 of the
Companies Act 1985 a resolution re-
appointing Ernst & Young LLP as auditors
for the ensuing year will be proposed at
the Company’s Annual General Meeting.
Special Business of Annual 
General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting is to be held
at 11.30 am on 14 February 2003 at 
De Vere Oulton Hall, Rothwell Lane,
Oulton, Leeds, Yorkshire, LS26 8HN.

By Order of the Board,
D C Edwards 
Company Secretary
4 December 2002 STATEMENT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
STATEMENT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 19
Corporate Governance
The Company complies with the detailed
Corporate Governance provisions of the
Combined Code incorporated into the
Listing Rules for quoted companies. The
Group complied with all Combined Code
requirements throughout the year.
Board Structure and Processes
The Board consists of its Non-executive
Chairman, its Chief Executive, Finance
Director and four Non-executive Directors,
with Mr A M Jackson as the senior Non-
executive Director. All members of the
Board submit themselves for re-election
every three years.
The Board meets at least every two months
during the year. The Board receives detailed
financial information on the business
performance in addition to items for
decision in advance of each Board Meeting.
The Directors are therefore able to make
informed decisions on corporate and
business issues under consideration.
The Non-executive Chairman, Lord
Daresbury, is responsible for the effective
operation and chairing of the Board. In
view of the previous positions he has held
with the company and his substantial
shareholding he is not considered to be an
independent director. Mr S P Morgan, with
his substantial shareholding, is also not
considered to be an independent director.
The Company Secretary is responsible for
ensuring that Board processes and
procedures are appropriately followed and
support effective decision making. All
Directors have access to the Company
Secretary’s advice and services and there is
also a formal procedure for Directors to
obtain independent professional advice in
the course of their duties, if necessary, at
the Company’s expense.
Audit Committee
The Company has an Audit Committee
consisting of Non-executive Directors under
the chairmanship of Mr N N Walmsley. 
The members of the Audit Committee are
as disclosed on page 16. In addition, 
Mr D E Reid served as Chairman of the
committee up to the date of his
resignation. It meets at least three times a
year and its terms of reference follow those
recommended by the Combined Code. 
The external Auditors are invited to attend
all the Audit Committee meetings and
other Board members are invited to attend
as appropriate. Part of each meeting of the
Audit Committee may be held between the
Non-executive Directors and the external
Auditors in private.
In addition, the Audit Committee keeps the
level of non-audit services, provided by the
Auditors, under review. Further details of
non-audit fees are disclosed in Note 2.
Remuneration Committee
The Chairman of this committee
throughout the year was Mr A M Jackson.
Mr Jackson resigned as Chairman on 
29 September 2002 and has been replaced
in this capacity by Ms D Howard. The
committee meets at least once a year to
determine the remuneration and other
terms of service of the Executive Directors
and to review their performance. Details of
the policy on the remuneration of directors
are given in the Report on Directors’
Remuneration. The members of the
Remuneration Committee also authorise
the granting of options under the Executive
Share Option Scheme. The Report on
Directors’ Remuneration is set out on pages
21 to 23.
Nomination Committee
The Company has a Nomination Committee
which consists of Non-executive Directors
under the Chairmanship of Mr A M Jackson.
This committee recommends to the Board
the appointment of all Executive and Non-
executive Directors.
Relations with Shareholders
Communications with shareholders are
given high priority. The operating and
financial review on pages 6 to 15 includes
a detailed review of the business and
future developments of the Group. There is
regular dialogue with institutional
shareholders including presentations after
the Company’s announcement of the half
year and year end results, and following
any strategic activity. 
The Board uses the Annual General
Meeting as an important means of
communication with private and
institutional investors and welcomes their
participation. The Chairman aims to ensure
that the Chairmen of the Audit,
Remuneration and Nomination committees
are available at Annual General Meetings
to answer questions. Details of resolutions
to be proposed at the Annual General
Meeting on 14 February 2003 can be
found in the Notice of Meeting.
To further improve communications with
shareholders, the Group has a website
(www.deveregroupplc.co.uk) dedicated to
corporate information such as: current and
historical financial reports, presentations
and press releases together with a link to
the current share price. Following recently
passed Government legislation, we now
offer our shareholders the option of
receiving electronic versions of shareholder
communications, including the annual and
interim reports. Information regarding this
service can be downloaded directly from
the corporate website.
Internal Control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s
system of internal control and for reviewing
its effectiveness. The system of internal
control is designed to manage the risks of
not meeting business objectives and is
intended to provide reasonable and not
absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
The principal elements of the Group’s
system of internal control and risk
management, that comply with the
Turnbull guidance and which were in place
throughout the year under review and up
to the date of approval of the Accounts,
are as follows:
•A risk management report that is
reviewed at each meeting of the Board of
Directors. This report summarises all
foreseen strategic, operational, financial,
technical and environmental risks that
could prevent the achievement of
business objectives.
• All major risks identified in the risk
management reports are assessed and
allocated to specific individuals as
appropriate. Action plans to mitigate the
identified risks are in place. STATEMENT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Continued
20 DE VERE GROUP PLC STATEMENT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
•A detailed budget is prepared for the
following financial year along with a
strategic plan for the subsequent three
years. Actual results are reported monthly
and compared to both budget and prior
year results. Operational performance of
the hotels is reviewed against external
industry benchmarks.
•A formal appraisal and approval process
is operated for all items of capital
expenditure. Projects are required to
demonstrate achievement of appropriate
operational and financial criteria.
•Key systems and controls are documented
and, on a monthly basis, self-certification
reports are signed off by heads of finance
functions across the Group.
• Internal audits are conducted in
accordance with a rolling programme.
Each hotel or business unit is audited at
least once each year, with further audits
being conducted in accordance with
perceived risk.
• The Group has a clearly defined
organisational structure which allows
appropriate segregation of duty.
Employees have prescribed authority
levels.
All aspects of Internal Control are
considered and monitored regularly by the
Board of Directors and the Audit
Committee.
The Directors confirm that they have
reviewed the effectiveness of the Internal
Control system in accordance with the
above procedures.
Going Concern
The Directors consider, after making
enquiries, that the Company has adequate
resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future and,
accordingly, that it is appropriate to adopt
the going concern basis in the preparation
of the Accounts.  REPORT ON DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
REPORT ON DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 21
Remuneration Policy
The aim of the Group’s remuneration
policy is to attract, motivate and retain
high quality individuals who will contribute
fully to the success of each of the Group’s
businesses. Competitive salaries and
benefits are provided to all employees in a
range of formats appropriate to the variety
of skill groups and markets in which the
Group operates. These include
performance-related annual pay reviews
and incentive schemes based on the
achievement of Group, Company and local
objectives.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is
responsible for determining the
emoluments of Executive Directors and for
the overall reward policy for Senior
Executives. The Committee’s members are
Mr A M Jackson, Mr N N Walmsley and 
Ms D Howard, and since 30 September
2002 it has been chaired by Ms D Howard.
Until his resignation on 30 April 2002 
Mr D E Reid was also a member of the
Remuneration Committee. Where
appropriate, the Committee obtains
independent professional advice on all
aspects of executive remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee does not
consider the fees payable to Non-executive
Directors, which are determined by the
Executive Directors.
Executive Directors’ Remuneration
Remuneration is reviewed annually or when
a change of responsibility occurs. The
Company’s policy, both during the past
year and for the forthcoming and
subsequent financial years, is to provide
levels of remuneration which are in line
with comparable jobs in the market place
and which will motivate and retain high
performing individuals.
Non-executive Directors’ Remuneration
So far as the Non-executive Directors are
concerned the Company’s policy is to
provide levels of remuneration which
reflect the duties and responsibilities of
each of the Non-executive Directors and
which are in line with market rates.
Performance Related Bonuses
Bonuses for Executive Directors, up to a
maximum of 50% of current basic salary,
are based on improvement in Group profit
excluding exceptional items.
Profit targets are set at the beginning of
each financial year and are reviewed
throughout the year.
For the year ending 29 September 2002 the
Executive Directors were awarded a bonus
of 36.35% of salary. The profit target for
the payment of this bonus was an increase
in the previous year’s EBIT of 10% or more.
Pensions
The Executive Directors are members of the
Group Pension Scheme. The standard
pension arrangements for Directors are
that they accrue pension at 1/30th of final
pensionable salary, for each year of service
up to normal retirement age of 60. If
Directors retire before the age of 60 a
reduced pension is payable. Benefits are
subject to the limits laid down by the
Inland Revenue, including a maximum
annual pension of two thirds final salary.
Details of Directors’ pension arrangements
are given on page 23.
On death before retirement, a life
assurance lump sum is payable together
with a spouse’s pension of 50% of the
Director’s accrued pension. On death after
retirement, a spouse’s pension of 50% of
the member’s pre-commutation pension is
payable. In the event of death after leaving
service but prior to commencement of
pension, a spouse’s pension equal to 50%
of the accrued preserved pension is
payable. Protection is also provided in the
event of serious ill health.
Long-term Incentives
The Group operates an approved and
unapproved Executive Share Option
Scheme together with a savings-related
Share Option Scheme. An Employee Co-
Investment Plan is also in place.
Executive Schemes
Grants under the Executive Schemes are
made to Directors and to those Senior
Executives, including General Managers of
the Hotels and Health & Fitness clubs, who
can contribute most to the achievement of
the Group’s business plans. The value of
grants are typically linked to the value of
annual cash incentives received by grantees
in the previous year and thus adds a
longer-term perspective to short-term
incentives.
Options are granted at the full prevailing
market price without discount.
Presently, options granted will be
exercisable only if, over the three year
period starting with the financial year
period in which the option is granted, the
total shareholder return of the Company’s
share has equalled or exceeded that of the
middle ranking company of the Leisure,
Entertainment and Hotels sector of the
FTSE Small Cap Index.
Sharesave Scheme
The terms of the De Vere Group Sharesave
Scheme 1995, in which Executive Directors
may participate on the same terms as other
eligible employees, include the grant of
options at a discount of 20% below the
market price.
Employee Co-Investment Plan
Shareholders approved the introduction of
the Employee Co-investment Plan in
February 2001. During the year 16
employees accepted invitations to
participate in the Employee Co-Investment
Plan. No Executive Directors currently
participate. Under this plan participants are
granted a conditional right to receive
shares. The rights are awarded in January
each year and vest after a three-year period
subject to achievement of a performance
test. The performance test is that the right
to receive shares does not vest unless the
Company’s ranking at the end of the
closing month (for awards made in January
2002 – September 2005) in a comparator
group comprising the constituents of the
Leisure Entertainment and Hotels sector of
the FTSE Small-Cap Index is at or above the
middle ranking position.
Other Benefits
Executive Directors are entitled to other
benefits such as the provision of a
company car and healthcare insurance
consistent with our industry norms. Directors’ Emoluments

Service Contracts
Executive Directors now in office have been
appointed on the basis of a one-year
rolling contract. Non-executive Directors
are appointed for a fixed term and
thereafter from year to year by mutual
agreement.
On termination of an Executive Director’s
service contract there is an entitlement to
pre-determined compensation, linked to
annual salary and contractual benefits,
which is less than the full contractual
entitlement over the remaining period of
the contract, reflecting an adjustment for
mitigation.
External Non-executive Directorships
The Company considers that appointments
as Non-executive Directors of other
companies broadens the experience and
knowledge of Executive Directors to the
benefit of the business. Accordingly, such
appointments are permitted and Executive
Directors are allowed to retain the fees paid. REPORT ON DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 23

accordance with applicable United
Kingdom law and accounting standards are
set out in the Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Accounts
in accordance with relevant legal and
regulatory requirements, United Kingdom
Auditing Standards and the Listing Rules of
the Financial Services Authority.
We report to you our opinion as to
whether the Accounts give a true and fair
view and are properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We also report to you if, in our opinion,
the Directors’ report is not consistent with
the Accounts, if the company has not kept
proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if
the information specified by law or the
Listing Rules regarding Directors’
remuneration and transactions with the
Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate
Governance statement reflects the
Company’s compliance with the seven
provisions of the Combined Code specified
for our review by the Listing Rules, and we
report if it does not. We are not required
to consider whether the Board’s statements
on internal control cover all risks and
controls or to form an opinion on the
effectiveness of either the Group’s
Corporate Governance procedures or its
risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained
in the Annual Report and consider whether
it is consistent with the audited Accounts.
This other information comprises the
Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s
Business Review, Financial Review, Report of
the Directors, Statement on Corporate
Governance and Report on Directors’
Remuneration. We consider the
implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or
material inconsistencies with the Accounts.
Our responsibilities do not extend to any
other information.
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance
with Auditing Standards issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence
relevant to the amounts and disclosures in
the Accounts. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and
judgements made by the Directors in the
preparation of the Accounts, and of
whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately
disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as
to obtain all the information and
explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the Accounts are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by
fraud or other irregularity or error. In
forming our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the Accounts.
Opinion
In our opinion the Accounts give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the Company and of the Group as at 
29 September 2002, and of the profit of
the Group for the year then ended and
have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985.
Ernst & Young LLP
Registered Auditor
Manchester
4 December 2002 26 DE VERE GROUP PLC ACCOUNTING POLICIES
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
which form an integral part of the Accounts
Basis of Accounts
The Accounts have been prepared in
accordance with applicable United
Kingdom accounting standards under the
historical cost convention with the
exception of hotel and health & fitness
properties which, under the transitional
provisions of FRS 15 – Tangible Fixed
Assets, are included at their 1999
valuations. Since 1999 it has been Group
policy not to revalue fixed assets.
FRS 19 – Deferred Tax has been adopted
this year and has resulted in the prior year
adjustment detailed in Note 18.
As disclosed in Note 2 certain expenditure
has been reclassified between cost of sales
and other operating expenses.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated profit and loss account
and balance sheet combine the Accounts
of the Company and its subsidiary
undertakings which are prepared up to 
29 September 2002 and represent the
operations of the Group for a period of 52
weeks. In accordance with Section 230 of
the Companies Act 1985, no separate
profit and loss account is presented for the
Company.
Results of subsidiary undertakings and
businesses acquired or sold during the year
are included from or up to their respective
dates of acquisition or disposal.
Entities in which the Group holds an
interest on a long-term basis are jointly
controlled by the Group and one or more
other ventures under a contractual
arrangement are treated as joint ventures.
In the Group accounts, joint ventures are
accounted for using the gross equity
method.
For acquisitions prior to September 1998,
the difference between the purchase
consideration and the fair value of
identifiable net assets at the date of
acquisition was dealt with as a movement
on reserves. On subsequent disposal of
such businesses such goodwill is taken into
account in determining the profit or loss
on sale or closure.
Tangible Fixed Assets and Depreciation
The cost of tangible fixed assets represents
the actual purchase price paid. Cost
includes gross interest on capital invested
in major property development and directly
attributable costs.
Fixtures and fittings contains items of
plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings, and
equipment including computers.
Depreciation is not provided on freehold
land.
Depreciation is provided to write-off the
cost or valuation of all other fixed assets
over their useful lives to their estimated
residual values and is calculated by the
straight-line method at the following rates:
Per annum
Hotels and 
health & fitness buildings 2%
Other properties 2%
Production plant 5% – 20%
Motor vehicles 10% – 50%
Fixtures and fittings 5% – 20%
Leasehold properties are depreciated over
the shorter of 50 years or their remaining
useful lives.
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets
are reviewed for impairment in periods if
events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. 
Assets under construction are not
depreciated until they are ready for use. 
When an asset is fully depreciated and no
longer in use both the gross amount and
the aggregate depreciation are eliminated
from the Accounts.
Stock
Stock is valued at the lower of cost and net
realisable value. Cost comprises expenditure
directly incurred in purchasing or
manufacturing stock and includes an
appropriate amount of overhead.
The value attributed to timeshare stock is
the cost of building the lodges apportioned
to each week on the basis of the selling
price for that week.
Certain operating supplies are treated as a
base stock and renewals and replacements
of such stock are written-off to the profit
and loss account as incurred.
Deferred Taxation
FRS 19 – Deferred Tax has been adopted
for these accounts. The standard requires
full provision to be made for deferred tax
assets and liabilities arising from timing
differences, between the recognition of
gains and losses in the financial statements
and their recognition in tax computations,
with the exception of timing differences
arising from the revaluation of, or gains
rolled over into fixed assets for which there
is no binding agreement to sell or on the
undistributed profits of overseas
subsidiaries. Deferred tax is calculated at
the rates at which it is estimated the tax
will arise. The deferred tax provision has
not been discounted to net present values.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to
the extent that the Directors consider that
it is more likely than not that there will be
suitable taxable profits from which the
future reversal of the underlying timing
differences can be deducted.
Previously provision was made for
deferred taxation on timing differences
which were not expected to continue in
the future. No provision was made for
taxation on chargeable gains arising from
disposals of properties because any
liability would be postponed by the
application of rollover relief.
Turnover
Turnover is the value of goods and services
sold to third parties, including excise
duties, as part of the Group’s trading
activities, after deducting discounts and
sales based taxes.
Joining fees in respect of health and fitness
memberships are accounted for when
received. All other fees and subscriptions
are recognised over the membership period. ACCOUNTING POLICIES ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2002 27
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
which form an integral part of the Accounts – Continued
Sales of timeshares are recognised at the
later of the time of sale or the date
building work on the lodge is complete.
Pensions
Pension costs relating to the Group defined
benefit scheme are charged to the profit
and loss account in accordance with the
advice of independent qualified actuaries
based on an assessment of the current and
expected future pensionable payroll.
Actuaries’ assessments of the pension
scheme are carried out every three years
and surpluses or deficiencies disclosed by
the valuations are amortised over the
remaining service lives of the members
except where there is a significant
reduction in the number of employees in
the scheme. Differences between the
amount charged in the profit and loss
account and the payments made to the
schemes are treated as provisions or
prepayments in the balance sheet.
Payments to money purchase pension
schemes are charged as incurred.
Leases
Assets, which are subject to finance leases,
are capitalised and the related depreciation
charged to the profit and loss account.
Lease payments are treated as consisting of
interest and capital, interest being charged
to the profit and loss account over the
term of the lease on an actuarial basis.
Rental payments in respect of operating
leases are charged to the profit and loss
account on a straight-line basis. Provision
has been established for future anticipated
costs related to leased premises no longer
occupied by the Group. 28 DE VERE GROUP PLC CONSOLIDATED PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT

liabilities arising from timing differences, between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and their recognition in tax
computations, with the exception of timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets for which there is no binding agreement to
sell or on the undistributed profits of overseas subsidiaries. No provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance
sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the
replacement assets are sold. Deferred tax is calculated at the rates at which it is estimated the tax will arise. The deferred tax provision has not
been discounted to net present values.
The impact of this change in policy on the tax charge for the year to 29 September 2002 has been to increase the charge by
£11,003,000. The comparative amounts have been restated for the year to 30 September 2001 resulting in an increase in the
tax charge of £4,940,000 for that year and a prior year adjustment of a credit to the profit and loss reserve of £3,681,000 in
respect of earlier years. The impact of the change to the balance sheet can be found in Note 18.
(iii) Factors that may affect future tax charges
The Group does not expect to pay any UK Corporation tax for the next three years as a result of the availability of tax losses
carried forward and accelerated capital allowances on its ongoing capital expenditure programme.
As a result of deferred and overseas tax, the Group expects its tax charge for the forseeable future to remain at an effective
rate close to the UK Corporation tax rate of 30%.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised where the likelihood of realisation fails to meet the ‘more likely than not’
criterion. No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing property or on the sale of properties
where potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets. At the year end, the total unprovided deferred
tax on assets if sold at book value would be £75 million (2001: £65 million) and on gains rolled over into replacement assets
£nil (2001: £12 million). Such tax would only become payable if the properties were sold without it being possible to claim
rollover relief and if expenditure on replacement assets were less than anticipated. However, it is not expected that any capital
gain will be crystallised in the foreseeable future.

9. Earnings/(Loss) Per Share
Basic earnings per share is calculated with reference to the earnings/(loss) attributable to Ordinary shareholders of
£27,057,000 (2001: loss of £23,630,000) and the weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue during the year of
111,830,000 (2001: 111,393,000).
Diluted earnings per share is basic earnings/(loss) per share adjusted for the effect of the conversion into fully paid 
Ordinary shares of all Convertible subordinated bonds 2003 and all dilutive share options. Diluted earnings for the year 
were £32,417,000 (2001: losses of £18,267,000) and the weighted average number of Ordinary shares was 135,705,000 
(2001: 134,983,000).
Adjusted earnings per share figures are disclosed based on the elimination from earnings of exceptional items.

/9 pence Ordinary shares at 465 pence per
share*, will be redeemed at their outstanding principal amount on 24 September 2003. Consequently the bonds are
disclosed as creditors falling due within one year.
As disclosed in the Financial Review on page 14 the Group expects to repay the Convertible subordinated bonds from its
existing Revolving Credit Facility and a new US $100 million long-term debt facility. The principal and interest payable on
this new facility have been hedged into Sterling for the full term of the facility. Interest on the US $100 million will initially
be payable at a floating rate linked to LIBOR until September 2003 and then at a fixed rate of approximately 7.15%.
* Giving a conversion rate of 21.5054 Ordinary shares for every £100 of Convertible subordinated bonds. Where 75% of the principal value
has been converted, the Company has the right to convert the whole of the remaining issue by giving at least 30 days notice.
(ii) The annual rate of interest on the Loan notes is 1% below LIBOR. The Loan notes are redeemable at par by holders 
on any interest payment date on 30 days notice. If at any time the amount of outstanding Loan notes is less than 
£5 million, the Company may redeem the outstanding balance on 30 days notice. Otherwise the Loan notes will be
repaid in full on 10 April 2005.
(iii) Unsecured bank loans represent funds drawn down under the Company’s current Revolving Credit Facility of £175
million. At the year end £120 million of the facility remains undrawn (2001: £139 million), the facility expires in October
2006. In addition the Group has a bank overdraft facility of £25 million (2001: £25 million) which remained undrawn at
both year ends; this facility is reviewed by the bank on an annual basis.
(iv) The hotel finance lease obligations mature between 31 December 2022 and 23 August 2024.
(v) The amounts due from the Company to subsidiary undertakings are a mixture of interest bearing and non-interest 
bearing loans.
The carrying value of debt at 29 September 2002 secured on fixed assets was £60,913,000 (2001: £59,337,000). NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS

Financial Risk Management
An explanation of the Group’s objectives, policies and strategies for the role of derivatives, foreign currencies and other
financial instruments in creating and changing the risks of the Group in its activities can be found on page 15.
Weighted average interest rates applicable to fixed rate and floating rate borrowings and assets were as follows:

219,717 6.7 205,050 6.5
* The weighted average period for the fixed rate debt is 1.4 years (2001: 1.9 years).
Fixed rate borrowings comprise £109,673,000 (2001: £109,692,000) of 7% Convertible subordinated bonds 2003 and
finance leases repayable by instalments over 2 years. In addition, the Group holds a £10 million interest rate swap at 6.65%
and a £20 million swap at 5.31% fixing the interest rate on an element of the Group’s floating rate borrowings. The amount
of available borrowing facilities at the year end is disclosed in the Financial Review on page 14, which also includes an
assessment of the estimated impact of a change in interest rates on the Group’s results. The weighted average period of
long-term debtors is 7.4 years (2001: 3.0 years).
The interest rate applicable to floating rate debt and cash is determined by reference to LIBOR or Base Rate. All financial
assets and liabilities are denominated in Sterling.

provisions remaining at 29 September 2002 are expected to be utilised over the next four years. 
An analysis of the provision for deferred tax is given in Note 18.
17. Pensions
a) Pensions 
The Group operates a contracted-out defined benefit scheme, The Greenalls Group Pension & Life Assurance Scheme (the
Scheme), the assets of which are held in a separate trustee administered fund. The Scheme is now closed to new members.
Contributions are paid into the Scheme in accordance with the recommendations of an independent actuary on the basis of
triennial valuations. The latest formal actuarial triennial valuation was carried out on 5 April 2000. This disclosed that the
value of the Scheme’s assets totalled £203 million at market value which represented 79% of the benefits that had accrued
to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings. The liabilities were valued on a market-related projected
unit basis, under this basis the current service cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
Following the disposal of the Pubs & Restaurants business in December 1999, and based on subsequent advice from the
Group’s actuaries, the Group undertook to improve the funding level of the ongoing scheme by contributing an additional
£40 million to the Scheme payable over a four year period. As the additional contribution requirement arose from the
significant reduction in Scheme membership a liability was recorded immediately. At the year end £27.5 million had been
contributed. The level of contributions required in the future will be reviewed at the next actuarial valuation in March 2003.
The Group also operates a contracted-in defined contribution scheme in which its liabilities are restricted to the level of
contributions paid into the scheme.
The assumptions, which have had the most significant effect on the funding of the Scheme, are set out in the following table:
%
Price inflation 3.00

29 September 2002. Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 29 September 2002. The following assumptions 
were used to determine the value of the scheme’s liabilities:

HM Customs & Excise has raised an assessment on the Group in the amount of £7 million plus interest relating to the
operation of the Group’s golf and leisure facilities. The Directors are confident that the grounds for the assessment are
unreasonable and they have appealed. However, in the event that the appeal is not successful, the assessed amount may
ultimately crystallise as a charge.

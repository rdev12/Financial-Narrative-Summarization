“Telford Homes, by the development
of magnificent new buildings and
community spaces, is part of an
extraordinary transformation
taking place in East London.”

R&A Telford 07  4/6/07  16:26  Page 5 Chairman’s statement
“Telford Homes has taken a
substantial step forward during
the last 12 months. Another year
of strong financial performance
has been complemented by the
share placing raising net funds
of £14.4 million during 2006.
This additional equity gives us
the opportunity to accelerate
our growth in East London, a
region with an exciting future.”
David Holland 
Chairman (Non-Executive)
Sales performance in the year has
been strong and although we are
mindful of rising interest rates this has
not had an effect on the confidence
of our customers. Demand is in excess
of supply in East London and this,
together with the quality of our
product, has been a factor in the
success of our recent sales launches.
Our development pipeline is very
healthy at over 2,200 homes. This does
not include over 1,000 homes not yet
under contract that we expect to
deliver through our development
partnership with Eastend Homes. Last
year I reported that we had been
chosen as their partner on the British
Estate in Mile End and, following a
thorough planning process which has
helped set the precedent for future
estate regeneration in East London,
development is now underway. We have
been appointed as their partner on a
further five estates which we expect to
develop over the next five years.
The share placing in October last year
was extremely successful with demand
for our shares being far greater than
we expected. This is a sign of the
confidence that the directors have in
the future of Telford Homes and the
positive messages we were able to
relay when presenting to institutions.
I am delighted that a number of new
shareholders have been added to our
register during the year and I hope that
they are looking forward to the next
few years as much as I am.

year in which we have exceeded
our initial expectations. Turnover
has grown by 32% to £104.4 million
and profit before tax is up 35%
to £13.5 million.
Earnings per share have increased
by 27% to 30.3p despite the dilutive
effect of the share placing and the
directors are proposing a final
dividend of 4.9p, making a total
of 8.9p for the year.”
Property sales and
affordable housing
Contracts were exchanged on 478
private homes, 84 affordable homes
and two commercial units making a
total of 564 properties in the year.
Included within this figure are 16 homes
being constructed under joint ventures
where we recognise half of the turnover
and profit from the development.
The number of private homes sold has
increased by 45% this year with the
average selling price of those homes
also increasing to £258,000 from
£245,000. Prices have continued to
move ahead in East London and, where
the market allows, we have maintained
our policy of selling properties at an
early stage in the development
process. This secures future cash flows
and enables us to invest further in our
development pipeline. We have been
able to secure increased bank finance
as a direct result of the volume of early
sales on some sites which offsets the
risk of increased gearing.
Earlier this year we sold all 179 private
homes at OneStratford our
development in High Street, Stratford
before construction had commenced.
More recently we have sold all of the
53 private homes at Metro East, E3
and the 144 private homes at SoBow,
E3 and work is only just underway at
both sites. Both of these developments
went on sale in 2007 and the success
we have achieved is an indication of
the continuing strength of the market,
particularly in East London. Of the 197
private homes across these two sites
81 contracts were exchanged in the
year to March with the remainder being
exchanged in the new financial year
and all have been sold to investors.

R&A Telford 07  4/6/07  16:27  Page 9 Queen Mary’s Gate, South Woodford is
a different marketing proposition with
sales to date being largely to the
owner-occupier market. Despite this
the rate of sales has been impressive
with handovers not due to commence
until November this year. To date we
have sold 123 of the 184 private homes
in the first construction phase.
The number of affordable properties
sold this year is lower than last year due
solely to the timing of some significant
contracts. In March 2006 we
exchanged contracts to deliver all of
the affordable homes at OneStratford
and Queen Mary’s Gate with those 232
exchanges being recognised last year
but the majority of the profits flowing
into 2007 and beyond. Partnerships
with affordable housing providers
remain integral to our business and
typically 35% of any development is
sold for affordable housing.
Our accounting policy is to recognise
turnover and profit from the point of
exchange of contracts on a
percentage complete basis. This
means that in addition to profit
recognised from contracts exchanged
in the year we also have profit
continuing to be realised from ongoing
construction at developments where
the exchanges have been reported in
previous years. Our results this year
include profits from, amongst others,
Tequila Wharf, E14 where sales
commenced in 2004 and the
development was completed at the
end of 2006 and Icona, Stratford
where sales commenced in 2005 and
development will continue into 2008. 
Operating performance
The operational heart of our business
has once again delivered outstanding
quality of final product, on programme
and within budget. Both Telford Homes
Metro and Telford Homes Alto
continue to experience substantial
change in the scope of their
operations and new staff have been
recruited to ensure we have the
capacity to cope with expansion. In
recognition of our operational
performance we have won a number of
awards in the year for design,
construction and marketing.
During the year ended 31st March
2007 we handed over a total of 477
properties to our customers, achieving
excellent standards in Customer
Service. We are rated highly amongst
our peers in independent surveys and
our attention to detail in the handover
process, together with our approach in
dealing directly with tenants where
properties have been rented out, is a
significant factor in our level of sales to
previous customers.
Health and Safety is always at the
forefront of our business and this year
we have recruited a Group Health and
Safety Manager who is assisting David
Durant, our Group Managing Director,
and the divisional Managing Directors
in developing and monitoring our
policies and procedures.

Site acquisitions
This year we have substantially
increased our development pipeline
purchasing, or agreeing to purchase, a
number of new development sites. This
has been accelerated by the £14.4
million net funds raised in a placing at
the end of 2006.  Mike North has joined
our land team alongside Jim Furlong
and Nick Drew our Partnerships Director
and Mike has already been responsible
for some significant site acquisitions.
Some of the land acquired benefited
from detailed planning permission such
that development could commence
almost immediately. SoBow, E3 was
purchased from one of our affordable
housing partners with the benefit of a
resolution to grant planning permission
for 201 homes. Development is now
underway and will be completed in
2009. We have recently purchased a
site at Leyton Orient Football Club
where redevelopment adjacent to the
North and South stands incorporates
a planning permission for 62 homes.
A number of land acquisitions were
subject to receipt of satisfactory
planning permission. These include land
within the British Estate, E3 which
received a resolution to grant planning
permission to provide 161 new private
homes in January 2007. Since the share
placing we have also contracted to
purchase a major site in Greenwich in a
joint venture with The Royal Bank of
Scotland. The contract is subject to
receipt of planning permission for 372
homes which is expected in the next few
months. This will be our second joint
venture with The Royal Bank of
Scotland and our success together at
Icona, Stratford has led us to continue
our partnership on this exciting scheme. 
We have also added to our medium to
longer term development pipeline with
the acquisition of sites that we will
progress through the planning process.
The former Lesney Toys factory in
Homerton Road, Hackney is expected to
achieve planning permission for over
200 homes and commercial space,
including affordable art studios. In
addition the Hannaford and Marshall site
in Bethnal Green Road near Liverpool
Street station has been acquired in a
joint venture with Genesis Housing
Group and is expected to achieve
planning permission for more than 300
homes and commercial space.

Planning
The planning process is more
complicated than ever before with an
increasing number of external
consultants’ reports being required
for each application. A key
competitive advantage comes from
knowing your way through the
process and our knowledge of the
local planning environment in East
London puts us in a strong position,
while not removing all of the hurdles
that can be placed in our path. 
Development pipeline
Our development pipeline, being
properties that will produce profit in
future years not including those built for
joint venture partners, consists of 1,279
properties with planning permission and
942 subject to the planning process.
This is a total of 2,221 properties which
are expected to provide turnover in
excess of £500 million and gross profit
of over £100 million, more than four
years supply at current levels of profit.
Of this forecast gross profit in the
pipeline over £24 million has been
secured by contracts already exchanged
and this will be recognised as
construction proceeds on developments
over the next two to three years. Gross
profit in the year ended 31st March 2007
was £23.4 million.
Our partnership with Eastend Homes
has added the homes on the British
Estate to our pipeline. During the year
we have been chosen as the
development partner to Eastend
Homes on a number of other well
located estates in Tower Hamlets. We
have secured this partnership due to
the quality of the Telford Homes brand
which incorporates a straight-forward
and honest approach. We are now
progressing master plans for the
regeneration of these estates and we
expect to achieve planning permissions
and then commence construction on
all of them over the next two years. The
British Estate has set the model for this
partnership with land payments made
by Telford Homes being reinvested into
the third party refurbishment of existing
homes on the estate.
People
Several senior members of staff have
been recruited as we continue to plan
for the future and ensure that our
internal infrastructure is always one
step ahead of our growth plans.
We finished the year with over 120
employees and our strength in every
area is evident from our performance
over the last 12 months. I would like to
thank each and every one of our
employees for their efforts this year.
Strategy
Each year the directors review the
strategy of Telford Homes to ensure
that we are creating maximum value for
shareholders and taking advantage of
all the opportunities that come our way
while minimising risks in the business.
There are so many opportunities in
East London, and our knowledge of this
market place is so strong, that we will
largely remain focused on this region.
We expect to continue to pre-sell a
proportion of our developments,
depending on their location, in order to
secure future cash flows and minimise
the funding risks. 
In doing this we will maintain organic
growth at a controlled rate in order to
capitalise on the imbalance between
supply and demand for properties in
our area of operation. This was part of
the reasoning for the share placing last
year and will be our main driver in the
future while the market remains stable.
Interest rates will be a key factor in the
stability or otherwise of the market and
the mechanics of supply and demand
will also play a significant role in the
coming years.
Current trading and outlook
Our recent sales launches are an
indication that the market in East
London remains strong despite rising
interest rates. We were extremely
pleased with the results of these sales
events and the upcoming launch of
Merchants’ Quarter, the marketing
name for the British Estate, has
received a high level of interest.
To date, due to contracts exchanged
since 31st March 2007 and properties
sold, subject to contract, we have a
total of 185 private homes and 25
affordable homes contributing to our
results for 2008. The demand for
homes in East London, the strength of
our development pipeline and our
ongoing partnerships with affordable
housing providers lead me to expect
2008 to be another year of record
results and another step forward in the
development of Telford Homes.

R&A Telford 07  4/6/07  16:27  Page 13 Financial review
“Another year of record turnover
and profits has been underpinned
by increasing the capital available
to the Company through a share
placing and managing those funds
to maximise return on equity while
adding a balanced portfolio of
sites to our development pipeline.”
Jonathan Di-Stefano 
Financial Director
Operating results
Turnover increased to £104.4 million
from £79.3 million last year. An analysis
of properties sold in the year is given in
the Chief Executive’s review.
Gross profit has increased to £23.4
million with the margin falling to 22.4%
from 23.0% last year. Each new site is
appraised to achieve a gross margin
of at least 20% unless high returns on
equity can be secured in exchange for
lower margins. Queen Mary’s Gate in
South Woodford was purchased for
consideration of 35% of all private
sales proceeds achieved from the
development. The total expected
payments are now in excess of £35
million with only £10 million paid to
date, resulting in a high rate of return
on equity. The profit margin on our
share of sales proceeds is in excess of
20% as this represents our risk in the
development. However the reported
margin is 13% when taking the proceeds
being paid directly to the vendor into
account, still in line with our original
expectations for the site. The gross
margin in 2007 excluding Queen Mary’s
Gate is 23.5% and this development will
continue to depress the reported
margin over the next few years.
Our forecasting and control of
development costs has been excellent
over the last 12 months with fewer
movements being reported in monthly
cost control meetings. Build costs in
the year were £50 million and the
operational teams are clearly well set
to manage this level of expenditure. 
The operating margin has fallen to
16.0% from 16.2% with overheads
reducing as a percentage of turnover
to 6.4% from 6.8% last year.
Overheads have remained under
careful control while also allowing us
to put the appropriate infrastructure
in place prior to each growth phase
and ensuring our employees are
rewarded for their contribution to the
success of the Company.  
Interest
Interest paid in the year was £4.0
million up from £3.1 million last year.
This was mainly due to the increase in
activity during the year along with
rising interest rates.
Interest received in the year was £0.8
million up from £0.2 million last year as a
result of higher cash balances during the
year, particularly after the share placing.

Financial review
15 Annual report and accounts 07
The continuing increases in the base
rate are a cause for concern for the
business as a whole although any
negative effects are yet to materialise.
In terms of finance costs we monitor
this carefully and forecast future rate
rises on a prudent basis. Interest cover
was 5.2 times in 2007 which remains
well within acceptable limits.
Profit before tax has increased to £13.5
million from £10.0 million last year. 
Taxation
The effective tax charge for the year is
26.3% down from 29.7% last year. This
change is due to a prior year over
provision of £178,000 and a significant
tax deduction this year in relation to
the exercise of share options which
reduces the tax charge by £309,000. 
Dividends
A final dividend of 4.9p per ordinary
share has been proposed. Together with
the interim dividend of 4.0p paid in
January 2007 this makes a total
dividend for the year of 8.9p which is
covered 3.4 times by earnings per share.
The total dividend last year was 7.0p.
The final dividend is expected to be
paid on 13th July 2007 to shareholders
on the register on 22nd June 2007.
Earnings per share
Earnings per share increased to 30.3p
from 23.8p and the weighted average
number of shares in issue was 32.8
million. The 5.8 million shares issued as
a result of the share placing diluted
earnings for five months. The funds
raised will make a more significant
contribution to profits in 2008 and to
a greater extent in 2009 and 2010.
Balance sheet
Net assets have increased to £54.5
million from £32.2 million with part of the
change due to the £14.4 million raised in
the share placing last year. The number
of shares in issue is now almost 37
million. Net assets per share at 31st
March were 148p up from 108p last year. 
The placing funds have all been
allocated to new land opportunities
within six months of the money being
received and while cash held at the
end of March was £17.6 million, the
majority of this balance will be utilised
by future construction and the
purchase of new development sites
that are already under contract. Some
of the sites purchased will take a few
years to flow completely into turnover
and profit as a number are subject to
planning or have been acquired
without planning permission.
Pre-tax return on equity in the year
ended 31st March 2007 was still
healthy at 31.2%, falling from 35.5%
last year due primarily to the effect of
the additional equity raised in the year.

Scotland amounting to £128 million.
Total facilities are therefore £178
million with actual drawn loans at 31st
March 2007 being £73.2 million.
In April 2007 we agreed an outline
facility with Barclays Bank on one new
development and we expect to
gradually introduce Barclays to the
business to give us another route to
funds and to assist us in securing
competitive debt finance. Gearing at
31st March 2007 was 102% reduced
from 193% last year. This reduction is a
direct result of the cash balances held at
the end of the year. We are comfortable
with higher levels of gearing as we
continue to monitor the certainty of
future cash inflows against exposure to
debt. Our business model of selling
properties at an early stage of
construction reduces the risk of carrying
debt as the sales revenue on a given
development, secured by exchanging
contracts, will be used to repay loans
specific to that development.
Internally we calculate ‘uncovered
gearing’ which excludes debt matched
by the value of contracts exchanged on
a given development. This is becoming
an increasingly important performance
indicator in the business, particularly in
reporting to banks. The board has
determined that levels of uncovered
gearing are acceptable up to 100%.
Uncovered gearing at 31st March 2007
was 18% reduced from 60% last year.
Cash flow
We maintain a detailed cash flow
forecast as part of our management
information systems. This extends for a
number of years into the future and is
subject to continual re-assessment.
The cash flow position is reported to
the board and our banking partners on
a monthly basis.
Share price
The share price on 31st March 2007
was 421.5p (31st March 2006 –
187.5p), with a high in the year of
422.5p and a low of 187.5p.
International Financial
Reporting Standards
Telford Homes will adopt International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for
the year ended 31st March 2008. We
have already explored all current
international standards that may have
an impact on the accounting policies
employed by the Company. There are no
material issues expected to arise from
the standards already in place other than
presentational changes. International
standards are evolving over time and
new standards will be appraised as and
when they are issued. We have already
started the process of converting the
2007 results into the international
format, including all of the disclosure
changes that will be required. These can
then be used as comparatives for the
first full year of adoption in 2008.

Area of operation
Telford Homes is all about East London.
The business has been built up in this
area over the last six years and ongoing
regeneration means there are many
more development opportunities to
come in the future.
Local knowledge has played a key role
in helping the Company to grow and
it remains a competitive advantage
particularly in relationships with councils
and affordable housing organisations
and in our understanding of the local
planning process.
The 2012 Olympics being awarded to
London has been a major boost to
East London with the Olympic Park
being constructed in Stratford and
with many other events due to take
place in the local London boroughs.
This has accelerated the programme
of regeneration that was already
taking place and has had a beneficial
impact on the property market.
East London, together with the rest of
the Thames Gateway, has become a
major growth region in the country and
this will be the case for many years to
come. While the opportunities to utilise
our competitive advantage remain we
will continue to play a significant role in
the regeneration of the area.

the business and will assist
in our plans for growth
over the next few years.”
John Fitzgerald 
Managing Director
Over the last 12 months Telford Homes
Alto has kept up with the pace of
change within Telford Homes,
researching and using modern methods
of construction for improved quality,
speed and efficiency. Several major
developments were completed during
the year including Equinox at Island
Gardens, Tequila Wharf, E14 and Estilo,
N1. Quality of construction has been
excellent and this has been evidenced
by customer feedback during a very
busy period of property handovers. 
Queen Mary’s Gate in South Woodford
is the biggest development that Telford
Homes has ever undertaken and both
design and construction are proceeding
well and to programme. This site has
been well set up to deal with the volume
of employees and subcontractors that
are required over the next few years. The
tower at Icona in Stratford is now
prominent on the East London skyline
and OneStratford is rapidly rising from
the ground a short distance away.
A number of planning permissions are
being sought requiring careful
management to make the process as
smooth as possible. Our partnership
with Genesis Housing Group will result
in a landmark development in Bethnal
Green Road close to Liverpool Street
station and we are delighted to be
working with them on the scheme.
James Gaffney, Construction Director
and Chris Dreher, Commercial Director
have both been instrumental in the
operational performance of the division
and also in the recruitment of new staff
to add expertise within each department.
A trainee programme has been set up
with a regular cycle of trainees being
recruited each year. This will contribute
to the long term future of the Company
as well as the construction industry as a
whole. The Alto team is now well placed
to deal with an increasing workload and
will be able to take on significant new
schemes in the coming months.

and profit grow in line with the
number of sites and units under
construction. Average site size
has increased to 46 units from
24 last year and is expected to
grow further by 2008.”
Mark Parker 
Managing Director
Telford Homes Metro has grown
substantially since the Company formed
two operational divisions in 2004. During
the year to March 2007 the division
completed and handed over eight new
developments and has many more in the
pipeline. A significant part of this pipeline
will come through the partnership with
Eastend Homes which the Metro team
have had a key role in. Alongside Eastend
Homes the division has worked with a
number of housing associations in the
year including Asra, Circle Anglia, Old
Ford, Bethnal Green and Victoria Park,
East Thames, Poplar HARCA and
Metropolitan. Furthering these
partnerships is critical in the future of
Telford Homes and excellent
relationships have been forged which will
benefit all parties over the next few years. 
During the year Paul Copsey has been
recruited as the Commercial Director
of Telford Homes Metro which
completes the management team.
Control and management of build
costs has been very good this year and
this appointment will add further
strength to the commercial team as
the business grows.
Construction standards have been
maintained at the high level expected in
Telford Homes. This is the heart of our
business and the quality of our finished
product has assisted our high standards
of customer service. Paul O’Connell was
awarded the silver medal in the ‘Building
Manager of the Year’ awards for our
Cubix development at Brock Place, E3.
Innovative design solutions have been
required to ensure we can maximise
the use of each site and promote
environmentally friendly construction
wherever possible. This has included a
‘brown roof’ at Sienna in Barking and
the use of ground source heat pumps.
Increase in average units per site next year
46%
“We our proud of our achievements to
date and every member of the Metro
team has contributed to the quality of
our finished product. I am looking
forward to new challenges in the year
ahead as we continue to grow.”

R&A Telford 07  4/6/07  16:28  Page 27 Health and Safety
The Company regards the promotion of health and safety as a critical objective of all employees at every level. Every employee is
issued with health and safety instructions that endeavour to identify all the risks and dangers that are likely to be encountered in the
course of their work and set out precautionary measures. We continue to invest in the training and development of our people to
not only meet but exceed industry requirements.
As the Company grows, recruitment of key staff will be crucial in sustaining and improving health and safety standards. A significant
part of this was the recruitment during the year of Steve Nicoll as Group Health and Safety Manager. This appointment will help to
ensure that health and safety remains the first concern of the Company as the business develops. 
Our Accident Frequency Rate (AFR) is at an all time low and below the industry average. The number of man-hours worked on site
in a given 12 month period has continued to grow and is now over 1 million hours per year.  The increase in activity is being
effectively managed by our construction teams without putting health and safety at risk. 
We continue to identify new ways of working to reduce wasteful practices and processes. One example of this is the ‘bathroom
pods’ being installed on a number of our developments. These inherently labour intensive rooms are manufactured off site,
before being delivered and installed, following the principles set out in the Construction Design and Management Regulations
2007 by designing out risk wherever possible.  
This year we have formed an ‘Executive Safety Committee’ and an ‘Operational Safety Forum’ as part of the overall strategy for
managing change as the business grows and develops. It has been recognised that our approach to health and safety will be developed
through these groups by encouraging an inclusive culture throughout the business and delivering integrated solutions.    
Mark Parker and John Fitzgerald continue to be responsible for health and safety in each of the operating divisions with the assistance of
Steve Nicoll. David Durant, Group Managing Director, is the board member with overall responsibility for health and safety.
“One of the main reasons for joining Telford Homes was the passion I witnessed in everyone I met. A few months on I have not
seen anybody within the Company that does not share in the aspirations of the business. This is reinforced on site by the
commitment and integrity of the site teams in undertaking their duties in a professional manner. My main goal is to further
develop and monitor policies and procedures in the light of the continuing growth of the Company. I am looking forward to the
challenges and feel privileged to be part of the Telford Homes team.”

R&A Telford 07  4/6/07  16:28  Page 29 Environment and Sustainability
The key aims of the policy are:
• Integration of environmental responsibilities into the organisation.
• Ensuring that all operations take account of the Environmental Protection Act.
• Undertaking regular reviews of our working practices to minimise pollution and waste.
• Ensuring that contractors involved in the removal of waste are registered carriers.
• Assessment of any environmental impact when performing risk assessments for the control of substances hazardous to health.
• A commitment to achieving high levels of energy efficiency and water management in all of our operations.
There are many examples of this policy in action in our business:
• On almost all of our sites we undertake extensive remediation works in existing residential areas to remove pollutants and
material harmful to the environment.
• Recycling of waste is undertaken wherever possible including the use of crush concrete from demolished buildings for ground
works on the same developments and the recycling of plasterboard and other materials. 
• In our internal specification we provide low energy light fittings, dual-flush toilets, aerators on taps and flow restrictors on
showers to save water.
• Recent schemes have aimed for 10% of all energy to come from a sustainable source which can include the use of biomass
boilers for central heating and hot water and these are fuelled by wood pellets from managed forests.
• Timber from sustainable sources is now used exclusively on all developments.
• We are exploring the possibility of a timber panel solution for one of our developments which will have a much lower carbon
footprint than traditional methods of construction.
• Methods of harnessing natural energy such as solar panels and ground source heat pumps are being incorporated into a
number of developments.
• The external structures of our buildings are designed with enhanced thermal properties to reduce their carbon footprint,
including high-performance glazing systems and where appropriate mechanical ventilation systems, incorporating heat
recovery systems to complement natural air circulation. 
• We use tyre rubber as a sound deadening membrane in a number of our developments thereby recycling waste materials and
reducing noise pollution.
• We have designed underground refuse facilities at recent sites which are self contained and environmentally friendly and on
larger developments we are introducing recycling facilities alongside the normal refuse bins.
• We are increasing our use of pre-fabricated external walls and bathroom pods and these reduce waste as they are
manufactured off-site.
• Many of our developments are ‘car free’ and these are usually located near public transport links and have provision for
bicycles to be stored.
• Ecological reports have helped us to assess the ways in which existing species can be nurtured once a development is complete. Bat
boxes and brown roofs have been positive additions to recent developments to enhance the built environment for urban wildlife.
29 Annual report and accounts 07
Telford Homes is committed to supporting the
environment and minimising any harmful impact
our business activities have upon it. The Company
has an environmental policy and we ensure that
this is communicated throughout our operations
including appropriate subcontractors and suppliers. 
R&A Telford 07  4/6/07  16:28  Page 30 Corporate responsibility 
As a result of such activities a number of Telford Homes’ properties have been rated as ‘very good’ in their EcoHomes assessments.
In order to build considerately for the future, we continue to research sustainable energy solutions to ensure the best technologies
are being used across the Company and that we are contributing positively towards a greener future.
In addition to our commitment to the environment we consider our social responsibility in a wider sense to be of vital
importance in the areas in which we operate.
The regeneration of East London is an ongoing project in which we are playing a major role. This process is increasing the quality
of life for local people both by improving neighbourhoods and through the provision of new but affordable housing with our
housing association partners. We have excellent relationships with local councils and housing associations and we are extremely
supportive of the need to provide affordable housing for shared ownership and for rent.
Throughout the year we have worked alongside the local authorities to encourage employment of local labour on our projects.
During the year we carried out several pre-planning public consultations to discuss local issues and concerns. This encourages
public participation and allows us to incorporate relevant issues within our planning applications. This was particularly important
at the British Estate, E3 where local opinion was key to some of the decisions taken in respect of the development.

R&A Telford 07  4/6/07  16:28  Page 31 Customer Service
Our Customer Service remit includes:
• Thorough quality control inspections in the final weeks of construction.
• 'Snagging' every unit across all developments to achieve finishing consistency.
• Pre-Completion Inspections with customers.
• Thorough demonstration on handover for trouble-free ownership.
• Inductions for new tenants (showing how to use the home prevents most running-in problems). 
• An emergency back-up service for the times when our offices are closed and help is needed.
• Communication of build progress, completion dates and running-in advice.
• Listening to feedback for future improvements.
The Customer Service team spend up to 80% of their time on site, carrying out quality control in the final two weeks of construction,
which gives the team the opportunity to view each property as if through the eyes of the customer.  At this stage, the standard of
finish is checked to ensure it exceeds NHBC guidelines, and only then is each customer invited to undertake their Pre-Completion
Inspection and see a full working demonstration in their apartment: for example, kitchen appliances, central heating boiler,
programmers and alarm.  This induction service is also available for tenants who may subsequently move in, where the home has
been purchased for letting purposes. At the final handover, the customer is invited to inspect their property fully again and raise
any issues they may have, which will be addressed promptly. 
Outside of our normal office hours, there is a back-up 24/7, 365 days a year emergency service, which gives peace of mind for
owners and tenants alike.  Our high standards of finish, coupled with a ten year NHBC warranty and the out of hours service, result
in maximum benefit and minimum effort for all our customers.
Overall, Telford Homes' product and service package excellence has brought us a high level of repeat purchase and recommendation
from satisfied customers. In our last 2006 quarterly survey, 94% of purchasers said they would recommend Telford Homes to others.

R&A Telford 07  4/6/07  16:29  Page 37 Application of principles
Although not formally required to do so, the directors have sought to embrace the principles contained in the Combined Code (2003)
(the Code) applicable to fully listed companies, in formulating and applying the Company’s corporate governance policies. These
policies are monitored to ensure that they are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and comply as far as possible with the
provisions of the Code given the size of the Company. 
Directors
The Company is managed by a board of directors and they have the necessary skills and experience to effectively operate and
control the business. There are seven directors in total of whom two are non-executive directors. David Holland and Robert Clarke,
the non-executive directors, are considered independent and they comprise both the audit and remuneration committees. The
board meets once a month and the directors make every effort to attend all board meetings.
The board is responsible for taking all major strategic decisions and also addressing any significant operational matters. In addition
the board reviews the risk profile of the Company and ensures that an adequate system of internal control is in place. Management
information systems are in place to enable the directors to make informed decisions to properly discharge their duties.
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive are separate. The Chairman is responsible for running the board and he meets
regularly and separately with the Chief Executive and the other non-executive director to discuss matters for the board.
As the business has developed, the composition of the board has been under constant review to ensure that it remains
appropriate to the managerial requirements of the Company. One third of the directors retire annually in rotation in accordance
with the Company’s articles of association. This enables the shareholders to decide on the election of their Company’s board.
The board takes decisions regarding the appointment of new directors as a whole and this is only done following a thorough assessment
of a potential candidates skills and suitability for the role. New directors are given a full induction to the Company where required so as to
ensure they can properly fulfil their role and meet their responsibilities.
All directors are offered appropriate training to develop their knowledge and ensure they remain up to date in relevant matters for
which they have responsibility as a member of the board.
The Chairman’s statement and Chief Executive’s review included in this annual report give the board’s current assessment of the
Company’s prospects. The directors are responsible for preparing the financial statements as set out in the statement of
directors’ responsibilities. The responsibilities of the auditors are set out in their report.
Remuneration committee
Details concerning the composition and meetings of the remuneration committee are contained in the directors’ remuneration
report on pages 39 to 40.
Audit committee
During the period the audit committee, which is chaired by Robert Clarke an independent non-executive director, has met three
times with the external auditors being in attendance. 
The committee has a responsibility for reviewing the financial statements provided to shareholders. In addition the committee
reviews the business and financial risks and internal controls as described below.
The duties of the committee also include ensuring that the auditors provide a cost effective service to the Company and remain
objective and independent and to consider from time to time the need for an internal audit function.
Policy on corporate governance

R&A Telford 07  4/6/07  16:29  Page 38 Corporate governance
Relations with shareholders
The Company has institutional shareholders and is, where practicable, willing to enter into a dialogue with them. The Chief Executive and
the Financial Director meet regularly with institutional investors within the confines of relevant legislation and guidance.
The board invites communication from its private investors and encourages participation by them at the Annual General
Meeting (AGM). All board members present at the AGM are available to answer questions from shareholders. Notice of the AGM
in excess of 21 clear days is given and the business of the meeting is conducted with separate resolutions, voted on initially by a
show of hands and with the result of the voting being clearly indicated.
Internal control
The board is responsible for the Company’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system is
designed to mitigate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable but not absolute
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The board is of the view that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the Company’s significant risks,
and that it has been in place for the period ended 31st March 2007 and up to the date of approval of the annual report and
accounts, and that it is regularly reviewed by the board.
The internal control procedures are delegated to executive directors and senior management in the Company operating
within a clearly defined departmental structure. The board regularly reviews the internal control procedures in the light of
the ongoing assessment of the Company’s significant risks.
On a monthly basis management accounts, including a comprehensive cash flow forecast, are reviewed by the board in order to
provide effective monitoring of financial performance. At the same time the board considers other significant strategic, organisational
and compliance issues to ensure that the Company’s assets are safeguarded and financial information and accounting records can be
relied upon. The board formally monitors monthly progress on each development.
Going concern
The directors consider that the funds available to the Company are sufficient for its operation for the foreseeable future.

R&A Telford 07  4/6/07  16:29  Page 39 The directors present the remuneration report for the year ended 31st March 2007.
Composition of the remuneration committee
The remuneration committee comprises the independent non-executive directors, David Holland and Robert Clarke. The
committee makes recommendations to the board on executive directors’ service agreements and remuneration. In doing so it has
undertaken relevant research to ensure that remuneration levels are competitive with the industry average. The committee met
twice during the year.
Remuneration policy
It is the Company’s policy to provide remuneration packages sufficient to attract, retain and motivate directors of the quality
required. To add further incentive the directors have adopted two bonus schemes, one applicable to all staff and a scheme for
executive directors and senior management. Both schemes are dependent on the Company meeting certain financial
performance targets. The maximum amount that can be earned under the executive bonus scheme is 100% of basic salary.
The Company operates a Share Incentive Plan (SIP) in which all employees are entitled to participate. The SIP exists in order to
increase employee ownership of shares and further details are given in note 18 to the financial statements.
During 2006 the Company set up a Deferred Payment Share Purchase Plan (DPSPP) for the benefit of selected senior employees.
Further details are given in note 18 to the financial statements. The remuneration committee is responsible for approving any
offers of shares made under the DPSPP. 
The board as a whole determines the remuneration of the non-executive directors after considering external market research.
They do not participate in the bonus schemes or in the group personal pension scheme. They are entitled to participate in the SIP. 
Service contracts
The executive directors have service contracts that can be terminated on 12 months notice. These provide for termination
payments equivalent to 12 months basic salary and contractual benefits.
The non-executive directors have letters of appointment that can be terminated on three months notice.

A resolution to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors to the Company will be proposed at the Annual General
Meeting in accordance with section 385 of the Companies Act 1985.
Each of the directors at the time this report was approved has confirmed the following:
• so far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware;

aware of that information.

R&A Telford 07  4/6/07  16:29  Page 43 The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law
and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have
elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law).  The financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of
the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently, with the exception of changes arising on the adoption of
new accounting standards in the year as explained in the statement of accounting policies;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will
continue in business.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
43 Annual report and accounts 07
R&A Telford 07  4/6/07  16:29  Page 44 Independent auditors’ report to the members of Telford Homes Plc
We have audited the financial statements of Telford Homes Plc for the year ended 31st March 2007 which comprise the profit and loss
account, the statement of total recognised gains and losses, the balance sheet, the cash flow statement, the statement of accounting
policies and the related notes. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the statement of
directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the
Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose.  We do not,
in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the report of the
directors is consistent with the financial statements. The information given in the report of the directors includes that specific
information presented in the Chief Executive’s review and the financial review that is cross referred from the review of activities
section of the report of the directors. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and
other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the annual report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. This other information comprises only the report of the directors, the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s
review, the financial review, the policy on corporate governance and the directors’ remuneration report. We consider the
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation
of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice,
of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31st March 2007 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended;
• the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
• the information given in the report of the directors is consistent with the financial statements.

49 Annual report and accounts 07
R&A Telford 07  4/6/07  16:29  Page 50 The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year
and the preceding year except as noted below.
Changes in accounting policy
The Company has adopted Financial Reporting Standard 20 'Share-based payment' for the year ended 31st March
2007. As a result of this, a charge is made to the profit and loss account to reflect the calculated fair value of
employee share options over and above the exercise price paid by employees (note 18). This charge is calculated at
the date of grant of the options and is charged equally over the vesting period. The corresponding adjustment to
reserves is made directly to the profit and loss reserve.  
Accounting convention
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable
UK accounting standards.
Turnover and profit recognition
Turnover is recognised from the date of exchange of contracts for the sale of properties at a rate equivalent to the
value of work undertaken in respect of land development. The value of turnover less deposits and completion monies
received is included as amounts recoverable on contracts within debtors. All turnover is generated in the United
Kingdom. Commission received on property sales made on behalf of third parties is recorded within turnover, with all
costs associated with the sale of those properties recognised within cost of sales.
Profit on developments is recognised over the life of each development in proportion to turnover only to the extent
that the total eventual profit on the development can be foreseen with reasonable certainty. Until there is reasonable
certainty over the final outcome of a development the profit is restricted to the non-refundable deposits received.
Losses are provided for as soon as foreseen.
Joint arrangements
The Company has certain contractual arrangements with other participants to engage in joint activities that do not
create an entity carrying on a trade or business of its own. The Company includes its share of the assets, liabilities,
profits and cash flows in such joint arrangements, measured in accordance with the terms of the arrangement and
pro-rata to the Company's interest in the arrangement, in its financial statements. 
Development properties
Development properties are included in stocks and work in progress and are stated at the lower of cost and net
realisable value. Cost comprises costs of acquisition and development, including directly attributable fees and
expenses but not loan interest. Included within development properties are freehold interests held in completed
developments. These are recognised at a multiple of annual rental income.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on a straight line
basis at rates calculated to write down the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset over its expected useful
life as follows:
Leasehold improvements - shorter of term of lease and 10 years
Plant and machinery - 2 to 5 years
Motor vehicles - 3 years

Annual report and accounts 07 50
R&A Telford 07  4/6/07  16:29  Page 51 Statement of accounting policies 31st March 2007
Taxation
Corporation tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance
sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less
tax in the future have occurred. Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the
periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted
or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised when, on the basis of all available
evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the reversal
of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Finance leases and hire purchase contracts
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised and depreciated over the shorter of
their expected useful lives and the lease term. The capital elements of the future lease obligations are recorded as
liabilities, while the interest elements are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the leases to
produce a constant rate of charge on the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Operating leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Pension costs
Contributions paid to group personal pension schemes (defined contribution), in respect of employees, are charged
to the profit and loss account as incurred.

On 21st March 2007 it was announced that the corporation tax rate will reduce from 30% to 28% with effect from
1st April 2008. The legislation to enact this change was not in place at the balance sheet date and so this change is
not recognised for deferred tax purposes. The impact of the change on the calculation of deferred tax is not
considered to be material.

average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held in the Share Incentive Plan
(note 18), which are treated as cancelled. For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary
shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

18 Employee Share Schemes
Telford Homes Plc Employee Share Option Scheme
The Company operates both an approved share option scheme and an unapproved share option scheme. Awards
under each scheme are made periodically to new employees.
The Company has adopted Financial Reporting Standard 20 'Share-based payment' for the year ended 31st March
2007. As a result of this, a charge is made to the profit and loss account to reflect the calculated fair value of
employee share options over and above the exercise price paid by employees. This charge is calculated at the date
of grant of the options and is charged equally over the vesting period. The corresponding adjustment to reserves is
made directly to the profit and loss reserve.
The Company has used the Black-Scholes-Merton formula to calculate the fair value of outstanding options.
Individual calculations have been performed for groups of share options with differing exercise prices and dates. The
assumptions applied to the Black-Scholes-Merton formula for share options issued and the fair value per option are
as follows:
2007 2006
Expected life of options based on options exercised to date 4 years 4 years
Volatility of share price based on three year share price history 20% 20%
Dividend yield 2% - 4% 4%
Risk free interest rate 4.75% - 5% 4.75%
Share price at date of grant 205p - 337p 138.5p - 167p
Exercise price 205p - 337p 138.5p - 167p
Fair value per option £0.30 - £0.66 £0.20 - £0.24

18 Employee Share Schemes (continued)
The charge calculated up to 31st March 2005 is £43,000 with a corresponding deferred tax asset at that date of £13,000.
The profit and loss reserve is therefore restated by the deferred tax credit of £13,000 from £11,056,000 to £11,069,000.
The charge calculated for the year ended 31st March 2006 is £59,000 with a corresponding deferred tax asset of
£18,000 recognised in the year. The profit and loss reserve is therefore restated by cumulative deferred tax credits of
£31,000 from £16,493,000 to £16,524,000.
The charge calculated for the year ended 31st March 2007 is £90,000 with a corresponding deferred tax asset of
£27,000 recognised in the year.

R&A Telford 07  4/6/07  16:29  Page 62 Telford Homes Plc Share Incentive Plan
During the year ended 31st March 2004 Telford Homes Plc set up a Share Incentive Plan (SIP) for the benefit of all of
the employees of the Company. This SIP has been approved by the Inland Revenue and confers certain tax
advantages for participating employees.
The SIP provides for employees to purchase shares up to a value of £1,500 in each tax year. These shares are known
as 'Partnership shares'. Partnership shares are matched on a one for one basis by 'Matching shares' provided by the
Company subject to the shares remaining in the SIP for a period not less than three years. Dividends are paid on both
Partnership and Matching shares and these are allocated to employees as 'Dividend shares'.
The Company has set up a trust to administer the SIP and to hold shares on behalf of individual employees. This trust is
an entirely separate entity to the Company and is managed by a corporate trustee, Telford Homes Trustees Limited.
The costs associated with the trust are paid for by the Company and the Company finances all share purchases.
The trust has distributed shares as Partnership shares and Dividend shares to employees participating in the scheme.
These shares remain in the trust until such time as an employee withdraws from the SIP. Further shares have been
allocated to employees as Matching shares and the cost of these shares is being written off over the three year
holding period. The charge in the year ended 31st March 2007 is £109,000 (2006 - £76,000).
During the year ended 31st March 2007 the trust acquired 180,000 shares at 197p in May 2006 and a further 3,372
shares at 310p in November 2006. At 31st March 2007 the trust remains interested in 41,180 shares (2006 - nil)
which have not been allocated to employees. The dividends on shares in which the trust has an interest are waived.
Shares held by the SIP are recognised as a deduction from shareholders funds. The value of these shares at 31st
March 2007 was £203,000 (2006 - £127,000). Movements in the profit and loss reserve relating to the SIP are
shown in note 16.
Telford Homes Plc 2006 Deferred Payment Share Purchase Plan
During the year ended 31st March 2007 Telford Homes Plc set up a Deferred Payment Share Purchase Plan (DPSPP)
for the benefit of selected senior employees. An employee benefit trust (the Telford Homes Plc 2006 Employee
Benefit Trust) was set up with Abacus Corporate Trustee Limited acting as trustee.
Participants in the DPSPP are offered a loan by the trustee to enable them to subscribe for a specified number of
shares in the Company at market value. This loan is interest free, repayable on or before the repayment date, which is
normally ten years from the date of the loan or on leaving employment or disposing of the shares. The loan has a
limited recourse such that repayment is limited to the value of the shares on the repayment date. The Company will
lend the trustee sufficient funds to enable the trustee to provide the loans to individual participants. All shares acquired
under the DPSPP will be subject to a three year vesting period and are held by the trustee for the benefit of the
participants. Offers to participants will be made periodically at the discretion of the directors of Telford Homes Plc.
In September 2006 selected employees were offered, and subscribed for, a total of 550,000 shares at the market
value of 260p. These shares were issued on 9th November 2006. On this date the Company provided a loan to the
trustee of £1,430,000 to enable the trustee to provide a loan to each of the participants. This loan is repayable at the
earlier of the sale of the vested shares and November 2016 and has been recognised as a deduction from
shareholders’ funds (note 16).

23  Derivatives and other financial instruments
The Company's financial instruments comprise loan and overdraft facilities and various items such as trade debtors
and creditors that arise from its operations. The Company uses loan finance, all of which is denominated in sterling, to
acquire development land and undertake site construction. It does not enter into any derivative transactions and has
no exposure to exchange rate movements as its trade takes place entirely within the United Kingdom.
At 31st March 2007 the Company had unutilised overdraft facilities of £2.5 million at 1.5% above base rate (2006 -
£2.5 million). The facilities are due for review before April 2008.
In addition the Company has a credit line facility with Allied Irish Bank in respect of site development loans of £50
million, including joint arrangement funding, with interest charged at rates of up to 1.75% above base rate. A total of
£25.2 million was unutilised at 31st March 2007. This facility is due for review by April 2008. The Company has a
further facility with The Royal Bank of Scotland of £128 million at similar rates, specific to certain sites and including
joint arrangement funding, due for review by April 2008. A total of £79.6 million was unutilised at 31st March 2007.
Apart from hire purchase liabilities all of the Company's financial liabilities fall due within one year.
The fair value of the Company's financial assets and liabilities at 31st March 2007 is equal to the carrying value
stated in the balance sheet at that date.

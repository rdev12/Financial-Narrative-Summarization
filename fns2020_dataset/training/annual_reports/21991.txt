Brooks Macdonald Group plc
This has been another strong year 
for Brooks Macdonald, with 
pre-tax profit increasing by 78% 
to £5.7m. Earnings per share were 
38.10p, an increase of 69%.
On the back of these excellent results the 
Board has decided to recommend a final 
dividend of 6p per share. This, following our 
maiden interim dividend in March 2010 of 
3p, represents a 64% increase in total 
dividends over last year, when a single 
dividend of 5.5p was paid.
Funds under management at 30 June 2010 
were £2.186bn, compared with £1.386bn a 
year earlier, an increase of 57%. We are 
delighted that FUM now exceed £2bn, a 
milestone which reflects the group’s robust 
business model, consistent investment 
performance across all risk mandates and the 
continued ability to generate new business 
from both on-going and new relationships.
The momentum seen in the first half of the 
year carried through into the second half 
and beyond. Since the end of the financial 
year we have completed the acquisition of 
Braemar Group, a specialist manager of 
property funds. This acquisition was 
undertaken only after careful consideration 
of its “fit” with Brooks Macdonald in terms 
of company values as well as its ability to 
enhance shareholder value.
In April I was pleased to welcome Nicholas 
Holmes and Andrew Shepherd to the Board. 
As Joint Managing Directors of our asset 
management company they have played a 
major role in the growth of our business. 
Colin Harris, the former Chief Executive 
Officer of Newton Investment Group, was 
appointed a non executive director in July. I 
am confident that Colin’s experience and 
expertise will be of significant value to Brooks 
Macdonald as we continue to expand. 
Market conditions remain volatile but they 
have provided some ‘tailwind’ over the 
period in terms of assisting growth. However 
none of the progress of the group would 
have been possible without the hard work, 
dedication and professionalism of our staff. 
The year under review was one of significant 
progress for Brooks Macdonald. Our strong 
balance sheet, growing brand and the 
strength and depth of talent throughout the 
group give the Board confidence that our 
progress will continue in the current year.

Chief Executive’s Review
The group continues to have a 
number of growth strategies and I 
am pleased to report that these 
have enabled us to continue to 
grow the business at a very 
successful rate over the last year. 
Organic growth has been the 
major driving force, but has been 
combined with new office 
openings, strategic alliances and 
the acquisition of Lawrence House.
Funds under management rose from 
£1.386bn to £2.186bn over the period 
representing an increase of 57%. Whilst 
markets remained volatile they were 
supportive, with the APCIMS Balanced index 
rising 12.66% and the less relevant FTSE100 
rising 6.7% over the same period.
We continue to work closely with high 
quality IFAs and professional introducers 
alike. This continues to account for a major 
part of the group’s growth and in the period 
under review over 80% of our new business 
came from these sources. I would like to take 
this opportunity to thank all our professional 
connections for their continued support.
Our principal offering to clients is based 
around providing high quality fee based 
private client discretionary fund 
management. This service is divided into the 
management of Private Portfolios, Self 
Invested Personal Pensions (‘SIPP’), Charities 
and Trusts, and our Managed Portfolio 
Service (‘MPS’). In addition we have a 
bespoke financial consulting practice. I am 
pleased to report that in all areas we have 
seen growth.
The group has continued to make significant 
strides in the SIPP market, which now 
accounts for 42% of funds under 
management. Our MPS service, aimed at 
clients with portfolios of between £20,000 
and £150,000, has seen considerable growth 
in the number of SIPP accounts but also 
noticeably from ISA amalgamations. This 
represents around 7% of FUM and continues 
to be a driver of profit and turnover growth. 
Our pipeline for new business remains robust 
for all our discretionary investment 
management services.
In London we have seen continued growth 
in the fund management teams, our 
operations department, central functions 
and financial consulting. This remains our 
largest office and further space has been 
secured to allow continued growth. Outside 
of London, we have relocated our Hampshire 
office to larger premises reflecting its 
considerable success, and Manchester, 
Tunbridge Wells and our newest office in 
Edinburgh have all grown ahead of forecasts 
over the last year. We will continue to look at 
regional opportunities over the coming year.
The Retail Distribution Review (‘RDR’) is 
scheduled for January 2013 and it will 
change the distribution models of most firms 
“I remain firmly of the view 
that private clients require 
a blend of service and 
investment performance in a 
risk controlled environment.“
Chris Macdonald, Chief Executive Annual Report & Accounts 2010

Brooks Macdonald Group plc
Chief Executive’s Review
in financial services. We are highly supportive 
of the proposed changes and see RDR as a 
considerable opportunity for the group over 
the next two years and beyond.
In July 2010 we completed the acquisition of 
the Braemar Group. Part of our growth 
strategy has been to look at niche funds and 
to make acquisitions where we can see 
strong medium term value. Braemar very 
much fitted these objectives. It manages 
over £500m of property and has £45m in 
specialist funds. Whilst still early days in 
terms of integration, I am pleased to report 
initial progress has been strong. I do not 
believe that in the first year the acquisition 
will be earnings enhancing due to the 
system development and new recruitment 
that will take place, but over the medium 
term (2011 onwards) I am confident that 
this will be a valuable addition to the group.
I remain firmly of the view that private 
clients require a blend of service and 
investment performance in a risk controlled 
environment. We continue to invest in 
the investment management process to 
expand our research and performance 
capabilities as well as investing in 
the development of our systems to 
enhance the offering to our clients. 
Over the year a number of landmarks were 
achieved. We passed through £2bn of funds 
under management, we announced further 
significant ‘hires’, added further strategic 
partners and were awarded the accolade of 
being one of the Best Companies in the UK 
to work for according to the Sunday Times. 
The latter was especially pleasing as it is a 
strong reflection of the ethos and culture of 
the group. During the year the company 
decided to establish the Brooks Macdonald 
Employee Benefit Trust to motivate and 
retain our employees, all of whom are 
potential beneficiaries of the Trust. 
I wish to end this report by thanking all 
members of staff. Total staff numbers 
have increased from 140 to 168 over 
the financial year, and now amount to 
over 200, and it remains a privilege to 
work alongside such a talented group of 
individuals. With growth being generated 
from a number of sources, an exceptional 
team and a robust balance sheet we 
continue to look forward with confidence.

Risks and uncertainties 
The principal risks and uncertainties that face the group are:
Financial risks
The group’s principal financial risks and the measures and policies 
for the management of those risks are set out in note 24 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Non–financial risks
The significant non-financial risks faced by group are as follows:
Reputational risk
The group has a growing reputation as provider of high quality 
investment and wealth management services. There is a risk that 
significant damage to reputation could lead to the loss of existing 
clients as well as impacting on the ability to gain new clients which 
would lead to a fall in financial income. 
Such risk could lead to negative publicity arising from reasons such 
as poor investment performance or client service or regulatory 
censure. This risk is minimised by ensuring the group maintains a 
culture of high ethical and professional standards whilst focussing 
on delivering a first class service to all of our clients. The group 
maintains an independent compliance department which ensures 
conformity with the regulations of the Financial Services Authority 
as well as relevant statute in all of our dealings with our clients. This 
compliance function is monitored by the compliance and risk 
committee of the group board.
Regulatory risk
The sector in which the group operates is heavily regulated and any 
breach of regulations could lead to fines or disciplinary action 
against the group or its staff. The group monitors actual and 
impending changes in regulations in order to assess the impact on 
the business and to ensure that the group has sufficient resources to 
implement any necessary changes. 
Competition risk
Operating in a competitive market there is a risk of loss of existing 
clients due to poor performance, failure to respond to changes in 
the market place, or the loss of key investment professionals. To 
minimise this risk, the group continues to invest in its employees 
and monitors developments in the marketplace in which it operates 
to ensure that the group continues to offer a wide range of services. 
Recruitment policies are designed to attract high quality staff and 
the group regularly reviews and benchmarks its remuneration 
packages and contractual arrangements in order to retain and 
motivate staff. A dedicated training manager provides structured 
training plans in order to ensure all staff continue to develop their 
careers within the group.
Technology risk
A key part of the high quality service delivered to clients is facilitated 
by a flexible and robust IT infrastructure.
New IT projects are regularly reviewed and appraised at board 
meetings in order to ensure that the group continues to develop its 
IT capabilities. As well as our offices in Hampshire, Manchester, 
Tunbridge Wells and most recently Edinburgh providing back up 
facilities we have a disaster recovery site based at Heathrow. 
Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk that the group suffers a loss resulting 
from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or 
from external events. The group’s policy to minimise these risks is to 
continuously monitor and review the controls in place to ensure 
these are adequate for the risks involved.

Brooks Macdonald Group plc
The directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report  
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to 
prepare the financial statements for the group in accordance with 
IFRS as adopted by the European Union and for the company in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (UK GAAP). In accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union the group financial statements must present fairly 
the financial position and performance of the group. In accordance 
with UK GAAP, the company financial statements must present fairly 
the financial position and performance of the company. Under 
company law directors must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view. In 
preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
•  make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
•  state whether the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with an applicable accounting framework;
•  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company and 
group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of the financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.

General information
Brooks Macdonald Group plc is a public limited company, incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
Restatement of financial position as at 30 June 2009 and 30 June 2008
In respect of provision for client compensation payments, at 30 June 2009 and 30 June 2008, these were classified as non-current provisions and 
have now been classified as current provisions and the balance sheets have therefore been restated.
The general accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been applied 
consistently to all the years presented unless otherwise stated
1. Principal accounting policies
(a) Accounting conventions
  The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the measurement of certain financial assets that are held at 
fair value, and in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. The group has adopted all new and revised standards and 
interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee that 
are relevant to the group’s operations and effective for annual reporting periods beginning 1 July 2009. 
  In the current year the following new and revised standards have been adopted and have affected the amounts reported in these financial statements:
  IAS 1 -“Presentation of Financial Statements” (Revised) effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The amendment 
to the standard requires the preparation of a statement of comprehensive income either to replace or to complement the current income 
statement. In addition, restatements or reclassifications of comparative balance sheet information will include a restatement of the opening 
balance sheet of the comparative period. There are also terminology changes.
  IFRS 2 -“Share-based payments” effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The amendments clarify that vesting 
conditions comprise only service conditions and performance conditions, and specifies the accounting treatment for a failure to meet a 
non-vesting condition.
  IFRS 3 -“Business Combinations” (Revised) effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009. The revised standard introduces a 
number of changes in the accounting for business combinations that impact on the amount of goodwill recognised, the reported results in the 
period that an acquisition occurs and future reported results.
  IAS27 -“Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements” (Amendments) effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009. 
The amendments provide new guidance on accounting changes in the interests in subsidiaries. 
   IFRS 7 -“Financial Instruments Disclosures” effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. Amendments relating to the 
reclassification of financial assets. This required greater disclosure about certain types of financial instruments and their fair value measurement 
and liquidity risk. 
   IFRS 8 -“Operating Segments” effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. This standard replaces IAS 14 “Segment 
Reporting” and has required a change in the disclosure of segmental information.
(b) Standards and interpretations which become effective in future periods 
  The group has not decided to early adopt the following standards and interpretations, and revisions to existing standards. Although relevant, 
they are not expected to have a material impact on the group’s results, financial position and disclosures unless otherwise noted.
  IFRS 2-Group Cash-settled Share based Payment Arrangements effective for accounting periods on or after 1 February 2010. Existing IFRS 2 has 
been amended to clarify the accounting for group cash-settled share based payment transactions. 
 
Notes to the Financial Consolidated Statements  Annual Report & Accounts 2010
19
Brooks Macdonald Group plc
Notes to the Financial Consolidated Statements 
1. Principal accounting policies - continued
  IFRIC 19-Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments effective for accounting periods on or after 1 July 2010. IFIRC clarifies that 
equity instruments issued to a creditor to extinguish a financial liability are consideration paid in accordance with paragraph 41 of IAS 39 
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
  There are number of other standards and interpretations, and revisions to existing standards and interpretations, these are not considered 
likely to have a material impact on the group’s financial statements.
(c) Critical accounting estimates and judgements
  The preparation of financial information requires the use of assumptions, estimates and judgements about future conditions. Use of available 
information and application of judgement are inherent in the formation of estimates. Actual results in the future may differ from those 
reported. In this regard, management believes that the accounting policies where judgement is necessarily applied are those that relate to; the 
measurement of indefinite life intangible assets, deferred consideration and trade receivables.
  The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised if the revision only affects both current and future periods.
  Further information about key assumptions the future and key sources of estimation uncertainty are set out below:
 Business combinations
  As described in note 8, the group has deferred consideration in respect of the acquisition of Lawrence House Fund Managers Limited which 
has been calculated as £725,719 allowing for an estimated growth in acquired funds discounted by the cost of capital. The group does not 
consider that the potential changes to these assumptions would result in the deferred consideration being materially different. 
 Share based payments
  The group engages in share-based payments in respect of services received from certain employees. Estimating fair value for these payments 
requires determining the most appropriate valuation model and the inputs to that model. The assumptions and models used for estimating 
fair value are disclosed in notes 15 and 19.
 Intangibles
  The group has acquired client relationships and new teams of fund managers as described in note 12 and in assessing the fair value of those 
assets the group has estimated the finite life based on the experience of existing client relationships. 
(d) Business combinations
 Basis of consolidation
  The group’s financial statements comprise a consolidation of the accounts of the parent company (Brooks Macdonald Group plc) and its 
subsidiaries. The underlying financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using 
consistent accounting policies. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the company and control exists when the company has the power to 
govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The financial statements of the subsidiaries 
are included from the date on which control is transferred to the group to the date that control ceases.
  All intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
  Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the 
aggregate amount of the consideration transferred, at the acquisition date irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. Acquisition costs 
incurred are charged to the income statement.
  When the group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in 
accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. If the business 
combination is acquired in stages, the fair value of the groups’ previously held equity interest is re-measured as at the acquisition date and the 
difference is charged or credited to the income statement.  Annual Report & Accounts 2010 Brooks Macdonald Group plc
20
1. Principal accounting policies - continued
  Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the group will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the 
fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in the 
income statement or as a change to other comprehensive income.
  Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the consideration transferred over the group’s net identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed. If the consideration is lower than fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised in  
income statement.
 Impairment
  After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill 
acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the group’s cash generating units that are expected to 
benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquisition are assigned to those units.
  Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the 
operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. 
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash 
generating unit retained.
(e)  Fees, commissions and interest
  Portfolio and other management advisory and custody services are billed in arrears and are recognised over the period the service is provided. 
These fees are calculated on the basis of a percentage of the value of the portfolio over the period the service is provided. Dealing charges are 
levied at the time the deal is placed for the client.
   Financial consulting fees are charged to clients on an hourly fee rate or by a fixed fee arrangement and are recognised over the period the 
service is provided. Commissions receivable and payable are accounted for in the period which they are earned.
  Interest is recognised as the interest accrues (using the effective interest rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the 
expected life of the financial instrument) to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. 
(f)  Cash and cash equivalents 
  Cash comprises cash in hand and cash on demand deposits which may be accessed without penalty. Cash equivalents comprise short term 
highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition.
(g)   Share based payments
   The group provides equity and cash settled share-based payment transactions in respect of services received from certain employees. The fair 
value of the services received is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares or share options granted on the date of the grant. The cost 
of the employee services received in respect of the shares or share options granted is recognised in the income statement over the vesting 
period, with a corresponding credit to equity or accruals depending on the nature of the scheme.
  The fair value of the options granted is determined using option pricing models, which take into account the exercise price of the option, the 
current share price, the risk free interest rate, the expected volatility of the company’s share price over the life of the option/award and other 
relevant factors.
  The group also operates a phantom cash settled share based scheme. On the grant date, the liability incurred is measured at fair value. The 
liability is re-measured at the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognised in the 
income statement.

(h)  Segmental reporting 
  A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from 
those of other business segments. Direct costs are allocated to the segment that generated the cost. Indirect costs are allocated to reporting 
segments so as to reflect the proportion of the cost that each segment has generated, on a pro-rata basis. 
(i)  Fiduciary activities 
  The group commonly acts as trustees and in other fiduciary capacities that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf of individuals, 
trusts, retirement benefit plans and other institutions. These assets and income arising thereon are excluded from these financial statements, as 
they are not assets of the group.
  The group holds money on behalf of some clients in accordance with the Client Money Rules of the Financial Services Authority. Such monies 
and the corresponding liability to clients are not included within the balance sheet as the group is not beneficially entitled thereto.
(j)  Property, plant and equipment 
  All property plant and equipment is included in the balance sheet at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment.
   Provision is made for depreciation rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset over its expected 
useful life, using a straight line method as follows:
Fixtures and fittings 15% per annum
Equipment 20% per annum
Leasehold improvements over the term of the lease
 
  The assets’ residual lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the balance sheet date. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by 
comparing proceeds with the carrying amount. These are included in the income statement. 
(k) Available for sale
  Available for sale financial assets are carried at fair value and their value is based on the current bid prices of the asset as quoted in active markets. 
(l) Intangible assets
  Intangible assets are client relationships that are recognised when acquired by the group as part of a business combination or when separate 
payments are made to acquire funds under management by adding teams of investment managers. Client relationships are initially recognised 
at cost and are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. If acquired as part of a business 
combination the initial cost of client relationships is the fair value at the acquisition date.
  The amortisation of client relationships is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives (five to 
fifteen years).
(m) Financial assets 
  The group classifies financial assets as loans and receivables, they are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that 
are not quoted on an active market. 
(n) Provisions
  Provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation as a result of a past event which it is probable will result in an outflow of 
economic benefits that can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle 
the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.

1. Principal accounting policies - continued
(o) Foreign currency translation
   The company’s functional and the group’s presentation currency is sterling. Foreign currency transactions are translated using the exchange rate 
prevailing at the transaction date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from settlement of such transactions and from the translation of 
period end monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement.
(p) Retirement benefit costs
  Contributions in respect of the group’s defined contribution retirement scheme are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
(q)  Taxation 
  Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the 
year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
  Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts in the group financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled based on its tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
  Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
(r)  Trade receivables 
  Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts. Doubtful debts are 
provided for when the collection of the full amount is no longer probable, whilst bad debts are written off when identified.
(s)  Operating lease payments 
  Rents due under operating leases are charged to income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. Where leases which have 
lease incentives, such as rent- free periods, the benefit of these incentives is recognised over the lease term.
(t)  Goodwill 
  Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the group’s interest in the net 
fair value of the separately identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at date of acquisition. In accordance 
with IFRS 3 Business combinations, goodwill is not amortised but reviewed annually for impairment and as such, is stated at cost less any 
provision for impairment of value. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and not subsequently reversed. Gains 
and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. On acquisition, any goodwill acquired 
is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of 
the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.

  For management purposes, the group’s activities are split into two operating divisions, investment management and financial planning. The 
group’s other activity, offering nominee and custody services to clients, has been included within investment management. These divisions are 
the basis on which the group reports its primary segmental information.
  Revenues and expenses are allocated to the business segment that originated the transaction. Revenues and expenses that are not directly 
originated by a business segment are reported as unallocated. Centrally incurred expenses are allocated to business segments on an appropriate 
pro-rata basis. Segmental assets and liabilities comprise operating assets and liabilities, being the majority of the balance sheet.

8. Business combinations
On 4 September 2009, the group acquired the entire share capital Lawrence House Fund Managers Limited (LHFM) for a total consideration of 
£1,798,684. LHFM managed three sub-funds through an open ended investment company (OEIC) together with a number of private client 
portfolios .The acquisition has enabled the group to increase its funds under management and also expand its current OEIC offering, together with 
acquiring additional skill sets in this sector. On 9 September 2009 LHFM changed its name to Brooks Macdonald Asset Management (Tunbridge 
Wells) Limited (BMTW), the clients were transferred to Brooks Macdonald Asset Management Limited, and the company ceased to trade.
The consideration for LHFM was by way of cash based on the value of the client relationships and the distributable reserves at the date of the 
acquisition. The intangible assets represent the value of the client relationships which are being amortised over a period of 15 years.
An initial amount of consideration of £1,072,965 was paid with the contingent deferred balance of £756,706 due on 4 September 2011 based on 
an estimate of the future value of the original funds acquired. This estimate has been made allowing for a growth in the value of the funds less an 
allowance for withdrawals.
The net present value of the contingent deferred balance of £725,719 was calculated by applying a cost of capital of 5%and the charge of £30,987 
in respect of the year to 30 June 2010 has been made to the consolidated income statement and shown as other interest expense.

Included in accruals and deferred income is an accrual of £1,444,996 (2009: £188,978) in respect of two phantom share option schemes, which 
were approved by the group’s directors in October 2009 and October 2008.
The schemes are cash settled plans and the payments made to participants in respect of awards are in the form of cash. The phantom schemes are 
awarded at no cost to the participants. The amount that is ultimately paid to the participants of the scheme is equal to the increase in market value 
of the ordinary shares determined after a three year vesting period. The awards will be vested after three years only to the extent that the 
performance conditions are satisfied. The charge for the year in respect of both of the phantom schemes was £1,256,018 (2009: £188,978)

Incentive Scheme options at values of 140p, 155.5p and 215p respectively. 
(b)  Share option schemes- equity based
Following its admission to AIM the company set up two share option schemes, a Sharesave Scheme 2005 and an Enterprise Management Incentive 
(EMI) Scheme.
The Sharesave Scheme enables all eligible employees to participate in a scheme whereby they enter into a savings contract for a period of three 
years. At the end of the three years they receive a bonus payment and the right to subscribe for a number of ordinary shares at the option price up 
to the maximum value of their savings contract. 
The EMI scheme is an incentive scheme used by the company to offer share options to key employees and directors of the group as a part of their 
remuneration package in addition to their basic pay, performance bonus and other benefits. Under the schemes certain employees hold options to 
subscribe for shares in the company at prices ranging from 140p to 578p. The options are conditional on the employee completing three years’ 
service and are exercisable three years from grant date. The options have a contractual term of between three and ten years depending on the 
scheme and are subject to performance conditions being met by the company. The company has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase 
or settle the options in cash.
Grants of EMI share options to employees and directors of the group which when in total exceed the limits of the scheme form unapproved share 
options which are subject to the same rules and performance conditions of the EMI scheme.

The options granted under the Employee Sharesave Scheme, the EMI Scheme and the Phantom Scheme (note 15) were valued on the basis of 
market prices at the time the options were granted and were calculated using the Black Scholes method with a volatility ranging between 15% and 
49%, on an historic price, covering the period to exercise cessation date. The expected volatility was estimated on the basis of the share price history 
subsequent to flotation. The risk free interest rate was assessed as the yield on gilt edged security with a maturity term of 10 years.
The options were valued at prices up to £5.78 per share, the charge for the year being £251,164 (2009: £189,622).The weighted average remaining 
contractual life of share options at the end of the year was 3.92 years (2009: 4.39 years). The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for 
options exercised during the period was £5.69. The total charge for the equity based schemes and phantom schemes was £1,507,182 (2009: £378,600).

24.  Financial risk management 
The group offers a range of services to private clients, family and charitable trusts and corporate clients. The group uses non-retail funding 
instruments to invest in liquid asset balances and to manage the risks arising from its operations. The group classifies its financial assets as loans and 
receivables which are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market.
The group has a formal structure for managing risk, including established risk lines, reporting lines, mandates and other control procedures. The 
structure is reviewed regularly. The group does not use derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes.

Brooks Macdonald Group plc
24.  Financial risk management - continued
(a)  Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the group is unable to meet its payment obligations associated with its financial liabilities when they fall due.
The primary objective of the group’s treasury policy is to manage short–term liquidity requirements and to ensure that the group maintains a surplus 
of immediately realisable assets over its liabilities such that all known and potential cash obligations can be met. 
The table below presents the cash flows payable by the group under non-derivative financial liabilities together with cash and balances at bank  
on demand.

Net liquidity gap 8,347,287 (5,595,230) - (203,041) 2,549,016
(b)  Market risk
Interest rate risk 
Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. Cash 
and cash equivalents are invested in short term cash deposits with maturities of no greater than three months.
The effect of a 100 basis points increase/decrease in interest rates would be £143,000 (2009: £83,000) on pre-tax profits and equity.
Foreign exchange risk
The group does not have any material exposure to transactional foreign currency risk and therefore no foreign exchange risk analysis is provided.
Price risk
Price risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices (other than 
those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk). The group is exposed to a price risk through its holdings of equity securities which are reported 
at fair value (note 11). Given the short term nature of the holding of this asset the group does not consider the price risk to be material.

24.  Financial risk management - continued
Credit risk
The group invests some of its surplus funds in highly liquid market instruments. Such investments have a maturity no greater than three months. The 
difference between the book and the fair value of these instruments is not significant. To reduce the risk of a counterparty default the group deposits 
the rest of its funds in approved high quality banks. At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.

No external credit ratings are acquired with regard to the trade receivable as collateral is held by the group in excess of the total value of the receivables.
25.  Capital management 
Capital is defined as the total of share capital, share premium, retained earnings and other reserves. Total capital at 30 June 2010 was £12,410,068 
(2009: £8,079,000). Regulatory capital is derived from the Group Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), which is a requirement of 
the Capital Requirements Directive. The ICAAP draws on the group’s risk management process which is embedded within the individual businesses, 
function heads and executive committees within the group.
The group’s objectives when managing capital are to comply with the capital requirements set by the FSA, to safe guard the group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain a strong capital base 
to support the development of the business.
Capital adequacy and the use of regulatory capital are monitored daily by the group’s management. 
The 2010 ICAAP was approved in April 2010. There have been no capital requirement breaches during the course of the year.
26.  Guarantees
During the year the company undertook a guarantee to the Royal Bank of Scotland to guarantee settlement for trading with CREST stock on behalf 
of clients. The company holds client assets to fund such trading activity.
27.  Related party transactions

28.  Events since the end of the year 
On 6 July 2010, Brooks Macdonald Group plc completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued share capital of Braemar Group plc (BG) at a price of 
2.25p for each ordinary share. BG has two core divisions: Braemar Securities which designs, promotes and manages niche structured financial 
products in the property sector through open ended investment companies and closed end residential funds; and Braemar Estates (BE) which 
manages property assets on behalf of the funds and other clients. At the date of the acquisition the value of the funds was approximately £45million 
and BE managed approximately 3,100 properties in the UK with a combined value of over £500 million.
The acquisition of this range of property funds has enabled the group to strengthen its position in the specialist fund management market.
The total consideration of £4,118,780 of was satisfied by cash of £3,032,977 in respect of 123,868,959 ordinary shares and outstanding share 
options in BG and by the issue of 139,851 new shares in Brooks Macdonald Group plc, with a value of £1,085,803, to the management of BG in 
exchange for their aggregate holding of 48,257,421 ordinary shares.
The fair value of the assets is the gross contractual amounts and all are considered to be fully recoverable. At the date of the acquisition the assets 
and liabilities acquired are detailed below:

At the balance sheet date the group had a 4.96% interest in Braemar Group plc this was acquired shortly before the balance sheet date and the 
value of the interest has not changed since the acquisition date. At 6 July 2010, the group acquired all of the remaining shares of Braemar Group plc.
Due to the recent completion date of the acquisition the group has yet to fully assess the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired and the 
resultant goodwill arising from the acquisition.

We have audited the parent company financial statements of Brooks 
Macdonald Group Plc for the year ended 30 June 2010 which comprise 
the Parent Company Balance Sheet, and the related notes. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, 
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for 
this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors responsibilities on 
page 9, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent 
company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with 
the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made 
by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
•  give a true and fair view of the state of company’s affairs at  
30 June 2010
•  have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
•  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
•  the information given in the directors’ report for the financial year for 
which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
parent company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the 
Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
•  the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns;
•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of Brooks 
Macdonald Group Plc for the year ended 30 June 2010.

Notes to the Company accounts
29. Principal accounting policies
(a)  Basis of accounting
  The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. They have been drawn up to comply with applicable 
accounting standards within the United Kingdom. 
  The Company has taken advantage of the exemption conferred by FRS 29 not to present the disclosures required by that standard relating to 
the financial risks in the Company’s solus accounts.
  The principal accounting policies of the company are set out below. They have been applied consistently throughout the year and  
preceding year.
(b) Investments in subsidiary companies 
 Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less provisions for impairment.
(c) Deferred taxation
  Deferred taxation is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date, at rates that are expected to 
apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law. 
  Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in 
which they are included in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
(d) Share based payments
  The company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based payments and has adopted the requirements of UITF 44. Equity settled share 
based payments are measured at fair value at the date of the equity settled share based instrument is expensed on a straight line basis over the 
vesting period based on the number of shares that will eventually vest.
(e) Operating lease payments
  Rents due under operating leases are charged to income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. The group benefited from 
a rent-free period under the terms of the current property lease. In accordance with UITF 28 Operating Leases Incentives, the benefit is being 
allocated over the shorter of the lease term and the date of the market review specified in the lease. During the rent-free period a rental charge 
has been recognised in the income statement and accrued as a liability in the balance sheet.
(f) Retirement benefit costs
  Contributions in respect of the group’s defined contribution retirement scheme are charged to the profit and loss account as they fall due.
30.  Profit/ (2009 loss) for the year
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the year. Brooks 
Macdonald Group plc reported profit after tax for the financial year ended 30 June 2010 of £1,350,405 (2009: loss £591,438).
Auditors’ remuneration for audit and other services to the company are set out in note 4.

Explanation of AGM Business
Enclosed with this document is a notice convening the annual general 
meeting of the company for 19 October 2010. This explanatory note 
gives further information on resolutions numbered 2 to 13 set out in the 
notice of AGM.
Resolution 2 – To declare a final dividend
The directors recommend a final dividend of 6.0 pence per ordinary 
share. Subject to approval by shareholders, the final dividend will be 
paid on 25 October 2010 to shareholders on the register on 24 
September 2010.
Resolutions 3 to 8 – To re-elect certain of the directors
Nicholas Holmes, Andrew Shepherd and Colin Harris have all been 
appointed as additional directors since the annual general meeting in 
2009 and, accordingly, the company’s articles of association require 
them to retire from office at this annual general meeting and offer 
themselves for re-election.
In addition, the company’s articles of association state that one third of 
the other directors (or the nearest whole number closest to one third) 
must retire from office at each annual general meeting and offer 
themselves for re-election. In addition, any director who has been in 
office for more than three years since their last appointment or 
re-appointment should also retire and offer themselves for re-election. 
Christopher Macdonald, Christopher Knight and Simon Wombwell are 
therefore offering themselves for re-election on this basis.
Information on each of the directors standing for re-election is set out 
below. The Chairman confirms that each of the directors offering 
themselves for re-election has extensive relevant experience of the group 
and its business. The board is therefore of the opinion that all such 
persons should be re-elected to the board.
Nicholas Holmes (39), joined the Group in 1996 as a trainee and headed 
an investment team in London from 2006 before he was appointed joint 
managing director of Brooks Macdonald Asset Management Limited in 
September 2008. In April of 2010 Nicholas was appointed to the  
group board.
Andrew Shepherd (37), started working in financial services in 1994 and 
was investment director for AFPS Asset Management before joining 
Brooks Macdonald Asset Management in 2002 where he headed an 
investment team before becoming joint managing director in September 
2008.In April of 2010 Andrew was appointed to the group board.
Colin Harris (56), non-executive director, is a qualified solicitor and a 
member of the Law Society of Scotland. Colin worked for Aon as in 
house legal counsel before joining Newton Investment Group in 1985 
where he was chief executive officer from 1998 until his retirement in 
2002. Since retirement Colin has held a number of non-executive posts 
and is currently a non-executive director for Longbow Capital LLP and is 
a trustee of Sevenoaks School Foundation. 
Christopher Macdonald (49), chief executive officer, was one of the 
founding directors of the company in 1991and he has worked in private 
client fund management since 1981. As CEO Chris is responsible for the 
overall strategy and growth of the group and he was instrumental in the 
successful admission to AIM in 2005. Chris has won numerous 
investment awards, is a fellow of the Institute of Professional 
Development and he is a non executive director of Invesco Perpetual 
AIM VCT plc.
Chris Knight (64), has been a non-executive director of Brooks 
Macdonald Group since 2002; he was appointed Chairman in 2005. A 
chartered accountant, Chris was an investment banker for nearly 30 
years, for much of that time with Morgan Grenfell and, following its 
takeover, with Deutsche Bank. He has extensive corporate finance 
experience gained during his banking career in London, New York and 
Hong Kong.He is a non-executive director of Intertek Group plc and of 
Powerflute Oyj.
Simon Wombwell (49), has spent his entire career in the financial 
services industry, primarily involved in the development, sales and 
marketing of investment products and has been a non-executive 
director of Brooks Macdonald Group since 2002. He joined Newton 
Fund Managers in 1994 where he performed a number of roles before 
being appointed Managing Director of Newton Fund Managers in 1998. 
Following the acquisition of Newton by Mellon Bank he was also 
appointed head of UK Distribution for Mellon Global Investments. He 
left Newton Fund Managers and Mellon Global Investments in 2004 and 
was Head of UK Sales and Marketing for Scottish Widows Investment 
Partnership from 2004 until 2010. Simon is an Associate of the Society

Resolution 9 – To re-appoint Moore Stephens LLP as auditors
This Resolution proposes that Moore Stephens LLP should be re-
appointed as the company’s auditors and authorises the directors to 
determine their remuneration.
Resolution 10 – Authority to allot shares
The Companies Act 2006 prevents directors from allotting unissued 
shares without the authority of shareholders in general meeting. In 
certain circumstances this could be unduly restrictive. The directors’ 
existing authority to allot shares, which was granted at the annual 
general meeting held in 2009, will expire at the end of this year’s annual 
general meeting.
Resolution 10 in the notice of annual general meeting will be proposed, as 
an ordinary resolution, to authorise the directors to allot ordinary shares of 
1 pence each in the capital of the company up to a maximum nominal 
amount of £34,150 (i.e. up to 3,415,000 ordinary shares) representing 
approximately 33% of the ordinary shares in issue on 24 September 2010.  
The company does not currently hold any shares in treasury.
The authority conferred by this resolution will expire on the date which 
is fifteen months after the passing of this resolution or, if sooner, at the 
end of next year’s annual general meeting.
The directors have no present plans to allot unissued shares other than 
on the exercise of share options under the company’s employee share 
option schemes. However, the directors believe it to be in the best 
interests of the company that they should continue to have this 
authority so that such allotments can take place to finance appropriate 
business opportunities that may arise.
Resolution 11 – To disapply pre-emption rights
Unless they are given an appropriate authority by shareholders, if the 
directors wish to allot any of the unissued shares for cash or grant rights 
over shares or sell treasury shares for cash (other than pursuant to an 
employee share scheme) they must first offer them to existing 
shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings.  This is known as 
pre-emption rights.
The existing disapplication of these statutory pre-emption rights, which 
was granted at the annual general meeting held in 2009, will expire at 
the end of this year’s annual general meeting. Accordingly, resolution 11 
in the notice of annual general meeting will be proposed, as a special 
resolution, to give the directors power to allot shares without the 
application of these statutory pre-emption rights: first, in relation to 
offers of equity securities by way of rights issue, open offer or similar 
arrangements; and second, in relation to the allotment of equity 
securities for cash up to a maximum aggregate nominal amount of 
£5,120 (i.e. up to 512,000 ordinary shares) (representing approximately 
5% of the ordinary shares in issue on 24 September 2010).
The authority sought and limits set by this resolution will also apply to a 
sale by the company of any shares it holds as treasury shares.  The 
Treasury Share Regulations allow shares purchased by the company out 
of distributable profits to be held as treasury shares, which may then be 
cancelled, sold for cash or used to meet the company’s obligations 
under its employee share based incentive schemes.  Any subsequent 
transfers of treasury shares by the company to satisfy the requirements 
of employee share-based incentive schemes will be counted towards the 
anti-dilution limits for such share issues to the extent required by the 
Association of British Insurers guidelines.
The power conferred by this resolution will expire on the date which 
falls fifteen months after the passing of this resolution or, if sooner, at 
the end of next year’s annual general meeting.
Resolution 12 – Company’s authority to purchase its own shares
Resolution 12 in the notice of annual general meeting, which will be 
proposed as a special resolution, will authorise the company to make 
market purchases of up to 1,000,000 ordinary shares. The existing 
authority to make market purchases of ordinary shares, which was 
granted at the annual general meeting held in 2009, will expire at the 
end of this year’s annual general meeting.
The number of ordinary shares stated in this resolution equals 
approximately 10% of the company’s ordinary shares in issue on 24 
September 2010. The minimum price that may be paid is the nominal 
value of an ordinary share (i.e. 1 pence), and the maximum price shall 
not exceed 5% above the average of the middle market quotations for 
an ordinary share for the five business days before each purchase is 
made (exclusive of expenses).

Brooks Macdonald Group plc
The authority conferred by this resolution will expire on the date which 
falls fifteen months after the passing of this resolution or, if sooner, at 
the end of next year’s annual general meeting.
The directors are committed to managing the company’s capital 
effectively. Although the directors have no plans to make such 
purchases, buying back the company’s ordinary shares is one of the 
options they keep under review. Purchases would only be made after 
considering the effect on earnings per share, and the benefits for 
shareholders generally.
The company may hold in treasury any of its own shares that it purchases 
pursuant to the Treasury Share Regulations and the authority conferred by 
this resolution. This would give the company the ability to re-issue 
treasury shares quickly and cost effectively and would provide the 
company with greater flexibility in the management of its capital base.
Resolution 13 – Adoption of new Long Term Incentive Scheme 
In order to further align the interests of senior employees with those of 
shareholders, the board is now proposing to introduce a new incentive 
scheme, the Brooks Macdonald Group Long Term Incentive Scheme (the 
“LTIS”), under which it may grant nil-price options. Options will vest 
after three years, subject to the satisfaction of appropriately stretching 
performance conditions. For the initial awards, the board proposes to 
use performance conditions similar to those used under the existing 
incentive scheme.
A copy of the rules of the LTIS is available for inspection at the registered 
office of the company at 111 Park Street, London W1K 7JL during 
normal business hours on any weekday and at the place of the AGM for 
at least 15 minutes prior to and at the annual general meeting.  In 
addition the principal terms of the rules of the LTIS are summarised in 
the appendix to the notice of annual general meeting.
Resolution 13 in the notice of annual general meeting, which will be 
proposed as an ordinary resolution, will adopt the LTIS in the form of 
the draft rules produced to the meeting (and summarised in the 
appendix to the notice of AGM) and authorise the directors to 
implement the LTIS.

Special Business
Directors’ authority to allot shares
To resolve as an ordinary resolution:
10   That the directors be generally and unconditionally authorised 
pursuant to section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 (“the Act”) to 
exercise all the powers of the Company to allot shares in the 
Company and to grant rights to subscribe for, or to convert any 
security into, shares in the Company (“Relevant Securities”), up to a 
maximum aggregate nominal amount of £34,150, for a period 
expiring (unless previously revoked, varied or renewed) on the date 
which is fifteen months after the passing of this resolution or, if 
sooner, the end of the next annual general meeting of the 
Company.  However, in each case the Company may make an offer 
or agreement which would or might require Relevant Securities to 
be allotted after this authority expires and the directors may allot 
Relevant Securities in pursuance of such offer or agreement as if this 
authority had not expired.
  All previous unutilised authorities given to the directors pursuant to 
section 551 of the Act shall cease to have effect at the conclusion of 
the annual general meeting, save to the extent that those authorities 
are exercisable pursuant to section 551(7) of the Act by reason of 
any offer or agreement made prior to the date of this resolution 
which would or might require shares to be allotted or rights to be 
granted on or after that date.
Disapplication of pre-emption rights
To resolve as a special resolution:
11   That, subject to the passing of resolution 10 above, the directors be 
generally empowered pursuant to sections 570 and 573 of the Act 
to allot equity securities (within the meaning of section 560 of the 
Act) for cash, pursuant to the authority conferred by resolution 10, 
as if section 561 of the Act did not apply to such allotment, 
provided that this power shall expire on the date which is fifteen 
months after the passing of this resolution or, if sooner, the end of 
the next annual general meeting of the Company.  This power shall 
be limited to the allotment of equity securities:
11.1   in connection with an offer of equity securities (including, without 
limitation, under a rights issue, open offer or similar arrangement) in 
favour of holders of Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company 
in proportion (as nearly as may be practicable) to their existing 
holdings of Ordinary Shares but subject to such exclusions or other 
arrangements as the directors deem necessary or expedient in 
relation to fractional entitlements or any legal, regulatory or practical 
problems under the laws of any territory, or the requirements of any 
regulatory body or stock exchange; and 
11.2   otherwise than pursuant to paragraph 11.1 up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £5,120;
  but the Company may, before such expiry, make an offer or 
agreement which would or might require equity securities to be 
allotted after this power expires and the directors may allot equity 
securities in pursuance of such offer or agreement as if this power 
had not expired.
  This power applies in relation to a sale of shares which is an 
allotment of equity securities by virtue of section 560(2)(b) of the 
Act as if in the first paragraph of this resolution the words “pursuant 
to the authority conferred by resolution 10” were omitted.
  All previous unutilised powers given to the directors pursuant to 
sections 570 and 573 of the Act shall cease to have effect at the 
conclusion of this annual general meeting.
Company’s authority to purchase its own shares
To resolve as a special resolution:
12   That the Company be generally authorised pursuant to section 701 of 
the Act to make market purchases (within the meaning of section 
693(4) of the Act) of its Ordinary Shares of £0.01 each on such terms 
and in such manner as the directors shall determine, provided that:

purchased is 1,000,000;
12.2   the maximum price which may be paid for each Ordinary Share 
shall be 5% above the average of the middle market quotations for 
an Ordinary Share (as derived from The Stock Exchange Daily 
Official List) for the five business days immediately before the day on 
which the purchase is made (in each case exclusive of expenses);
12.3   the minimum price which may be paid for each Ordinary Share shall 
be £0.01; and
12.4   this authority (unless previously revoked, varied or renewed) shall 
expire on the date which is fifteen months after the passing of this 
resolution or, if sooner, the end of the next annual general meeting 
of the Company, except in relation to the purchase of Ordinary 
Shares the contract for which was concluded before such date and 
which will or may be executed wholly or partly after such date.
Adoption of new Long Term Incentive Scheme
To resolve as an ordinary resolution:
13   That:
13.1   the new Brooks Macdonald Group Long Term Incentive Scheme 
(the “LTIS”), the draft rules of which are to be produced to the 
meeting marked “LTIS Rules”, and (for the purposes of identification 
only) initialled by the Chairman, be adopted and that such rules be 
and are hereby approved in the form of the draft; and 
13.2   the directors (or an appropriately constituted committee of 
directors) are hereby authorised to do all acts and things which 
they may consider necessary or expedient for implementing, 
giving effect to and operating the LTIS approved under the 
preceding paragraph of this resolution.

Your rights to appoint a proxy
1   As a member of the Company you are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of your rights to attend and to speak and vote at a meeting of the Company.  A proxy does not need to 
be a member of the Company.  You may appoint more than one proxy in relation to a meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or 
shares held by you.
2   You may appoint a proxy in respect of all or some only of the shares held by you.  If you do not want to appoint a proxy in respect of all of the shares held by you, delete the word “all” in 
square brackets and insert the number of shares in respect of which you wish to appoint your proxy in the box provided.  If you sign and return this proxy form with no number inserted, you 
will be deemed to have appointed your proxy in respect of all of the shares held by you.
3   If you require additional proxy forms in order to appoint more than one proxy, please contact the Company’s registrar, Capita Registrars Limited, or you may copy this form.  Please indicate 
by ticking the box provided if the proxy appointment is one of multiple appointments being made.  You must also indicate in the separate box the number of shares in relation to which the 
proxy holder is authorised to act as your proxy.  All proxy forms must be signed and should, wherever possible, be returned together in one envelope.
4   If you appoint a proxy, this does not preclude you from attending the meeting and voting in person.
Procedure for appointing a proxy
5  Please insert your full name and address in block capitals in the box.
6   To appoint as your proxy a person other than the chairman of the meeting, delete the words in square brackets and insert the full name and address of your chosen proxy in block capitals in 
the box.  If you sign and return this proxy form with no name inserted in the box, the chairman of the meeting will be deemed to be your proxy.  Where you appoint as your proxy someone 
other than the chairman of the meeting, it is your responsibility to ensure that that person attends the meeting and is aware of your voting intentions.  If you wish your proxy to make any 
comments on your behalf, you will need to appoint someone other than the chairman of the meeting and give that person your directions.
Directing your proxy how to vote
7   To direct your proxy how to vote on the resolutions mark the appropriate box with a “ ✓”or an “X”.  If no voting direction is given, your proxy can vote or abstain from voting as he or she 
chooses.  Your proxy has the right to vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she chooses in relation to any other business (including a resolution to adjourn the meeting or to amend a 
resolution) which may properly come before the meeting.
8   The “vote withheld” option is provided to enable you to abstain on any particular resolution.  However, it should be noted that a “vote withheld” is not a vote in law and will not be counted 
in the calculation of the proportion of the votes “for” and “against” a resolution.

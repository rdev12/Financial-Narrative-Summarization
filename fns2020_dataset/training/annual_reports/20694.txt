Strategic report
Financial highlights As your Interim Chairman, I am 
honoured to be presenting our 2016 
Annual Report, which highlights 
another year of excellent progress 
against our strategic objectives.”
Danuta Gray,
Interim Chairman
Another year of 
substantial progress
During the year the Group has 
continued executing on its strategy 
to deliver ‘banking as it should be’ to 
more customers and generating strong, 
sustainable returns for shareholders. 
Earnings per share have increased 
by 11% to 25.2p, generating an 
underlying return on average equity 
of 18%. These are excellent results in 
competitive markets and a testament 
to the dedication of colleagues across 
the Group.
Resilience in an uncertain 
operating environment
As well as being a year of considerable 
progress for Aldermore, 2016 has 
been a year of change and uncertainty 
for the banking industry as a whole, 
with evolving regulation, political 
developments and their corresponding 
impacts on the global economy. 
In particular, the UK’s referendum 
on EU membership and vote to leave 
introduced considerable volatility to 
financial markets, which impacted 
the share price of many companies, 
including Aldermore and other 
specialist lenders, as shown in the 
chart opposite. Following the vote, 
Aldermore’s business model has 
remained resilient, demonstrated by 
our financial results and partly reflected 
in the share price performance 
during the second half of the year. 
There remains much uncertainty 
regarding the precise nature and timing 
of Britain’s exit from the EU. However, 
the Board remains confident that the 
business can continue to respond to the 
opportunities and threats this presents 
and continue to successfully deliver 
against our strategic objectives.
6 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Strategic report
Chairman’s 
statement Commitment to strong 
Governance
The Board’s responsibility to provide 
strong and effective governance 
remains paramount. Throughout 2016 
we were fully compliant with the 
Corporate Governance Code 2014 
and having overseen the Board 
effectiveness review in my capacity 
as Senior Independent Director, I have 
every confidence in the continued 
strength and cumulative experience 
of the Board. 
I would like to take this opportunity to 
welcome Chris Patrick to the Board 
and to thank Peter Cartwright and Neil 
Cochrane for their services as Non- 
Executive Directors. Both Peter and 
Neil made valuable contributions to the 
Aldermore Board, as representatives 
of our Principal Shareholders, AnaCap 
Financial Partners LLP. 
On behalf of the Board I would also like 
to extend particular gratitude to Glyn 
Jones, who has served as Chairman 
of the Aldermore Board since March 
2014. Glyn played an instrumental 
role in Aldermore’s significant growth 
and transition to a listed company and 
leaves behind a strong, experienced and 
dedicated Board. 
We are progressing in our search 
for a successor for Glyn and are 
confident we will secure a strong 
replacement to oversee Aldermore’s 
continuing progress. 
Our communities
We remain committed to investing in 
our communities, whether that is within 
Aldermore through development of the 
team; our local communities through 
volunteering and fundraising; or the 
broader UK economy through lending to 
businesses, homeowners and landlords. 
We are also committed to strong 
corporate citizenship. 
We support the drive to create greater 
accountability and transparency 
throughout the banking sector and 
have worked to ensure compliance 
with the FCAs Senior Management 
Regime from March 2016, as well as 
joining the Banking Standards Board in 
the year. We are also proud signatories 
of the Women in Finance Charter and 
are committed to both developing 
greater female representation in 
senior positions across the Group and 
promoting the advantages of diversity 
more broadly across the business. 
More on our role in our communities can 
be found in our Corporate Responsibility 
Section on pages 36–38. 
Outlook
The Board is committed to supporting 
the substantial progress Aldermore 
is making in operational development 
and financial performance, as well 
as managing the challenges that 
this presents. 
The EU referendum introduced greater 
uncertainty. However, the UK economy 
has remained resilient to date. 
Your Board remains confident that 
Aldermore can continue to grow within 
existing risk appetite generating strong, 
sustainable returns for shareholders.

7 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Aldermore is focused solely in the UK, so what happens 
in the economy here matters to us. For example, 
the pricing of loans and savings products are often 
impacted by the base rate set by the Bank of England 
and confidence in economic growth can impact on a 
demand for homes or funding for business investment.
This year
2016 was an eventful year for the macro-economy, 
with the UK’s decision to leave the EU being a 
significant source of volatility. This caused many 
economists to initially downgrade their expectations 
of UK GDP growth before subsequently revising 
them upwards as the economy proved resilient to the 
political uncertainty. The Bank of England also reacted 
to the risk to the economy from the referendum by 
lowering the base rate to 0.25% and extending their 
quantitative easing programme with the introduction 
of the Term Funding Scheme (TFS).
Key impact
The lowering of the Bank of England base rate was 
largely neutral to Aldermore as we passed on the 
impact through both sides of our balance sheet, 
while the likelihood of any material changes to Bank 
of England rates in the near future remains small. 
The TFS has provided a benefit, as we can use it to fund 
new lending growth into the UK economy at a lower 
interest expense.
Despite the volatility in financial markets, customer 
outlook remains broadly positive with Aldermore’s 
SME Future Attitudes report indicating that four 
out of five SMEs are confident about their business 
performance in 2017.
Given its importance to the economy, banking is 
a highly regulated market and can be affected by 
changes in legislation. In the UK, the PRA, and the FCA 
are the primary bodies which regulate the banking 
industry, ensuring effective prudential management 
and fair conduct, respectively. Together these bodies 
ensure that local and European law are effectively 
applied to the UK banking industry.
This year
A number of new laws and items of regulation, which 
directly impacted the banking market, were introduced 
or announced during 2016. The main themes of changes 
impacting Aldermore concerned the buy-to- let (BTL) 
property market, taxation and capital requirements. 
In the BTL market, new laws introduced by the 
Government included a higher rate of stamp duty 
payable from April 2016 and a reduction in mortgage 
interest tax deductibility for landlords phasing in from 
April 2017. The PRA announced changes to affordability 
testing effective from January 2017 and revised 
underwriting requirements for landlords with four 
or more properties effective from September 2017. 
2016 also saw the introduction of the 8% banking tax 
surcharge announced in 2015 and further consultation 
on capital requirements and risk-weightings by the 
Basel Committee on Banking Standards. 
Key impact
Aldermore has a comprehensive BTL offering, serving 
many types of customer from individual property 
owners through to incorporated professional landlords. 
Demand has remained strong throughout 2016, as 
reflected in the record levels of origination. In 2017, 
the forthcoming regulatory changes may result in a 
shift towards more professional investors, favouring 
specialist lenders, such as Aldermore. Developments in 
capital requirements are yet to be finalised, however 
Aldermore is taking steps to mitigate impacts, discussed 
further in our Emerging Risk Section on pages 34–35.
8 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Strategic report
Market overview
Legal and regulation Macro-economy Since the global financial crisis in 2009 – when 
Aldermore was founded - ensuring healthy competition 
and fair customer outcomes in the UK banking market 
has been in sharp focus for both the regulator and the 
Competition and Markets Authority. In the aftermath 
of the crisis many banks stopped serving groups of 
customers, particularly certain small and medium sized 
businesses and first-time homebuyers, which provided 
an opportunity for Aldermore to grow through serving 
these unmet needs.
This year
Aldermore’s primary markets are mortgages and 
business finance. Although these are competitive 
markets, Aldermore is recognised by brokers and 
customers for its ‘can do’ approach and occupies 
leading positions in several of its chosen business 
areas. Within the asset finance market, we continue 
to see consolidation in the broker channel and expect 
competition to increase as new lenders attempt to 
build a presence.
The residential mortgages market remains highly 
competitive and concentrated amongst the large high 
street banks. In this market, Aldermore serves credit-
worthy niches, including the self employed and first-
time buyers, where it has taken particular advantage of 
Government schemes. In BTL Aldermore has continued 
to benefit from market growth and is well positioned 
to benefit from the increased professionalisation of 
the market.
Key impact
Throughout 2016 Aldermore has continued to grow and 
maintain attractive margins in each of our key markets, 
as demonstrated by record levels of origination and 
robust net interest margins. We are confident that 
we can continue to meet the challenge presented by 
competitors and continue to deliver profitable and 
sustainable growth within our prudent risk appetite. 
The traditional banking model of large branch networks 
and standardised single-channel service is outdated. 
Customers and intermediaries are increasingly 
demanding online or digital servicing as well as 
greater flexibility in savings and borrowing products. 
The response has been the emergence and growth of 
new entrants like Aldermore. 
This year
Aldermore has established a track record of agility in 
deploying resources to serve unmet customer demand 
through specialist underwriting. In particular during 
2016, Aldermore was able to respond with agility to a 
surge in BTL mortgage demand early in the year, ahead 
of changes to Stamp-Duty Land Tax, and again in the 
fourth quarter. Additionally, we have developed our 
brand and since the year end, launched our new visual 
identity which has been designed to capture the bold 
and enterprising spirit of our customers as we help 
them to seek and seize opportunities.
Key impact
By deploying specialist underwriting expertise 
Aldermore is able to serve the needs of customers, 
such as complex portfolio landlords that other 
traditional volume-focused banks can’t. This deep 
expertise and operational agility has enabled us to 
continue growing and helping more customers to 
seek and seize opportunities in their professional and 
personal lives. We continue to invest in improving our 
digital propositions and servicing to customers and 
brokers as is reflected in the high levels of customer 
advocacy we received in 2016.

11 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Banking as it should be
The key drivers of our performance 
in 2016 are rooted in our purpose. 
Since the Bank was founded in 2009, 
we have sought to challenge the status 
quo and empower more people across 
Britain to seek and seize opportunities 
in their professional and personal lives 
by providing ‘banking as it should be’. 
In doing so, we are addressing a market 
opportunity that is as real today as 
it was in the aftermath of the global 
financial crisis. In fact, as the market 
has matured, companies and individuals 
have increasingly recognised that a 
different kind of banking experience is 
both possible and available.
As a specialist bank, we don’t compete 
head on with the traditional banks in 
their main markets. We go beyond 
their one-size fits all approach by 
employing specialist underwriters 
to understand each individual, and 
by making sure we offer a service 
that works for them. We operate in 
carefully selected segments where 
we have the necessary experience 
and expertise to deliver strong and 
sustainable risk-adjusted returns 
through responsible lending. We benefit 
from a modern infrastructure and 
an efficient distribution model, using 
an approved network of specialist 
intermediaries and, increasingly, direct 
relationships with customers online or 
by telephone, without the need for a 
costly branch network.
A record year
It is with great pride that we are 
reporting another record year for 
Aldermore, demonstrating continued 
progress on the journey we described 
at IPO. I am particularly pleased that 
we were able to deliver such a strong 
performance despite the uncertainty 
presented by the UK’s referendum on 
EU membership. While the full political 
and economic implications of this 
2016 was another great year for 
Aldermore, with more customers 
than ever choosing us to serve their 
needs and profitability at record highs. 
As we move forward on our journey, 
I am confident that we can continue to 
build on this momentum, helping more 
customers to seize opportunities.”
Phillip Monks OBE,
Chief Executive Officer
12 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Strategic report
Chief Executive Officer’s 
review decision are as yet unknown, the UK 
economy has remained resilient to date, 
and we continue to closely monitor our 
operating environment for any change.
Throughout the year, the Group 
has performed well and customer 
confidence remained high. We ended 
the year with strong growth, a robust 
credit performance and a healthy 
pipeline, giving us confidence that we 
are well positioned for further success.
Continuing commitment 
to UK businesses, 
homeowners, landlords 
and savers
Net loans to customers increased by 
£1.3bn, or 22% to £7.5bn at the end of 
2016, driven by record levels of organic 
origination. This record performance 
was seen across both Business Finance 
and Mortgages, where, respectively, 
£1bn and £2bn of new customer loans 
were provided. 
In Business Finance, we focus in both 
the asset finance and invoice finance 
markets. In Asset Finance we have 
leveraged our efficient broker-led 
distribution model to build a market 
leading position in this channel. 
Our specialist underwriting advantage 
in transport, plant and machinery, and 
other areas of expertise, enabled us 
to grow net lending by 7% to £1.6bn 
during 2016.
Across our Mortgages franchise 
we grew lending by 24% to £5.7bn. 
This was led by our broad customer 
offering in Buy-to-Let (BTL) which 
enabled us to grow BTL lending by 
38% to £3.3bn. In SME Commercial 
Mortgages, where we have particular 
expertise in underwriting multi-let 
investment properties, lending grew 
by 12% to £930m. In our Residential 
Mortgages business we are committed 
to truly understanding our customers’ 
circumstances which, with our focus on 
creditworthy segments of the market, 
enabled us to grow lending by 7% to 
£1.5bn.
Loan growth continues to be primarily 
funded by our award-winning deposit 
franchise. The performance of our 
savings business is driven by our 
straightforward and transparent 
proposition and our promise, that 
savers get “great returns effortlessly”. 
Our dynamic online franchise enables 
customers to tailor products to their 
needs and our transparent approach 
means we don’t use teaser rates. 
This approach drove an increase in 
deposits of 16% to £6.7bn in 2016. 
Business customers provide both 
c30% of this balance and a high level 
of advocacy, with 97% of customers 
surveyed saying they would 
recommend Aldermore to others.
Profit before tax up by over 
a third
Reported profit before tax rose 36% 
to a record high of £129m, driven 
by continued benefits from our 
growing franchises, a healthy net 
interest margin of 3.5% and further 
improvement in operational leverage 
with the cost to income ratio falling to 
below 45%. Our management of risk 
remains robust as demonstrated in a 
cost of risk of just 0.23%, and less than 
0.5% of our loans by value being classed 
as non-performing.
Enhanced balance sheet 
strength and strong 
shareholder returns
2016 was also an important year in 
further strengthening our balance 
sheet. While our fully loaded CRD IV 
CET1 ratio reduced by 0.3% to 11.5% 
over 2016, we reached the point of 
capital self-sufficiency in the second 
half of the year when our ratio rose 
by 0.5%. This increase was driven by 
record levels of profitability and was in 
line with our guidance at IPO. We expect 
our CET1 capital ratio to continue rising 
in the coming years, as we deliver 
strong, sustainable earnings. 
Overall, the Group generated underlying 
earnings per share of 26.4p and an 
underlying return on equity of 18%, or 
20% prior to the impact of the 8% bank 
tax surcharge introduced in 2016.
Strengthening the team
The excellent progress seen in 2016 is 
the result of the experience and effort 
that everyone at Aldermore puts into 
supporting customers on a daily basis 
and for this I extend gratitude to all my 
colleagues across the Group.
During the year I was delighted to 
welcome three new members to the 
Executive team. Christine Palmer 
joined us as Chief Risk Officer, Dana 
Cuffe joined as Chief Operating 
Officer and Rob Divall joined as the 
Group HR Director. All of my new 
Executive colleagues have tremendous 
experience in their fields and it is a real 
testament to the business and the 
progress we have made that we can 
continue to attract such high calibre 
executives, who share our vision 
and can help successfully drive us 
forward. I also express my gratitude 
to our outgoing Executive team 
members Steve Barry, Vicki Harris, 
Ali Humphries and Paul Myers for all 
that they contributed during their time 
with Aldermore.
Strategic priorities
As we seek to further enhance the 
sustainability of returns, our strategic 
priorities will continue to be delivering 
further growth, increasing efficiency 
and maintaining our robust approach to 
risk management.

Read on for more on our strategic 
priorities and progress in 2016. Strategic objective Our progress in 2016
Customer-driven:
Helping more customers to seek 
and seize opportunities
We will continue helping more customers across 
Britain to seek and seize opportunities, whether 
that’s growing their business, buying their first 
home or securing a fair return on their savings. 
Our focus remains on serving diverse pools of 
customer demand and adjacent markets, where 
we can operate as an agile, service-focused 
specialist player in large markets, providing us with 
multiple levers for growth.
• 2016 was a record year for originations with over £3bn lent across Business Finance and 
Mortgages. T otal customer numbers also reached an all-time high at over 220k, while our 
customer advocacy continued to improve as NPS grew from +29 to +43
• We received further recognition for our service, products and expertise in 2016, winning 
awards across all of our franchises, including ‘Leasing and Asset Finance Provider of the 
Year’ (NACFB), ‘Best Specialist Mortgage Lender’ (Your Mortgage) and ‘Best Business 
Savings Provider’ (Moneynet)
• Our market-leading breadth of offering in Buy-to-Let helped us support more landlords 
than ever, as we grew customer numbers by 25% to c20k, originating over £1.2bn of 
loans, despite the increased market complexity
• We continued to serve specialist segments of the residential mortgage market and 
invested in enhancing our propositions, including those for the self-employed and first 
time buyers
• We also invested in developing our retention strategy in Mortgages, providing greater 
choice and support for customers looking for their next product
Simply delivered:  
Developing our scalable,
effective and efficient
operating model
Aldermore benefits from modern, scalable 
systems and an efficient online broker-led 
distribution model, as opposed to a costly branch 
network. We continue to invest in key capabilities 
and technology, optimising our operating model 
to support the delivery of growth with enhanced 
levels of service, capability and efficiency.
• We generated greater operational leverage in the business, bringing the underlying cost 
to income ratio below 45%
• As well as introducing new Executives we also bolstered the wider teams during 2016, 
strengthening expertise across the Group including, a new Head of Enterprise Risk, Chief 
Information Officer and Chief Data Officer
• We progressed a number of improvement initiatives over the year, including enhanced 
digital capability, process simplification, platform upgrades and a refresh of our brand and 
customer segmentation
Securely managed:  
Maintaining a diverse and  
low-risk business model
As specialist underwriters, our ability to 
understand our customers’ circumstances and 
the value of underlying assets is a source of 
competitive advantage. Growth is supported and 
controlled by a consistent risk appetite and robust 
risk management framework, which drives our 
prudent approach across all areas of the Group.
• Our credit quality remained well within our appetite as we incurred a cost of risk of 23bps 
and maintained non-performing loans below 0.5% of our portfolio
• We continue to originate in line with centrally controlled underwriting standards, including 
stress testing affordability, before going on to re-score the portfolio on a monthly basis
• We made a number of enhancements to our credit risk models through our on-going 
work to become IFRS9 compliant ahead of the January 2018 implementation date

Strategic report – Chief Executive Officer’s review
Our strategy – supporting strong 
and sustainable returns Outlook for 2017 and beyond Key performance indicators
As we deliver on the first priority of our 
strategy, we expect to grow our loan book 
by between 10% and 15% in 2017 with further 
growth thereafter and the portfolio mix 
remaining broadly stable. The exact pace of 
growth will be dependent on our ability to 
grow within our prudent risk appetite, while 
delivering strong and sustainable returns.
We will also continue to invest in efficiency, 
and enhanced operating leverage in order 
to deliver on our second strategic priority. 
This, combined with our planned growth, 
is consistent with the cost to income ratio 
declining below 40% over the medium term. 
In line with our third strategic priority, we will 
retain a prudent approach to risk across the 
bank over 2017 and beyond to support the 
sustainability of earnings
We are delighted with the Group’s 
performance in 2016 and remain positive on 
our outlook notwithstanding the economic 
uncertainty and potential changes to 
regulatory capital requirements. The Board will 
therefore continue to consider the payment of 
dividends while taking into account the growth 
opportunities available, anticipated changes 
in capital requirements, and once the Group’s 
CET 1 ratio is above 12%. 
In conclusion…
I’m delighted that our record performance 
in 2016 continues to demonstrate delivery 
against our business plan and targets 
and I would like to thank our customers, 
colleagues and shareholders for their 
continued support. 
We have clear strategic priorities to further 
create and unlock value across the business, 
as we continue to serve and delight our 
customers and generate strong and 
sustainable returns for our shareholders.

15 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Loans to customers up 
22% with originations 
at record levels
2016 loan growth was driven by record 
levels of origination across both our 
Business Finance and Mortgages 
divisions at over £1bn and £2bn 
respectively, as we continue to build 
our diversified portfolio. This record 
level of originations was partly offset 
by £1.8bn of redemptions in the year. 
This level of redemptions represents 
almost a third of the loan portfolio at the 
start of the year, and an 83% increase 
on redemptions in 2015, reflecting the 
growing maturity of the business.
Net loans to customers reached 
£7.5bn (31 December 2015: £6.1bn), 
as the number of customers grew 
by 17% to over 80,000 with more UK 
businesses, homeowners and landlords 
choosing Aldermore to serve their 
borrowing needs. 
Business Finance up 15% 
to £1.7bn
Asset Finance grew by 17% to £1,573m 
as our expertise in a broad range of 
asset classes allowed us to maintain 
our market leading position in the 
broker-channel and grow our wholesale 
proposition by 60%.
Invoice Finance continued to focus on 
returns, moving toward larger invoice 
discounting for small businesses 
and structured finance, and away 
from lower value factoring business. 
This was reflected in a 4% decline in 
loans to £154m, whilst segmental 
profits increased by over 50%.
Mortgages up 24% to £5.7bn
SME Commercial Mortgages saw a 
growing proportion of customers 
engaging with us directly, reflecting our 
reputation for expertise and service. 
This contributed to loan growth of 
12% to £930m, despite tightening 
our appetite for development-based 
lending following the EU referendum.

In Buy-to-Let, our broad customer 
offering enabled us to grow lending by 
38% to £3,326m. This strong growth 
also reflects our operational agility, 
as we took advantage of the market 
spikes in the first quarter, ahead of 
the introduction of an increase in 
stamp duty, and in the fourth quarter 
when we successfully took share in an 
active market.
In Residential Mortgages, our 
approach to understanding each of our 
customers’ circumstances enabled 
us to grow lending by 7% to £1,494m. 
This growth was driven by £466m of 
originations which, more than offset a 
high level of redemptions on Help to Buy 
mortgages written two years ago when 
Aldermore was the first to market with 
the product.
Deposit-led funding model, 
with balances rising 16%
Our funding strategy remains 
deposit-led whilst, we actively 
manage wholesale sources, such 
as Government and central bank 
schemes, to provide diversification and 
drive an efficient cost of funds. As at 
31 December 2016, our loan to deposit 
ratio was in line with management 
expectations at 112% (31 December 
2015: 107%).
Our dynamic and innovative online 
savings franchise, which provides 
award-winning savings products to 
c140,000 customers grew by 16% to 
£6.7bn (31 December 2015: £5.7bn) 
benefitting from strong rates of 
retention at c70%. SME deposits of 
£1.6bn (31 December 2015: £1.4bn) 
and our Corporate deposits of £260m 
(31 December 2015: £156m) now 
represent almost a third of all deposits.
Wholesale funding increased by 54% 
to £982m (31 December 2015: £636m) 
and predominantly consists of on-
balance sheet funding via repurchase 
agreements of Funding for Lending 
Scheme (FLS) Treasury Bills, drawings 
through the Term Funding Scheme 
(TFS) and our Residential Mortgage 
Backed Securitisation (RMBS). 
As at the end of 2016, under the Bank 
of England’s SME lending extension 
of FLS, the Group had on-balance 
sheet funding of £355m. We were 
also the first bank to utilise the Bank 
of England’s newly launched TFS, 
with £396m of funding having been 
accessed by the end of 2016.
The outstanding balance on our 
RMBS as at 31 December 2016 
stood at £131m (31 December 
2015: £194m). This reduction reflects 
the capital repayments on the 
underlying mortgages.
Other wholesale funding predominantly 
consists of Tier 2 debt capital of £100m 
(31 December 2015: £38m). In October 
2016, £60m subordinated loan notes 
were successfully issued adding to our 
existing Tier 2 Notes which were issued 
in 2012 and have an option to call in 
May 2017.
Profits up demonstrating 
continued strong returns
Profit before tax for the year increased 
by 36% to £128.7m (2015: £94.7m) as 
we maintain healthy margins across 
a larger loan book. Excluding £4.1m 
for both the goodwill impairment in 
2016 and the 2015 pre-tax IPO related 
costs, the underlying profit before 
tax increased by 34% to £132.8m 
(2015: £98.8m).
The tax charge for the year increased 
by 115% to £35.2m (2015: £16.4m). 
This increase reflects the Group’s 
increased profitability as well as the 
introduction of the 8% bank corporation 
tax surcharge on taxable profits 
above £25m from 1 January 2016. 
The effective tax rate of 27% in 2016 
(2015: 17%) comprises the standard 
20% corporate tax rate plus the 8% 
surcharge. Statutory profit after tax 
therefore increased by 19% to £93.5m 
(2015: £78.3m).
The return on equity generated in 
the period was 17.2%, or 18.0% on an 
underlying basis, and was in line with 
our commitment to delivering returns in 
the high teens. The 2016 basic earnings 
per share was 25.2p, on both a basic and 
fully diluted basis.
17 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Operating income 
increases 19% 
During 2016 interest income grew by 
19% to £358.2m driven by continuing 
net loan growth. The Group’s average 
gross yield fell slightly to 5.3% 
(2015: 5.5%), primarily as a result 
of the lower rate environment and 
competition in Asset Finance and a 
change in mix with the comparatively 
lower yielding BTL portfolio growing at 
a faster pace than other portfolios.
Interest expense increased by 17% 
to £118.8m as we funded our lending 
growth. We also continued to benefit 
from diversified funding and access 
to lower cost Government schemes, 
reducing our average cost of funds to 
1.7% (2015: 1.9%).
As a result, the Group’s net interest 
income increased by 20% to £239.4m 
(2015: £198.9m) while, as expected, the 
net interest margin remained broadly 
stable at 3.5% (2015: 3.6%). Net fee 
and other operating income rose by 
12% reflecting a higher volume of 
property valuations as a result of new 
mortgage lending. 
Growth in operating 
expenses controlled to 
a 3% rise
Operating expenses were well 
controlled, increasing by 3% to 
£123.3m (2015: £119.6m), in line with 
management expectations. Within this, 
administrative expenses rose by 5% 
to £113.1m (2015: £107.9m), primarily 
reflecting the recruitment of colleagues 
to further support growth and enhance 
risk management. 
Provisions of £0.8m in 2016 were 65% 
lower than in 2015, due to the payment 
of the capital element of the Financial 
Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) 
levy having now been completed by 
the banking industry. Depreciation and 
amortisation was consistent with last 
year at £5.3m (2015: £5.3m). 
Given their material and one-off nature, 
costs related to our IPO in 2015 and the 
impairment of goodwill related to our 
Invoice Finance business in 2016 are 
removed from our financial metrics 
to provide an ‘underlying’ view of our 
performance. This resulted in our cost 
to income ratio on an underlying basis 
declining by six percentage points to 
45% (2015: 51%).

Loan impairments rise 
while cost of risk remains 
low at 23bps
We maintain a robust approach to risk 
management and this, combined with 
a relatively benign credit environment, 
has resulted in our cost of risk 
remaining low and below expectations 
at 0.23%. Impairments increased by 
49% to £15.5m (2015: £10.4m), within 
which our collective charge grew by 
31% to £4.7m (2015: £3.6m) reflecting 
the growth of the loan book and a 
further degree of caution, reflecting 
increased economic uncertainty 
following the UK’s vote to leave the 
EU. Individual impairments of £10.8m 
were 58% higher than 2015 due to 
2016 having seen impairments taken 
in relation to a relatively small number 
of exposures, while these had been 
abnormally low in 2015.
A robust capital position 
The Group maintains a strong capital 
position and after becoming capital 
generative in the second half of 2016 
closed the year with a fully loaded 
CRD IV total capital ratio of 15.6% 
(31 December 2015: 15.1%) and a CET1 
ratio of 11.5% (31 December 2015: 11.8%). 
These movements reflect the profit 
after tax of £93.5m offset by growth 
in Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) of 
£883m and the post-tax AT1 coupon 
of £6.6m, payable annually in April. 
The total capital ratio also benefits from 
the issuance of £60m Tier 2 Notes in 
October 2016. 
18 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Strategic report
Chief Financial Officer’s review
continued RWAs increased by 24% reflecting 
loan growth of 22% and the increase 
in the Basic Indicator Approach (BIA) 
Operational Risk charge which is 
updated in the first quarter each 
year based on the average of the last 
three years’ net operating income. 
The Group’s leverage ratio at 7.0% 
(31 December 2015: 7.2%) remains 
significantly above forthcoming 
regulatory minimums. 
As of 1 January 2017, Aldermore’s 
total CET1 requirements under normal 
operating conditions, which include PRA 
ICG and Pillar 2B requirements as well as 
the phased in CRD IV buffers are higher 
than the 7% AT1 conversion level. 
We are on track with enhancements 
to our credit risk models through our 
work to become IFRS9 compliant for 
January 2018 when the new accounting 
standard is introduced. This takes us 
closer to the sophistication required for 
an Internal Ratings-Based approach 
(IRB) to capital which may help to 
mitigate the risk of future changes in 
capital requirements. We will continue 
to monitor the cost and benefits 
associated to moving to IRB, as the 
regulatory changes and timeframes for 
implementation become clear.
Capital resilient under stress
We periodically test the Group’s 
resilience to severe but plausible 
adverse scenarios. This process 
supports calibration of our stress 
loss buffer, ensuring we are able to 
withstand an economic downturn 
over our five year planning horizon. 
The outcome of this process is a key 
input into other Group processes, 
including the setting of our risk 
appetite, the assessment of our capital 
adequacy, and our assessment of risk-
adjusted returns. 
In 2016 , this process included the 
supervisory H2 2016 Annual Cyclical 
Scenario in addition to Aldermore’s 
internal scenario. This scenario includes; 
a rapid fall in property prices, with 
residential property values declining 
by 32% and commercial by 42%; an 
economic downturn with a cumulative 
4.3% reduction in GDP; unemployment 
rising to almost 10%; the BoE base 
rate falling to 0%; and inflation running 
at 3.4%. 
Under this severe scenario, higher 
impairments including the effect 
of changes to IFRS9, operational 
risk losses and other detrimental 
factors would reduce our projected 
CET1. However, at its lowest point 
post Management actions, the CET1 
ratio is expected to be around 8.5%, 
remaining above the 7% level at which 
our AT1 security converts to equity and 
significantly above our current CET1 
PRA requirement and CRDIV buffers at 
1 January 2017.
Outlook
The process of Britain’s exit from the 
EU may result in economic growth 
deviating from current forecasts, but 
for 2017 there is unlikely to be any 
material impact. Our economic base-
case upon which we set our outlook 
for the coming years includes the 
expectation that;
• house prices will continue to 
rise gradually,
• unemployment remains below 6%,
• the Bank of England base rate 
remains below 1%, and 
• UK GDP growth increases to 
around 2%.
Returns will continue to be delivered 
through a combination of focused loan 
growth, margin stability, and robust 
control of expenses and impairments. 
Specifically we expect;
• 10 – 15% net loan growth in 2017, with 
a broadly stable net interest margin, 
around 3.5% .
• In 2017, we expect an incremental 
increase in costs of between 
£15m and £20m driven by 
ongoing investment, which 
includes mandatory projects and 
strengthening of our teams.
• Despite these additional costs, we 
expect to deliver increased efficiency 
and operating leverage consistent 
with the cost to income ratio declining 
below 40% over the medium term. 
• We also plan to maintain the credit 
quality of the book such that we 
would expect to incur a cost of risk of 
between 25 and 35bps per year over 
the medium term. Further information 
on effect of changes to IFRS9 will 
be provided closer to the January 
2018 implementation.

driven by organic origination of £1bn; 
extending our Asset Finance franchise 
to c50k small UK businesses.
We maintain a leadership position in 
the competitive broker-introduced 
market, supporting a range of customer 
segments across a significant number 
of asset classes. We have also 
expanded our wholesale proposition, 
up c60% year-on-year. Net interest 
income was up 15% in the year to 
£59.4m, with NIM down slightly to 
4.1%, driven by changes in mix and 
tenure, including the expansion of our 
wholesale channel.
Impairments remained low at £5.6m 
(2015: £4.8m), with the cost of risk 
remaining broadly flat at 38bps, 
reflecting the high quality book backed 
by high-levels of tangible collateral. 
The overall segmental profit increased 
15% to £45.1m (2015: £39.3m). 
Market and strategy
The asset finance market was worth 
c£29bn of gross originations in 
2016, growing by 7% year-on-year. 
Aldermore operates as a leader within 
the £5bn broker segment (which grew 
9%) providing both straightforward 
forms of asset finance in addition to 
complex and structured deals which 
play to our specialist underwriting 
advantage. We are also increasing our 
share of smaller transactional deals 
and ‘soft assets’, which grew 15% year 
on year. 
Consolidating our leadership in the 
broker market will be driven by our  
on-going investment programme in 
digital capability, aimed at enhancing 
our service offering by making it 
simpler for brokers to deal with us, 
especially in less complex cases. 
This capability can then be leveraged 
into new market adjacencies, including 
the £9bn vendor finance market.
The market is likely to remain 
competitive in 2017, driven by new 
entrants and consolidation in the 
broker channel, and we expect to see 
a continued trend toward wholesale 
deals. However, customer demand 
remains robust, with Aldermore well-
positioned as market leaders to take 
our natural share of a growing market.

Flexible finance
ECS Engineering Services Ltd (ECS), a 
leading engineering company in Huthwaite 
near Mansfield, put in place the means to 
grow its business with the purchase of 
a new metal plate machine. The machine 
was funded by Aldermore and arranged 
by Newark-based finance broker 
FUNDINGROUND Ltd.
The new Peddinghaus plate machine 
replaced an older unit, enabling ECS 
to increase production capacity and 
provide greater efficiency and flexibility 
in their use of materials. This ultimately 
allows the company to deliver improved 
products to existing clients and to take on 
new orders.
Aldermore worked closely with the 
broker to understand ECS Engineering’s 
requirements to ensure that the finance 
facility was structured appropriately and 
that the asset was delivered promptly.
We urgently required the new plate 
machine to improve versatility, 
efficiency and quality. We were really 
grateful for both FUNDINGROUND’s 
proactive approach and Aldermore’s 
flexibility and speed of delivery.”

capital solutions for UK SMEs, ranging 
from vanilla invoice discounting 
and full-service factoring to more 
tailored customer solutions requiring 
Aldermore’s in-house expertise.
Performance
Performance trends in Invoice Finance 
have shown significant improvement as 
a result of our strategy to consolidate 
and focus on larger discounting facilities 
to small businesses, demonstrated by a 
56% increase in segmental profit. 
Invoice Finance has a relatively short 
lifecycle compared to the Group’s other 
portfolios, whilst net lending declined 
slightly by 4% in 2016 to end the year at 
£154.1m (2015: £160.8m), 19% growth 
in originations reflects our continuing 
focus toward invoice discounting and 
structured finance and away from lower 
value factoring business. 
Fee income of £14.2m declined by 
£1.0m as we refocused and managed 
down customer numbers, reducing 
overall operating income by 7% to 
£19.0m. Administrative expenses were 
reduced by almost a third, reflecting 
management action to increase 
efficiency and focus the customer base 
whilst broadly maintaining overall net 
lending balances.
Impairments remain low, increasing 
by £0.2m to £1.7m, with a cost of risk 
at 108bps. 
Market and strategy
The Invoice Finance business continues 
to offer a vital working capital solution 
for Britain’s small businesses and 
provides a valuable contribution to 
the Group, as well as the potential for 
further opportunities for lending to 
small businesses. Aldermore remains 
a small player with less than 1% of the 
£21bn market.
We will continue to deploy a focused 
strategy, targeting key clients through 
enhanced sales capability, where we 
can develop relationships and support 
client growth. As we grow the client 
base and net lending, we will continue 
to drive efficiencies in the operating 
structure and enhance profitability.

23 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Our SME Commercial Mortgages 
business provides mortgages for 
investment in shops, warehouses, 
industrial units and offices or for 
residential Property Development (PD) 
distributed via financial intermediaries 
or directly to customers.
Performance
In 2016, we grew net loans to customers 
by 12% to £930m (2015: £829m) driven 
by robust organic origination partially 
offset by increased redemptions. 
Approximately 75% of originations 
were introduced via specialist 
brokers, with whom we have strong 
relationships. A further c25% engaged 
with us directly, as we continue to see a 
growing volume of repeat business. 
The net interest margin increased 
slightly by 21bps to 5.2% which, 
combined with momentum in loan 
growth, has driven a 33% increase 
in operating income to £46.7m 
(2015: £35.0m). The reduction in 
operating expenses over the year 
reflects our focus on improving 
operating leverage as well as the 
greater allocation of operational 
resources to other Mortgages 
segments in 2016 to support growth.
Despite impairments in 2016 including 
greater prudence in collective 
provisioning, they remained low at 
£2.9m (2015: £2.0m), reflecting the 
low levels of arrears and continued 
relatively benign credit environment. 
The book remains backed by high 
quality tangible collateral with indexed 
loan to value, excluding PD, of 62% 
(2015: 63%). Our PD business had 
£229m of loans outstanding at the year 
end, with a loan to gross development 
of 58%. In total, the segmental profit 
for SME Commercial Mortgages 
increased by 44% to £40.7m in 2016 
(2015: £28.2m). 
Market and Strategy
The commercial mortgage market was 
worth c£43bn in originations during 
2016, of which Aldermore represented 
less than 1%, focused on multi-let 
commercial investment property 
loans and property development to 
experienced regional developers.  
Aldermore differentiates itself through 
its specialist underwriting capability 
and strong service proposition, 
enabling us to generate strong margins. 
Our commercial underwriters work 
closely with customers and our 
approved panel of c1k specialist brokers 
to understand the property use, the 
tenant covenant and the local market 
dynamics to underwrite effectively, 
and earn a premium. 
The segments in which we operate 
are expected to remain competitive. 
However, we will continue to deploy 
our specialist underwriting advantage 
in our core niches. Specialist brokers 
will continue to be our priority route 
through which we serve our customers 
but we will also seek to continue to 
expand our direct origination capability.

Building for 
the future
Jamie Barnett and Nicki Cadwallander, joint 
owners of Worcester Properties Ltd, have a 
long-standing relationship with Aldermore 
going back five years. Specialising in student 
properties, Jamie and Nicki were initially 
introduced to Aldermore through a broker.
From starting with one house, Worcester 
Properties Ltd is now the largest single 
provider of student accommodation in 
Worcester and is involved in larger new 
builds for students.
During 2016, Aldermore assisted with two 
Worcester Properties loans, both units 
planned for further development. One was 
the previously disused Butlers Gym in 
Worcester. The gym is now being converted 
into a 48 bed student house of multiple 
occupation property. Once completed, it will 
be refinanced and let out to students on an 
annual basis. 
Separately, a new development finance 
deal has been agreed for a 70-room facility 
to service Warwick University. The end 
value of the property is expected to be 
almost triple the purchase price once the 
development is completed.
We regard Aldermore as a partner or 
colleague rather than just a lender. 
We have a great relationship with 
them, and we always have Aldermore 
in mind when we approach new deals.”

25 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Buy-to-Let (BTL) provides a 
comprehensive proposition catering for 
both individual and corporate landlords, 
simple to complex properties, including 
HMOs, and from a single property 
investment to large portfolios.
Performance
We significantly outperformed the 
market in 2016, growing net loans 
by 38% to £3.3bn, driven by a 92% 
increase in organic origination to 
£1.3bn. This strong growth also reflects 
our operational agility, as we took 
advantage of the market spikes in the 
first quarter, ahead of the introduction 
of an increase in stamp duty, and in the 
fourth quarter when we successfully 
took share in an active market. 
Strong lending growth and a broadly 
stable net interest margin drove 
a 23% increase in net interest 
income to £90.4m (2015: £73.3m). 
Operating income was up 27% to 
£97.2m, with fee income benefitting 
from record application numbers, as 
we grew our customer base by 25% 
to c20k.
The £1.7m increase in administrative 
expenses is driven by an increased 
allocation of operational resources 
to support the strong loan growth 
delivered in the year.
A modest increase in the cost of risk 
to 12bps is in line with expectations 
and remains low. The increase is 
partly driven by increased prudence in 
collective provisioning as we extended 
emergence periods by three months to 
reflect increased economic uncertainty. 
The quality of the book remains robust, 
with average loan balances of just 
£170k across the portfolio and an 
indexed LTV of 63%. The segmental 
result demonstrated excellent 
progress, growing by 26% to £83.1m 
(2015: £66.0m).
Market and strategy 
The BTL market was worth c£41bn in 
2016, representing c14% of the overall 
mortgage market. Aldermore is a 
mainstream player in BTL and took a 
c3.2% market share of originations in 
the year but with an overall market 
share of c1% in this market, we have 
clear headroom for growth. 
Our proposition offers market-leading 
breadth of offering for all landlords 
but our clear differentiation is at the 
specialist end of the market, with 
professional landlords (more than three 
properties) who represent c60% of our 
portfolio. Our distribution strategy is 
primarily broker-led but with a growing 
proportion of customers, 20% in 2016, 
engaging with us directly. We have a 
diverse geographic footprint but a bias 
towards the strong rental markets in 
Greater London and the South East.
The fundamentals supporting 
demand in the BTL market remain 
strong. There remains a shortage of 
housing stock and new housebuilding 
continues to lag Government targets. 
Whilst regulatory changes to personal 
tax relief, underwriting and affordability 
testing are expected to reduce the 
overall rate of market growth, we 
expect to benefit from the increased 
professionalisation of demand and 
to continue outgrowing the market, 
building on our small market share.

and decided to approach us directly for a 
five-year fixed rate limited-edition deal.
“I approached Aldermore primarily as I found 
their product range interesting and very 
attractive when compared to the other 
rates available on the market at the time.”
With the uncertainty caused by the EU

five-year fixed product to give him just 
that. Our specialist team was able to take 
Mr Cheema’s application through to offer in

Dealing with Aldermore was very pleasant

27 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Residential Mortgages serves 
creditworthy first-time buyers, the 
self-employed and professionals, who 
often fall outside the automated and 
inflexible lending criteria of some of the 
mainstream providers.
Performance
The Residential Mortgages portfolio 
grew by 7% in 2016 to £1.5bn 
(2015: £1.4bn), driving net interest 
income up by 13%. This growth was 
driven by £466.0m of originations 
which were lower than in 2015 
(2015: £582m) due to a greater focus 
on buy-to-let in 2016. Originations in 
2016 were partly offset by redemptions 
increasing to £365.6m (2015: £171.8m) 
which was weighted to the second half 
of the year due to the maturity of the 
high yielding first cohort of Help to Buy 
mortgages written in mid-2014. 
The net interest margin reduced by 
c30bps to 3.4% (2015: 3.7%), driven 
by a number of factors, including the 
reduction in the base rate and the 
redemption of high-yielding first cohort 
of Help to Buy customers.
The reduction in operating expenses 
over the year reflects our focus on 
improving operating leverage as well as 
the allocation of operational resources 
between Mortgages segments to 
support loan growth, which is based 
on origination activity and net loan 
balances. Despite increased prudence 
in collective provisioning, impairments 
remained low at £1.9m (2015: £0.8m), 
reflecting the relatively low levels of 
arrears and continued benign credit 
environment. The overall segmental 
profit increased 12% to £45.1m 
(2015: £40.1m).
Market and strategy
The residential mortgage market was 
worth c£205bn in originations during 
2016, of which Aldermore represented 
just 0.2%, focused on specialist sub-
segments, including first time buyers, 
the self-employed and professionals. 
We are differentiated through our use 
of specialist underwriting capabilities 
which complement modern credit 
rating engines. Our system-driven 
approach automatically completes 
basic checks, creates a case file, and 
highlights areas for further review 
enabling our human underwriting 
team to make better informed credit 
decisions, with greater efficiency. 
The mortgages platform, operated 
across all three mortgage segments, 
underwent an upgrade during 2016, 
driven by requirements from the 
Mortgage Credit Directive but also 
providing an opportunity for us to 
enhance system functionality, including 
the development of a product switching 
portal, which will enable future growth 
in our target segments going forward.
Aldermore operates as a small 
player in specific niches and we are 
confident that we can continue organic 
origination-led growth within the large 
residential market. Specifically, the 
Mortgage Indemnity Guarantee (MIG) 
product that we introduced to follow-
on from the Government’s Help to Buy 
Mortgage Guarantee scheme, and a 
package of measures to enhance our 
proposition and service to the self-
employed market are expected to drive 
increased origination activity.

care. Somerset Forestry has posted strong 
profits over the past few years and Darren 
was looking to move from his flat into a 
three-bedroom terraced home with his wife 
and two children.
The mortgage on his flat was with a major 
high street lender, and as a long-time 
customer, he went to them first. However, 
during the application process Darren 
found that the high street bank didn’t fully 
understand his accounts or his business.
Focusing on growing his business, Darren 
had been paying himself only what he 
needed to get by and investing the rest 
in new machinery and equipment, some 
of which he had financed with Aldermore. 
He approached us about taking out a 
mortgage for his new home and our

With the high street banks, all they look

Performance
Net interest income includes the 
interest expense relating to the Tier 
2 Notes and part of the income or 
expense arising from derivatives held 
at fair value in hedging relationships, 
neither of which are recharged 
to segments. 
Net fees and other income 
predominantly includes the net 
expense or income from derivatives 
not currently recognised as being 
in hedging relationships and other 
financial instruments at fair value 
through profit or loss and gains 
on disposals of available for sale 
debt securities.
Central administrative expenses, 
increased by 11% to £81.8m (2015: £7 4.2m) 
driven by the recruitment of colleagues as 
we invested to further support growth and 
risk management. 
At the end of 2015, we held goodwill 
of £4.1m related to the acquisition of 
Absolute Invoice Finance (Holdings) 
Limited which was supported using 
a Fair Value less Cost of Disposal 
methodology. During 2016, as a result 
of the general fall in market values of 
financial services businesses following 
the EU referendum, management 
concluded the goodwill balance 
was fully impaired and a charge of 
£4.1m has been recognised in the 
income statement.
The segmental result was a charge of 
£92.3m (2015: charge of £83.4m).
Savings market and strategy
The market for savings in 2016 
continued to be dominated by a 
backdrop of low and falling interest 
rates from a lower base rate and 
reduced competition for deposit 
funding in response to Bank of England 
funding schemes. In particular, the 
SME savings market remains highly 
attractive given the opportunity for 
non-traditional providers to offer 
a demonstrably better customer 
proposition – both in terms of rate 
and experience.
We continue to focus on small 
businesses where insight and research 
demonstrates a clear customer 
demand and market opportunity. 
Inflationary pressures in the economy 
suggest that we may have reached 
the bottom of the interest rate cycle 
and base rate movements are more 
likely to be upwards. This, together with 
increases in the annual ISA allowance 
(to £20k) and FSCS deposit protection 
limit (to £85k), means the outlook for 
savings customers is positive.

with requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, published by 
the Financial Reporting Council in 
September 2014 (the “Code”), the 
Directors have performed a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity.
The principal risks are further described 
on page 33 and the current emerging 
risks are described on pages 34 and 35.
Risk management and 
internal controls
The Board monitors the Group’s risk 
management and internal control 
systems. A review of the effectiveness 
of the systems has been performed 
incorporating all material controls, 
including financial, operational and 
compliance controls.
The Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems are designed 
to identify, manage, monitor and report 
on risks to which the Group is exposed. 
It can therefore only provide reasonable 
but not absolute assurance against the 
risk of material misstatement or loss. 
Further details of the processes and 
procedures for managing and mitigating 
these risks are provided in the risk 
management section from page 106.
The effectiveness of the internal controls 
was regularly reviewed by the Board, Audit 
Committee and Risk Committee during 
the year . This involved receiving reports 
from management including reports from 
Finance, Risk, Compliance, Group Internal 
Audit and the business lines. The Audit 
Committee also receives reports on 
internal controls from the Group’s external 
auditor . Where recommendations 
are identified for improvements to 
controls these are monitored by Group 
Internal Audit who report the progress 
made in implementing them to the 
Audit Committee.
Based on the review performed during 
the year , and the monitoring and 
oversight activities performed, the Audit 
Committee, in conjunction with the Risk 
Committee, concluded that the Group’s 
risk management and internal control 
systems were effective. The Audit 
Committee recommended a statement to 
this effect to the Board.
Based on this assessment, the Board are 
satisfied with the effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk management and internal 
control systems.
Viability
In accordance with provision C.2.2 
of the Code, the Directors have 
assessed the prospects of the Group 
over a three-year time horizon to 
31 December 2019.
The Directors concluded that a three-
year time horizon is an appropriate 
length of time to use to perform the 
assessment, mainly because financial 
forecasts have a greater level of 
certainty over three years. The Board 
monitors a longer term strategic plan 
which extends over the three-year 
horizon. This longer term strategic plan 
provides less certainty of outcome, but 
provides a robust planning tool against 
which strategic decisions can be made.
In the assessment of the viability of the 
Group, the Directors considered each 
of the principal risks set out on page 
33 of the strategic report. In addition, 
the assessment has been performed 
with reference to the Group’s current 
position and strategy.
In making this assessment the 
Directors have considered a wide range 
of information relating to present and 
future conditions, including the current 
state of the balance sheet, future 
projections of profitability, cash flows 
and capital resources. The Directors 
have also considered the implications of 
the UK referendum on EU membership. 
The information considered includes a 
wide range of stress testing which is 
performed as part of both the ICAAP 
and ILAAP processes as further 
described in the Risk Management 
Section from page 106.
Based on the above assessment, the 
Directors have concluded that there is a 
reasonable expectation that the Group 
will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the period to 31 December 2019.
Risk management, internal 
control and viability reporting
31 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Our approach to risk
Effective risk management is a 
core component of the Group and is 
embedded throughout the organisation. 
The Board and senior management 
ensure that a strong risk culture is at 
the heart of everything we do, with a 
clearly defined risk appetite.
Risk Management 
Framework
The Risk Management Framework 
outlines the process by which we 
identify, manage, monitor and report 
risks to which the Group is exposed. 
The framework is supported by 
supplemental frameworks, policies, 
processes and procedures which 
ensure that the Group’s risks are 
managed appropriately and within 
the Board sanctioned risk appetite. 
More detail is provided on page 108.
Principal risks:
Principal risks are the primary risks 
that the business faces, which could 
impact the delivery of our strategy. 
Read more about those risks and how 
they are managed opposite and in detail 
on page 112.
Emerging risks:
Emerging risks are those risks that 
have been identified on the horizon, 
which may have an impact on our future 
performance, compromise our existing 
strategy or threaten our business 
model. These risks are discussed on 
pages 34–35.
Legal and Regulatory risks:
We operate within the context of the 
UK legal and regulatory environment 
(as well as European law adopted 
and supported by UK regulators). 
The Legal and Compliance functions 
ensure that we are aware of both 
current and upcoming legal or 
regulatory requirements. 
Franchise preservation
The protection of our reputation and franchise 
is paramount. Everything we do is guided by 
the principle of putting the customer at the 
centre of what we do. It informs our business 
strategy, the way in which we do business, and 
the manner in which we treat our customers and 
other stakeholders.
Strong risk governance:
Risk is managed using the three lines of defence 
principle – separating risk origination from risk 
oversight and risk assurance. Governance is 
provided through a formal committee process, 
including the Board Risk and Audit Committees. 
Independent risk oversight and challenge
Risk is the risk oversight and challenge function, 
independent of the businesses and functions, with 
a reporting line to the Board Risk Committee. It is 
the basis of the second line of defence. 
Defined risk appetite
A clearly defined Risk Appetite Framework is in 
place which allows the setting of detailed risk 
appetite and reporting metrics for principal risks. 
Risk management and control
Risks are identified, managed, monitored and 
reported against pre-determined risk appetite 
where appropriate. All are subject to governance 
and controls. Responsibility for the identification, 
assessment, measurement, monitoring and 
management of the risks rests with the first line of 
defence, being the business units and functions.
Risk culture
The Board ensures that the Group actively 
embraces a strong risk culture, where all staff are 
accountable for the risks they take. The Board 
leads in setting the risk appetite and ensuring 
that the Risk Management Framework is fully 
embedded with a strong focus on the adherence 
to risk appetite in all metrics. Staff performance 
management and reward practices all have key 
risk inputs, and a focus on risk management in 
their design. The Group aims for employees to be 
risk aware, and to strike the right balance between 
delivering on objectives, individual accountability, 
and maintaining a safe and secure business 
adhering to risk appetite

Risk overview
and culture Principal risk Commentary Mitigation
Credit Risk
The risk that customers 
are unable to make their 
loan repayments.
• Focus lending where we have specific expertise
• Limit concentration of lending by size, geography 
and sector
• Obtain appropriate level of security cover and perform 
affordability testing at origination
• Embed clear lending policies in each business area
• Regularly review performance against risk appetite 
• Stress test the portfolio to test resilience
Group cost of risk remains low 
at 23bps (2015: 19bps) reflecting 
the maturation of the book and a 
move to less benign conditions.
The heightened uncertainty 
for the UK economy following 
the referendum vote, and the 
implementation of the result, 
has increased the possibility of 
higher future credit losses.
Capital and Liquidity Risk
The risk that we fail to hold 
sufficient or appropriate 
reserves to support growth, 
meet regulatory requirements, 
or repay obligations as they 
fall due.
• Monthly monitoring of capital adequacy against 
targets and forecasts
• Maintenance of a liquidity buffer based on 
stressed requirements
• Daily monitoring of liquidity buffer
• Stress testing and sensitivity analysis of both capital 
and liquidity
• Maintenance and annual review of the Contingency 
Funding Plan
• Ongoing review, analysis and impact assessment of 
regulatory changes
The Group’s capital remains 
stable and well above regulatory 
minimum requirements. 
We successfully raised 
additional £60m Tier 2 capital 
in October 2016.
The Group’s liquidity position 
remains stable.
Market Risk
The risk that market 
movements adversely impact 
the Group.
• We do not seek to take or expose the Group to market 
risk and we do not carry out proprietary trading
• We match interest rate structures of assets and 
liabilities to create a natural hedge where possible
• Unmatched interest rate exposures are hedged with 
derivative ‘Swap’ contracts 
The Group’s approach remains 
prudent and underlying risks 
remain unchanged.
Operational Risk
The risk of loss due to failure in 
processes, systems or human 
error, including outsourcing.
• Embed and ensure all staff understand and follow the 
Operational Risk Management Framework
• Analysis of Risk Event Reporting and follow-up actions
• Monitoring of the operational risk profile, and risk 
event reporting
• Continuing to invest in information security and cyber 
controls following our Cyber strategy
• Implementation of a Third Party Supplier Framework
The Group continues to invest 
in its IT infrastructure including 
Cyber controls and resilience.
Compliance, Conduct and 
Financial Crime Risk
The risk of sanctions or 
financial loss as a result 
of a failure to comply with 
applicable laws, including anti-
money laundering and the risk 
of causing unfair outcomes or 
detriment to customers.
• The Group provides simple and transparent products 
and operates solely in the UK market.
• Provide and monitor against clear policy frameworks, 
including Conduct Risk and Product Governance
• Continued investment in staff training and awareness
• Horizon scanning and impact assessment of potential 
regulatory change
Whilst the financial services 
sector remains subject to 
increasing regulation and 
scrutiny we believe our risks 
remain unchanged from the 
prior year.
Reputational Risk
Failure to meet the 
expectations and standards 
of our customers, 
investors, regulators or 
other counterparties.
• All governance committees have reputational risk 
considerations as a key part of their remit
• Group Corporate Affairs monitors reputational risk, 
under the executive direction of the Group CEO
• All employees are made aware of their responsibilities 
under the Bank’s Reputational Risk Policy
• Maintenance of open and transparent relationships 
with regulators and other key stakeholders
We believe the risks remain 
unchanged from the prior year.

Basel Committee on

December 2015 Second 
consultation on Revisions 
to the Standardised 
Approach for Credit 
Risk proposals 
In December 2015 the BCBS issued a second consultative document, (Revisions to the Standardised 
Approach for Credit Risk) containing, amongst others, proposals to increase the capital treatment 
of buy-to-let and commercial real estate lending. If these proposals were implemented as outlined, 
the capital requirements for these market segments would increase significantly and require the 
execution of management actions to mitigate their impact.
We conducted an impact assessment of the proposed changes, 
followed by scenario analysis including feasible management actions. 
The Bank also undertook a feasibility study on transitioning from 
Standardised to an Internal Ratings Based (IRB) approach to capital. 
This included a gap analysis against current regulatory requirements 
and has informed our thinking into possible responses, including 
the possibility of applying for regulatory approval to operate in an 
IRB environment.
The IFRS9 work on credit models (see Emerging Risks 
IFRS9) takes us closer to the sophistication required for 
an IRB approach to capital which may help to mitigate the 
risk of future changes in capital requirements. We will 
continue to monitor the cost and benefits associated to 
moving to IRB, as the regulatory changes and timeframes 
for implementation become clear.
 
IFRS 9 New reporting requirements under IFRS 9 introduce forward looking credit loss models which will lead 
to changes in the timing of impairment recognition. The requirement, which comes in to effect from 
1 January 2018, requires the development of new risk models. The risk is that the Group is unable to 
deliver these before new regulation takes effect.
We assessed the impact of IFRS 9 and have initiated a project plan 
to ensure compliance with the new standard ahead of its proposed 
implementation date of 1 January 2018.
We are on track with enhancements to our credit 
risk models and expect to be IFRS9 compliant ahead 
of January 2018 when the new accounting standard 
is introduced.

Further review of PRA’s expectations in terms of portfolio 
landlords and use of personal income in affordability 
calculation, with expectation that all changes to 
approach considered necessary will be introduced by the 
30 September 2017 deadline
 
Economic and political environment 
The UK’s decision to leave 
the European Union
Heightened economic and political risks following the UK’s decision to leave the European Union. As a 
UK focused Group, we are sheltered from the more direct impacts of the Referendum, such as access 
to European markets but we are exposed to the wider economic impacts. To date we have seen no 
direct impact on either the lending or deposit sides of our business.
The Group incorporated these risks in stress testing conducted 
during 2016. 
The Group will continue to monitor the situation and will 
decide on an appropriate response, based on internal 
scenario planning, as the situation develops. 
 
International economic 
and political environment
The geopolitical environment presents risks to global markets, including the impact of a new 
administration in the USA, deflationary concerns in the EU and continued political risks in Russia and 
the Middle East.
We have monitored these risks, and the UK economy has remained 
robust in the face of these domestic and global headwinds. As a UK-
focused business we have not felt any adverse consequences across 
our trading franchise.
The medium-term outlook is unclear and there remains 
a possibility that material international events could 
adversely affect the UK, in addition to any EU exit impacts. 
These could act as a drag on the UK economy and affect 
the sectors to which we lend. We aim to manage these 
risks by maintaining a well-diversified product base, and 
remaining firmly focused on the UK.
Exposure to real estate We have a substantial lending exposure to the residential, buy-to-let, and commercial property 
sectors. Any property value falls, or increase in unemployment may lead to a rising number of defaults.
The Group continued to monitor and manage the performance of our 
real estate backed lending, and identified no significant change in 
performance in 2016. 
We also continued to enforce our underwriting criteria, which 
includes affordability testing at the point of origination.
The risks are expected to remain unchanged in 2017.
Interest rate environment The low interest rate environment, introduced to stimulate growth following the financial crisis, 
has persisted for longer than first expected. If interest rates are increased, or growth slows, 
unemployment may rise and loan servicing costs may increase, which could cause an increase in 
credit losses.
We conducted specific stress testing on our loan portfolio and 
maintained strict underwriting criteria, which includes stressing 
affordability rates at interest rates above those being paid today.
We will continue to monitor the external environment and 
respond to any interest rate rises as appropriate.
Competitive environment 
New entrants and 
increased competition
The competitive landscape contains risks from new entrants, increased competition from incumbent 
lenders and disruptive products/software solutions potentially affecting both lending and deposit 
taking activities. The effect of this could result in lower volume, higher customer attrition and/or lower 
net interest margins.
The risk of competition has been incorporated in our forward planning 
process and the external market is monitored on a consistent basis.
We will continue to monitor the external environment and 
adapt accordingly.
Technology risk 
Cyber-crime Cyber-crime is a significant threat in our increasingly interconnected world and exposes all businesses 
and in particular financial services companies to financial as well as reputational damage. 
Cyber threats continue to evolve as demonstrated by high-profile cases. The increased size of the 
Group, and growing customer base, increases the profile of the Group to would-be cyber attackers.
During 2015, and continuing into 2016, we strengthened our defences 
against cyber-crime.
We have a cyber risk response plan, which involves working with our 
technology partners, and ensures that there is a practical response 
and appropriate escalation. 
This remains a key risk area and the Group will continue to 
invest in ongoing security improvements.
System failure/
outsourcing
The Group has a number of major outsource partners and critical supplier relationships who are key 
elements of the overall supply chain. The failure of one of these key partners could significantly impact 
the Group’s operations and reputation.
The Group has controls in place in relation to sourcing and onboarding 
suppliers. In 2016, work was begun to further enhance the supplier 
management framework.
Continued focus during 2017 as the updated framework is 
implemented across the supplier estate.

Corporate responsibility Effective two-way communication is vital in 
engaging our people and we place a great deal 
of emphasis on listening to employees. 
At our 2016 Employee Summit we launched 
‘The Big Conversation’, our new approach 
to engaging with our people which saw us 
gather their views on how we can enable an 
improved ongoing connection to Aldermore 
and better deliver on our strategic objectives. 
After the summit we invited over 300 
employees to sessions across our offices 
to provide their ideas and contributions. 
These sessions were complemented by a 
business-wide pulse survey, giving every 
employee a chance to contribute. 
The Big Conversation has been our most in-
depth discussion with employees ever, giving 
us a deeper understanding of our culture. 
What we did during the year and how our approach supported our business:
• We signed up to HM Treasury’s Women in Finance Charter, which aims to increase female 
representation in senior management roles in the financial sector, committing to increasing 
the proportion of female senior managers at Aldermore to 30% by 2020 and to maintaining 
our gender split at around 50/50. 
• To support our commitment to greater female representation, we launched the Women@
Aldermore network which brings in senior women from outside the business to provide 
advice and insight to our female employees about how to progress their careers.
• In October, we held our 2016 Employee Summit allowing all of our people to come together 
in one place to network, hear from our Executive team and discuss the future of the 
Bank. Following the event, 91% of employees said that they were proud to be part of the

broker partners so we recognise the 
need to support the development of the 
next generation. 2016 marked the third 
year of our asset finance broker training 
programme, which sees us running 
workshops for emerging talent at our asset 
finance broker partners.
Sessions are delivered at Aldermore offices 
by independent trainers with in-depth 
industry knowledge. In 2016, modules 
included principles of asset finance, 
regulation and sales skills.
During 2016, we held four separate 
courses attended by over 120 brokers. 
Since launching the programme, around 280 
young brokers have benefitted from the 
workshops which have equipped them with 
the expertise they need to be successful in 
their chosen field.

Our communities and environment
What we did during the year and how our approach supported our business:
• In November 2016, Aldermore joined the Banking Standards Board, an independently led 
body that promotes high standards of behaviour and competence across the UK banking 
industry. As a member, we are playing our part in ensuring that the industry is trusted and 
viewed as having a positive impact on the communities in which we operate.
• A significant part of our fundraising efforts go towards our charity of the year, which is 
chosen through a Bank-wide employee ballot. In 2016, our colleagues chose the Batten 
Disease Family Association (BDFA) as our charity of the year. Our charity of the year for 
2017 is Sands, the stillbirth and neonatal death charity.
• We piloted a volunteering programme with Employee Volunteering, the non-profit 
organisation. This saw our employees spending over 525 hours helping charities and other 
non-profit organisations local to our offices.
Leading the industry Giving back Reducing our impact
The SMEs, landlords, homeowners and savers that we support, in turn support the communities in which they live and work. 
We understand that we have a responsibility to give back to these communities.
1.  We play our part as a responsible 
member of the banking community
• Actively involved with industry bodies 
including the BBA, FLA, ABFA, CML 
and IMLA
• Became a member of the Banking 
Standards Board
2.  We give back to the communities 
where we operate
• Raised £26,739 for the Batten Disease 
Family Association (BDFA), our charity 
of the year
• Our people spent 525 hours 
volunteering for local charities and 
other non-profit organisations
3.  We are committed to reducing our 
environmental impact
• Our total greenhouse gas emissions 
during 2016 were 525tCO 2e 
• Our total greenhouse gas emissions per 
employee were 0.59tCO 2e
Case study
Supporting broker  
education
Aldermore has come a long way. We have built a bank from scratch and delivered impressive growth. However , the journey 
towards truly fulfilling our responsibilities to our customers, people and wider stakeholders has only just begun. 
While we are judged on our ability to meet our financial objectives, the way in which we achieve these is equally important. 
We are heading in the right direction. We are involving our customers and employees in every step of the journey and 
building the foundations so that we can continue our strong progress over the coming years.

UK Corporate Governance Code 2014 (“the Code”) – statement of compliance
The Board is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance and confirms that, during the year under review, 
the Group has complied with the requirements of the Code, which sets out principles relating to the good governance of 
companies. Following the resignation of Glyn Jones as Chairman with effect from 6 February 2017, and the subsequent 
appointment of Danuta Gray as Interim Chairman, Danuta Gray is currently not discharging her role as Senior Independent 
Director. These responsibilities will be resumed on appointment of a new Chairman. 
The Code is available at www.frc.org.uk
This corporate governance report describes how the Board has applied the principles of the Code and provides a clear and 
comprehensive description of the Group’s governance arrangements. 
Danuta Gray,
Interim Chairman
40 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Corporate governance
Chairman’s introduction Dear Shareholder
As your Interim Chairman, I am 
delighted to introduce our corporate 
governance report for the year ended 
31 December 2016.
Firstly, as I highlighted in my statement 
on page 7, on behalf of the Board I 
would like to offer our sincere thanks 
to Glyn Jones who decided to step 
down from the Board on 6 February 
2017 to enable him to focus on his 
new role as Chairman of Old Mutual 
Wealth. Since joining the Group in 
March 2014, Glyn chaired the Board 
through a significant period of growth 
and change for the Company as it 
successfully completed its IPO in 
March 2015. Prior to the Company’s 
listing, Glyn played a pivotal role in 
setting the foundations for our current 
governance framework, which has 
provided a robust environment for 
the Group to deliver on its strategic 
and financial objectives within its 
risk appetite. He has left a strong, 
experienced and dedicated Board of 
Directors to lead the Group through 
the next stage of its development, 
and we remain committed to building 
on these foundations. An external 
agency has been appointed to help 
with the process of selecting Glyn’s 
successor which is being managed 
through the Corporate Governance 
and Nomination Committee in line 
with our agreed Chairman Succession 
Framework. We are making good 
progress with the search and look 
forward to announcing a replacement in 
due course. Further information about 
the search process is set out in the 
Corporate Governance and Nomination 
Committee Report on page 60.
In terms of other Board changes, we 
welcomed Chris Patrick as a Non-
Executive Director in November 2016 
when he replaced Neil Cochrane as 
the representative of our Principal 
Shareholders. Neil stepped down as a 
Director in October 2016 subsequent 
to him resigning from AnaCap. 
Peter Cartwright also resigned in April 
2016 as a shareholder-representative 
Director due to time commitments. 
We would like to extend our gratitude 
to both of them for their significant 
contribution during their respective 
tenures. The Principal Shareholders 
retain the right to a second seat on 
the Board but currently have one 
representative only.
Following the IPO, 2016 has been a 
year of consolidation and evolution 
as we have strived to build on the 
strong governance framework that 
we established in preparation for our 
listing. The following pages describe 
how we comply with the main principles 
of the Code, how the Board operates, 
and the key areas of focus for both the 
Board and its Committees during the 
year. Whilst it is difficult to narrow down 
our activities across the year to a few 
highlights, the strengthening of our Risk 
Management Framework overseen by 
the Risk Committee; the broadening of 
the financial performance measures 
within the balanced scorecard for 
the annual bonus scheme, such that 
they are more aligned to our KPIs; and 
the comprehensive tender process 
for the external auditor led by the 
Audit Committee, are all examples of 
areas where our Committees have 
supported the Board in developing our 
governance arrangements.
The Board recognises that one of 
the keys to the Group’s long-term 
success is the development of a healthy 
corporate culture. As we continue to 
execute on our strategy, the Group’s 
size and complexity will continue to 
increase, and the Board is cognisant 
that the Group’s culture has to evolve 
alongside this. Culture starts at the 
top, and the Board and the Executive 
Committee together have to drive the 
values and behaviours that support our 
brand. During the year, the Executive 
Committee initiated a new programme 
of ‘Big Conversation’ discussions with 
our employees regarding the kind of 
company they want Aldermore to be. 
A dashboard of cultural metrics has 
also been developed, and the Board will 
continue to receive regular updates on 
these initiatives as they progress.
The Board strongly supports the 
principle of diversity, of which gender 
is one important aspect, and we were 
therefore delighted to support the 
Group signing up to the Women in 
Finance Charter to promote wider 
female representation in senior 
management roles in finance. The Board 
has committed to a target of 30% for 
our female senior managers by 2020, 
and to maintaining our gender split at 
around 50/50. In respect of possible 
targets at Board level, we have not 
established a measurable target for 
gender representation but remain 
committed to increasing all aspects 
of diversity. As set out in our Board 
Diversity Policy, Director appointments 
are subject to a formal, rigorous and 
transparent procedure and are made on 
merit against a defined job specification 
and criteria. We will continue to monitor 
whether it is appropriate to set a 
Board target in the future taking into 
account developments arising from 
the Hampton – Alexander Review and 
seeking the views of the new Chairman 
when appointed.

Corporate governance
Executive Committee Board and 
Committee structure
The Board has delegated a number 
of its responsibilities to Board 
Committees, which utilise the expertise 
and experience of their members to 
examine subjects in detail and make 
recommendations to the Board where 
required. This delegation allows the 
Board to focus more of its time on 
strategic and other broader matters. 
The Chairs of the Board Committees 
provide the Board with a verbal update 
on matters discussed at each meeting, 
and Board Committee minutes are 
made available to the whole Board 
through a secure online system.
In addition to the Board Committees 
noted on the diagram below, the 
Board has established two further 
standing committees:
• The General Purpose Committee, 
comprising the two Executive 
Directors, for the purpose of 
approving routine business matters 
such as powers of attorney, changes 
to bank mandates and the execution 
of agreements which have already 
been approved in principle by 
the Board.
• The Disclosure Committee, 
comprising the two Executive 
Directors and the General Counsel, 
for the purpose of maintaining 
procedures, systems and 
controls for the identification and 
disclosure of market and price 
sensitive information.
All Board Committees have written 
terms of reference (available on the 
Company's investor website) which set 
out their authority, and the minutes of 
all meetings of these Committees are 
made available to the Board.
Responsibility for the day-to-day 
management of the Group is delegated 
to the CEO, who has established a 
structure of two executive commit-
tees, supported by a number of 
sub-committees, which oversee the 
execution of the strategy agreed by the 
Board, and performance and risk issues. 
The executive committees and their 
sub-committees each have their own 
terms of reference.

and related risk appetite, it also takes 
account of its obligations to other 
stakeholders including customers, 
employees, suppliers and the 
community in which it operates, as well 
as the regulatory obligations of the 
Bank, its principal banking subsidiary.
The Chairman leads the Board in its 
role to provide executive management 
with entrepreneurial direction, whilst 
the day-to-day management of the 
Group and operational matters are 
delegated to the CEO. The separation 
of duties between the Chairman and 
CEO is formally documented. The CEO 
is supported by his senior management 
team (the “Executive Committee”). 
Further details about the Executive 
Committee can be found on page 44, 
whilst further information about the 
role and responsibilities of each Board 
member can be found on the next page.
The Board’s principal duties are 
set out in a formal schedule of 
matters reserved for its decision, as 
summarised on page 48. This schedule 
is reviewed annually and is available at 
www.investors.aldermore.co.uk 
The Group Corporate Governance 
Framework, which is reviewed annually 
by the Board, sets out in detail the way 
the Group is governed.

47 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Board meetings
The Board held nine scheduled Board 
meetings, one strategy workshop and 
four additional ad hoc Board meetings 
in 2016. Two of the ad hoc meetings 
were called in order to analyse the 
Q3 forecast in greater detail in light 
of the uncertain economic outlook 
following the UK vote to leave the 
European Union, whilst other matters 
discussed at the ad hoc meetings 
included a substantial new contract and 
the appointment of the new external 
auditor following a tender process.
Attendance at scheduled Board and 
Committee meetings is set out below. 
There are occasions when a Director 
may be unable to participate in a 
meeting and, if this is the case, they are 
encouraged to provide comments to 
the Chairman on key items of business 
in advance of the relevant meeting, so 
that their views can be shared at the 
meeting and their opinions taken into 
account during discussions. 
In addition to the meeting programme, 
Directors meet informally during the 
year enabling them to discuss sensitive 
and key matters in more depth.
Both the Board and its Committees 
have a rolling annual programme which 
aligns to the schedule of matters 
reserved for the Board and the terms 
of reference of each Committee. 
The agendas and time allocation for 
Board meetings are put together by 
the Chairman, assisted by the CEO 
and Company Secretary, based on the 
annual programme, actions arising 
from previous meetings and key 
business priorities. A similar process 
is followed with the Chair of each 
Board Committee. The Board and 
Committee agendas include a closed 
session at the end of meetings from 
time to time to enable the Chairman/
Committee Chair to meet privately with 
the Non-Executive Directors without 
management present.
The Board monitors the performance 
of the Group against the approved 
strategy and annual business plan, and 
within the agreed risk appetite, through 
the following regular reports: 
• An update from the CEO 
on market, customer and 
strategic developments.
• A business performance report which 
gives a holistic view of the Group’s 
performance, and includes:
 –  a report from the CFO on 
the financial results of the 
Group as a whole, as well as an 
investor relations update and 
review of various prudential 
regulatory matters;
 –  a briefing from the Chief Risk 
Officer on key emerging 
risks, risk appetite and 
regulatory developments;
 –  an update from the Chief 
Operating Officer on IT, operational 
and transformation matters, and 
strategic change projects; and
 –  reports from the Managing 
Directors of the businesses on the 
business performance and related 
key issues, and an overview of the 
competitive landscape.

Corporate governance
The Board – roles and processes
continued Strategy sessions 
The Board is responsible for 
establishing the Group’s strategy 
and plays a key role in challenging 
management in developing the 
strategic plan and objectives.
Two Board strategy workshops are 
generally held every year where the 
CEO, with members of his Executive 
Committee, present their views of the 
market and proposed plans, including 
new initiatives, to be probed and tested 
by the Non-Executive Directors. 
The range of experience and expertise 
that the Non-Executive Directors 
are able to bring to the debate, along 
with their independent oversight, is 
key to building a sustainable strategy. 
The focus of discussions is not only 
on how the strategy should evolve, 
but also on ensuring that the Group 
has the appropriate resources, skills 
and competencies to deliver the 
chosen strategy. 
However, given the rapidly changing 
market and regulatory environment in 
which the Group operates, the strategy 
has to be subject to continuous 
review and, as such, the executive 
management provides the Board 
with regular updates on key strategic 
initiatives as they progress.

The Corporate Governance and 
Nomination Committee (the  
“Nomination Committee”) is responsible 
for making recommendations to the 
Board regarding the appointment of 
new Directors. 
One new appointment was made 
to the Board in 2016 (Chris Patrick), 
whilst the Nomination Committee also 
oversaw changes to the composition 
of the Board Committees which arose 
following the resignations of Peter 
Cartwright and Neil Cochrane. Chris, 
Peter and Neil were all appointed to 
the Board in accordance with the 
Relationship Agreement between the 
Group and its Principal Shareholders 
(further information can be found 
on page 59). Under the Relationship 
Agreement, the Principal Shareholders 
are entitled to appoint up to two 
Board Directors and a member 
of each of the Risk Committee 
and the Nomination Committee. 
Consequently, when Peter stepped 
down from the Board in April 2016, the 
Nomination Committee considered 
and recommended to the Board that 
Neil replace Peter as a member of 
these Committees in line with the 
wishes of the Principal Shareholders. 
Following Neil’s resignation from the 
Board in October 2016, the Principal 
Shareholders informed the Company 
of their intention to appoint Chris 
as their sole representative on 
the Board and as a member of the 
Risk and Nomination Committees. 
The Nomination Committee considered 
the proposed appointments and agreed 
to recommend them to the Board, 
subject to the completion of fitness and 
propriety tests. As part of this process, 
Chris met with each of the Committee 
Chairs and the Senior Independent 
Director to assess his competence and 
capability, whilst various references 
were sought and checks completed 
in order to verify his educational, 
employment, criminal and credit history. 
Regulatory approval was not required 
for Chris’ appointment.
Induction of Directors
All Directors receive a comprehensive 
induction on appointment to 
enable their effective contribution 
to the Board as early as possible. 
Induction programmes are tailored 
to the needs of the new Director. 
The Chairman discusses requirements 
with the new Director, which are 
facilitated by the Company Secretary. 
The programme will typically include 
one-to-one meetings with business 
and functional heads; site visits; and 
access through the Board portal to 
past Board packs and an induction pack 
containing relevant Group policies and 
procedures. Details of Chris Patrick’s

Corporate governance
The Board – roles and processes
continued induction programme, which will be 
implemented during 2017, are set out at 
the bottom of page 50. 
Diversity 
The Board embraces the benefits 
of diversity in the boardroom and 
believes that it generates effective 
challenge and decision-making. 
It strives for diversity in the broadest 
sense – female representation is just 
one of the factors that is taken into 
account and all Board appointments 
are made on merit against a defined 
job specification. The Company does 
not therefore consider it appropriate 
to set a measurable target for 
gender representation on its Board. 
Female membership of the Board 
currently stands at 22%. 
The Board adopted a Board Diversity 
Policy in November 2015, and the 
Nomination Committee has since 
reconfirmed that no amendments 
to this Policy are required at the 
current time. However, the Policy 
will be revisited following the 
appointment of a new Chairman and 
taking into account developments 
arising from the Hampton-Alexander 
Review. The Policy is available at 
www.investors.aldermore.co.uk
Skills, knowledge and 
experience 
As previously mentioned, the Board 
values all aspects of diversity and 
recognises the benefit of maintaining 
a balance of skills, experience 
and knowledge. During 2015, the 
Nomination Committee oversaw an 
exercise to evaluate the skills and 
experience on the Board. This was 
based on a self-assessment completed 
by each Director. The matrix which 
was compiled as a result has been kept 
under review in 2016. It was updated to 
reflect the changes to the composition 
of the Board during the year and, as a 
result, the Nomination Committee has 
been able to satisfy itself that the mix 
of skills and experience on the Board is 
appropriate to challenge management 
and support the Group’s strategy. 
At the time of the 2015 review, some 
areas were identified where, in the 
medium term, the balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience could be 
strengthened. These remain relevant 
and will be taken into consideration 
in any future search for new Non-
Executive Directors.

100% Election and re-election 
The Code requires that all Directors 
retire and offer themselves for 
election at the first AGM following their 
appointment, and for re-election on an 
annual basis thereafter. 
Ahead of the re-election of the 
Non-Executive Directors being 
recommended to shareholders, the 
Nomination Committee assesses the 
performance, time commitments and 
independence of each Non-Executive 
Director and makes a recommendation 
to the Board in this regard. In addition, 
the outcome of the appraisals of the 
Executive Directors (as set out on page 
56) is considered. These assessments 
took place over January and February 
2017 and, based on these factors 
(described further in the paragraphs 
that follow), as well as the balance 
of skills, knowledge and experience 
on the Board as a whole, the Board 
approved the recommendation that 
each Director should be proposed 
for election/re-election at the 2017 
AGM. Further information about the 
Directors, including their experience, 
is set out on pages 42 and 43.
The Principal Shareholders are classed 
as a “controlling shareholder” of the 
Company under the Listing Rules. 
As a result, the Independent Non-
Executive Directors of the Company 
must be elected or re-elected by both 
a majority of the votes cast by all of the 
Company’s shareholders and a majority 
of the votes cast by the Company’s 
independent shareholders (being all 
of the Company’s shareholders other 
than the controlling shareholder). The 
outcome of both of these votes will be 
announced following the 2017 AGM. 
Director performance 
evaluations
Details of the Director performance 
evaluation process are set out on page 
56. The outcome of the evaluations 
concluded that each Director continues 
to be effective and to demonstrate 
commitment to their role.
Time commitment and 
independence
The Nomination Committee reviewed 
the time commitment to the Company 
demonstrated by each of the Non-
Executive Directors and was satisfied 
that this was both in line with the 
requirement set out in their letters 
of appointment, and sufficient to 
discharge their duties. The external 
directorships and other commitments 
of the Non-Executive Directors were 
also taken into account in making 
this assessment. 
Independence of the Non-Executive 
Directors is assessed by the Nomination 
Committee on an annual basis against 
the criteria set out in the Code, which 
require directors to be independent in 
character and judgement, and free from 
any relationships or circumstances 
which could affect that judgement. 
Factors taken into account in this 
assessment include length of tenure 
and any potential conflicts recorded in 
the Company’s Register of Directors’ 
Conflicts. The Nomination Committee 
was satisfied that there had not been 
any changes in circumstance which 
would impact on the previous 
assessment that all Non-Executive 
Directors, with the exception of the 
Director who represents the Principal 
Shareholders, were deemed to 
be independent.
Separately, on the basis that Danuta 
Gray will be acting as Chairman in an 
interim capacity for a limited period 
only, the Board continue to regard 
her as independent.
Shareholder-representative 
Director
Chris Patrick has been appointed to 
the Board to represent the interests of 
the Principal Shareholders, and is not 
therefore considered to be independent 
under the Code. Notwithstanding that 
he is not independent, the Nomination 
Committee confirmed that it was 
satisfied that he should be recommended 
for re-election at the 2017 AGM.
Conflicts of interest
The Board has procedures in place to 
deal with potential conflicts of interest, 
which are governed by both company 
law and the Company’s Articles of 
Association. All Directors are required 
to declare any interests that could 
give rise to a conflict of interest with 
the Group, either on appointment or 
when they arise. Under the Company’s 
Articles, the Board is permitted to 
authorise such conflicts and to impose 
any conditions on that authorisation 
that it considers to be necessary, for 
example to leave Board meetings 
when certain matters are discussed. 
All authorisations are recorded in the 
Board minutes, and entered into the 
Register of Directors’ Conflicts.
The Nomination Committee has 
provided guidance to the Board on the 
declaration of interests which cannot 
reasonably be regarded as likely to give 
rise to a conflict of interest. In addition, 
the Nomination Committee undertakes 
an annual review of the Register of 
Directors’ Conflicts to ensure that 
there have not been any changes in 
circumstances that would require 
the Board to revisit any previous 
authorisation that it has granted, or its 
view of the Directors’ independence.
52 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Corporate governance
The Board – roles and processes
continued During the year, the Nomination 
Committee considered the prospective 
appointment of Robert Sharpe as 
Chairman of Bank of Ireland (UK) 
PLC. The proposal was considered 
from the perspective of any potential 
business conflict of interest; time 
commitment pressures which would 
prevent Robert from discharging 
his role with the Company; and the 
cross-directorship which would arise 
given that Peter Shaw was also a 
Director of Bank of Ireland (UK) PLC. 
Having taken into account a number 
of factors, including the character 
and judgement of both individuals, it 
was agreed to approve any potential 
conflict of interest associated with the 
proposed appointment.
Succession planning 
Non-Executive Directors
The Nomination Committee reviewed 
succession planning for the Non- 
Executive Directors during the year. 
Whilst acknowledging that succession 
planning was key to the sustainability 
of the Board, the Nomination 
Committee was also cognisant that 
the majority of the Non-Executive 
Directors had been appointed in 2014 
when a Board was formed which would 
be suitable to lead the Company in a 
public environment. The tenure of these 
Directors was therefore less than three 
years. During the year, tenure was 
discussed with the longest-serving 
Non-Executive Director (less than four 
years on the Board), who had confirmed 
that he had no specific retirement date 
in mind. In light of these relatively short 
tenures, the Nomination Committee 
confirmed that the previously 
agreed principles on which future 
succession planning should be based 
remained appropriate.
Chairman
To ensure that an effective Chairman 
was in place at all times to lead the 
Board, the Nomination Committee 
agreed a Chairman Succession 
Framework in 2015. The Framework 
outlined the approach that would be 
taken when the time came to search for 
a new Chairman, and confirmed that the 
Senior Independent Director would lead 
the process. As a result, following the 
resignation of Glyn Jones as Chairman 
during the year, the Nomination 
Committee was able to act quickly 
to put the Framework into action. 
Good progress has been made with the 
search, and a fuller update is provided 
in the Chair’s introductory letter to 
the Nomination Committee Report on 
page 60.
Executive positions
Succession planning for the Executive 
Directors was considered by the 
Nomination Committee during the year, 
whilst the Executive Committee was 
strengthened through the appointment 
of three new members. 
The Executive Committee has 
continued to build on work undertaken 
in 2015 to develop a pipeline of potential 
successors to executive positions 
below Board level. This is an iterative 
process which aims to assess (and 
regularly re-assess) the current 
capabilities and future potential of both 
the direct reports of the Executive 
Committee and their teams. This 
process is key to both the identification 
of employees who would benefit from 
or require development plans to further 
build on their potential, and as a way of 
highlighting gaps where consideration 
should be given to recruiting potential 
successors. As a result, efforts are 
being focused on increasing the number 
of employees who are moved into roles 
that will enable them to broaden their 
skills and experience, with a view to 
stepping up in to a more senior role in 
due course. The introduction of the 
Senior Managers and Certification 
Regime during 2016 has also provided 
additional impetus to the succession 
planning process as individual 
development plans are now required 
under the regulations.
53 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Board support
All Directors have access to the 
advice and services of the Company 
Secretary, who ensures that Board 
procedures are complied with. 
In addition, Directors have access to 
independent and professional advice at 
the Company’s expense. 
Information flow to the 
Board
The Board’s ability to discharge its 
duties is dependent on the quality of the 
information that it receives to support 
decision-making. Information should 
be accurate and clear, and provided on a 
timely basis.
Board papers
The Company Secretary takes 
responsibility for ensuring that the 
Board receives high-quality information 
and, to the extent possible, acts as a 
gateway to challenge any Board papers 
which require additional clarity. All ad 
hoc Board papers include an executive 
summary in a standard format which 
ensures that key information can be 
easily identified by the Directors, and 
that important points are sign-posted.
The format of the regular business 
performance report to the Board is 
reviewed regularly in order to ensure 
that it continues to provide the Board 
with a holistic view of the business as 
a whole, and that insight is provided 
rather than data.
Resources
A library of useful information has 
been made accessible to Directors 
through an online portal. This includes 
corporate information such as the 
business plan, corporate governance 
material, regulatory correspondence 
and technical updates.
Training and development 
Training sessions for Directors on topics 
of relevance to the Board are organised 
periodically throughout the year to tie in 
with Board and Committee meetings. 
In 2016, training sessions attended 
by the Board included sessions on 
the EU Market Abuse Regulation, 
and Committee-specific training on 
IFRS9 and hedge accounting (Audit 
Committee) and developments in 
the external market (Remuneration 
Committee). An invite to the 
Committee-specific training was 
extended to all Directors and the 
sessions were well attended by non-
members. The training was led by 
either senior management or external 
advisers. In addition, Directors attended 
relevant external training sessions.
The Board values internal development 
sessions as an important way of 
engaging with key employees and 
familiarising themselves with the 
business. In order to hear the views of 
the wider employees first hand, the 
Board has continued with the ‘Meet 
the Board’ initiative introduced in 2015. 
In addition, the Audit Committee held 
a roundtable with members of the 
Group Internal Audit (“GIA”) function. 
Further information on these events 
can be found on the next page.
A training log is maintained by the 
Company Secretary for each Director 
as evidence of continuous development.
A longlist of potential training sessions 
for 2017 is being drafted by the 
Company Secretary based on proposals 
raised by Directors through the Board 
evaluation process. Suggestions from 
advisers regarding upcoming areas of 
regulatory change will also be sought. 
The Company Secretary, the Chairman 
and Committee Chairs will discuss  
the proposals, which will broadly 
cover business-related and technical/
regulatory items. As a result, a programme 
of quarterly Board training sessions 
supplemented by Committee-specific 
training will be finalised for 2017 . The ‘Meet 
the Board’ and GIA roundtable events will 
also continue.

Corporate governance
The Board – roles and processes
continued Meeting our employees
As part of internal development, the 
Board appreciates the opportunity to 
engage directly with employees. Set out 
below are two examples of how this has 
been achieved. 
‘Meet the Board’ – Wilmslow
In 2016, the Directors visited one of 
the Group’s key sites in Wilmslow 
(where the Mortgages and Financial 
Reporting teams are based) as part of 
an initiative to enable them to engage 
directly with employees across the 
business areas and central functions. 
This followed two similar events 
held during 2015 when the Directors 
visited the Group’s Peterborough and 
Reading sites. The ‘Meet the Board’ 
event was held in an informal setting 
and was designed to be interactive, 
allowing the Directors to gain a deeper 
understanding of the business, how it 
operates and the challenges that staff 
face on a first-hand basis, as well as 
providing an insight to colleagues on 
the role of the Board. The event also 
provided a valuable opportunity for 
employees to share their ideas and 
suggestions with the Directors and to 
put forward questions about the vision 
and strategy for Aldermore, in order to 
promote transparency and employee 
engagement across the Group. 
The ‘Meet the Board’ event was well 
received by both the Directors and 
the participating employees and will 
continue in 2017. In particular, the 
Directors welcomed the informal format 
of the event which was conducive 
to stimulating an open debate with 
colleagues. The feedback from 
employees was equally positive, with 
many expressing their appreciation 
for the Directors’ interest, time and 
engagement, and commenting on the 
high quality of the discussions.
“It is excellent when we have Board 
meetings away from London as we 
get the chance to meet colleagues 
and hear what is going on with our 
customers. The enthusiasm from staff 
was very motivating, and you could 
sense the energy and pride in the room. 
The questions asked were wide ranging 
and all pertinent to our future business 
success. I enjoyed chatting to colleagues 
over lunch and was pleased to learn 
about how, as we grow, we are creating 
opportunities for new and different 
roles and the ability to learn in current 
jobs.” Cathy Turner, Independent Non-
Executive Director
“It was great to see the session 
attended by so many people. The  
questions asked were really topical 
and the Board did a great job at 
answering the questions, covering both 
the high-level outlook on topics as well 
as relating the answers back to people’s 
day jobs and the customer outlook.” 
Employee from Financial Reporting
“It was great to see and hear from each 
of the Board members. I felt that I got 
more of an insight as to what is going 
on within the wider Group and Financial 
Services in general. It is unusual to get 
an opportunity to meet and speak with 
Board members when working in this 
industry so it was great for us to be 
able to ask questions and get some 
really useful feedback.” Employee from 
Residential Mortgages
Group Internal Audit 
Roundtable – Reading
In June 2016, a roundtable was held 
between members of the Audit 
Committee and the GIA team in 
response to a recommendation from the 
2015 effectiveness review of the GIA 
function that it would be beneficial to 
enable Directors to have direct dialogue 
with the GIA team.
The session was an informal 
conversation with no fixed agenda, 
providing the GIA team with an 
opportunity to introduce themselves to 
the Audit Committee members and ask 
questions, including probing Directors 
for their views on current and horizon 
risks, their individual expertise and their 
expectations of the GIA team. The GIA 
team were also keen to understand the 
importance of their role in supporting 
the Audit Committee and the 
interaction between the GIA Director, 
the Audit Committee, the other Board 
Committees and the CEO. 
“The roundtable was useful for both 
the Audit Committee members, who 
were able to meet and learn about 
the skills within the GIA team, and for 
the GIA team who gained an insight 
into the Audit Committee’s role and 
responsibilities, its members and their 
views on key risks within the Group. 
The Directors had the opportunity to ask 
the GIA team questions about the work 
they perform, the challenges faced and 
areas where the team would benefit 
from Audit Committee support. This has 
had a positive cultural impact on the 
GIA team who felt that they gained 
insight which they had not experienced 
in previous roles, as well a unique 
opportunity to have their views heard 
at Board level. Further, it provided the 
team with a greater understanding as to 
why particular audits were required and 
the value of the GIA reports, as well as 
how the Group’s governance structure 
operates.” GIA Director
55 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Board and Committee 
effectiveness
The Board recognises the benefits 
that reviewing the effectiveness of 
its own performance and that of its 
Committees can bring, and is conscious 
that the actions needed to maintain 
effectiveness will develop over time 
as the Company, the Board and best 
practice evolve. Effectiveness is 
reviewed on an annual basis, and the 
Nomination Committee oversees this 
process. In 2016, the Board decided that 
the annual review would be conducted 
internally. The last external review 
was undertaken by Egon Zehnder in 
2014 and, in line with the Code, it is 
anticipated that an external review will 
next take place in respect of 2017.
The 2016 process was agreed by the 
Nomination Committee and led by the 
Senior Independent Director (now the 
Interim Chairman) with support from 
the Company Secretary as required. 
The evaluation was taken forward by 
way of questionnaires which were 
issued to all Board and Committee 
members, and were supplemented by 
one-to-one meetings between each 
Director and the Interim Chairman 
which aimed to seek more context to 
the responses given. The results were 
collated and analysed by the Company 
Secretary, and the draft output was 
discussed with the Interim Chairman 
and, in relation to Committees, the 
relevant Committee Chairs. Finalised 
reports and action plans were 
presented and agreed by the Board and 
Committees. The output concluded that 
the Board and its Committees operated 
effectively during 2016. A summary of 
the outcomes is set out on the next 
page, together with a summary of the 
areas for development for 2017 and an 
update on the actions arising from the 
last effectiveness review. Information on 
the Committee reviews can be found in 
the reports from the individual 
Committees on pages 60 to 73 and 
page 90.
The Nomination Committee will 
oversee the implementation of the 
agreed action plan for the Board and 
interim updates will be assessed during 
the year. An update on progress against 
these actions will be reported in the 
2017 Annual Report and Accounts.
Director performance 
evaluations
In tandem with the process to review 
Board and Committee effectiveness, 
a similar process is followed to 
evaluate the continued effectiveness 
of the performance of the Non-
Executive Directors. 
In respect of the year under review, 
the Interim Chairman undertook a 
performance evaluation for each 
Independent Non-Executive Director, 
whilst the previous Chairman led the 
process for evaluating the performance 
of the Interim Chairman (who had 
acted as Senior Independent Director 
throughout 2016). An evaluation of 
the Chairman’s performance would 
ordinarily also be undertaken, but 
this was not completed in 2016 given 
that the Chairman (Glyn Jones) had 
already tendered his resignation 
when the reviews were commenced. 
To support the evaluations, each 
Director completed an anonymous 
questionnaire to provide an 
assessment of the performance 
and effectiveness of each of the 
Independent Non-Executive Directors. 
The Interim Chairman also solicited 
verbal feedback from each of the Non-
Executive Directors on an individual 
basis. The output from the performance 
evaluations is being discussed in 
one-to-one sessions between the 
Interim Chairman and each Non-
Executive Director, and will identify 
any development needs in terms of 
ongoing training.
The performance of the Executive 
Directors was appraised by the 
previous Chairman (in the case of the 
CEO) or the CEO (in the case of the 
CFO) with input from other Directors. 
The outcome of the evaluations 
was reviewed by the Remuneration 
Committee as part of the process by 
which changes to salary and bonus 
outcomes were approved. 
The evaluations concluded that each 
Director continues to be effective, 
demonstrates commitment to their 
role, and is able to allocate sufficient 
time to the Company to discharge their 
responsibilities effectively.

The Board – roles and processes
continued Update on key development areas in 2016
Continue to embed the recently implemented new template for 
Board papers
• Good progress has been made with the use of an agreed Board 
paper template to ensure papers focus on key issues and flag 
decisions to be made. Management information continues to 
be an area for further improvement as detailed below in “Key 
development areas in 2017.” 
Implement a more structured process to review the effectiveness  
of past decisions, and to apply lessons learned
• A structured process for the review of the effectiveness of past 
decisions has been introduced which monitors on a six-monthly 
basis items approved by the Board, including achievement of key 
milestones and evaluation of successes/lessons learned.
Maintain the focus on succession planning
• The approved Chairman Succession Framework served the 
Company well as the search process for the new Chairman could 
be initiated immediately.
• The Board has overseen the changes which the CEO has made to 
strengthen his executive team.
• Succession planning for key executive roles continues to be an 
area of focus as detailed below in “Key development areas in 2017.”
Review the ongoing development of the Risk Management 
Framework to ensure appropriate behaviour is embedded into  
the risk culture
• The Risk Management Framework has continued to evolve, with 
risk appetite statements and risk metrics being revised and 
refreshed as appropriate.
Develop a comprehensive training programme to meet Directors’ 
requirements
• A bespoke training programme on key regulatory and legislative 
matters was developed.
• Training sessions were held at Board and Committee meetings 
during the year, facilitated by external advisers where 
appropriate (further information is detailed on page 54).
• A similar approach is being adopted in formulating a training 
programme for 2017.
Schedule more informal time for the Board to spend together, and 
extend some of the meetings to ensure there is adequate time for 
discussion of all agenda items, in particular strategic issues
• A number of dinners following formal meetings were scheduled 
to enable Directors to continue discussion of material 
agenda items.
• An annual round-up of remuneration-related developments was 
organised by the Remuneration Committee which was presented 
over dinner by FIT Remuneration Consultants.
• Members have spent informal time with each other and 
colleagues in the business through the ‘Meet the Board’ events 
(see page 55 for more information).
• These events will continue to form part of the Board calendar 
in 2017.
Key areas of strength
• Overall, the Board is considered to work very effectively, with an 
open and positive culture which encourages all to contribute, as 
well as challenge and support the executives equally. 
• It is acknowledged that there is a good mixture of subject matter 
experts on the Board but who all contribute on business overall to 
create a well-balanced team.
• The Chairs of Board Committees are all recognised for their work 
throughout the year.
Key development areas in 2017
Chairman 
• A key focus in the next year will be the introduction of the new 
Chairman and ensuring his/her transition is smooth. 
Agendas and management information
• Responsibilities of Committees and Board are to be reviewed to 
ensure duties are delegated effectively, agendas are focused on 
appropriate matters, and overlap is eliminated.
• In structuring meetings, continuously balance the Board 
agenda between strategic development, risk management and 
delivery assurance.
• Presentation of management information in papers to be 
reviewed to avoid duplication across Board and Committee 
meetings, and to ensure papers are amended to reflect the 
different areas of focus by each forum.
Succession planning and induction
• Continue to develop executive succession plans for key roles to 
ensure there are robust plans in place, with a dedicated strategy 
session to be led by the Group HR Director. 
• Monitoring of talent pipeline to continue through the Nomination  
Committee.
• Ensure that the induction for new Non-Executive Directors 
is refreshed.
Board composition
• Further assessment of the skills and experience on the Board to 
be addressed by the new Chairman, noting there may be some 
further enhancement of the Board in relation to digital technology.

Shareholder analysis
Set out below is analysis of the 
Company's shareholder base as at 
31 December 2016. The shareholding is 
relatively concentrated amongst the 
top 10 shareholders, in particular as 
the Principal Shareholders hold 40.14% 
(discussed in more detail on page 59). 
Overall, the top 10 shareholders hold 
just under 70% of the total issued 
share capital. 
The majority of shareholders  (86%)
are based in the UK, particularly in the 
financial capital of London, with the 
remaining investors based primarily 
in the United States of America and 
in Europe. The primary investment 
style of the investor base is growth 
focused. This reflects the Group's 
growth strategy and an investor 
base that understands Aldermore’s 
financial objectives.
Investor relations
In 2016, the first full-year results as a 
listed company were presented to the 
market. A full investor engagement 
programme led by the CEO and CFO 
was carried out throughout the year 
with both holders and prospective 
holders. Additionally, a specific 
investor roadshow was run in relation 
to the £60m Tier 2 Notes issued in 
October 2016.
Investor meetings are normally 
undertaken by the CEO, CFO and 
the Director of Investor Relations. 
During the year, over 150 individual 
and group investor meetings were 
held covering topics such as business 
performance, competitive positioning, 
strategy and changes in the regulatory 
and political environment. The UK’s vote 
to leave the European Union in June 
2016 was one area of particular focus 
with investors in the year.
Leading Shareholders 
(% shares outstanding)
The Chairman and Senior Independent 
Director are also available to attend 
meetings with shareholders and 
address any significant concerns that 
shareholders may have. In particular 
during 2016, the Senior Independent 
Director (now Interim Chairman), was 
available to discuss the resignation of 
the Chairman, which was announced 
in November 2016.
The Group provides regular updates 
on its investor relations website at 
www.investors.aldermore.co.uk 
including its half-yearly financial 
results, reports and presentations, 
press releases, regulatory news, share 
price data and useful information for 
shareholders with regard to managing 
their shareholdings. 
Information to the Board 
The Chairman is responsible for 
ensuring effective communication with 
shareholders and the Board recognises 
the importance of constructively 
engaging with its shareholders. 
Feedback received from investors is 
regularly shared with Board members 
through the CFO’s regular business 
performance report, which aids broader 
discussions on business matters and 
other relevant topics.

During the year, the Board commissioned 
an independent perception audit of 
a number of the Company’s leading 
institutional shareholders and sell-
side analysts. Overall, whilst this 
demonstrated that the Company has 
a supportive investor base, there are a 
number of recommendations to further 
enhance communications and investor 
relations activity which will be an area of 
focus in 2017.
Principal Shareholders 
The Principal Shareholders have an 
interest in the issued share capital of 
40.14% and their relationship with the 
Company is governed by a Relationship 
Agreement which ensures that: 
-  the Company is capable of carrying 
out its business independently of the 
Principal Shareholders; 
-  transactions and arrangements 
with the Principal Shareholders (and 
their associates) are at arm’s length 
and on normal commercial terms 
(subject to the rules on related party 
transactions in the Listing Rules); and 
-  the Principal Shareholders do not 
take any action that would have the 
effect of preventing the Company 
from complying with, or would 
circumvent the proper application of, 
the Listing Rules.
During the year, the Nomination 
Committee, in accordance with its  
duties, conducted a review of 
compliance with the terms of the 
Relationship Agreement and concluded 
that the Relationship Agreement 
is working effectively and that the 
Company is capable of carrying out 
its business independently of the 
Principal Shareholders. 
The Company has adopted procedures 
which restrict Directors appointed by 
the Principal Shareholders from voting 
on matters where there are conflicts 
of interest and from using information 
obtained through their appointments. 
Under the Relationship Agreement, 
as the Principal Shareholders still 
have an interest in more than 20% 
of the Company, they are entitled to 
appoint two Non-Executive Directors 
to the Board. During the year, Peter 
Cartwright and Neil Cochrane stepped 
down from the Board on 18 April 2016 
and 14 October 2016 respectively. 
Currently, Chris Patrick, who was 
appointed on 21 November 2016, serves 
on the Board as the only Non-Executive 
Director appointed by the Principal 
Shareholders and will stand for election 
by shareholders at the 2017 AGM.
Annual General Meeting 
The 2017 AGM will be held at 11.00am on 
16 May 2017 at the offices of Linklaters 
LLP, 1 Silk Street, London, EC2Y 8HQ. 
The Notice of AGM, together with an

to be discussed at the meeting, will

the 2017 AGM to amend the Company’s 
Articles of Association so that future 
AGMs may be held electronically. 
All members of the Board will be in 
attendance at the 2017 AGM which 
will provide an opportunity to engage 
with shareholders on the key issues 
facing the Group and respond to any 
questions shareholders may have. 
All the Directors will be available after 
the meeting to meet shareholders on 
an informal basis. Voting at the 2017 
AGM will be conducted by a poll and the 
results will be announced to the market 
and made available on the Group’s 
website as soon as practicable following

Perspectives on a number of external 
search agencies were debated by 
the Nomination Committee and a 
shortlist of agencies invited to pitch. 
Based on those discussions and how the 
respective agencies would approach our 
assignment, Ridgeway Partners was 
engaged. In conjunction with Ridgeway 
Partners, a detailed specification was 
prepared which included the most critical 
skills, experience and characteristics 
we would look for in the new Chairman. 
We are making good progress with the 
search and look forward to announcing a 
replacement in due course.
Further detail on the key activities that 
the Nomination Committee focused on 
in 2016 can be found on page 61. We are 
cognisant that governance is a dynamic 
area and we will continue to monitor and 
further embed best practice to ensure 
that our governance frameworks support 
and underpin the delivery of our strategy. 
Whilst the annual effectiveness review 
of the Nomination Committee confirmed 
that we continue to operate effectively, 
an area highlighted for enhancement 
relates to succession planning. In light 
of this and the need to ensure that we 
have adequate succession planning in 
respect of Executive Directors and senior 
management, and to ensure that we have 
the right talent and initiatives to develop 
internal executives for execution of 
our strategy, we intend to make this a 
continued area of focus in 2017.
Danuta Gray,
Chair of Corporate Governance 
and Nomination Committee
Dear Shareholder
As a consequence of the resignation 
of Glyn Jones, I am now acting as Chair 
to the Corporate Governance and 
Nomination Committee (the “Nomination 
Committee”), and I am therefore pleased 
to present this report to you. 
Following the resignation of Neil 
Cochrane as the representative of our 
Principal Shareholders, Chris Patrick 
was nominated as his replacement. 
With responsibility for reviewing Board 
vacancies, the Nomination Committee 
considered the appropriateness of 
the candidate and was pleased to 
recommend the appointment of Chris as 
a Non-Executive Director and member 
of the Nomination Committee and Risk 
Committee in November 2016. 
The Nomination Committee (led by 
myself as the Senior Independent 
Director (“SID”)) has dedicated 
considerable time to overseeing the 
search to identify Glyn's replacement. 
John Hitchins, our Audit Committee 
Chair, was also formally invited to 
join discussions and form part of the 
search process. We were well placed 
to initiate the search process quickly 
and effectively as, in the prior year, we 
had agreed a Chairman Succession 
Framework which outlined the agreed 
approach that would be adopted 
should a replacement ever be needed. 
The Framework, which was developed 
to ensure that the Company has in place 
at all times an effective Chairman to 
lead the Board, confirmed that, as the

The Nomination Committee undertook a review of its own effectiveness through 
2016 as part of the wider Board and Committee evaluation exercise. The review 
took the form of an internal evaluation and was conducted principally by way of a 
questionnaire that was issued to all Nomination Committee members. 
The review covered various areas including the role and remit of the Nomination 
Committee; the effectiveness of the Chair; the appropriateness of information 
provided to the Nomination Committee; and the relationship with management. 
The Nomination Committee discussed the outcome of the review in early 2017. 
The Nomination Committee confirmed that it operated effectively and there were 
no significant areas for concern. It also noted that succession planning would remain 
a key area of focus in 2017. Further information about the Board and Committee 
effectiveness process is set out on pages 56 and 57.

audit team at KPMG for the support they 
have given to the organisation as it has 
transitioned into a listed company.
Given the highly regulated environment 
that we operate within, I am pleased to 
report that the outcome of the annual 
evaluation of the Group Internal Audit 
("GIA") function demonstrates that 
overall the team is operating effectively 
and that it continues to evolve in tandem 
with the maturity of the organisation. 
In line with the Chartered Institute 
of Internal Audit ("CIIA") standards, 
the Audit Committee has agreed 
to commission an external quality 
assessment in 2017 to benchmark GIA 
activities against best practice and peers. 
Ahead of this, during 2016, the function 
conducted a self-assessment against 
the CIIA published guidance on “Effective 
Internal Audit in the Financial Services 
Sector” which provided assurance to the 
Audit Committee that, on a proportionate 
basis, the function complied with all 
relevant areas. Further information 
about GIA can be found on page 67 .
The report sets out the areas the 
Audit Committee focused on in 2016. 
Many of these will again form areas of 
focus for us in 2017 and, in particular, 
the Audit Committee will continue to 
provide regular oversight to the IFRS9 
programme (which was mobilised during 
2016) to ensure that the Company 
is ready for the implementation 
of this standard with effect from 
1 January 2018.
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present this report of 
the Audit Committee for the year ended 
31 December 2016 and I set out below 
some key highlights. We continue to 
maintain a close relationship with the 
Risk Committee as there are topics of 
mutual interest, although with different 
areas of focus.
The Conduct Committee of the Financial 
Reporting Council ("FRC") reviews the 
report and accounts of public and large 
private companies to determine whether 
they comply with the Companies Act 
2006 and other reporting requirements. 
These reviews are conducted on a “desk 
top” basis without access to companies’ 
detailed records, but nonetheless the 
Audit Committee was delighted to 
receive a “no issues” letter from the 
FRC which confirmed that, based on 
their review of the Group’s 2015 Annual 
Report and Accounts (our inaugural 
report as a listed company), they had no 
questions or queries to raise at that time.
T aking into account the framework 
set out in the Audit Tendering Policy 
(which we adopted in June 2016), the 
Audit Committee initiated a project 
in the second half of 2016 to design 
and execute a tender process for the 
external auditor. This was a significant 
and comprehensive exercise which 
concluded with the Board approving the 
Audit Committee’s recommendation that 
Deloitte LLP be appointed as our external 
auditor for the period commencing 
1 January 2017 . I would like to extend my 
thanks to our audit partner and the wider 
John Hitchins,
Chair of Audit Committee

Financial reporting
In respect of financial reporting, the Audit Committee considered the Company’s half-year and annual financial statements and 
considered a number of significant issues and areas of judgement (as set out in the table below). The issues are broadly similar 
to those looked at in 2015 except deferred tax is no longer considered significant given the substantial reduction in the deferred 
tax asset.
Key issues/judgements in financial reporting Audit Committee review and conclusions
Loan impairment provisions
The calculation of loan impairment 
provisions is management’s best estimate 
of losses incurred in the Group’s portfolios 
at the balance sheet date. It involves 
estimates of expected future cash flows 
based on both the likelihood of a loan and 
advance being written off and the estimated 
loss on such a write-off. 
At 31 December 2016, the Group held 
£14.3m of specific loan impairment 
provisions and £13.1m of collective 
provisions respectively. 
 
- The Audit Committee reviewed regular reports during the year in relation to 
both the collective and individual loan impairment provisions. The collective 
impairment model involves a number of significant assumptions. All key 
assumptions, including the probability of default and emergence period, 
have been considered, challenged and reviewed, including an analysis of the 
sensitivity of each key assumption.
- The probability of default is assessed using information obtained from a credit 
bureau for comparable borrowers. These probabilities of defaults are then 
adjusted (usually downwards) to reflect the nature of the Group’s lending. 
The level of adjustment is based on historic internal data. 
- Emergence period assumptions are necessary to estimate the time between 
the trigger events occurring and loans being identified as impaired. The Group 
has limited historical data available and therefore uses market insight to 
estimate the emergence period assumptions. As a result of the UK’s decision 
to leave the EU, it is widely predicted that the UK economy will experience a 
sustained period of economic uncertainty. Whilst it is impossible to predict 
the potential impact of this economic uncertainty, a decision was made to 
increase the emergence period for the Mortgages segments in June 2016. 
This had the impact of increasing the collective impairment by £1.6m.
- The Audit Committee also considered specific cases of individual provisions. 
The significant judgements in calculating specific provisions relate to the 
estimate of the value of collateral due to the specialised nature of lending in 
SME Commercial Mortgages and Asset Finance, coupled with the alternative 
exit strategies which can be adopted. 
- The Audit Committee agreed management’s judgement was appropriate as 
at 31 December 2016. The disclosures relating to loan impairment provisions 
are set out in Note 3 and Note 22 to the financial statements on pages 166 to 
167 and 177 to 178 respectively.

Corporate governance
Audit Committee Report
continued Key issues/judgements in financial reporting Audit Committee review and conclusions
Effective Interest Rate (“EIR”)
The EIR method of accounting for income 
recognition requires management to make 
a number of assumptions. In particular, 
management must make a significant 
judgement around the estimation of the 
expected life of loan assets across the 
Group’s portfolios.
At 31 December 2016, the Group’s balance 
sheet includes an EIR asset of £6.8m. 
- The EIR method of accounting uses a discounted cash flow model to spread 
interest and fee income and expense attributable to loan assets, including 
costs and other premium and discounts, over the estimated life of the asset.
- The Audit Committee considered and challenged the key assumptions within 
the EIR models. One of the key assumptions relates to the expected life of the 
loan asset which is underpinned by judgements made on the likely repayment 
profile of the Group’s loan portfolios (both organic and acquired) driven by 
expected future customer behaviour. During the year, the Audit Committee 
reviewed, challenged and approved an updated governance framework 
related to the preparation and ongoing monitoring and enhancement of these 
repayment profiles.
- It further reviewed the reassessment of the expected lives as at 
31 December 2016, further details of which are given in Note 3 to the 
Financial Statements on page 168. The Audit Committee was satisfied that 
this reassessment had been prepared in line with the updated governance 
framework. After considering sensitivities of key judgements, the Audit 
Committee agreed that management’s judgement was appropriate. 
Share-based payments
Share-based payments are material by 
nature and determination of the fair value 
of share-based payments awarded to 
Directors and employees of the Group 
requires management to make a number 
of judgements. 
A total charge of £3.5m in relation to 
share-based payments was reflected in the 
income statement during the year. 
- During 2016, further share awards were granted under the existing schemes, 
including a modification. The most significant judgement remains the 
calculation of the expected volatility of the Company’s share price. 
- The Audit Committee considered the accounting for the share plans, including 
the methodology used to calculate the fair value of the awards granted and 
the key inputs and assumptions used in the valuation models to calculate 
the charge. 
- The Audit Committee considered sensitivities of key assumptions and was 
satisfied with the judgements applied in calculating the fair value of the 
awards granted. The disclosures relating to share-based payments are set 
out in Note 3 and Note 37 to the financial statements on pages 168 and 186 to 
189 respectively.
Goodwill attributable to Invoice Finance
During 2016, the Group impaired goodwill 
balances totalling £4.1m attributable to the 
Invoice Finance segment. 
Accounting standards require an 
assessment of goodwill balances for 
impairment on at least an annual basis. 
- At 1 January 2016, the Invoice Finance goodwill was carried forward using the 
Fair Value Less Cost of Disposal ("FVLCD") method of valuation. During 2016, 
following the UK's decision to leave the EU, there was a general fall in the 
market value of financial services businesses. As a result, at the half year 
a decision was taken to impair the goodwill relating to the Invoice Finance 
business of £4.1m.
- The disclosures relating to the Invoice Finance goodwill are set out in Note 3 
and Note 28 to the financial statements on pages 169 and 182 respectively.
65 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Fair, balanced and 
understandable
In line with the Code, the overarching 
principle for an annual report and 
accounts is that the report as a whole 
is “fair, balanced and understandable 
and should provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to 
assess the company’s position and 
performance, business model and 
strategy”. This requirement was at the 
forefront of the Audit Committee’s 
planning process for the 2016 Annual 
Report and Accounts to ensure that it 
could provide assurance to the Board 
about making this statement. 
The process enabling the Audit Committee 
to reach this conclusion included:
• The production of the 2016 Annual 
Report and Accounts was managed 
by the Chief Financial Officer, with 
overall governance and co-ordination 
provided by a cross-functional team 
of senior management. 
• This support included input 
from Finance, Risk, Company 
Secretariat, Investor Relations and 
the business lines (including the 
Managing Directors). 
• There was a robust review process 
of inputs into the 2016 Annual Report 
and Accounts by all contributors to 
ensure disclosures were balanced, 
accurate and verified, and further 
comprehensive reviews were 
conducted by senior management.
• The Company Secretary reviewed 
all Board and Committee minutes 
to ensure all significant matters 
discussed at meetings were 
appropriately disclosed in the 
2016 Annual Report and Accounts 
as required.
• A full review was undertaken by the 
external legal advisers to ensure all 
disclosure requirements were met, as 
well as following best practice.
• A formal review was undertaken by 
the Audit Committee of the draft 
2016 Annual Report and Accounts in 
advance of final sign-off.
• A final review was performed by the 
Board of Directors.
In conclusion, the Audit Committee is 
satisfied that the 2016 Annual Report 
and Accounts meets the “fair, balanced 
and understandable” criteria.
Internal controls and risk 
management
The Audit Committee is responsible 
for reviewing the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the Group’s systems of 
internal control and risk management. 
Details of the risk management 
systems in place are provided within 
the risk management section from 
page 106. 
Details of the process performed to 
assess the effectiveness of internal 
controls are provided on page 31.
On the recommendation of the Audit 
Committee and Risk Committee, the 
Board concluded that the Group’s 
systems of internal control and risk 
management were appropriately 
designed and operated effectively 
during 2016.
Whistleblowing
The Audit Committee reviews the 
adequacy and security of the Group’s 
whistleblowing arrangements for 
its employees and contractors to 
raise concerns, in confidence, about 
possible wrongdoing in financial 
reporting or other matters. Under new 
regulation in 2016, the Company was 
required to appoint a Whistleblowing 
Champion to oversee the effectiveness 
of the whistleblowing framework, 
and an accountable executive for 
establishing policies and procedures on 
whistleblowing. The Chair of the Audit 
Committee and the Chief Risk Officer 
agreed to be appointed to these roles, 
and will carry out their responsibilities in 
conjunction with the Audit Committee.
During 2016, the Audit Committee 
reviewed the Group's whistleblowing 
arrangements and it was agreed 
that, in order to complement the 
processes that were already in place, 
an independent third-party provider 
would be appointed to operate a 
whistleblowing line. Avenues previously 
available to an employee for raising a 
concern remain in place (i.e. with their 
line manager in the first instance or, 
where not appropriate, directly with 
the Head of Compliance via a dedicated 
contact number). Once a report has 
been made, an initial assessment is 
undertaken in order to decide if an 
independent investigation is required.
In respect of the year under review, 
a report on whistleblowing was 
considered by the Audit Committee 
which concluded that there were no 
areas of concern which were significant 
or demonstrated material weaknesses 
in internal controls during the year.

Audit Committee Report
continued Group Internal audit
The Group has an independent and 
objective GIA function which acts as the 
third line of defence. The GIA Director 
reports directly to the Audit Committee 
Chair and to the CEO for administrative 
purposes. The GIA Director meets 
with the Audit Committee Chair on a 
frequent basis and periodically with 
the whole Audit Committee without 
management present. In addition, the 
Audit Committee held a roundtable 
with members of the GIA team during 
the year, which allowed the Audit 
Committee to delve further into key 
areas of focus. See page 55 for more 
information about the roundtable event.
The Audit Committee reviews and 
approves the GIA Risk Assessment 
and Plan of Work (“GIA Plan”) including 
the adequacy of resources and skills 
available. The GIA Director utilises 
specialist knowledge from external 
consultants, where appropriate, to 
supplement the skills of the GIA team. 
The GIA Director monitors changes 
to the business and the external 
environment throughout the year and 
considers whether any changes to the 
GIA Plan are needed. Any proposed 
changes are reviewed and approved by 
the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee receives regular 
reports on progress against the GIA Plan 
including reports on individual audits 
as well as thematic issues identified. 
The Audit Committee also reviews 
the effectiveness of management 
action plans to remediate GIA findings 
and receives reports from GIA on the 
progress management has made in 
implementing audit recommendations.
To assess the effectiveness of GIA in 
respect of 2016, the Audit Committee 
performed an internal review which 
included obtaining feedback from 
members of the Audit Committee, as 
well as executive management. It also 
had regard to the CIIA guidance on 
“Effective Internal Audit in the Financial 
Services Sector” (“CIIA Guidance”). 
The internal review concluded that 
the function was effective overall 
noting that, while there were some 
areas for further development, these 
had already been identified and were 
being acted upon by the GIA Director. 
During the year, GIA also performed 
a self-assessment against both the 
CIIA Guidance and internal auditing 
standards. The Audit Committee 
reviewed the output from this review, 
which confirmed that GIA was operating 
effectively against the standards.
The Audit Committee has decided that 
in 2017 it will commission an external 
quality assessment to benchmark 
GIA activities against best practice 
and peers.
External audit
The Audit Committee is responsible 
for overseeing the relationship with 
the external auditor, including the 
ongoing assessment of the auditor’s 
independence. The Audit Committee 
makes recommendations to the Board 
with regard to the appointment of 
the external auditor, and approves 
their remuneration and terms 
of engagement.
KPMG LLP and its predecessor firm, 
KPMG Audit PLC, were appointed as the 
Company’s auditor in 2009. The current 
audit partner is Mike Peck who has been 
in place since 2014.
During 2016, the Audit Committee Chair 
met the external auditor on a regular 
basis during the year to facilitate 
effective and timely communication. 
The Audit Committee also met the 
external auditor once during the year 
without management present in order 
to discuss their remit and raise any 
issues arising from the audit.
Independence
Processes are in place to safeguard the 
independence of the external auditor, 
including controls around the use of the 
external auditor for non-audit services 
and the operation of a Policy on the 
Employment of Former Employees 
of the External Auditor. Details of 
the Non-Audit Services Policy are 
set out on page 69. In addition, the 
external auditor provides the Audit 
Committee with further assurance as 
to the procedures that it maintains to 
preserve objectivity and confirmation 
that it remains independent.
Effectiveness
The Audit Committee assesses the 
effectiveness of the external auditor 
and the external audit process on 
an annual basis through a number of 
steps, including: i) agreement of their 
engagement letter and fees; ii) a review 
of the external audit plan, including the 
experience of the audit team assigned; 
iii) an evaluation of the reports issued 
following inspections of KPMG LLP by 
the Financial Reporting Council’s Audit 
Quality Review team; iv) a review of 
the clarity and thoroughness of KPMG 
LLP’s written reports and contribution 
to Audit Committee discussions; 
and v) a review of non-audit fees to 
confirm compliance with the Non-Audit 
Services Policy. Following its review 
of the 2016 external audit process, 
the Audit Committee concluded that it 
was effective.
67 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices External audit tender process
The tender process was overseen by the Audit Committee, with support from a steering group comprising the Audit Committee Chair, the Risk 
Committee Chair, the CFO and the Group Financial Controller. The tender process involved five key stages, which are summarised below:
Audit tender
During the year, the Audit Committee 
approved an Audit Tendering Policy 
which confirmed that the external audit 
contract would be put out to tender 
at least every 10 years, and where 
a competitive tender had not been 
completed in the last five years, the 
Company would confirm when it  
proposed to carry out a tender and  
the reasons why. This was in line with  
both the Code and other regulatory  
requirements.
The Audit Committee decided to 
commence a tendering process in 2016. 
This process culminated in a 
recommendation to the Board that 
Deloitte LLP should be appointed as the 
Company’s auditor with effect from the 
2017 AGM. This recommendation was 
approved by the Board in December 
2016 and the proposed appointment 
is included in the 2017 Notice of AGM. 
Further detail on the tender process is 
provided below.

effectiveness 
The Audit Committee undertook a  
review of its own effectiveness through  
2016 as part of the wider Board and 
Committee evaluation exercise. The  
review took the form of an internal

by way of a questionnaire that was issued 
to all Audit Committee members.
The review covered various areas 
including the role and remit of the 
Audit Committee; the effectiveness 
of the Chair; the appropriateness of 
information provided to the Audit 
Committee; and the relationship with 
management. The Audit Committee 
discussed the outcome of the review 
in early 2017. The Audit Committee 
confirmed that it operated effectively 
and there were no significant areas for

68 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Corporate governance
Audit Committee Report
continued Non-audit services 
To ensure the independence of the 
external auditor, the Audit Committee 
has adopted a formal policy on the 
engagement of the auditor to perform 
non-audit services. 
Under the Non-Audit Services Policy, 
the external auditor is prohibited 
from undertaking any work that 
is considered to threaten its 
independence or objectivity in its role. 
Prohibited work specifically includes 
bookkeeping services, the design and 
implementation of financial information 
systems, appraisal or valuation 
services, actuarial or legal services, and 
any other work that would involve the 
external auditor in preparing financial 
information that is included or disclosed 
in the audited financial statements, or in 
making judgements or taking decisions 
on behalf of management. 
The external auditor is permitted to 
undertake work in other areas as long 
as it is the most suitable supplier of the 
service and the terms and conditions 
of the engagement, including the level 
of the fee, do not impair its objectivity 
or independence. Under the Policy, 
the Audit Committee pre-approves 
the use of the external auditor for 
routine non-audit services, such as 
profit verifications and country-by-
country reporting.
Agreement to use the external auditor 
for non-audit services must be 
approved as set out below. 
When determining whether the 
external auditor is the most 
suitable supplier of a particular 
service, management and the Audit 
Committee take into account the 
cost-effectiveness of the service and 
the external auditor’s knowledge of 
the Group. KPMG LLP has policies and 
procedures in place to ensure that 
the highest standards of objectivity, 
independence and integrity are 
maintained, and these comply with 
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors. The audit 
engagement partner must approve 
any non-audit services offered to the 
Group. This ensures that the objectives 
of the proposed engagement are not 
inconsistent with the objectives of 
the audit; allows the identification and 
assessment of any related threats 
to KPMG LLP’s objectivity; and 
assesses the effectiveness of available 
safeguards to eliminate such threats 
or reduce them to an acceptable level. 
KPMG LLP do not carry out non-
audit services where no satisfactory 
safeguards exist. 
During the year, the external auditor 
was engaged to perform the following 
non-audit services: 
The above services resulted in total 
non-audit services being provided of

central functions) to reflect the growing 
size, scale and complexity of the 
Group; enhancing our stress testing 
capabilities; augmenting our lending 
policies; and reviewing our buy-to-let

execution of that decision has emerged. 
We will continue to do so as we look 
towards our priorities for 2017.
The Risk Committee keeps under 
review those risks on the horizon that 
could have a material impact on the 
Group in the future. These emerging 
risks will be an area of focus in 
2017, alongside the impact on our 
risk appetite of changes in the 
external environment.
Peter Shaw,
Chair of Risk Committee
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the report 
of the Risk Committee for 2016. 
The promotion of a strong risk culture 
is a key Board responsibility and the 
regular attendance at meetings of the 
Risk Committee by other Directors who 
are not members reflects the Board’s 
desire to set this ‘tone from the top’.
In November 2016, we welcomed 
Chris Patrick to the Risk Committee 
as the representative of our Principal 
Shareholders. Chris brings with him a 
wealth of financial and risk management 
experience. Peter Cartwright and Neil 
Cochrane served as shareholder-
representative members during 
the year, and I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank them both for 
their outstanding contributions to the 
Risk Committee during their respective 
tenures. Following changes to the CEO’s 
executive team, the Risk Committee 
is now supported by a new Chief Risk 
Officer, Christine Palmer. Joining from 
RBS where she held senior risk roles 
for the last 13 years, Christine brings 
strong leadership to the Risk function.
The Risk Committee has again had an 
active agenda in 2016. Our key priority 
has been to build on the substantial 
investment in the Risk Management 
Framework that we oversaw in 2015. 
We have continued to evolve and 
embed risk frameworks, policies 
and procedures, whilst remaining 
cognisant of the growth of the 
business, the changing economic 
outlook and developments in the 
regulatory environment.

Details of key matters discussed by 
the Risk Committee during the year 
are set out on page 71 and further 
information about discussion of these 
topics at meetings is described below. 
In addition, pages 33 to 35 provide a 
summary of the principal risks faced by 
the Group and key mitigating actions; 
and an overview of emerging risks, 
along with recent and anticipated future 
developments. Further information on 
the Group’s approach to risk, including 
the associated governance framework 
for managing risk, stress testing and a 
full analysis of the principal risks are set 
out in the risk management section on 
pages 106 to 139. 
Frameworks
During the year, the Risk Committee 
reviewed and updated the Risk 
Management Framework (“RMF”) and 
Risk Appetite Framework (“RAF”), 
with risk appetite statements and risk 
metrics being revised and refreshed 
as appropriate. Proposals were 
approved to implement a Group 
Policy Management Framework 
(under which policies, processes and 
procedures will be governed) and a 
Models Management Framework, 
thereby strengthening the overarching 
RMF. The Stress Testing Framework 
was also enhanced, and the Group’s 
ICAAP and ILAAP were challenged and 
recommended to Board.
Credit risk
The Risk Committee regularly reviews 
the credit risk profile of the Group, 
with a clear focus on performance 
against risk appetite statements 
and risk metrics. During the year, the 
Risk Committee considered in-depth 
reviews of a number of asset classes 
including the Mortgages and Buy-To-
Let exposures. A number of policies 
were reviewed by the Risk Committee 
including the Group Concentration 
Risk Policy, changes to portfolio level 
policies and the impact of these on 
risk appetite.
The current and future impact of 
emerging risks on the Group’s credit 
risk profile and risk appetite was a 
particular area of focus, with follow-up 
actions being agreed with management 
as required.
Capital and liquidity risk
The Risk Committee monitors capital 
and liquidity risk and receives regular 
reports on actual and forecast levels in 
relation to key RAF metrics.
During the year, the Risk Committee 
considered revisions to the Group’s 
capital risk appetite and reviewed the 
impact of key regulatory developments 
including the BCBS proposed revisions 
to the standardised approach to credit 
risk (expected to be finalised in H1 2017) 
and the Bank of England’s approach to 
minimum requirement for own funds 
and eligible liabilities.
The Risk Committee also reviewed 
changes to the approach to the 
management of and reporting on 
liquidity risks. This was strengthened 
by revisions to the Funds Transfer 
Pricing Policy (which ensures that the 
costs and risks of liquidity are clearly 
attributed to business lines) and 
changes to core systems and people 
capability which have enabled daily 
liquidity reporting to be enhanced.
Market risk
Although the Group does not seek to 
take market risk, the Risk Committee 
reviewed the interest rate risk that 
the Group carries as part of the ICAAP 
review process.
Operational risk
As part of the continued development 
of the systems and controls in place 
to support the control environment, 
the Risk Committee approved a 
revised Operational Risk Management 
Framework in early 2016, and a detailed 
report on the effectiveness of that 
framework in October 2016.
During the year, the Risk Committee 
received a number of updates on 
operational risk matters, including the 
operational risk profile, and on specific 
areas of focus including enhancements 
to and the implementation of business 
assurance (controls) testing and the 
risk and control self-assessment 
process (by which business areas 
maintain a view of their risks and 
control effectiveness).
In terms of the operational risk profile, 
the Risk Committee received regular 
updates on business continuity, disaster 
recovery, cyber security and cyber risk 
management. Cyber security remains 
an important area of focus for the 
Group with a number of improvements 
delivered during 2016, driven by the 
Security Investment Programme. 
This has been complemented by an 
independent review of the Group’s 
security framework, and a revised 
cyber strategy for 2017 onwards.
In addition, the Risk Committee 
monitored the performance of 
key systems and significant 
projects, as well as noting material 
outsourced arrangements.

continued Compliance, conduct and 
financial crime risk
Conduct risk management continues 
to be a key area of focus for the Risk 
Committee. In addition to regular 
reports on performance against 
conduct risk metrics and developments 
regarding new and existing products, 
a deep-dive was presented to the Risk 
Committee which provided an overview 
of enhancements to and embedding 
of the conduct risk framework, and 
emerging themes.
In conjunction with the Audit 
Committee, the Risk Committee 
reviews the Group’s arrangements for 
anti-money laundering on an annual 
basis. The effectiveness of the Financial 
Crime Risk Framework over 2016 was 
also reviewed and the Risk Committee 
noted the significant enhancements 
made to key policies and procedures 
during the year and the strengthening 
of capabilities for regular monitoring of 
financial crime risk metrics.
Reputational risk
The Risk Committee reviewed and 
recommended for Board approval the 
Group’s Reputational Risk Policy.
Remuneration matters
The Risk Committee has a duty to 
advise the Remuneration Committee 
regarding both the design of senior 
executive annual and long-term 
incentive plans to ensure that 
management are not being incentivised 
to take undue risks; and any risk 
management and control issues that 
have arisen that it believes should be 
taken into account when determining 
executive remuneration payments 
under the aforementioned plans.
In 2016, the Risk Committee reviewed 
regular reports from the Chief Risk 
Officer in relation to these matters. 
A full assessment of the risk appetite, 
risk management, governance and 
control frameworks operating across 
the Group was undertaken, which took 
into account adherence to established 
risk appetite limits and triggers, risk 
events which have been raised, the 
findings from second line oversight 
reviews and any unsatisfactory 
reviews or material findings by Group 
Internal Audit. Consideration was also 
given to whether these areas revealed 
poor culture or a lack of risk and control 
awareness, and also whether actions to 
close risk issues were taken seriously 
and acted upon in a timely manner.
Risk Committee 
effectiveness
The Risk Committee undertook a 
review of its own effectiveness 
through 2016 as part of the wider 
Board and Committee evaluation 
exercise. The review took the form 
of an internal evaluation and was 
principally conducted by way of a 
questionnaire that was issued to all Risk 
Committee members.
The review covered various areas 
including the role and remit of the 
Risk Committee; the effectiveness 
of the Chair; the appropriateness 
of information provided to the Risk 
Committee; and the relationship with 
management. The Risk Committee 
discussed the outcome of the review 
in early 2017. The Risk Committee 
confirmed that it operated effectively 
and there were no significant areas for 
concern. Further information about the 
Board and Committee effectiveness 
process is set out on pages 56 and 57.

Remuneration Committee and its

• Appendix: Remuneration Policy 
(pages 92 to 99)
Performance and reward 
outcomes for 2016
2016 was a remarkable year. Whilst we 
recognise that the macroeconomic 
and regulatory developments globally 
impacted sentiment throughout the 
year, it was disappointing that the share 
price has not performed as strongly as 
we had hoped given the fundamentally 
strong financial performance that 
was achieved.
However, throughout 2016 we 
continued to focus our efforts on 
serving our customers, prudent growth 
in assets and capital accretion, such 
that the year finished strongly in terms 
of the key financial targets:
• Profit before tax of £128.7m
• Reported return on equity of 17.2%
• Reported cost/income ratio of 46.09%
• Net loan growth of £1.3bn
In determining the pay outcomes for 
the financial year, the Remuneration 
Committee has given full consideration 
to all aspects of performance to ensure 
a clear linkage to the results.
In respect of the Executive Directors, 
we agreed:
• a zero level of vesting for the 
Pre-IPO long-term awards which 
were subject to a TSR performance 
measure ending 31 December 2016. 
These awards have, therefore, lapsed 
in full; and
• an AIP award of approximately 
79.7% and 80.7% of the maximum 
for the CEO and CFO respectively, 
in keeping with the strong financial 
results, and combined with the 
achievement of the non-financial 
and personal performance measures 
within the AIP balanced scorecard. 
Further information on the 
performance against relevant targets 
can be found on pages 79 to 81.
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
present our Directors’ Remuneration 
Report (the “Remuneration Report”) 
for the year ended 31 December 2016. 
In addition to this statement, the report 
also includes our “Annual Report on 
Remuneration” which covers:
• How the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy (the “Remuneration Policy”) 
was implemented in 2016 and how it 
will be implemented in 2017
• A report on the key details of the 
Remuneration Committee and 
its activities
• An appendix which sets out an 
extract from our Remuneration 
Policy for ease of reference
The Remuneration Policy was approved 
by shareholders last year at the 2016 
AGM. Votes of 93.68% and 93.93% 
were achieved in favour of the approval 
of the Remuneration Policy and the 
advisory vote on the Annual Report on 
Remuneration respectively, and the 
Board was pleased with this strong level 
of support.
The Remuneration Committee has kept 
the Remuneration Policy under review 
throughout the year. We are satisfied 
that, as an overarching framework, 
our Remuneration Policy remains 
appropriate and continues to align 
remuneration with the long-term 
interests of our shareholders. As part 
of our ongoing assessment of our plans, 
which includes consideration of market 
developments, we have identified some 
enhancements to the operation of our 
annual bonus plan, the Annual Incentive 
Plan (“AIP”), which are set out on the 
next page.
Cathy Turner
Chair of Remuneration Committee
We are satisfied that, as an 
overarching framework, 
our Remuneration Policy 
remains appropriate 
and continues to align 
remuneration with the 
long-term interests of 
our shareholders.”

Remuneration Policy
Executive Directors
Looking ahead to 2017, remuneration 
arrangements will remain largely  
unchanged from 2016. The  Remuneration  
Committee agreed that it would be 
appropriate to award an increase in 
base salary to the Executive Directors 
which was consistent with the average 
level of increase of 2.5% awarded to 
employees across the Group generally. 
This increase will take effect from 1 April 
2017. No changes are proposed to the 
levels of pension contributions (which 
we are pleased to report are in line with 
those paid to employees in the wider 
Group), taxable benefits or the market 
adjusted allowance.
In considering the AIP balanced 
scorecard for 2017, we have strived 
to ensure that bonus outcomes 
continue to be based on a framework 
that is both transparent and aligned 
with shareholder interests. We have 
concluded that our approach in this 
regard could be strengthened by:
• broadening the financial performance 
measures such that they are less 
weighted towards a single measure 
of profitability and are now more 
representative of our core financial 
KPIs. The weighting of the financial 
performance measures remains 
at 50%;
• further emphasising the link between 
risk performance and remuneration 
outcomes by increasing the 
weighting of the risk measures from 
15% to 20%. This reflects input from 
our regulator, the PRA, for a more 
explicit approach to risk adjustment 
within scorecards across the industry 
as well as our own enterprise-wide 
objective of continuing to embed a 
robust risk framework; and
• removing the highly qualitative 
personal objectives target 
completely and increasing the 
weighting of the customer and people 
elements from 7.5% each to 20% and 
10% respectively, reflecting the two 
critical enablers driving sustained 
performance. Individual performance 
will continue to be assessed 
through measuring the non-
financial elements against both the 
overall achievement and personal 
contribution to those measures.
We believe that these modifications will 
enable us to provide shareholders with 
more transparent disclosures going 
forward on how we have assessed 
bonus outcomes.
No changes are proposed to either 
quantum or performance measures in 
respect of awards to be made under 
the Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) in 
2017, and these will be made on a similar 
basis to 2016.
Non-Executive Directors
Following the resignation of Glyn 
Jones as Chairman with effect from 
6 February 2017, Danuta Gray, our 
Senior Independent Director, has 
assumed the role of Interim Chairman. 
We have agreed that Danuta’s fee will 
be raised to the same level as that of the 
previous Chairman for the period she 
undertakes the interim role, recognising 
the increased responsibilities.
Shareholder engagement
We have followed with interest external 
developments over the last year 
regarding executive remuneration, 
and have monitored evolving views 
regarding flexible remuneration 
structures and the use of restricted 
stock. In particular, we have welcomed 
the increasing level of support for the 
tailoring of remuneration arrangements 
to suit each company’s own culture 
and strategy.
We have taken the decision to widen 
the use of restricted stock for senior 
(below Board) executives from 2017 
onwards as we believe that this 
enhances alignment of the interests 
of executives with the share price and, 
therefore, with investors, whilst also 
reducing overall share usage. We will 
review the impact of changes to our 
own remuneration structure and 
wider market developments in 2017 
and beyond.
Following our listing last year, we have 
continued to develop our remuneration 
practices in line with the approved 
Remuneration Policy. We welcome 
the views of our shareholders and are 
committed to maintaining an open  
dialogue. 
We hope to receive your ongoing 
support at our forthcoming AGM where 
I, along with the other members of the 
Remuneration Committee, look forward 
to answering any questions you may 
have on this Remuneration Report 
or our approach to remuneration 
more generally.

Fees to be paid to the Non-Executive Directors are set out on page 87. The only change to fees in 2017 (effective 1 April 2017) is 
an increase in the fee paid to the Chair of the Remuneration Committee (from £15k p.a. to £20k p.a.), which brings this fee into line 
with the fees paid to the Chairs of the Audit and Risk Committees.

 “Taxable benefits” comprises the gross value of any benefits paid to the Director, whether in cash or in kind, that are chargeable to UK income tax. Further detail is 
provided at the bottom of the page. In addition, the following items have been included under “Taxable benefits”:
- Awards made under the SIP . Consistent with other employees, a one-off award was made under the SIP to both Executive Directors following IPO in recognition 
of their contribution to the business. This has been valued at the share price on the date of grant (£2.41) and included in the 2015 figure. These awards vested 
immediately on grant and are included in the share interests table on page 88.
- The write-off of loans to Phillip Monks and James Mack of £108,317 and £31,279 respectively in 2015. These loans were made originally to settle the tax payable by 
each of the Directors in respect of equity incentives awarded to them prior to the IPO.
- Participation by Phillip Monks and James Mack in the Sharesave Plan. Where the average share price over Q4 in the year of grant is higher than the option price, 
participation is included under “Taxable benefits”. On this basis, participation in the 2016 invitation is included above. Further detail can be found on page 85.

 The “Market adjusted allowance” became payable following IPO.
3
 The “Annual bonus” figure represents the value of the total bonus. A proportion of the bonus will be deferred into shares under the DSP . 60% of the bonus earned in 
respect of 2016 will be deferred. For 2015, this was at a blended rate based on 15% being deferred into shares for the part of the bonus earned in the period up to IPO, and 
60% being deferred into shares for the part of the bonus earned for the period following IPO. See page 79 for detail on the bonus outcome.
4
 The Directors held certain shares pre-IPO which converted into ordinary shares on IPO. The reported gains have been calculated on the market value of shares held at 
IPO (£1.92) less the actual cost of any shares bought pre-IPO, regardless of whether such shares were acquired as an investment or an incentive, and included in the 
2015 figure. As part of the IPO, the Directors were subject to certain lock-up arrangements in respect of their shares, as set out in the IPO Prospectus. The lock-up 
in respect of two-thirds of each Director’s holding expired on the first anniversary of the IPO, whilst the remaining one-third expired on the second anniversary of 
the IPO.
Fixed pay for Executive Directors
Base salary
The Remuneration Committee considered benchmarking data in respect of the base salaries of the Executive Directors, and 
determined that the increases set out in the table below were appropriate. The increases, which will take effect from 1 April 2017, 
are in line with the Remuneration Policy and are consistent with the average level of increase of 2.5% awarded to employees in 
the Group generally.
At 1 April 2017 % increase At 1 April 2016
Phillip Monks £525,313 2.5% £512,500
James Mack £367,719 2.5% £358,750
Taxable benefits
The taxable benefits received by the Executive Directors in 2016 included private medical insurance (family cover), a car 
allowance and critical illness insurance. 
No changes to taxable benefits are proposed to be made during 2017.

continued Market adjusted allowance
The market adjusted allowance is calculated as a percentage of base salary. As reported last year, with effect from 1 April 2016 
the level paid to the CFO was increased from 15% to 20%, aligning it with that paid to the CEO. Further information on the market 
adjusted allowance can be found in the Remuneration Policy table on page 94.
No changes to the market adjusted allowance are proposed in 2017.
Pensions
Pension contributions for the Executive Directors are paid at a rate of 8%, consistent with employees in the Group generally. 
This may be paid into a personal pension arrangement or paid as a cash supplement (reduced for the impact of employers’ 
NICs). Throughout 2016, the CEO chose to receive a cash supplement. Prior to 1 April 2016, a contribution of 6% was paid into a 
stakeholder pension for the CFO (maintained at 6% in line with the CFO’s wishes). As reported last year, with effect from 1 April 
2016, the CFO elected to be paid a cash supplement of 8% (less employers’ NICs) and he ceased to receive contributions into a 
stakeholder pension.
The Company does not intend to make any changes to pension contributions in 2017.
Annual Incentive Plan (“AIP”)
2016 AIP outturn
The AIP is based on a balanced scorecard of financial, non-financial and personal measures. The Remuneration Committee sets 
stretching performance targets at the start of the performance period. Whilst the performance of each element is assessed 
against the targets at the end of the performance period, the Remuneration Committee also considers total bonus outcomes 
within the context of both the Company’s overall performance and personal performance to ensure that they are fair.
The table below sets out the performance measures and outcomes for the 2016 AIP. The maximum bonus opportunity for both 
the CEO and the CFO was 125% of base salary. The actual percentage of the maximum bonus awarded was 79.7% for the CEO and 
80.7% for the CFO.

Based on the assessment of the performance measures above, actual bonuses paid to the Executive Directors are set out below. 
60% of the bonus awarded will be deferred into shares and held under the DSP. The deferred element of the bonus will take the 
form of a nil-cost option award, which will become exercisable by the Directors in equal amounts over the three years following 
the award, subject to continued employment and malus and clawback provisions. The number of shares to be awarded will be 
based on the Company’s average share price over the three-day period prior to grant and will be disclosed in the 2017 Annual 
Report and Accounts.

The Remuneration Committee assesses the non-financial elements by way of both internal, quantifiable targets and a broader 
qualitative assessment having sought appropriate input from the Chief Risk Officer, the Group Marketing Director and the Group 
HR Director in respect of the risk, customer and people elements respectively. The key performance outcomes which were taken 
into account in agreeing the outcomes were as follows:

Performance 
metric Outcomes
Phillip 
Monks
James 
Mack
Risk •  A full assessment of the risk appetite, risk management, governance and control frameworks operating 
across the Group was undertaken by the Chief Risk Officer and discussed with the Risk Committee 
before formal presentation to the Remuneration Committee. This included adherence to established 
risk appetite limits and triggers, risk events and findings raised in the course of reviews by second-line 
risk teams and the Group Internal Audit function. Consideration was also given to risk culture and risk 
awareness.
•  Overall, it was recognised that the risk performance met expectations when measured against existing 
risk appetite and metrics, the operating environment and the current maturity of the organisation. 
Both the CEO and the CFO (in conjunction with the Executive team) had been strong advocates of 
setting the ‘tone from the top’, and a transparent and open culture was promoted. This had manifested 
itself in general trends of risk events being raised proactively and in a timely manner; management 
responsiveness to risk issues; and, consequently, appropriate resolution.
75% 80%
Customer •  The overarching goal for remuneration purposes was to ‘put the customer at the heart of everything we 
do’. This objective was an assessment which included both numeric and more behavioural assessment.
•  NPS, or Net Promoter Score, is a customer loyalty metric which is widely used across a number 
of industries, and is one of the key performance indicators of the Group’s strategic objective to be 
customer -driven (see pages 14 and 36 for more information). In 2016, the customer NPS improved by 
+ 14 which was well ahead of the target for the year. The Remuneration Committee also took into account 
the CFO’s leadership of the Savings business, where a strong performance resulted in the increase in the 
Savings NPS score exceeding the target set for 2016.
•  The ‘Voice of the Customer’ programme was launched to enable the Group to collect customer feedback 
in real time and respond to it. The programme was championed by the Executive Directors.
•  Other indicators of customer views were also considered, for example customer complaints, which were 
maintained within accepted tolerances, and upheld rates, which remained below industry averages.

Mack
People •  The ‘Big Conversation’ programme was launched, in part to replace the ‘Best Companies to Work For’ 
survey as the principal means of evaluating employee engagement and to provide more meaningful 
insights from people. This has enabled richer feedback to be obtained from employees, with a view to 
better connecting culture with strategy.
•  Employee engagement is a key performance indicator of the Group’s strategic objective to deliver 
simply. Whilst the mechanism for measuring employee engagement changed in 2016 in line with the 
‘Big Conversation’ approach and was not directly comparable to previous years, the Remuneration 
Committee noted that internal engagement surveys had confirmed a strong level of employee 
connection to Aldermore.
•  Senior management succession planning is continuing to evolve and the mapping of current and future 
talent requirements has developed further during the year. This translated into the movement of a 
number of employees into roles that will enable them to broaden their skills and experience, with a view 
to stepping up in to a more senior role in due course. In addition, development plans were formalised for 
the senior management team.
•  Internal management development programmes continue to be promoted, and strong sponsorship and 
support from the Executive Committee has been instrumental in the programmes resulting in internal 
promotions. During 2016, the CFO sponsored the Group’s main internal development programme 
(the ‘Next Generation Leaders’ programme).
67% 80%
The targets for the risk customer and people measures are internal to the Group and commercially sensitive, and are likely to 
remain so. They are not, therefore, disclosed.
The Executive Directors’ personal objectives are focused on the delivery of the Group’s strategy and, in the case of the CFO, 
the continued evolution of the Finance functions falling within his remit. Following consideration of achievements against the 
objectives which were set at the beginning of 2016, the Remuneration Committee’s view was that both the CEO and the CFO had 
performed strongly against all of their objectives and confirmed that awards of 100% and 95% of maximum respectively should 
be made. Examples of achievements against personal objectives are set out below:
2016 AIP: personal objectives

•  A significant year of macroeconomic uncertainty and regulatory developments demanded a more flexible approach to 
planning, which has been driven by the CEO. A re-articulation of the Group’s strategy has led to a renewed focus on three 
strategic priorities as detailed on page 14.
•  During the year, the Executive Committee was strengthened through the appointment of three new members who bring 
a wealth of experience in their respective fields and who will each help drive the business forward.
•  The CEO has supported the delivery of key strategic projects. This included upgrades to two of the Group's core customer 
platforms.

•  The CFO oversaw delivery of the project to raise £60m additional Tier 2 capital in October 2016, thereby strengthening 
the balance sheet.
•  A strong performance was delivered across Financial Planning, Financial Control and Capital Management with 
improvements made to internal structures and resources to provide improved insight and an enhanced control 
environment to support business decisions.
•  Under the leadership of the CFO, it has been a strong year for the Treasury function. A new asset/liability management 
system has been implemented with improved reporting and analysis capabilities to drive business performance in areas 
such as cashflow forecasting.

As set out in the statement from the Remuneration Committee Chair (on page 75), the Remuneration Committee has reviewed 
the balanced scorecard of performance measures to apply for the 2017 performance year. Whilst retaining the broad overall 
split between financial and non-financial performance measures, some changes to the underlying performance measures and 
weightings were agreed and, as a result, the balanced scorecard will be structured as set out below.
A key driver of the changes to the underlying performance metrics is to ensure that they are more representative of our core 
KPIs, thereby strengthening the link between pay and performance. The alignment of the performance metrics with our KPIs is 
shown below, whilst further information on the KPIs can be found on page 15.
2017 AIP: performance measures (CEO and CFO)

Cost/income ratio Cost/income ratio 5%
Cost of risk Cost of risk 5%
Non-financial measures

The Remuneration Committee has set stretching financial targets against budget, and has agreed a suite of underlying metrics in 
respect of the non-financial performance measures. An evaluation of each Director’s individual performance against the relevant 
overarching enterprise-wide objective will also be taken into account in assessing the outturn of the non-financial measures.
The targets are currently commercially sensitive but will be disclosed in the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts on a similar basis to 
those for 2016 in this report.
Long-term incentives
PSP: Awards made in 2016
During the year, awards were granted to the Executive Directors under the PSP (in the form of nil-cost options) with a face value 
at the time of the award of 135% of base salary. Full details of the awards made are included on page 84.
Half of each award is subject to a relative Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") condition whilst the other half of the award is subject 
to the achievement of Earnings Per Share ("EPS") targets. Both performance conditions are measured over performance periods 
which end on 31 December 2018. Details of the performance measures and targets are set out on the next page.
82 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Corporate governance
Remuneration Report
Annual Report on Remuneration
continued 2016 PSP: performance measures
Relative TSR
Growth in TSR will be measured against a comparator group comprising the companies making up the FTSE 350 (excluding 
Investment Trusts and the Company itself). It is measured from 1 January 2016 (using the Company’s one-month average 
immediately prior to 1 January 2016 as the start point) to the end of 2018 (using the Company’s one-month average to 
31 December 2018 as the end point). The Remuneration Committee selected relative TSR as a performance measure as it 
is a key indicator of returns to investors, thereby aligning interests of the Executive Directors with those of shareholders. 
The Remuneration Committee believes that the FTSE 350 is the most appropriate comparator group as it is more reflective of 
market performance than a single market grouping or a comparator group of competitors. Details of the targets for relative 
TSR are set out below:
Ranking % of award which vests
Below median 0%
Median 10%
Between median and upper quartile On a straight line basis between 10% and 50%
Upper quartile or above 50%
EPS
EPS will be measured using adjusted undiluted EPS. The Remuneration Committee selected EPS as a performance measure as 
it is a key internal measure of profitability. Details of the targets for EPS are set out below:
Target % of award which vests
Below 30p 0%
30p 10%
Between 30p and 37p On a straight line basis between 10% and 50%
37p or above 50%
In order to satisfy itself that the vesting of any awards is appropriate, the Remuneration Committee has set additional underpin 
performance conditions which must be met. For both performance measures, the result achieved must appropriately reflect 
the performance of the Company taking into account such factors as the Remuneration Committee considers appropriate; 
and the result achieved must be consistent with the Company’s risk appetite. Additionally, in respect of TSR, the Remuneration 
Committee must be satisfied that the Company’s achieved TSR is reflective of the Company’s underlying financial performance.
PSP: Pre-IPO Awards vesting outcome
The Pre-IPO Awards granted to the Executive Directors at IPO were subject to a performance period which ended on 
31 December 2016. In order to achieve a threshold level of vesting, growth of at least 20% p.a. in absolute TSR was required. 
At the end of the performance period, the Remuneration Committee assessed TSR performance over the performance period 
and determined that the minimum level of performance had not been met. The Pre-IPO Awards therefore lapsed in full.
PSP: Awards to be made in the current year (2017)
In 2017, the Remuneration Committee intends to make PSP awards to Phillip Monks and James Mack with a face value (at the time 
of the award) of 135% of base salary. The awards will be made on the same basis as in 2016.
On that basis, half of the award will be subject to a relative TSR condition with 20% of that part vesting at median versus the 
constituents of the FTSE 350 (excluding Investment Trusts and the Company itself) rising to full vesting of that part for upper 
quartile performance. The other half of the award will again be subject to an EPS scale with 20% of that part vesting at an EPS of 
33p rising to full vesting of that part for an EPS of 41p. In both cases, the same underpins will apply as for the 2016 PSP awards.

2
 Performance was assessed following the end of the performance period and it was determined that the minimum level of performance had not been achieved.
3
 Face value for awards made in 2015 was calculated using the final offer price of the Company’s shares at IPO (192p). For awards made in 2016, the average middle 
market quotation over the three-day period 16-18 March 2016 (227.73p) was used to calculate face value. The relevant price was multiplied by the maximum number of 
shares that would vest if all performance measures and targets were met in full. Actual value at vesting will depend on actual share price at the time of vesting, and any 
dividend equivalents (if any) payable on vested shares.

All-employee share plans
Executive Directors are invited to participate in all-employee share plans on the same basis as other Group employees. 
The purpose of these plans is to encourage share ownership by employees, thereby allowing them to share in the long-
term success of the Group and align their interests with those of shareholders. The plans are operated within the maximum 
participation levels permitted under HMRC regulations from time to time. The Company has established both a Sharesave and a 
Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”). Details of the participation by the Executive Directors in the Sharesave Plan are set out below:

 The percentage change in the CEO’s taxable benefits excludes the one-off write-off of a loan of £108,317 
in 2015. The loan was made originally to settle tax payable in respect of equity incentives awarded to Phillip 
Monks prior to the IPO.

continued Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors’ fees
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are paid a basic fee, whilst the Non-Executive Directors may receive further fees to 
reflect Board Committee or additional responsibilities.
The current fee structure was agreed at the time that the Board was put together in preparation for IPO on the basis of a 
benchmarking exercise against financial services companies of a similar size. The fees are reviewed by the Board (in the case 
of the Non-Executive Directors) and the Remuneration Committee (in the case of the Chairman) on an annual basis. The most 
recent review concluded that, with the exception of the fee paid to the Chair of the Remuneration Committee, the fees remained 
appropriate, and no increases would be made in 2017. With effect from 1 April 2017, the fee paid to the Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee will be brought into line with that paid to the Chairs of the Audit and Risk Committees (£20k p.a.). 
Current fees are set out below:
Non-Executive Directors’ Fees

 The gain on Glyn Jones’ personal investment in certain shares prior to IPO has been included within 2015 remuneration under “Long-term incentives” (calculated 
at the market value of shares held at IPO (£1.92) less the original cost of his personal investment). Such shares were not part of an incentive subject to any form of 
performance hurdles and his only ongoing financial interest in the performance of the Company is as an ordinary shareholder.

Shareholdings
In order to further align the interests of Executive Directors with those of shareholders, the Company has implemented share 
ownership guidelines. The guidelines require the Executive Directors to build up a specified level of shareholding (expressed as a 
percentage of base salary) within five years of the guidelines being implemented (or within five years of appointment, if later). 
The required level of shareholding is 200% of base salary, using the current share price from time to time, for each of the 
Executive Directors. Under the guidelines, the Executive Directors are expected to retain all of the ordinary shares vesting under 
any of the employee share plans, after any disposals for the payment of applicable taxes and any acquisition costs, until they have 
achieved the required level of shareholding. Vested awards not subject to any performance condition (but subject to a holding 
period) count as ownership towards the guidelines after deducting the tax which would be due if the shares were released on that 
date. The guidelines also prohibit the Executive Directors from hedging (or offering as collateral) any shares which are unvested 
or unexercised under any employee share plans, and any shares which count towards meeting the guidelines.
Other shares owned by Executive Directors and their connected persons also count towards the share ownership guidelines. 
Both Executive Directors have met the guideline levels.
Details of the Executive Directors’ beneficial interests (and their connected persons) in the Company’s shares as at 31 December 
2016 are set out below:

There were no payments made during the year to any person who was not a Director of the Company at the time the payment 
was made, but had previously been a Director. There were also no payments for loss of office made during the year.
External appointments
The Company’s policy is that Executive Directors may hold one external non-executive directorship, subject to prior approval by 
the Company. Neither of the Executive Directors hold any external directorships at the current time.
Employee share trust
The Company has established the Aldermore Group PLC Employees’ Share Trust (the “Trust”), a discretionary share trust, for 
the purpose of facilitating the operation of the Company’s share plans. It is the Company’s current intention to satisfy any vested 
share awards by the allotment of new shares to the Trust. 
Dilution
As noted above, the Company intends to issue new shares to satisfy awards outstanding under employee share plans, and will 
implement these arrangements in accordance with the Investment Association Guidelines on dilution. Based on the number 
of awards outstanding as at 31 December 2016, the levels of dilution, which are within the dilution limits set by the Investment 
Association, are as set out in the table below. For the purpose of these calculations, executive awards granted prior to IPO are

Committee effectiveness 
The Remuneration Committee 
undertook a review of its own 
effectiveness through 2016 as part 
of the wider Board and Committee 
evaluation exercise. The review took 
the form of an internal evaluation and 
was conducted principally by way of 
a questionnaire that was issued to all 
Remuneration Committee members.
The review covered various areas 
including the role and remit of the 
Remuneration Committee; the 
effectiveness of the Chair; the 
appropriateness of information 
provided to the Remuneration 
Committee; and the relationship with 
management. The Remuneration 
Committee discussed the outcome of 
the review in 2017. The Remuneration 
Committee confirmed that it operated 
effectively and that there were 
no significant areas for concern. 
Further information about the Board 
and Committee effectiveness process 
is set out on pages 56 and 57.
Remuneration Committee

provision of independent remuneration 
advisory services following a 
competitive tender process. FIT does 
not provide any other services to 
the Group. FIT is a member of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group 
and adheres to its code of conduct. 
The Remuneration Committee reviews 
the effectiveness of its adviser on an 
annual basis, and remains satisfied that 
the advice that it has received from 
FIT during the year has been objective 
and independent. Total fees paid to FIT 
during the year amounted to £126.5k, 
which was charged on its normal terms.

91 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Introduction
For ease of reference, this appendix sets out an extract of our Remuneration Policy, which was approved by shareholders at the 
2016 AGM held on 17 May 2016 and took effect from that date. It is intended that the Remuneration Policy will operate until the 
2019 AGM unless any significant changes are proposed in the interim. No changes are proposed to the Remuneration Policy this 
year, and a shareholder vote on it will not therefore be required at the 2017 AGM.
The full Remuneration Policy, as approved by shareholders, can be found on pages 95 to 103 of the 2015 Annual Report and 
Accounts on the Company’s website at www.investors.aldermore.co.uk
The Remuneration Policy is based on the following key principles:
Aligned to the long-term success of the Group
The remuneration framework is structured to align remuneration, and in particular performance-related remuneration, with the 
long-term interests of shareholders. Incentive plans should be designed such that they do not encourage excessive risk-taking.
Competitive but not excessive
The Group recognises that its long-term success is closely linked to its ability to attract and retain high-calibre individuals who 
can drive the delivery of its business strategy. However, this should be balanced with ensuring that remuneration is appropriate 
to the role, responsibilities, experience and performance of the individual, and is not excessive.
Appropriate and balanced proportion of variable pay
Total remuneration should balance both fixed and variable elements, whilst variable pay should be balanced between both short-
term and long-term incentives with an emphasis on achieving sustainable business results.
Simplicity and transparency in the design and communication
The key to an effective remuneration structure is that the link between incentives and performance is clear, well-communicated 
and easily understood.
To see how the Remuneration Policy was implemented in 2016, please refer to the Annual Report on Remuneration on 
pages 76 to 89.

To attract and

the Group’s strategy
Typically paid monthly in cash and 
reviewed annually
The annual review takes into 
account various factors including:
• corporate and 
individual performance
• any change in an individual’s 
role and responsibilities
• market benchmarking 
• average pay increases 
awarded across the Group as 
a whole
Market benchmarking primarily 
takes into account pan-sector 
companies of a similar market 
capitalisation rather than looking 
at companies solely within 
the financial services sector. 
However, the Remuneration 
Committee may also consider 
more specific data and uses 
all data as a reference point in 
considering, in its judgement, the 
appropriate level of salary
Although an annual review of salaries is 
normally undertaken, the Remuneration 
Committee will not automatically award 
an increase
The Remuneration Committee may 
freeze salaries with consequently larger 
increases as and when an increase is 
awarded
Increases will normally be in line with the 
average increases for staff
The maximum salary increase which the 
Remuneration Committee may award will 
not result in the base salary exceeding 
110% of median data for an equivalent role 
within a comparator group of companies 
(the 20 companies listed on the London 
Stock Exchange above and below the 
Company by market capitalisation)

factors listed
Benefits
To provide market-
competitive benefits 
as part of an overall 
package which 
attracts and retains 
Executive Directors
A range of benefits is provided, 
which includes:
• car allowance
• private medical insurance 
(family cover)
• life assurance
• income protection
• critical illness insurance
Certain costs relating to 
Executive Director relocations 
will be met where appropriate
Benefits will not exceed 15% of an 
Executive Director’s base salary on 
an annual basis (plus a further 100% 
in the case of a Director who has been 
relocated)
As premiums are not taxable as benefits 
in kind, the following caps apply to life 
assurance and income protection:
• life assurance: up to 8 times salary, 
although currently capped at 4 
times salary
• income protection: up to 75% of salary
The value of such benefits is outside of 
the above cap 
The Remuneration Committee will 
monitor the costs in practice and ensure 
that the overall costs do not increase by 
more than it considers appropriate in all 
circumstances

In order to provide a formal cap, the

Annual Incentive 
Plan (‘‘AIP’’)
To motivate 
Executive Directors 
and incentivise 
delivery of 
performance over a 
one-year operating 
cycle, focusing on the 
short- to medium-
term elements of the 
Group’s strategic 
aims 
A proportion of 
the annual bonus 
is deferred, which 
encourages a longer-
term focus and aligns 
the interests of the 
Executive Directors 
with shareholders
A bonus plan which 
operates annually. 
Performance measures are set 
by the Remuneration Committee 
at the start of the financial 
year. Performance targets are 
assessed by the Remuneration 
Committee following the year-
end and the AIP outcome is 
agreed
At least 40% of the AIP outcome 
is deferred into shares under 
the Company’s Deferred Share 
Plan (“DSP”), whilst at least 60% 
of the AIP outcome is deferred 
if total variable remuneration 
exceeds £500,000 p.a.
The balance is normally paid in 
cash
The deferred element is typically 
released in tranches of one-
third on the first, second and 
third anniversaries of the 
award, subject to continued 
employment
Shares within the DSP may 
accrue dividend equivalents 
which may be settled in cash or 
shares (and which are excluded 
from the limit in the next column)
Both the cash and deferred 
elements of the bonus may be 
subject to malus and clawback
The 
maximum 
level of AIP 
outcomes is 
125% of base 
salary p.a.
Performance measures 
applied may be financial or 
non-financial and corporate, 
divisional or individual, and 
in such proportions as the 
Remuneration Committee 
considers appropriate 
The AIP outcome is 
determined by assessing 
each performance measure 
on the following basis:
• attaining the threshold 
level of performance 
produces a nil pay-out
• a sliding scale (not 
necessarily straight-line)
is applied between the 
threshold and maximum 
levels, full pay-out 
being achieved for this 
latter level
• no more than two-thirds 
of maximum is payable for 
on-target performance 
The Remuneration 
Committee must be satisfied 
that the result was achieved 
consistent with the Group’s 
risk appetite
The Remuneration 
Committee retains discretion 
to adjust performance 
measures and targets 
during the year to take 
account of events outside of 
management control which 
were unforeseen when the 
measures and targets were 
originally set
The Remuneration 
Committee retains a 
standard power to apply its 
commercial judgement to 
adjust the outcome of the 
AIP for any performance 
measure (from zero to any 
cap) should it consider that to 
be appropriate
The Remuneration 
Committee reserves the 
right to further modify 
the operation of the AIP to 
comply with developments 
in regulatory requirements 
and market practice 
subject to the overall cap. 
Operation of the AIP and DSP 
will not, in the Remuneration 
Committee’s view, be made 
less onerous. In particular, 
the Remuneration 
Committee may vary the 
deferral terms and settle 
awards in cash, shares and 
other instruments

Remuneration Policy 
continued Recruitment Remuneration Policy – Remuneration Committee discretion
Relocation expenses
For external and internal appointments, certain relocation expenses may be provided and may be paid over more than one financial 
year. As set out in the Remuneration Policy, this may be up to a maximum of 100% of base salary p.a. (over and above the general 
policy on payment of benefits).
AIP
The AIP will operate as detailed in the Remuneration Policy (including the maximum award levels).
In the year of appointment, at the Remuneration Committee’s discretion, the terms of that year’s AIP and the performance 
measures will normally be varied to reflect the part year worked. 
For an internal appointment, any award under the AIP in respect of the individual’s prior role may either continue on its original 
terms or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment as appropriate.
No element of AIP will be guaranteed, unless in the year of joining a guaranteed element is used as part of a buy-out of awards 
forfeited on leaving the previous employer (see below for further detail).
PSP
The PSP will operate as detailed in the Remuneration Policy (including the maximum award levels).
For an internal appointment, in line with the AIP , PSP awards in respect of the individual’s prior role may either continue on its 
original terms or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment as appropriate.
Buy-out awards
For external candidates, it may be necessary to make additional awards in connection with the recruitment to buy out awards 
forfeited by the individual on leaving a previous employer. Although these are not subject to a formal cap, the Group will not pay 
more than is necessary, in the view of the Remuneration Committee, to fairly compensate for awards forfeited on leaving the 
previous employer to join the Group and will in all cases seek to deliver any such awards under the terms of the existing AIP and 
PSP . In some cases however, it may be necessary to make such buy-out awards on different terms to reflect better the structure 
of the awards being bought out.
All buy-outs, whether under the AIP , PSP or otherwise, will take account of the service obligations and performance requirements 
for any remuneration relinquished by the individual when leaving their previous employer. The Remuneration Committee will seek 
to make buy-outs subject to what are, in its opinion, comparable requirements in respect of service and performance. However, 
the Remuneration Committee may choose to relax this requirement in certain cases, for example:
• where the service and/ or performance requirements are materially completed, or 
•  where such factors are, in the Remuneration Committee’s view, reflected in some other way, such as a significant discount to the 
face value of the awards forfeited, or
• where necessary to retain compliance with regulatory requirements, such as CRD IV.
Recruitment Remuneration Policy
Appointment of Executive Directors
The Remuneration Policy balances the need to have appropriate remuneration levels with the ability to attract high-performing 
individuals to the organisation. With this in mind, the starting point for the Remuneration Committee in setting a remuneration 
package for a new Executive Director will be to structure a package in accordance with the Remuneration Policy, based on the 
individual’s knowledge and experience. Consistent with the DRR Regulations, the caps contained within the Remuneration Policy 
for fixed pay do not apply to new recruits, although the Remuneration Committee does not currently envisage exceeding these 
caps in practice.
Notwithstanding the general approach set out above, the Remuneration Committee recognises that, when recruiting externally 
in particular, it may be necessary to compensate an individual to ensure that they are remunerated effectively. The table 
below sets out areas where the Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion in order to achieve this. This may arise 
in particular in relation to bonus and incentive plans given that variable performance-related pay is widely used in the financial 
services industry to incentivise senior management.
Appointment of Non-Executive Directors
A new Non-Executive Director would be recruited on terms in accordance with the approved Remuneration Policy at that time.
97 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Service agreements, payments for loss of office and termination policy 
Executive Directors
The terms under which the Executive Directors are appointed are set out in service agreements with the Company. In line with 
current market practice, the Executive Directors have rolling service agreements, which may be terminated by the Company 
or the individual on 12 months’ notice. The date of each Executive Director’s service agreement is 10 March 2015. Copies of the 
service agreements of the Executive Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office. They will also be 
available for inspection prior to and during the AGM.
Under the service agreements, the Company may make a payment in lieu of notice to an Executive Director. This will be limited to 
the amount of base salary and, potentially, other fixed benefits for the notice period and may be paid in instalments. The Director 
is obliged to seek alternative work during this period and the payments may cease or be reduced if the individual finds an 
alternative role. 
Service agreements may be terminated without notice or payment in lieu of notice under a range of circumstances including 
gross misconduct, fraud or dishonesty, and negligence and incompetence. The agreements do not contain change of 
control provisions.
The Remuneration Committee is opposed to rewarding failure and, when considering a termination, takes account of all of the 
information available to it at the time. This policy applies both to any negotiations linked to notice periods on a termination and any 
treatments which the Remuneration Committee may choose to apply under the discretions available to it under the terms of the 
AIP, DSP and PSP. The potential treatments on termination under these plans are summarised below.
Plan “Approved leaver” (e.g. death, injury 
or disability, redundancy, retirement) 
or otherwise at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee (including on 
resignation) 
“Unapproved leaver” 
(e.g. resignation)

by the 
Company for 
misconduct
Other exceptional cases (e.g.

Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors (including the Chairman) are appointed pursuant to letters of appointment, which set out the terms 
of their appointment. The appointment is subject to termination by the Company at any time with three months’ written notice. 
Directors are requested, but not obliged, to give three months’ notice. The letters do not provide for compensation for loss of 
office. All Non-Executive Directors are subject to annual re-election by shareholders at the AGM, however should the Director 
not be re-elected by shareholders their appointment will cease immediately and without compensation.
Copies of the letters of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s registered 
office. They will also be available for inspection prior to and during the AGM.

Going concern The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, 
as the Directors are satisfied that the Group has the resources to 
continue in business for the foreseeable future (which has been 
taken as 12 months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements). In making this assessment, the Directors have 
considered a wide range of information relating to present and 
future conditions, including the current state of the balance 
sheet, future projections of profitability, cash flows and capital 
resources, and the longer term strategy of the business. The  
Group’s capital and liquidity plans, including stress tests, have 
been reviewed by the Directors. The Group’s forecasts and 
projections show that it will be able to operate at adequate levels 
of both liquidity and capital for the foreseeable future, including 
under a range of stressed scenarios. After making due enquiries, 
the Directors believe that the Group has sufficient resources to 
continue its activities for the foreseeable future and to continue 
its expansion, and the Group has sufficient capital to enable it to 
continue to meet its regulatory capital requirements as set out by 
the Prudential Regulation Authority.

continued Emissions reporting
Greenhouse gas emissions 
The Group’s greenhouse gas (“GHG”) 
emissions for 2016 were 525 tonnes 
of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO
2 e) 
equating to 0.59 tCO 2 e per employee. 
In 2016, the Group established an 
energy baseline against which it can 
report in future years.
GHG emissions for the Group have 
been collated and calculated for all 
UK operations where the Group is 
responsible for the combustion of fuel 
or energy used in the operation of 
facilities occupied by the Group. 
Reporting period 
The reporting period for emissions 
corresponds with the Group’s financial 
reporting period.
GHG scope of disclosure and 
omissions
GHG emissions disclosure will be limited 
to Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions only 
as data was not readily available for 
Scope 3 emissions. Scope 1 includes fuel 
emissions from buildings and company 
vehicles and Scope 2 includes our 
emissions from electricity. Disclosure of 
Scope 3 emissions is voluntary under 
the regulations. 
Heat and electricity supplied by 
landlords to premises occupied by the 
Group, where the heat or electricity 
is not separately reported or charged 
outside of the general building 
service charge, has not been included 
in this year’s report due to lack of 
data. Methods to obtain this data or 
reliable methods for estimation will be 
investigated and if suitably accurate 
data can be obtained, this will be 
included in future year’s reports. 
GHG data integrity and 
calculation method
The data included in this report has 
been taken from multiple sources, 
namely: utility billed data, existing 
internal calculations, existing external 
calculations from landlords, and 
expense claims in relation to transport 
usage. It has not been possible to obtain 
some data for the reporting period. 
Where this is the case, data has been 
estimated either by using data from an 
earlier period or extrapolating existing 
data. Fuel consumption from vehicles 
for business travel was estimated from 
expense claim costs.
Conversion factors used in this 
report have been taken from the 
Department for Business, Energy and 
Industrial Strategy’s "Greenhouse Gas 
Conversion Factor Repository" and 
the report has been compiled in line 
with the Department for Environment, 
Food & Rural Affairs’ "Environmental 
Reporting Guidelines: Including 
mandatory greenhouse gas emissions 
reporting guidance".
GHG reduction plan
The Group is committed to reducing 
GHG emissions. The opportunities 
for energy savings identified through 
the Group’s ESOS (Energy Saving 
Opportunity Scheme) assessment, 
completed in January 2016, are 
being progressed and implemented 
as appropriate.
GHG data verification
All data used for GHG emissions 
reporting was compiled and calculated 
by JRP Solutions Ltd, an independent 
energy specialist.

Principal risks   112
Effective risk management plays a key 
role in the execution of the Group’s 
strategy of supporting UK SMEs, 
homeowners, buy-to-let investors 
and savers. Risk taking is an inherent 
part of banking and, within an effective 
risk management framework, we 
aim to generate strong sustainable 
returns for shareholders. The Board 
and senior management seek to ensure 
that the risks the Group are taking are 
clearly identified, managed, monitored 
and reported and that the Group’s 
resources are capable of withstanding 
both expected and unexpected levels of 
risk performance.
The Risk Overview on pages 32 to 
35 provides a summary of the risk 
management framework within the 
Group. It highlights the principal risks 
we face, together with emerging risks 
and the mitigating actions we are 
taking to address these challenges. 
This detailed Risk Management Section 
provides additional information on 
our approach to risk, the associated 
governance framework, stress testing 
and provides a fuller analysis of the 
principal risks. 
 
Risk Strategy
We have clearly defined our risk 
management objectives and have 
a strategy to deliver them. Our risk 
management strategy is to:
• Identify our principal and 
emerging risks
• Define our risk appetite and ensure 
that the business plans are consistent 
with it
• Ensure that the risk appetite and 
business plans are supported by 
effective risk controls, technology, 
and people capabilities
• Manage the risk profile to ensure that 
the business strategy can withstand 
a range of adverse conditions 
identified in stress testing
• Ensure a sound risk control 
environment and risk-aware culture
• Manage risk within the business units 
with effective independent oversight
• Construct our compensation 
practices to ensure only prudent 
risk taking, within our risk appetite, 
is rewarded.

The Group’s approach to risk Risk Management Framework
The Risk Management Framework (“RMF”) refers to the process of identifying, managing, monitoring and reporting the risks 
to which the Group is exposed. The RMF is supported by supplemental frameworks, policies, processes and procedures. 
These combine to ensure that our risks are managed in a manner which is appropriate to the size and nature of the Group’s 
operations. They are aligned to regulatory requirements and reflect industry practice, as outlined below. The Group will 
continue to develop and increase its range of products to better serve its customers and so grow the business sustainably in a 
controlled manner within the overall RMF.

The Group’s approach to risk  
continued Risk Appetite Framework
The Risk Appetite Framework (“RAF”) 
is the overarching framework through 
which we set individual risk appetites 
for each principal risk. It sets out how 
we monitor performance against the 
risk appetites. 
The RAF includes the following  
components:
• Overarching Risk Appetite Statement 
– this is the primary statement 
outlining our approach to risk taking 
linked to the pursuit of our business 
strategy. This is: 
“To run a sustainable, safe and sound 
business that conducts its activities 
in a prudent and reputable manner, 
taking into account the interest of 
its customers and also ensuring that 
our obligations to key stakeholders 
are met.”
• Key risk appetite statements – the 
articulation of the type and level 
of specific risks (derived from the 
principal risks) that we are willing to 
accept or tolerate
• Risk capacity – the maximum level of 
risk we can assume before breaching 
constraints determined by regulatory 
capital or liquidity needs
• Risk metrics, limits and tolerances – 
quantitative or qualitative measures 
that allocate our aggregate risk 
appetite statements to individual 
business activities
• Risk profile – the point in time 
assessment of our risk exposures 
Risk Appetite Statement
The Group’s overarching Risk Appetite 
Statement, and detailed individual 
metrics define the amount and nature 
of risk the Group is willing to accept or 
tolerate in pursuit of its strategy and 
business objectives. The Board sets the 
overall risk appetite of the Group, which 
is expressed in detail through Principal 
Risk Appetite Statements, individual 
metrics and associated limits which are 
reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
In articulating its risk appetite, the 
Group has taken into consideration 
the expectations of its stakeholders, 
the need for regulatory compliance 
at all times, the preservation of our 
franchise and reputation and our 
desire for controlled and sustainable 
profit growth.
Risk culture
The Board ensures that the Group 
actively embraces a strong 
risk culture where all staff are 
accountable for the risks that they 
take. Senior management leads 
in implementing the risk appetite 
and ensuring that the RMF is fully 
embedded with a strong focus on the 
adherence to risk appetite which is 
monitored through reporting metrics. 
Staff performance management and 
reward practices all have key risk 
inputs, and a focus on risk management 
in their design.

Information and Reporting
Oversight and Monitoring
The business strategy provides the context within which the Group outlines its 
business objectives and establishes its risk management framework. The risk strategy 
is developed to support the business objectives. Together, the business and risk 
strategies guide the development of the overarching risk appetite statement.
The overarching risk appetite statement sets the tone for risk management 
at the Group. It provides a framework to develop and cascade the 
Group’s risk culture and to establish risk policies, controls, and limits in a 
consistent manner.
The overarching risk appetite statement is supported by 
individual risk appetite statements for all principal risks.
Risk appetite statements are supported by a range  
of meaningful and measurable metrics. These metrics 
can be quantitative or qualitative in nature and are 
subject to triggers, tolerances and limits.
Risk Appetite Framework
109 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices The Board, often via sub-committees, 
has responsibility for setting the overall 
Risk Appetite, understanding the 
principal risks taken by the Group and 
setting acceptable limits for these risks 
utilising the Risk Appetite Framework. 
As part of this responsibility, the Board 
reviews and approves the business 
strategies, principal risk statements, 
supporting frameworks and certain 
Group policies. The Board is ultimately 
responsible for ensuring that an 
adequate and effective system of 
internal controls is maintained and 
regularly reviewed. The Board Risk 
Committee and Board Audit Committee 
are the main oversight committees in 
this regard.
Three lines of defence 
The governance framework adheres 
to a ‘three lines of defence’ model 
to ensure a clear delineation of 
responsibilities between control over 
day-to-day operations, risk oversight 
and independent assurance of 
our activities. 
All three lines of defence are 
responsible for supporting and 
developing a culture of risk-awareness 
and for supporting each other to 
manage risk effectively for the 
Group. In this way, risk management 
responsibilities are understood at all 
levels, ownership and accountability 
are clear, and control and oversight is 
maintained throughout the Group. 
First line of defence – 
Business lines and central 
functions
The business lines and central functions 
accept or tolerate risks with the aim of 
delivering value for the Group. The first 
line of defence is accountable for the 
controls we have in place to manage 
day-to-day operations. They manage 
risks within the business and functions 
to pre-agreed tolerances or limits. 
They identify, manage and monitor 
risks through regular reporting and by 
escalating issues as necessary.
Second line of defence – 
Risk functions 
The second line of defence 
encompasses the risk management 
functions, which are independent of 
the businesses and central functions. 
The second line supports a structured 
approach to risk management by 
maintaining and implementing the 
RMF, supplemental frameworks and 
Group-wide risk policies. The second 
line monitor the execution and ongoing 
self-assurance testing by the first line 
of defence. It also provides independent 
oversight and guidance on risks 
relevant to our strategy and activities, 
maintains an aggregate view of risk, 
and monitors performance in relation 
to our risk appetite.
Third line of defence – 
Internal Audit
Internal Audit provides independent 
assurance to the Board via the 
Audit Committee that the first 
and second lines of defence are 
both effective in discharging their 
respective responsibilities. 
The Group has continued to invest in all 
three lines of defence to enhance the 
controls around principal risks.

Risk management
Risk governance and oversight Stress testing is an important risk 
management tool, with specific 
approaches documented for the 
Group’s key annual assessments 
including the Internal Capital Adequacy 
Assessment Process (“ICAAP”), 
Individual Liquidity Adequacy 
Assessment Process (“ILAAP”), the 
Recovery and Resolution Plan (“RRP”) 
and Reverse Stress Testing (“RST”). 
We maintain a Stress Testing 
Framework (“STF”) which is updated 
on an annual basis, or more frequently 
if required, to assist the Board’s 
understanding of the key risks, 
scenarios and sensitivities that may 
adversely impact our financial or 
operational position. These support the 
development of risk appetite, business 
and capital plans by:
• Testing our ability to withstand the 
emergence of risks in both ‘normal’ 
and ‘stressed’ conditions
• Assessing the adequacy of our 
financial resources (both capital 
and liquidity) and the potential 
management actions available 
to mitigate the effect of any 
adverse events
• Identifying potential gaps in our 
Risk Management Framework such 
as potential weaknesses in the 
operational controls maintained by 
the Group
The STF relies upon and supports the 
Capital Planning and Management 
policy, the Funding and Liquidity policy 
and the Operational and Credit Risk 
Frameworks, all of which provide detail 
of how the STF has been implemented 
within these specific areas.
Stress testing is an integral part of the 
Group’s ICAAP assessment. The stress 
scenarios developed as part of the 
ICAAP are used to size and carry a 
stress loss buffer which ensures 
that the Group is able to withstand a 
range of adverse economic scenarios 
over its five year planning horizon. 
The ICAAP incorporates all principal 
risks impacting capital and is the result 
of active cooperation across Finance 
(including Treasury), Business areas 
and Risk functions. The Chief Financial 
Officer (“CFO”) is accountable for the 
Group’s ICAAP. 
The ILAAP is an assessment of our 
liquidity position under normal and 
stressed conditions and is used to 
inform the Board of the ongoing 
assessment and quantification of 
liquidity risk and the manner in which it 
is managed, monitored, controlled and 
mitigated. The CFO is accountable for 
the Group’s ILAAP.
The RRP provides an assessment of 
our ability to recover financial strength 
following or during a period of severe 
stress through a formal assessment 
of available recovery options. The RRP 
specifies the process and governance 
for invoking the Recovery Plan and 
enabling the selected options to be 
activated and mobilised quickly and 
effectively. The RRP also provides 
regulatory authorities with information 
and analysis to enable them to carry 
out an orderly resolution if required. 
The Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”) is 
accountable for the Group’s RRP.
We perform RST to identify and 
assess events that could cause our 
business model to become unviable. 
The outcome of failure is assumed as a 
starting point and we work backwards 
to determine the type and sequence 
of events and vulnerabilities that could 
lead to the hypothetical failure of the 
business. The key objective of RST is to 
enable the early identification of events 
that could cause our business plan to 
become unviable and to assess the 
likelihood of such events crystallising. 
Where those tests reveal a risk of 
business failure that is unacceptably 
high, when considered against our risk 
appetite, we will take action to prevent 
or mitigate that risk. 
Stress testing governance
The Board is responsible for reviewing 
and approving the STF, scenarios 
for each type of stress testing 
and results of the stress testing 
analysis on at least an annual basis. 
The Board Risk Committee (‘”BRC”) 
is responsible for reviewing the STF 
annually. The scenarios for each type 
of stress test and results of the stress 
testing analysis are reviewed and 
recommended at the Asset and Liability 
Committee (“ALCO”) and Executive 
Risk Committee (“ERC”). The BRC 
makes recommendations to the Board 
for approval of the scenarios to support 
the ICAAP, ILAAP and RRP. As the 
senior risk committee, BRC provides 
independent review and challenge 
to stress scenarios, underlying 
assumptions and adequacy of proposed 
management actions, prior to their 
recommendation to the Board.
The primary executive responsible for 
the STF is the CRO who is responsible 
for ensuring the development and 
implementation of a robust STF 
and overseeing its implementation. 
The CRO is also responsible for ensuring 
that the STF is fit for purpose and 
adheres to all regulatory requirements 
and industry good practices. 
Participants from all business units 
functions and second line risk are 
responsible for providing inputs for the 
development of scenarios, underlying 
assumptions and relevant management 
actions. These areas coordinate with 
the CRO and CFO to provide relevant 
data for stress testing.

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial 
loss arising from the borrower or a 
counterparty failing to meet their 
financial obligations to the Group in 
accordance with agreed terms.
The risk arises primarily from our 
lending activities as a result of a 
defaulting mortgage, lease or loan 
contracts. Although credit risk arises 
from our loan book, it can also arise 
from treasury investments and off-
balance sheet activities.
Credit risk appetite – loan book
The credit risk appetites are set based 
on expected levels of loss, credit risk 
concentration, portfolio composition 
and performance characteristics. 
We set an overall credit risk appetite 
for our lending activities, supported by 
specific business line level appetites. 
Expected losses are factored into the 
budgeting and forecasting process and 
reflect our expected view of lending 
performance, taking into account 
recent performance data and the 
prevailing economic environment.
We recognise that actual losses 
may differ from forecasted or 
budgeted values. 
Exposure
The table above presents our maximum 
exposure to credit risk of financial 
instruments on the balance sheet and 
commitments to lend before taking into 
account any collateral held or other credit 
enhancements. The maximum exposure 
to credit risk for loans, debt securities, 
derivatives and other on balance sheet 
financial instruments is the carrying 
amount and for loan commitments the 
full amount of any commitment to lend 
that is irrevocable or is revocable only in 
response to material adverse change. 
Mitigation
We target UK SMEs, homeowners, and 
buy-to-let customers. Credit risk is 
managed in accordance with lending 
policies, the risk appetite and the RMF . 
Lending policies and performance 
against risk appetites are reviewed 
regularly. We seek to mitigate credit risk 
by focusing on business sectors where 
we have specific expertise and through 
limiting concentrated exposures on 
larger loans, certain sectors and other 
factors which can represent higher risk. 
We also seek to obtain security cover , 
and where appropriate, guarantees 
from borrowers. Affordability checks on 
income versus outgoings are also made 
where appropriate to assess a borrower’s 
capacity to meet the servicing costs.
Credit risks associated with lending 
are managed through the Credit Risk 
Management Framework, which 
includes the use of detailed lending 
policies which outline the approach to 
lending, underwriting criteria, credit 
mandates, concentration limits and 
product terms. We maintain a dynamic 
approach to credit management 
and aim to take necessary steps if 
individual issues are identified or if 
credit performance deteriorates, 
or is expected to deteriorate, due 
to borrower, economic or sector-
specific weaknesses.
Credit risk is assessed through a 
combination of due diligence, reviewing 
credit reference agency reports, 
reviewing financial information, credit 
scores and the expert opinion of our 
underwriters. A proportionate approach 
is taken, ensuring that the highest 
risk loans and facilities are subject 
to detailed review by experienced 
senior underwriters. 
This section provides further detail on the 
specific areas where we are exposed to 
credit risk.

113 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Credit risk portfolio
The following Section provides 
analysis of our credit risk portfolio as 
at 31 December 2016. The analysis is 
segmented between credit risk on loans 
and advances to customers and credit 
risk on treasury assets. Details of the 
methodologies and estimates used 
to determine the allowances for loan 
impairments are provided in Note 3.
Forbearance
Forbearance is defined as any 
concessionary arrangement that is 
made for a period of three months 
or more where financial difficulty is 
present or imminent. It is inevitable that 
some borrowers experience financial 
difficulties which impact their ability 
to meet mortgage or SME finance 
obligations as per the contractual 
terms. We seek to identify borrowers 
who are experiencing financial 
difficulties, as well as contacting 
borrowers whose loans have gone 
into arrears, consulting with them in 
order to ascertain the reason for the 
difficulties and to establish the best 
course of action to bring the account up 
to date. In certain circumstances, where 
the borrower is experiencing financial 
distress, we may use forbearance 
measures to assist the borrower. 
These are considered on a case-by-
case basis and must result in a fair 
outcome. The forbearance measures 
are undertaken in order to achieve the 
best outcome for both the customer 
and the Group by dealing with financial 
difficulties and arrears at an early stage. 
The most widely used methods of 
forbearance are temporarily reduced 
monthly payments, loan term 
extension, deferral of payment and 
a temporary or permanent transfer 
to interest only payments to reduce 
the borrower’s financial pressures. 
Where the arrangement is temporary, 
borrowers are expected to resume 
normal payments within six months. 
Both temporary and permanent 
concessions are reported as forborne 
for twenty four months following the 
end of the concession. In all cases, the 
above definitions are subject to no 
further concessions being made and 
the customers’ compliance with the 
new terms. 
See page 122 for an analysis of 
forbearance measures in place as at 
31 December 2016.
The analysis in this Section of the report 
excludes the Property Development 
portfolio from a number of tables 
where it is not relevant (marked with a 
footnote). Gross property development 
exposure at 31 December 2016 was 
£230m (31 December 2015: £184m), 
and net exposure was £229m 
(31 December 2015: £179m). 
Credit risk on loans and advances to

115 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices a) Risk grading methodology
The categorisation of high, medium and 
low risk is based on internal grading 
models utilised in portfolio monitoring. 
The grading models are used to 
generate a consistent Group-wide 
approach for the grading of customer 
credit risk exposures for all lending 
businesses, and provide a relative 
internal ranking of risk. Drivers for 
the grade mapping include external 
credit reference agency risk scores, 
property valuations and qualitative 
factors. The relative measure of risk 
reflects a combined assessment of the 
probability of default by the customer 
and an assessment of the expected loss 
in the event of default. 
The resulting classification of balances 
between low, medium and high is 
consequently driven by a combination 
of the Probability of Default (“PD”) 
and Loss Given Default (“LGD”) grades 
as further explained. A matrix of 
eighteen PD (fifteen of which apply 
to up to date accounts) and ten LGD 
grades determine the category 
within which each loan is categorised, 
i.e. those accounts that have a low 
PD and/or LGD are graded as ‘low’. 
Those graded ‘high’ will be accounts 
that have either a high PD and/or 
high LGD. 
• Probability of Default refers to 
the probability of a customer or 
counterparty defaulting within the 
next 12 months which is typically 
taken as three payments past due. 
A default probability model predicts 
this probability by using credit scores 
along with financial, behavioural and 
qualitative inputs. 
• Key components of the Loss Given 
Default are the propensity to “cure”, 
that is the likelihood/propensity for a 
defaulting account to be restored to 
a performing status, and the level of 
security held in relation to the credit 
exposure. The level of security varies, 
ranging from a small number of very 
short term unsecured loans in the 
Asset Finance business, to highly 
secured loans on residential property 
within the Residential Mortgage 
business. The valuation method for 
assets is specific to the nature of the 
collateral and includes indexation for 
property valuations.
b) Fair value of collateral 
methodology
For SME Commercial Mortgage, 
Buy-to-Let and Residential Mortgage 
agreements, the fair value of underlying 
collateral is calculated based on the 
indexed valuation of the property 
on which the mortgage is secured. 
Where the indexed valuation is greater 
than the balance outstanding, the fair 
value of the collateral is capped to the 
value of the outstanding balance. 
For Asset Finance agreements, the 
estimated fair value of the collateral 
is calculated by applying LGDs on a 
case by case basis. The LGD against 
each loan is deducted from the balance 
outstanding to derive a proxy for fair 
value. As the fair value is derived using 
LGDs, the fair value calculated includes 
an element of prudence as the LGD is 
based on non-performing loan data.

Property Development 
We use ‘loan to gross development value’ as an indicator of the quality of credit security of performing loans for the Property 
Development portfolio. Loan to gross development value is a measure used to monitor the loan balance drawn compared against the 
expected gross development value once the development is complete. A verage loan to gross development value at origination for 
Property Development loans at 31 December 2016 was 58.05% (31 December 2015: 56.97%).

Lending at higher LTV bandings is largely as a result of the Group’s participation in the Help to Buy Scheme, with in excess of 90% 
of the portfolio having an associated government guarantee on amounts where the Loan to Value is above 85%. This reduces the 
Group’s risk exposure. As at 31 December 2016, 96.15% of the exposures with Loan to Value in excess of 85% relate to the Help 
to Buy Scheme (31 December 2015: 89.16%). The Help to Buy guarantee portfolio, which makes up the majority of the Help to Buy 
book, had an average indexed Loan to Value of 87.47% (31 December 2015: 90.68%). As at 31 December 2016, the average indexed 
Loan to Value of the non-Help to Buy owner occupied book is 61.65% (31 December 2015: 64.14%). 
119 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Invoice Finance 
In respect of Invoice Finance, collateral is provided by the underlying receivables (e.g. trade invoices). As at 31 December 2016, 
the average advance rate against the fair value of sales ledger balances which have been assigned to the Group, net of amounts 
considered to be irrecoverable, is 62.30% (31 December 2015: 64.99%).
In addition to the value of the underlying sales ledger balances, we will wherever possible, obtain additional collateral before 
offering invoice finance facilities to a client. These may include limited personal guarantees from major shareholders, charges 
over personal and other business property, cross guarantees from associated companies and unlimited warranties in the case of 
frauds or certain other breaches. These additional forms of security are impractical to value given their nature.
Asset Finance
In respect of Asset Finance, collateral is provided by our rights and/ or title to the underlying assets, which we are able to repossess in the 
event of default. Where appropriate, we will also obtain additional security, such as parent company or personal guarantees. 
Asset Finance also undertakes a small volume of unsecured lending where we have obtained an understanding of the ability of the 
borrower’s business to generate cash flows to service and repay the facilities provided. As at 31 December 2016, the total amount of such 
unsecured lending was £40.7m (31 December 2015: £30.3m).

Credit risk exists with treasury 
assets where we have acquired 
securities or placed cash deposits 
with other financial institutions. 
The credit risk of treasury assets 
is considered to be relatively low. 
Certain treasury assets are held as 
part of our liquidity buffer.
Credit risk appetite – treasury 
assets
The Group’s appetite for credit 
risk on treasury assets is minimal. 
Cash and financial assets are invested 
in investment grade rated entities 
or investment vehicles. No assets 
are held for speculative purposes or 
actively traded.

Cash placements
Credit risk of Group and treasury counterparties is controlled through the treasury credit risk policy which limits the maximum 
exposure by entity with which the Group can place cash deposits. All institutions need to be rated at investment grade at the time 
of placement.
High quality liquid assets included in the liquidity buffer
As part of the liquidity buffer, we hold certain debt securities which qualify as high quality liquid assets included in the liquidity 
buffer. These instruments are AAA to AA rated. The portfolio includes UK Gilts, supranational bonds, sovereign risk bonds issued 
by European governments and agencies and corporate bonds. 
Asset-backed securities (“ABS”)
We have a portfolio of ABS. The majority of these investments are in AAA or AA+ to AA- rated bonds secured on UK originated 
assets. All investments are in Sterling; no foreign currency bonds were bought. The portfolio has credit enhancement, providing 
principal protection against losses.
Derivatives
Credit risk on derivatives is controlled through a policy of only entering into contracts with a small number of UK credit 
institutions, with an investment grade credit rating. Most derivative contracts are collateralised through the receipt/payment of 
daily cash margin calls to cover the mark to market value of the asset/liability.
Offsetting financial assets and liabilities
It is our policy to enter into master netting and margining agreements with all derivative counterparties. In general, under 
master netting agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty that are due on a single day in respect of all transactions 
outstanding in the same currency under the agreement are aggregated into a single net amount being payable by one party to 
the other. In certain circumstances, for example when a credit event such as a default occurs, all outstanding transactions under 
the agreement are terminated.
Under the margining agreements where we have a net asset position with a counterparty valued at current market values, in 
respect of derivatives, then that counterparty will place collateral, usually cash, with us in order to cover the position. Similarly, 
we will place collateral, usually cash, with the counterparty where it has a net liability position. 
As our derivatives are under master netting and margining agreements as described, they do not meet the criteria for offsetting 
in the statement of financial position.
The following tables detail amounts of financial assets and liabilities subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting agreements 
and similar arrangements including the Funding for Lending Scheme, and the Term Funding Scheme as detailed in Notes 22.

Risk management
Principal risks
continued Capital and Liquidity risk
Capital risk is the risk that the 
Group has insufficient capital to 
cover regulatory requirements 
and/or to support its growth plans.
Liquidity risk is the risk that we 
are not able to meet our financial 
obligations as they fall due, or can 
do so only at excessive cost.
Capital Risk
Capital risk appetite
We aim to maintain a strong capital 
position in line with the capital risk 
appetite established by the Board. 
Our capital risk appetite reflects the 
desire to optimise the capital structure 
of the Group and efficiently utilise its 
capital resources in order to generate 
appropriate returns for shareholders. 
The Group’s capital risk appetite is set 
to ensure that the Group:
• Meets minimum regulatory capital 
requirements at all times;
• Is able to achieve our strategic 
objectives including business 
growth plans;
• Is able to withstand an adverse stress 
scenario and continue to meet our 
Individual Capital Guidance (“ICG”); 
and
• Provides assurance of the 
Group’s resilience to depositors, 
customers, shareholders and other 
key stakeholders.
Capital Requirements 
We operate under the CRD IV CRR 
regulatory framework which came 
into force on 1 January 2014 and was 
implemented in the UK by the Prudential 
Regulation Authority (“PRA”). 
Under CRD IV, the Group is subject to 
capital requirements under both Pillar 
1 (minimum capital requirements) and 
Pillar 2 (Supervisory Review). 
Pillar 1 requirements
Pillar 1 capital requirements are based 
on prescribed risk calculations in line 
with Capital Requirements Regulation 
(“CRR”), EBA Single Rulebook and 
relevant PRA regulations. Under this 
framework, we hold Pillar 1 capital for 
credit risk, operational risk, market 
risk and Credit Valuation Adjustments 
(“CVA”). We calculate our credit and 
market risk Pillar 1 requirements 
using the standardised approaches. 
The operational risk Pillar 1 requirement 
is calculated under the Basic Indicator 
Approach (“BIA”).
Under CRD IV, we must hold total 
capital equal to a minimum of 8% 
of our total risk weighted assets to 
cover our Pillar 1 capital requirements. 
The 8% total capital minimum includes a 
minimum common equity tier 1 (“CET1”) 
requirement of 4.5% of RWAs and a 
minimum Tier 1 requirement of 6% 
of RWAs. 
CRD IV buffers
CRD IV introduced a number of new 
capital buffers to provide further 
capital cushions for additional risks that 
financial institutions may be subject 
to. For the Group, the combined buffer, 
which has to be met with CET1 capital, is 
comprised of the counter-cyclical capital 
buffer and the capital conservation 
buffer. The capital conservation buffer 
phase in commenced on 1 January 2016 
when it was set at 0.625%, increasing 
to 1.3% on 1 January 2017. The 2.5% 
requirement will be fully phased in 
by January 2019. The countercyclical 
buffer in the UK is set by the Financial 
Policy Committee (“FPC”) and reviewed 
on a quarterly basis. It is currently set at 
zero, and is expected to remain at this 
level at least until June 2017. The FPC 
has indicated that it envisages a 1% 
steady state countercyclical buffer 
for the UK in the future depending on 
economic conditions. 
In addition to the CRD IV combined 
buffer, the Group is also subject to the 
PRA Buffer as applied as part of the Pillar 
2 framework and discussed below. 
Application of the Pillar 2 Framework 
We have an established Internal 
Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process (“ICAAP”) which is conducted 
in accordance with CRD IV and PRA 
requirements. The ICAAP represents 
the aggregated view of the risks faced 
by the Group. It is used by the Board and 
management to understand the level 
of capital required over the planning 
horizon to cover these risks that are 
not covered or not adequately covered 
by the minimum regulatory capital 
requirement set out under Pillar 1, and 
also to withstand a range of adverse 
stress scenarios. 
Key risks assessed under Pillar 2 include 
credit risk, credit concentration risk, 
operational risk and interest rate risk in 
the banking book.
Following a review of our ICAAP 
assessment, through its Supervisory 
Review and Evaluation Process 
(“SREP”), the PRA sets an ICG, which 
supersedes Pillar 1 requirements 
and establishes the minimum level of 
regulatory capital we must maintain at 
all times. The ICG has to be met with the 
same quality of capital as Pillar 1. 
We also conduct capital stress testing 
and scenario analysis as part of our 
ICAAP assessment. We use the stress 
scenarios to size and carry a stress 
loss buffer which ensures we are able 
to withstand an adverse economic 
downturn over a five-year planning 
horizon. In addition, we identify 
management actions that could be taken 
to mitigate the impact of the stress on 
the capital position. These are aligned 
with our Recovery and Resolution Plan, 
which describes actions that can be 
taken to preserve capital if the stress 
scenario is more extreme than expected. 
127 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices The stress testing conducted in our 
ICAAP forms the basis for the PRA 
buffer assessment. Following their 
review, the PRA sets a PRA buffer, 
which in combination with the CRD 
IV combined buffer is held to ensure 
we can withstand an adverse market 
stress. The combination of the PRA 
buffer and the CRD IV combined buffer 
replaced the Capital Planning Buffer 
(“CPB”) with effect from 1 January 2016. 
The PRA buffer has to be met fully with 
CET1 capital by 1 January 2019, subject 
to a phase-in from 1 January 2016, 
which is aligned with the phase in of the 
conservation buffer. 
Throughout the year, our capital 
resources remained in excess of the 
minimum requirements determined 
by the ICG, CRD IV buffers and the 
PRA buffers.
Leverage ratio framework
Alongside the risk based capital 
framework, we actively monitor our 
leverage ratio. The leverage ratio at 
31 December 2016 is 7 .0%
1
 (31 December 
2015: 7.2%
1
), calculated in accordance with 
CRD IV . At present, we are not captured 
under the FPC’s leverage ratio framework. 
However , leverage will become a binding 
requirement in 2018 as outlined in CRR, 
albeit the Group comfortably meets the 
new requirements.
Further details of our capital 
requirements and resources are provided 
in the annual Pillar III disclosures which are 
available on our investor relations website: 
www.investors.aldermore.co.uk.
Mitigation and monitoring
Our Capital Planning and Management 
policy establishes a framework for 
maintaining our current and prospective 
capital at an appropriate level under 
various scenarios. The policy describes 
the process for establishing the Group’s 
capital risk appetite is approved by the 
Board and reviewed on an annual basis 
or more frequently if required.
We monitor current and forecast levels 
of capital against the capital risk appetite 
approved by the Board and report the 
capital position to ALCO, the Executive 
Risk Committee, Board Risk Committee 
and the Board on a regular basis. 
The capital forecast forms an integral 
component of the annual budgeting 
process and is updated in line with 
changes to our business plan. The capital 
forecast incorporates the impact of 
known forthcoming regulatory changes 
to ensure we are well positioned to meet 
them when implemented. 
Analysis of capital risk
We operated in line with our capital risk 
appetite as set by the Board and above 
our regulatory capital requirements 
throughout the years ended 31 December 
2016 and 31 December 2015. 
As at 31 December 2016, our capital base 
was made up of £525.8m (31 December 
2015: £435.6m) of Common Equity 
Tier 1 capital and £74.0m (31 December 
2015: £74.0m) of Additional Tier 1 capital 
and £113.1m (31 December 2015: £48.6m) 
Tier 2 capital. Common Equity Tier 1 
capital consisted of fully issued ordinary 
shares, satisfying all the criteria for 
a Tier 1 instrument as outlined in the 
CRR and audited/verified reserves. 
Additional Tier 1 capital was issued in 
December 2014. Tier 2 capital relates 
to issued subordinated loan notes and 
collective impairment allowances.

129 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk appetite
The Board has set a liquidity risk 
appetite which aims to ensure that a 
prudent level of liquidity is held to cover 
an unexpected liquidity outflow such 
that we will be able to continue to meet 
our financial commitments during an 
extended period of stress. Additionally, 
reputational risks are managed through 
holding liquidity to meet pipeline 
commitments expected to complete 
during a three month period.
Based on the business model of 
funding primarily via retail and SME 
deposits, the Board has set a liquidity 
risk appetite which it considers to 
be appropriate to provide it with the 
assurance that the relevant liquidity 
risk drivers are considered and 
prudently stressed, and that we are 
able to meet liabilities beyond the 
targeted survival period.
Exposures
Liquidity risk exposure represents 
the amount of potential stressed 
outflows in any future period less 
expected inflows. Liquidity is 
considered from both an internal and a 
regulatory perspective.
Mitigation
To protect the Group and its depositors 
against liquidity risks, we maintain 
a liquidity buffer which is based on 
our liquidity needs under stressed 
conditions. The liquidity buffer is 
monitored on a daily basis to ensure 
there are sufficient liquid assets at all 
times to cover cash flow movements, 
fluctuations in funding, enabling us to 
meet all financial obligations and to 
support anticipated asset growth. 
Contingency funding plan
As a regulated firm, we are required to 
maintain a Contingency Funding Plan 
(“CFP”). The plan (which is now part 
of our Recovery and Resolution Plan 
(“RRP”)) involves a two stage process, 
covering preventative measures and 
corrective measures to be invoked 
when there is a potential risk to our 
liquidity or capital position. The CFP/
RRP provides a plan for managing 
a liquidity or capital situation or 
crisis within the Group caused by 
internal events, external events or a 
combination thereof. The plan outlines 
what actions we could take to ensure 
we comply with the liquidity adequacy 
rules, maintain sufficient capital and 
operate within our risk appetite and 
limits as set and approved by the Board.
Analysis of liquidity risk
Through the ILAAP process, we 
have assessed the level of liquidity 
necessary to prudently cover systemic 
and idiosyncratic risks. The ILAAP 
process determines the appropriate 
liquidity buffer, taking into account the 
specific nature of the deposit base and 
other liquidity risk drivers. 
The ILAAP requires us to consider all 
material liquidity risks in detail and to 
document our analysis of each key 
liquidity risk driver and to set a liquidity 
risk appetite against each of these 
drivers. Liquidity risks are specifically 
considered by the ALCO each month. 
An overview of our key liquidity risk 
drivers is provided below:
• Deposit funding risk - Deposit 
funding risk is the primary liquidity 
risk driver for the Group and this 
risk could crystallise if there was 
a concern by depositors over the 
current or future creditworthiness 
of the Group. We seek to operate in 
such a way as to protect depositors 
and in excess of 95% of deposits are 
also protected by the government’s 
Financial Services Compensation 
Scheme (“FSCS”). The FSCS provided 
£75,000 of protection to each 
individual depositor at 31 December 
2016. This protection has increased to 
£85,000 in 2017. 
• Wholesale funding - We mainly 
finance our operations through retail 
and SME deposit taking. We also 
have long term wholesale funding 
lines in place under the Term Funding 
and Funding for Lending Schemes, 
repurchase facilities to help manage 
liquid assets, and debt securities 
issued by the Group securitisation 
vehicle in April 2014. We have 
relationship banking facilities in place, 
which are used to hedge against 
currency and interest rate exposures, 
as well as repurchase facilities for 
short term liquidity management.

continued Payment systems
We do not form part of the UK payment 
system however we make use of the 
system in our day to day business. 
In the event there are problems with 
one of the payment systems, we have 
access to other facilities with which to 
make payments if needed. 
Pipeline loan commitments
We need to maintain liquidity to cover 
the outstanding pipeline of loan offers. 
Although certain pipeline offers may not 
be legally binding, the failure to honour 
an expression of intent to finance a 
loan contract brings reputational risk, 
therefore our policy is to hold liquidity 
for all such pipeline offers.
Cash collateral requirements
The Credit Support Annex (“CSA”) 
agreement requires Aldermore or 
the derivative counterparty to hold 
cash in a deposit account depending 
on whether the swap is in or out of 
the money. Under a CSA, cash is 
passed between parties to mitigate 
the counterparty risk inherent in 
the outstanding positions which are 
valued daily.

An asset is defined as encumbered if it has been pledged as collateral against an existing liability and, as a result, is no longer 
available to the Group to secure funding, satisfy collateral needs or be sold to reduce the funding requirement. An asset is 
therefore categorised as unencumbered if it has not been pledged against an existing liability. The Group monitors and manages 
total balance sheet encumbrance via a board-approved risk appetite framework.
Details of assets pledged through repurchase activity and collateral pledges are reported in the relevant notes to the balance 
sheet (Note 22 in respect of the Term Funding Scheme and Funding for Lending Scheme, and Note 42 in respect of the

Risk management
Principal risks
continued Market risk 
We do not seek to take or expose 
ourselves to market risk, and do 
not carry out proprietary trading, 
although certain liquid asset 
investments which form part 
of the liquid asset buffer carry 
mark to market risk which we 
regularly monitor.
We carry interest rate risk 
which is the risk of loss through 
mismatched asset and liability 
positions sensitive to changes in 
interest rates. Interest rate risk 
consists of asset-liability gap risk 
and basis risk.
Market risk
We do not carry out proprietary trading 
or hold any positions in assets or 
equities which are actively traded.
However, we do hold a portfolio of 
highly rated asset backed securities 
and a portfolio of liquid assets (primarily 
gilts, Treasury bills and Supranational 
bonds) which are used for liquidity 
buffer purposes. The interest rate risk 
on these liquid assets is considered 
as part of the asset–liability gap risk 
described. The instruments are also 
exposed to other forms of market 
risk e.g. credit spread risk. Prices are 
monitored on a daily basis to ensure 
that we are aware of any material 
diminution in value. Formal monthly 
prices are subject to independent 
review and are reported to ALCO. 
We have repurchase facilities in place 
which can be used in the first instance 
to obtain liquidity when necessary, 
which will avoid the need to sell the 
liquidity buffer assets and so crystallise 
any price gain or loss resulting from 
market price movements.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk appetite
We aim to minimise interest rate risk 
and have a policy of matching fixed 
or variable rate assets with liabilities 
of a comparable interest rate basis, 
supplemented by derivatives such as 
interest rate swaps. 
Mitigation
Hedge accounting
As detailed above, we use derivative 
contracts in order to hedge existing 
exposures on loans to customers, 
customer deposits and available for 
sale securities, principally with regard 
to following our policies in respect of 
the management of asset-liability gap 
and basis rate risks. Wherever possible 
we seek to include the derivatives 
used within hedges which meet the 
qualification requirements of IAS 
39 to be accounted for as fair value 
portfolio hedges (see accounting 
policy (j) and Note 21). However there 
are times where, in order to meet 
IAS 39 requirements for prospective 
testing of hedge effectiveness for new 
derivatives to be included in hedging 
portfolios, there is a time lag due to 
operational process, before IAS 39 
hedge accounting may commence.
Similarly, there are also certain 
derivative contracts, e.g. those hedging 
basis risk exposures (see above) which 
do not meet the criteria for hedge 
accounting under IAS 39. The gains and 
losses arising on contracts which do not 
meet the IAS hedge accounting criteria 
are included within income as part of 
“Net expense from derivatives and 
other financial instruments at fair value 
through profit or loss”, but, as they are 
not matched by similar adjustments 
to the hedged assets and liabilities, 
they give rise to volatility in the income 
statement on a year to year base 
which will reverse over the life of the 
hedge exposures.
Changes in the fair value of the hedged 
bonds and the hedging derivatives, 
and any differences between them, 
which were largely attributable to 
changes in the fair value of the bonds 
due to changes in their credit risk, 
are both reflected within the income 
statement as part of “Net expense 
from derivatives and other financial 
instruments at fair value through profit 
or loss”.

Analysis of interest rate risk
Asset-liability gap risk
Where possible we seek to match the 
interest rate structure of assets with 
liabilities, creating a natural hedge. 
Where this is not possible, we will enter 
into interest rate swap transactions 
to convert the fixed rate exposures on 
loans and advances, customer deposits 
and available for sale securities into 
variable three month LIBOR exposures. 
Given timing differences and the price 
of hedging small gaps, it is not cost 
effective to have an absolute match 
of variable rate assets and liabilities. 
The risk exposure of the overall asset-
liability interest rate profile is monitored 
against approved limits using changes 
to economic value of the balance sheet 
as a result of a modelled 2% shift in the 
interest yield curve. 
Basis risk
Basis risk is where there is a mismatch 
in the interest rate reference base for 
assets and liabilities. When we enter 
into derivative contracts to swap 
fixed rate assets and liabilities into 
variable rate liabilities, the reference 
base is usually three month LIBOR. 
Certain lending products have interest 
rates which are based on the prevailing 
Bank of England Base Rate (BBR) and 
this different basis reference leads to 
basis risk. 
We have a market risk policy in place 
which places limits on the net mismatch 
between base rate linked assets and 
liabilities, and seek to manage the 
overall level of basis risk exposure by 
entering into basis swap agreements. 
As at 31 December 2016, the amount of 
the basis risk sensitivity measure was 
£0.0m (31 December 2015: £0.5m).

Risk management
Principal risks
continued The following shaded sections describe 
the operational risk, compliance, 
conduct and financial crime risk and 
reputational risks to which we are 
exposed. The sections are shaded as 
these areas are unaudited. All other 
areas of the Risk report are covered 
by the external auditor’s opinion on 
page 142.
Operational risk 
Operational risk is the risk of loss 
resulting from inadequate or failed 
internal processes, people and 
systems or from external events. 
This risk includes information 
technology, information security, 
change management, outsourcing, 
tax, legal, people and financial 
control risks. 
Operational risk appetite
We aim to maintain robust operational 
systems and controls and seek to 
operate within an acceptable level 
of operational risk that enables 
execution of our business strategy, 
aiming for risks to be taken without 
unacceptable losses or reputational 
impacts. The operational risk appetite 
considers risk events and the 
assessment of internal controls as well 
as holding additional capital for certain 
operational risks. 
Exposures
The key operational exposures that 
the Group is exposed to include: 
breakdowns in processes, controls 
or procedures (or their inadequacy 
relative to the growing size of the 
Group’s business), systems failures and 
the risk of cyber threats, which impact 
the Group’s information technology 
or critical infrastructure. The Group 
is also subject to the risk of business 
disruption, for example, arising from 
facilities/transport or utility failures, 
natural disasters and acts of terrorism, 
which may give rise to losses or 
reductions in service to customers 
and/or losses to the Group. Given the 
reliance on major outsource suppliers 
and critical suppliers, the Group is also 
exposed to risks in its supply chain. 
The main operational risks to the 
Group are:
• Business continuity – risk of 
inadequate business recovery 
and disaster recovery capability 
to recover from any operational 
disruption and continue to provide 
product or service delivery to 
customers. The Group has a Business 
Continuity and Incident Management 
Framework which has been updated 
in 2016 and has been used to respond 
to internal and external events 
as appropriate. 
• Change management – inability 
to execute changes effectively 
on a budget or to an acceptable 
quality. As a growing business, 
the Group has a significant change 
agenda to respond to customer and 
business needs, regulatory and legal 
developments and to deliver ongoing 
infrastructure and process capability 
to meet the Group’s strategic aims.
• Financial Control and Management – 
The Group relies on timely, robust and 
accurate management information to 
support its financial and operational 
performance. The Group relies 
on appropriate models and, in 
certain cases, the use of estimates 
and management judgement in 
applying relevant accounting 
policies. This includes provisions 
for operation and conduct losses 
which have occurred and credit 
impairment charges. 
• Information security – inappropriate 
disclosure of personal or sensitive 
information and/or inappropriate 
access to internal data sources. 
In particular, cyber security threats 
to the Group and its customers as a 
result of attacks through the use of 
computer systems exist. The growth 
in criminal trading of stolen data 
and the increasing size of the Group 
may increase motivation to attempt 
cybercrime against the Group and/
or its customers. Threats continue 
to evolve as demonstrated by 
an increased increase in denial of 
service attacks, ransomware and 
increased sophistication of targeted 
fraud attacks by organised criminal 
networks. Failure to adequately 
manage cyber threats, and to 
continually review and update 
capabilities in response to new 
threats, could result in increased 
fraud losses, inability to perform 
critical economic functions, customer 
detriment, regulatory censure and 
penalty, legal liability and reputational 
damage. The Group continues to 
invest in its security infrastructure 
and remains aware that this is a 
constantly evolving threat, across 
the whole industry generally. 
• Information technology – risks to 
the availability, performance and 
capacity of IT systems/telephony/
internet. As the dependency on digital 
channels and other technologies 
grows, the impact of technology 
issues can become more material and 
immediate. The Group’s technology 
and supplier infrastructure is critical 
to its operations and to the delivery of 
products and services to customers. 
135 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices • People - inability to attract, 
manage and retain competent 
employees to fulfil the needs of 
the Group. As the Group grows, it 
requires a diverse mix of skills and 
experience to deliver its strategy 
and its transformation and change 
agenda. Failure to attract and retain 
appropriate, qualified and skilled 
employees could adversely impact 
the Group’s financial performance, 
control environment and compliance 
with evolving regulation and 
legislative developments. 
• Process - ineffective design or 
execution of operational processes 
and payment or transaction 
processing failures. As the Group 
matures, the risks arising from 
existing processes may increase. 
• Third party suppliers - inappropriate 
supplier selection and contractual 
arrangements, or inadequate ongoing 
management of critical suppliers 
and material outsource partners. 
The Group is reliant on a range of 
major outsource suppliers and critical 
suppliers for robust delivery and 
execution of services. The Group’s 
Supplier Management Framework 
continues to evolve to ensure it is in 
line with regulatory expectations and 
industry best practice. 
Mitigation and monitoring
The management of operational risk 
is a key area of management focus 
and we adopt the Basic Indicator 
Approach (“BIA”) to operational risk. 
The Group has worked to understand 
its operational risk management 
framework as compared to peers 
and continues to align to the Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision 
criteria for the sound management of 
operational risk.
The Operational Risk Management 
Framework has three key objectives:
• Minimise the impact of losses 
suffered from day-to-day operations 
(expected losses) and from extreme 
events (unexpected losses)
• Ensure awareness of the operational 
risks faced by the Group and the 
appropriate techniques to manage 
them in line with risk appetite 
• Improve the effective management 
of the Group and protect its 
reputation and brand value
The prime responsibility for the 
management of operational risk and 
compliance within the Operational Risk 
Management Framework lies with 
business units and central functions. 
The Operational Risk function within 
Group Risk acts as a second line of 
defence and provides oversight and 
challenge of the operational risk profile, 
escalating issues as appropriate.
Senior management across the Group 
identify and assess operational risks 
within their respective areas and assess 
the effectiveness of key controls 
that mitigate those risks following 
the Risk & Control Self-Assessment 
process. This includes an assessment 
as to whether management actions 
are required to bring the risk within 
risk appetite, whether the level of risk 
is accepted, or escalation of the risk 
is required.
Operational risk event reporting 
is in place across the Group and 
corrective actions and recoveries are 
tracked accordingly.
We have placed emphasis on ensuring 
that the IT infrastructure, performance, 
resilience and security meet the 
ongoing needs of the business. 
Where possible the Group seeks to 
automate or mitigate through additional 
controls. In 2016 we have continued to 
make significant investment in cyber 
risk controls to ensure that we maintain 
appropriate levels of controls to counter 
the increasing threat of cyber-crime 
across the banking and financial 
services industries.
Mitigation of the risks arising from 
on-going changes and project activity 
is through a robust project governance 
structure and delivery framework. 
This approach was used to manage a 
series of projects during the year and 
ensures there are appropriate controls 
in place covering scoping and planning, 
design, initiation, monitoring and risk 
assessment. Following completion, 
post-implementation reviews are 
held to ensure any process or project 
improvements which are identified are 
implemented for future projects.
The Group aims to maintain an engaged 
and diverse workforce to ensure it 
can retain, develop and attract the 
right mix of skills and capabilities to 
deliver its strategy. Investment in staff 
training and personal development 
programmes, and support of both 
external and internal diversity projects, 
are key parts of ensuring we remain an 
employer of choice in the market.

Risk management
Principal risks
continued Compliance, Conduct and 
Financial Crime risk
Compliance risk is the risk of legal 
or regulatory sanctions, material 
financial loss, or loss to reputation 
as a result of a failure to comply 
with applicable laws, regulations, 
codes of conduct and standards of 
good practice. 
Conduct risk is the risk of legal 
or regulatory sanctions, material 
financial loss, or loss to reputation 
as a result of causing unfair 
outcomes or detriment to our 
customers and/or undermining 
market integrity as a result of 
our behaviour, decision making, 
activities or processes. 
Financial crime risk is the risk of 
legal or regulatory sanctions, 
material financial loss, or loss 
to reputation as a result of the 
Group`s activities being used 
by criminals for the purposes 
of money laundering, terrorist 
financing, bribery and corruption 
and fraud.
Compliance, Conduct and Financial 
Crime risk appetite
We aim to minimise Compliance, 
Conduct and Financial Crime risk 
by maintaining robust systems and 
controls which are designed to meet 
existing legislative and regulatory 
requirements, identify new and 
emerging changes to the external 
landscape and that counter the threat 
of the Group’s activities and products 
being used for the purposes of 
financial crime.
Exposures
The key compliance, conduct and 
financial crime risks that the Group is 
exposed to include: 
Legal & Regulatory – failure to 
identify, interpret or respond to legal 
or regulatory changes or lack of 
contractual arrangements in place 
to protect the Group. The financial 
services industry continues to be the 
focus of significant regulatory change 
which requires the Group to both 
maintain compliance with existing 
regulations and to ensure delivery 
of change to achieve compliance 
with new and emerging regulations. 
The Group has a formal approach 
to reviewing such developments, 
assessing the impact on the Group 
and tracking our progress towards 
achieving compliance. Of particular 
current significance is the continuing 
embedding of the Senior Managers and 
Certification Regime (SMCR), the IFRS9 
accounting changes, the recent BCBS 
capital proposals and the General Data 
Protection Regulations (GDPR) which 
are being closely managed.
Conduct – there is a risk that 
customers can suffer detriment due 
to actions, processes or products 
which originate from within the 
Group. Conduct risk can arise through 
the design of products that do not 
meet customers’ needs, mishandling 
complaints where we have behaved 
inappropriately towards our customers, 
inappropriate sale processes and 
exhibiting behaviour that does not 
meet market or regulatory standards. 
Customer detriment could affect our 
reputation, lead to loss of market share 
due to damage to our brand and may 
lead to customer redress payments, 
regulatory action or censure.
Financial crime – failure to prevent the 
Group’s products and services being 
used by criminals for the purposes 
of financial crime, including money 
laundering and terrorist financing or 
failure to comply with relevant financial 
sanctions requirements, and to prevent 
bribery and corruption. There is a risk 
the Group`s products and services 
could be the subject of significant fraud, 
either internally or externally leading 
to increased provisions and associated 
reputational damage.
Mitigation and monitoring
The primary responsibility for the 
management of compliance, conduct 
and financial crime risk lies with the 
business units and central functions 
in line with the SMCR responsibilities. 
The Compliance and Financial Crime 
functions within Group Risk act as a 
second line of defence and provide 
oversight of and challenge to the 
business and central functions, 
escalating issues as appropriate.
The Compliance and Financial Crime 
oversight functions are responsible 
for maintaining an appropriate risk 
framework for the management of 
compliance, conduct and financial 
crime risk, including setting the overall 
Group policies and minimum control 
requirements for the business and 
central functions to follow and for 
overseeing their compliance. 
Senior management across the Group 
identify and assess compliance, 
conduct and financial crime risks (within 
their respective areas) and assess 
the effectiveness of key controls that 
mitigate those risks following the Risk 
& Control Self-Assessment process. 
This includes an assessment as to 
whether management actions are 
required to bring the risk within risk 
appetite, whether the level of risk is 
accepted or whether escalation of the 
risk is required.
137 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices New and emerging legislative and 
regulatory driven changes are 
overseen through a defined model 
and standardised approach to ensure 
changes are both identified and 
assessed in terms of the impact on 
the Group. Any significant changes 
are implemented into the business 
units through a formal project 
governance approach. 
We monitor and mitigate conduct risk 
by ensuring our products, services, 
business processes and procedures 
are designed to consistently deliver 
fair customer outcomes which 
are subject to ongoing assurance, 
monitoring, testing and reporting 
where we may be operating outside 
of risk appetite. Conduct risk metrics 
and KPIs (which include among others, 
staff performance levels, training, 
customer feedback, complaints, 
product retention rates, cancellations, 
arrears levels and customer service 
standards) are in place to evidence 
fair outcomes, identify any emerging 
issues and document remedial 
actions. Our recruitment, training 
and development programmes have 
a clear customer focus and reward 
mechanisms are aligned with fair 
customer outcomes. 
The prevention of financial crime 
remains a key area of management 
focus. Money laundering checks are 
undertaken on all applicants to establish 
identity and the ultimate ownership 
structure for business customers. 
Financial sanctions and fraud checks 
are completed at application stage 
and during the customer lifecycle. 
Financial crime metrics and KPIs, 
(which include among others, fraud 
prevention value, frauds detected, 
fraud provisions and losses, suspicious 
activity reports and PEPs), are in place 
to oversee financial crime risk, identify 
any emerging issues and document 
remedial actions. 
Monitoring and testing of customer 
processes and outcomes is undertaken 
within each business area and is 
supported by independent review 
and oversight through the Group 
Risk function.
Reputational risk
Reputational risk is defined as the 
potential negative consequences 
arising from a failure to meet the 
expectations and standards of our 
customers, investors, regulators 
or other counterparties during the 
conduct of any of our business 
activities. This includes not just 
the Group itself but all employees 
and other agents acting for, 
or otherwise associated with, 
the Group. 
Reputational risk appetite
We aim to protect the strength of 
our reputation and franchise and 
consequently have a low appetite 
for reputational risk. We will seek to 
eliminate the potential for material risk 
events of this nature, or where this is 
not possible, mitigate them as fully and 
quickly as possible.
The Group will not conduct its business 
or engage with any stakeholders in a 
manner that could adversely impact 
its reputation or franchise value. 
In addition, the Group seeks to protect 
and enhance its reputation at all 
times through proactive engagement 
with stakeholders and on-going 
identification and assessment of 
reputational risk events with the Board 
and with the establishment of clear 
mitigating plans and actions.
Exposures
There are few reputational threats that 
are not intertwined with the outlined 
principal and emerging risks within 
this report. The key reputational risks 
the Group are exposed to include poor 
conduct and customer detriment, 
operational shortcomings, political 
and regulatory developments and 
external attacks. 
Mitigation and monitoring
All employees are responsible for day-
to-day identification and management 
of reputational risk. This is safeguarded 
by each employee conducting his or 
her business and personal activities in a 
manner that protects and enhances the 
Group’s reputation.
The Board of Directors and Executive 
Management set the tone from the 
top, creating a strong culture of 
integrity and high ethical standards 
cascaded through the Group 
Corporate Governance Framework, 
Risk Management Frameworks and 
supporting policies and procedures. 
Oversight of Reputational risk is 
provided by each of the committees 
detailed within the Risk Management 
Framework. In addition, the Group 
Corporate Affairs function supports 
the oversight and management 
of reputational risk and acts as a 
steward for protecting, promoting and 
enhancing our reputation amongst key 
stakeholders under the direction of the 
Chief Executive Officer. The principal 
monitoring and on-going reporting 
forum for Reputational Risk is the BRC. 
Ultimate oversight of reputational 
events and their resolution rests with 
the Board, reflecting the importance 
and longevity of this type of risk.
In 2016 emphasis was placed on 
ensuring our Crisis and Incident 
Management (“IMT”) processes were 
robust and tested. Scenario based 
response plans were developed and 
further embedded communications into 
all crisis and IMT processes. This aims to 
mitigate reputational risk by ensuring 
a centrally coordinated response plan 
to prevent greater damage if a critical 
event occurs.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the
Annual Report and Accounts and the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts and the Group and parent company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and 
applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the 
Group and parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent 
company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a strategic report, Directors’ Report, 
Remuneration Report and corporate governance statement that complies with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect of the annual financial report 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
• the Strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the issuer 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.
We consider the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy.

141 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Aldermore Group PLC for the year ended 31 December 2016 set out on pages 148 to 
204. In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2016 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2. Overview
The starting point for our audit was our experience as auditors of the Group since formation, including our assessment of the 
control environment and capital and liquidity positions, and we combined that with a consideration of external and internal 
developments and the risks they present to the Group’s business model and how these risks are mitigated. These were 
considered in June 2016, were refreshed following the results of the EU referendum and the half year review, and have been 
continually reassessed through our interim and final audits. That consideration includes conversations not only with management 
and the Board, and ongoing knowledge gained through reading pertinent management information, but also reflected the views 
of the Prudential Regulatory Authority, market analysts, specialists within the firm, and peer comparisons.
We considered that the impact of regulatory change, the greater competition within some of the Group’s markets impacting 
redemptions, the data migrations due to core system upgrades and the challenge of meeting market expectations would 
increase the audit risk in the area of income recognition.
We considered that the continued strong loan growth, the challenge of meeting market expectations, the regulatory and tax 
challenges to the Buy-to-Let market and the impact of the result of the EU referendum could all increase the audit risk in the area 
of loan impairment. We note, however, that the risk continues to be mitigated through a lower interest rate environment and a 
relatively benign albeit uncertain credit outlook.
We considered that the audit risk in relation to goodwill has been substantially reduced, given that the Group have fully impaired 
the goodwill relating to the Invoice Finance Cash Generating Unit at the half year, due to a deterioration in the value of financial 
services companies following the result of the EU referendum.
Other factors we have considered in assessing the audit risks include the substantial project spend required in relation to 
systems projects, the emergence of digital and technological disrupters, increased regulation including the need to prepare for 
major financial reporting changes such as IFRS 9 and the Group’s capital raising in October 2016. 
The final result of our risk consideration is shown in the table, and we have shown those which have increased or decreased in 
risk. We are of the view that there are seven areas of significant risk, but two – income recognition and credit risk – represent the 
greatest significance. 
Financial statements
Independent auditor’s report to the members of  
Aldermore Group PLC only 
142 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 3. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect 
on our audit were as follows:
Income Recognition: Effective Interest Rate asset of £34.8 million and offsetting liability of (£31.5 million) (2015: 
£23.9 million and (£21.5 million) respectively)
Refer to page 65 (Audit Committee Report), page 156 (accounting policy), page 168 (Use of estimates and judgements) and Note 5 
(financial disclosures)
The Risk – Measuring interest income on loans and advances to customers under the effective interest rate method (Note 2(a)) 
requires the Directors to apply judgements, with the most critical being the expected life assumption. 
The Group has a number of portfolios (including organic and acquired loans) across a variety of sectors and products which 
results in a large number of expected life assumptions. The sensitivity to a change in expected life can vary greatly over the 
portfolios depending on the underlying borrower and the other parameters also included in the effective interest rate calculation 
such as reversionary interest rates at the end of the fixed term, transaction costs and discounts or premium in place at inception. 
The expected life assumptions utilise repayment profiles which represent how customers are expected to repay. The Group has 
limited historical experience to support these profiles due to the relatively unseasoned nature of its lending. Consequently, the 
Group makes its expected life assumptions based on its forecasting process which takes into account historical data but also, 
for the forecast period, the Group’s expertise and experience in the sector. As such, any change in the expected life assumptions 
depend on the Directors’ assessment of whether there is any emerging experience or market information that indicates a 
different repayment profile and by how much. As the forecast profiles extend significantly into the future this creates a high level 
of estimation uncertainty.

143 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices This has the greatest impact on the acquired loan portfolios (current balance: £113.4 million) because these were acquired at 
an upfront discount (unamortised balance: £7.0 million) and repayments are linked to the bank base rate with minimal incentive 
for the borrowers to remortgage until there is a change in interest rate expectations. This means any change in the repayment 
profile causes the discount received on purchase of the acquired portfolios to be adjusted and spread over the revised 
expected life.
In addition, repayment profiles will be affected by future changes in the market – for example, market pricing and the ability of 
borrowers to remortgage 
The models used to measure revenue recognition rely on manual processes and controls which increase the risk associated with 
model stability and the completeness and accuracy of input data.
Our response – our audit procedures included:
• We tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of key controls over the completeness and accuracy of 
model inputs and the reconciliation of model outputs to the financial statements;
• We performed a reconciliation of data inputs used to measure interest income, including the loans split by product type, to 
reports from the Group reporting system;
• We tested application controls, with the involvement of our IT specialists, over the completeness and accuracy of the source 
loan input reports;
• We assessed the accuracy of the models by re-performing a sample of calculations and comparing the methodology used to 
our interpretation of the requirements of the relevant accounting standard;
• We tested the stability and integrity of the models with the involvement of our IT specialists;
• We challenged the appropriateness of key assumptions, including the expected lives and repayment profiles, by comparing 
these to the available historical customer trends within the Group, internal forecasts, and to our own expectations based 
on our knowledge of the Group and experience of the industry in which it operates, including the ability of customers to 
remortgage based on the current offerings in the market;
• For comparable lending and where available, we benchmarked the Group’s expected life assumptions to peer data and/or 
market information; and
• We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures about the changes in estimate that occurred during the period and 
the sensitivity disclosures across the key loan books.
Credit Risk: Impairment of loans and advances to customers £15.5 million (2015: £10.4 million)
Refer to page 64 (Audit Committee Report), page 160 (accounting policy), page 166 (Use of estimates and judgements) and Note 22 
(financial disclosures)
The Risk – The impairment provision relating to the Group’s loan portfolios requires the Directors to make significant judgements 
and assumptions over the recoverability of loan balances. 
The Group performs an assessment of its loans for impairment as described in Note 2(g). The loan provision is most sensitive 
to assumptions made when assessing the collective provision, in particular in respect of the probability of default and the 
emergence period. This is because the Group has limited historical experience to support the assumptions made due to the 
relatively unseasoned nature of its loan portfolios underwritten during a relatively benign economic period. 
To assess the probability of default, the Group uses a credit bureau to provide it with probabilities of default based on all available 
credit data for comparable borrowers. These probabilities are then adjusted (in almost all cases downwards) to reflect the 
Group’s actual borrowers and the nature of its lending. The adjustments (‘scalars’) are based on the Group’s internal data, which 
would not have been taken into account by the credit bureau. Management also apply overlays to the resultant modelled results 
to take into account both model risk and emerging risks that may not be otherwise appropriately factored in by the credit bureau.
Financial statements
Independent auditor’s report to the members of  
Aldermore Group PLC only continued 
144 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 The emergence period is assessed based on loans for which the Group is able to reliably measure the time between the trigger 
event occurring and the loans being identified as impaired. As the Group has limited historical data available, particularly in Asset 
Finance, the estimated emergence period is adjusted upwards (in the form of an overlay) and is based on market insight.
The Group’s individual provisions can also require judgement, particularly in SME Commercial Mortgages and Asset Finance, 
where the valuation of collateral can be difficult to establish due to its specialised nature; as well as the exit strategy adopted, 
which can significantly impact the timing and value of the cash flows. 
There continues to be regulatory focus on lending institutions factoring of forbearance arrangements adequately into their 
provisioning models.
The impact of the EU referendum result has also been assessed in regards to the potential impairment of collateral prices, 
uncertainties surrounding the House Price Index and potential increase in emergence periods as property markets have the 
potential of a slow down due to increased volatility in the funding markets.
Our response - our audit procedures included:
• We tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of key controls over the capture, monitoring and reporting 
of loans and advances to customers;
• We assessed the accuracy of the impairment model for collectively assessed loans, with assistance from our IT specialists, 
by re-performing a sample of calculations produced by the impairment model and compared the methodology used to our 
interpretation of the requirements of the relevant accounting standards; 
• For loans assessed collectively for impairment we: 
• assessed the competency, reputation and objectivity of the credit bureau that provides the probabilities of default; 
• critically assessed the assumptions made in respect of the probabilities of default (inclusive of the scalars) and the 
emergence periods against our understanding of the Group as well as our knowledge of the wider market;
• assessed the reasonableness of the methodology and accuracy of loss given default models;
• assessed the consistency of the probabilities of default (inclusive of the scalars) and the emergence periods with the limited 
historic internal data available; assessed and challenged management overlays within the model for completeness and 
accuracy; and
• assessed the accuracy of previous estimates of the collective provision.
• For a sample of exposures that were subject to an individual impairment assessment, and focusing on those with the most 
significant potential impact on the financial statements, we specifically challenged the Group’s assumptions on the expected 
future cash flows, including the value of realisable collateral, based on our own understanding of the industry and reviewing 
latest correspondence on the loan and third party valuations or property indexes;
• Challenged management’s assessment of identified cases of concern with material exposure;
• We assessed the performing loan book by using data analytics techniques to identify loans with characteristics that could 
indicate unidentified impairment;
• We benchmarked the Group’s key metrics, such as arrears trends and provision coverage, to externally available data, with 
particular focus on similar lending; and 
• We also considered compliance with the relevant accounting standards including the adequacy of the Group disclosures in 
relation to impairment.

4. Our application of materiality and an overview of the 
scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was 
set at £5.0 million (2015: £3.0 million), determined with reference 
to a benchmark of the Group profit before tax of £130.0 million 
(2015: £95 million), of which it represents 3.9% (2015: 3.1%). 
The benchmark percentage has been increased from 3.1% to 3.9% 
due to an improved control environment, resulting from increased 
stability in controls and processes over risks as a listed entity.
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected or 
uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £0.25 million 
(2015: £0.15 million), in addition to other identified misstatements 
that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
The Group audit team performed the audit of the Group and its only material component as if it were a single aggregated set of 
financial information. The audit was performed using the materiality level set out above and covered 100% of total Group revenue, 
Group profit before tax, and total Group assets.
5. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006;
• the information given in the strategic report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year is consistent with the financial 
statements; and 
• the information given in the corporate governance statement set out on page 31 with respect to internal control and risk 
management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures (“the specified corporate 
governance information”) is consistent with the financial statements. 
Based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the course of the audit of the financial statements and from reading the 
strategic report, the Directors’ Report and the corporate governance statement:
• we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report, the Directors’ Report, or the specified corporate 
governance information; 
• in our opinion, the strategic report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; 
and
• in our opinion, the corporate governance statement has been prepared in accordance with rules 7.2.2, 7.2.3, 7.2.5, 7.2.6 and 7.2.7 
of the Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority.
6. We have nothing to report on the disclosures of principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to: 
• the Directors’ statement of risk management on pages 31 to 35, internal control on page 31 and viability reporting on page 31 
concerning the principal risks, their management, and, based on that, the Directors’ assessment and expectations of the Group’s 
continuing in operation over the three years to 31 December 2019; or 
• the disclosures in Note 1 of the financial statements concerning the use of the going concern basis of accounting.

152 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements
1 Basis of preparation
a) Accounting basis
The consolidated financial statements of Aldermore Group PLC (the “Company”) and its subsidiary undertakings (together, the 
“Group”) include its principal subsidiary, Aldermore Bank PLC (the “Bank”). 
Both the Group consolidated financial statements and the Company financial statements have been prepared and approved by 
the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (“IASB”) and as adopted by the European Union (“EU”). For IAS 39: “Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement” the exclusion regarding hedge accounting (the so called “carve out”) decreed by the EU on 19 November 2014 is 
taken into account.
By including the Company financial statements here together with the Group consolidated financial statements, the Company is 
taking advantage of the exemption in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and 
related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements. 
The principal activity of the Company is that of an investment holding company. 
b) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which are 
entities controlled by the Company (jointly referred to as the Group) made up to 31 December each year. 
Control is achieved when the Company:
• has power over the investee;
• is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
• has the ability to use its power to affect returns.
If facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above, the 
Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are deconsolidated from the date 
that control ceases. Uniform accounting policies are applied consistently across the Group. Intercompany transactions and 
balances are eliminated upon consolidation.
Securitisation vehicles
The Group has securitised certain loans and advances to customers by the transfer of the beneficial interest in such loans to 
securitisation vehicles (see Note 22). The securitisation enabled the subsequent issue of debt securities by a securitisation 
vehicle to investors who have the security of the underlying assets as collateral. The securitisation vehicles are fully consolidated 
into the Group’s accounts as the Group has control as defined above.
The transfer of the beneficial interest in these loans to the securitisation vehicle are not treated as sales by the Group. The Group 
continues to recognise these assets within its own Statement of Financial Position after the transfer as it continues to retain 
substantially all the risks and rewards from the assets.
c) Going concern
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors are satisfied that the Group has the resources 
to continue in business for the foreseeable future (which has been taken as 12 months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements). In making this assessment, the Directors have considered a wide range of information relating to present and 
future conditions, including the current state of the statement of financial position, future projections of profitability, cash flows 
and capital resources and the longer-term strategy of the business. The Group’s capital and liquidity plans, including stress 
tests, have been reviewed by the Directors. The Group’s forecasts and projections, including a range of stressed scenarios, 
show that it will be able to operate with adequate levels of both liquidity and capital for the foreseeable future. After making due 
enquiries, the Directors believe that the Group has sufficient resources to continue its activities for the foreseeable future and to 
continue its planned expansion. Additionally, the Group has sufficient capital to enable it to continue to meet its regulatory capital 
requirements as set out by the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”).
153 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices 1. Basis of preparation continued
d) Basis of measurement
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following material items in the 
financial statements:
• derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value through profit or loss;
• certain debt securities which are designated at fair value through profit or loss;
• available for sale debt securities are valued at fair value through other comprehensive income; and
• fair value adjustments for portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities designated as hedged items in qualifying fair 
value hedge relationships, which reflect changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged.
e) Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
Information about areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are included in Note 3.
f) Presentation of risk and capital disclosures
The disclosures required under IFRS 7: ”Financial instruments: disclosures” and IAS 1: "Presentation of financial statements" 
have been included within the audited sections of the Risk Report on page 106. Where information is marked as audited, 
it is incorporated into these financial statements by this cross reference and it is covered by the Independent Auditor’s report 
on page 142.
g) Future accounting developments
All standards or amendments to existing standards which have been endorsed by the EU and which are available for early 
adoption for annual periods commencing on or after 1 January 2016 have been adopted by the Group apart from IFRS 9: “Financial 
Instruments” and IFRS 15: “Revenue from contracts with customers”. 
There are also a number of standards, amendments and interpretations which have been issued by the IASB but which have not 
yet been endorsed by the EU. The most significant of these is IFRS 16: “Leases” the planned replacement for IAS 17: “Leases”.
IFRS 9: “Financial Instruments” is the comprehensive standard to replace IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement” and was endorsed by the EU on 22 November 2016. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018 and is required to be applied retrospectively. However, prior periods need not be restated, instead an adjustment 
may be reflected in opening retained earnings at the start of the period when IFRS 9 is first adopted.
The standard includes requirements for classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities, hedge accounting and 
the impairment of financial assets.
Classification and measurement
The classification of financial assets will be based on the objectives of the Group’s business model and the contractual cash 
flow characteristics of the instruments. Financial assets will then be classified as held at amortised cost, at fair value through 
other comprehensive income (“FVOCI”), or at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL ”). In most instances, the measurement 
outcomes will be similar to those under IAS 39 and therefore, any changes from the accounting treatment currently followed by 
the Group under IAS 39 are not expected to be significant. The classification of financial liabilities is essentially unchanged from 
the treatment under IAS 39.

154 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Impairment of financial assets
Impairment provisions in all financial assets are recognised based on either 12 month expected losses or lifetime expected losses. 
This will result in the acceleration of the recognition of impairment provisions and will lead to more volatile impairment charges in 
the income statement. However, whilst IFRS9 represents a significant change compared to IAS 39, the quantum of impairment 
losses recorded against any one loan over the life of the loan will not change as IFRS 9 alters only the timing of recognition of 
impairment losses.
IFRS 9 introduces a number of changes to approach as compared to the current methodology under IAS 39. The main 
changes are:
• Expected credit losses (“ECL ”) are based on an assessment of the probability of default, loss given default and exposure at 
default discounted to give a net present value. The estimation of ECL should be unbiased and probability weighted to reflect 
a range of possible outcomes taking into account all reasonable and supportable information including forward-looking 
economic assumptions.
• On initial recognition, and for financial assets where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since the date of 
origination, IFRS 9 provisions will be made to reflect ECL arising from expected credit default events within the next 12 months.
• A key requirement of IFRS 9, compared with the existing impairment approach under IAS 39, relates to assets where there 
has been a significant increase in credit risk since the date of origination. Provisions will be made for those assets expected to 
default at any point over their lifetime, reflecting the asset’s full expected loss. 
• For assets where there is evidence of credit impairment, provisions will be made under IFRS 9 for lifetime expected credit 
losses, taking account of forward looking economic assumptions and a range of possible outcomes. Under IAS 39, provisions 
are currently based on the asset’s carrying value and the present value of the estimated future cash flows. 
It is not anticipated that changes in the approach to impairment will have a significant impact on the Group’s provisions in respect 
of specifically impaired loans, as the current provisions on such loans are based on estimates of lifetime expected losses arising 
based on expected future cash flows, but excluding any future credit losses that have not yet been incurred. 
In respect of other loans, against which collective provisions are raised, our current approach, as explained in Note 3(a), is to 
estimate probabilities of default for the next 12 months. This approach is similar to that which will be required under IFRS 9 except, 
that in order to measure incurred losses, as required by IAS 39, management currently adjust the calculated 12 month expected 
loss, which is based on management’s current best estimates, for an emergence period based on the nature of the underlying 
asset enabling management to reflect only the impairment considered to have been incurred at the reporting date. Under IFRS 9, 
the estimated probabilities of default will need to be probability weighted, based on a range of possible economic scenarios. 
 While the Group’s current approach to calculating collective impairment provisions (as described above) has similarities to the 
approach required under IFRS 9, it should be noted that IFRS 9 is a complex accounting standard and the Group’s detailed credit 
modelling approach remains under development. 
Hedge accounting
The hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9 are designed to create a stronger link with financial risk management. At present, 
IFRS 9 does not address the portfolio hedging of interest rate risk currently undertaken by the Group. Pending development 
of the IASB’s proposals for dynamic risk management (macro hedge accounting), to be considered in a separate accounting 
standard, IFRS 9 allows the option to continue to apply the existing hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39. The Group plans 
to exercise the accounting policy choice to continue IAS 39 hedge accounting (including the so called “carve out” as described in 
Note 2(j)).
155 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices 1. Basis of preparation continued
Implementation
The Group has established an IFRS 9 programme. The programme is jointly sponsored by the Chief Financial Officer and Chief 
Risk Officer. The programme is cross-functional with representation from (but not limited to) Finance, Risk and IT. Progress is 
regularly reported to the IFRS 9 Steering Group and the Audit Committee.
The key features of the programme include defining the IFRS 9 methodology and accounting policies, identifying data, 
reconciliation and system requirements, and the development and establishment of appropriate and compliant operating models 
within an appropriate governance framework. 
Extensive work is being carried out with regards to technical analysis, the development of the credit models and the design of the 
required changes to systems, data, business processes, reporting and governance relating to impairment provisions. During 2017, 
work will include building and testing of credit models and validating outputs, development of management information, 
implementation of business process changes and a parallel run phase. 
The financial impact of IFRS 9 will be quantified once models and systems are further developed. Impacts are expected to be 
disclosed no later than in the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2017.
The IASB has also issued IFRS 15: “Revenue from contracts with customers”. IFRS 15 provides a principles-based approach 
to recognise revenue and the concept of recognising revenue for obligations as they are satisfied. The impact for the Group is 
currently being assessed but may impact our treatment of fees and commissions and other operating income, the majority of 
which relates to the Invoice Finance business. The Standard was endorsed on 29 October 2016 and will be effective for annual 
reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with retrospective application permitted.
On 13 January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16: “Leases” as a replacement for IAS 17: “Leases”. The Standard will be effective 
for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, with early application being permitted for companies that 
also apply IFRS 15. The impact for the Group is currently being assessed. A significant change will be the inclusion of a “right of 
use asset” within the statement of financial position in respect of the benefit the Group receives where it leases assets under 
operating leases, together with a financial liability in respect of the obligation to make operating lease payments. Within the 
income statement, an operating charge will be reflected in respect of the use of the asset together with interest expense in 
relation to the financing, replacing the current operating lease charges included in administrative expenses.
2. Significant accounting policies
(a) Interest income and expense
Interest income and expense are recognised in the income statement on an effective interest rate (“EIR”) basis. The EIR is the 
rate that, at the inception of the financial asset or liability, exactly discounts expected future cash payments and receipts over 
the expected life of the instrument back to the initial carrying amount. When calculating the EIR, the Group estimates cash flows 
considering all contractual terms of the instrument (for example, prepayment options) but does not consider the assets’ future 
credit losses.
At each reporting date, management makes an assessment of the expected remaining life of its financial assets, including any 
acquired loan portfolios and where there is a change in those assessments, the remaining amount of any unamortised discount or 
premiums is adjusted so that the interest income continues to be recognised prospectively on the amortised cost of the financial 
asset at the original EIR. The adjustment is recognised within interest income in the income statement for the current period.
The calculation of the EIR includes all transaction costs and fees paid or received that are an integral part of the interest rate, 
together with the discounts or premium arising on the acquisition of loan portfolios. Transaction costs include incremental costs 
that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or liability.
Financial statements
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
continued
156 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Interest income and expense presented in the income statement include:
• Interest on financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost calculated on an EIR basis;
• Interest on available for sale debt securities calculated on an EIR basis;
• Interest income recognised on finance leases where the Group acts as the lessor (see Note 2(o));
• The effective portion of fair value changes in qualifying hedging derivatives designated in fair value hedges of interest rate risk 
together with changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk; and
• Interest income on financial assets designated at fair value so as to avoid an accounting mismatch with derivatives held as an 
“economic” hedge and the matching interest component of the derivative.
Interest income includes amounts the Group charges its Invoice Finance clients as interest each day on the balance of their 
outstanding loans. This interest income is recognised in the income statement on an EIR basis.
(b) Fee and commissions and other operating income
i. Fee and commission income
Fee and commission income includes fees relating to services provided to customers which do not meet the criteria for inclusion 
within interest income.
Within the Invoice Finance segment of the Group, customers are charged a factoring fee for managing their sales ledgers. This fee 
is recognised within fee and commissions income over the period in which the ledger management service is provided. 
Other fee and commission income includes fees charged for mortgage services, arrears, and insurance commission receivable. 
Fee income is recognised as the related services are performed.
Arrangement fees and other fees relating to loans and advances which do meet the criteria for inclusion within interest income 
are included as part of the EIR.
ii. Fee and commission expense
Fee and commission expense predominantly consists of introducer commissions, legal and valuation fees and company search 
fees. Where these fee and commissions are incremental costs that are directly attributable to the issue of a financial instrument, 
they are included in interest income as part of the EIR calculation. Where they are not incremental costs that are directly 
attributable, they are recognised within fee and commission expense as the services are received.
iii. Other operating income
Other operating income predominantly arises from the provision of invoice finance services and includes disbursements and 
collect out income. This income is recognised within other operating income when the service is provided.
(c) Net income from derivatives and other financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss
Net income from derivatives and other financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss relates to non-trading derivatives 
held for risk management purposes that do not form part of a qualifying hedging arrangement and financial assets designated 
at fair value through profit or loss. It includes all realised and unrealised fair value changes, interest and foreign exchange 
differences with the exception of interest income on financial assets designated at fair value and the matching interest 
component of the hedging derivatives. The assets designated at fair value are treated in this manner so as to avoid an accounting 
mismatch with derivatives held as an “economic” hedge.
(d) Financial instruments—recognition and derecognition
i. Recognition
The Group initially recognises loans and advances, amounts due to banks, customer accounts and subordinated notes issued on 
the date that they are originated.
Regular way purchases and sales of debt securities and derivatives are recognised on the trade date at which the Group commits 
to purchase or sell the asset. All other financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised on the trade date at which the Group 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
157 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices 2. Significant accounting policies continued
ii. Derecognition
Financial assets are derecognised when there are qualifying transfers and:
• the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have ceased; or
• the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets.
When a financial asset is derecognised in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount, the sum of the consideration 
received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and any cumulative gain or loss that had been 
recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the income statement.
When available for sale financial assets are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss, including that previously recognised in 
reserves, is recognised in the income statement.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires. Any difference between the carrying 
amount of a financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid is recognised through the income statement.
iii. Funding for Lending Scheme (“FLS”)
Loans and advances over which the Group transfers its rights to the collateral thereon to the Bank of England under the FLS 
are not derecognised from the statement of financial position as the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership including all cash flows arising from the loans and advances and exposure to credit risk. The treasury bills that the 
Group borrows against the transferred assets are not recognised in the statement of financial position but, where they are sold to 
third parties by the Group under agreements to repurchase, the cash received is recognised as an asset within the statement of 
financial position together with the corresponding obligation to return it which is recognised as a liability at amortised cost within 
‘Amounts due to banks’. Interest is accrued over the life of the agreement on an EIR basis.
iv. Term Funding Scheme (“TFS”)
Loans and advances over which the Group transfers its rights to the collateral thereon to the Bank of England under the TFS 
are not derecognised from the statement of financial position as the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership including all cash flows arising from the loans and advances and exposure to credit risk. The cash received against 
the transferred assets is recognised as an asset within the statement of financial position, together with the corresponding 
obligation to return it, which is recognised as a liability at amortised cost within ‘Amounts due to banks’. Interest is accrued over 
the life of the agreement on an EIR basis.
(e) Financial assets 
i. Overview
The Group classifies its financial assets (excluding derivatives) as either:
• loans and receivables;
• available for sale; or
• financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss.
ii. Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market and that the Group does not intend to sell immediately or in the near term. These are initially measured at fair value plus 
transaction costs that are directly attributable to the financial asset. Subsequently, these are measured at amortised cost 
using the EIR method. The amortised cost is the amount advanced less principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative 
amortisation using the EIR method of any difference between the amount advanced and the maturity amount, less impairment 
provisions for incurred losses. Loans and receivables mainly comprise loans and advances to banks and customers.
Financial statements
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
continued
158 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 iii. Available for sale
Available for sale financial assets are debt securities that are not held for trading and are intended to be held for an indefinite 
period of time. These are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the financial 
asset. Subsequently, they are measured at fair value based on current quoted bid prices in active markets for identical assets 
that the Group can access at the reporting date. Where there is no active market, or the debt securities are unlisted, the fair 
values are based on valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, with reference to relevant market rates, 
and other commonly used valuation techniques. Interest income is recognised in the income statement using the EIR method. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. Other fair value changes are recognised in other comprehensive 
income and presented in the available for sale reserve in equity. On disposal, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is reclassified 
to the income statement.
iv. Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss are assets which have been designated as such to eliminate or 
significantly reduce a measurement and recognition inconsistency or where management specifically manages an asset or 
liability on that basis. These assets are measured at fair value based on current quoted bid prices in active markets for identical 
assets that the Group can access at the reporting date. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value are brought into the 
income statement within ‘Net income/(expense) from derivatives and other financial instruments at fair value through profit or 
loss’ as they arise. The Group disposed of all of its financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss during 2015.
(f) Financial liabilities
i. Overview
Financial liabilities are contractual obligations to deliver cash or another financial asset. Financial liabilities are recognised initially 
at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs for financial liabilities other than derivatives. Financial liabilities, other 
than derivatives, are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
ii. Financial liabilities at amortised cost
Financial liabilities at amortised cost are recognised initially at fair value, which equates to issue proceeds net of transaction costs 
incurred. They are subsequently stated at amortised cost. Any difference between proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the 
redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the EIR method.
iii. Subordinated notes
Subordinated notes issued by the Group are assessed as to whether they should be treated as equity or financial liabilities. 
Where there is a contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets, they are treated as a financial liability and 
measured at amortised cost using the EIR method after taking account of any discount or premium on the issue and directly 
attributable costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The amount of any discount or premium is amortised over the period to the 
expected call date of the instrument. 
All subordinated notes issued by the Group are classified as financial liabilities. 
(g) Impairment—financial assets
i. Assessment
At each reporting date, the Group assesses its financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss as to whether there is 
objective evidence that the assets are impaired. Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired may include:
• significant financial difficulty of the borrower;
• a breach of contract such as default or delinquency in interest or principal repayments;
• the granting of a concession for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower’s financial condition that the Group would 
not otherwise grant;
• indications that a borrower or issuer will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation;
• the disappearance of an active market for a debt security because of the issuer’s financial difficulties; or
159 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices 2. Significant accounting policies continued
• national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults within groups of financial assets e.g. increases in 
unemployment rates or decreases in property prices relating to the collateral held.
The Group considers evidence for the impairment of loans and advances at both the individual asset and collective level. In certain 
cases, where a borrower is experiencing significant financial distress, the Group may use forbearance measures to assist them 
and mitigate against default. Any forbearance measures agreed are assessed on a case by case basis.
ii. Scope
The Group considers evidence of impairment of financial assets at both an individual asset and collective level.
Individual impairment
All individually significant financial assets are assessed for individual impairment using a range of risk criteria. Those found not to 
be individually impaired are then collectively assessed for any impairment that has been incurred but not yet identified.
Assets may be considered to be individually impaired where they meet one or more of the following criteria:
• a default position equivalent to three or more missed monthly repayments (or a quarterly payment which is more than 30 days 
past due);
• litigation proceedings have commenced;
• act of insolvency, e.g. bankruptcy, administration or liquidation, or appointment of an LPA Receiver;
• invoice finance accounts are classified as in default when there is cessation of additional advances and/or when the facility is in 
collect out; or
• •where there is evidence of fraud.
Collective impairment
All financial assets that are not found to be individually impaired are collectively assessed for impairment by grouping together 
financial assets with similar risk characteristics.
iii. Measurement
Impairment provisions on financial assets individually identified as impaired are calculated as the difference between the carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original EIR.
When assessing collective impairment, the Group estimates incurred losses using a statistical model which multiplies the 
probability of default (“PD”) for each class of customer (using external credit rating information) by the loss given default 
(“LGD”) multiplied by the estimated exposure at default (“EaD”) to arrive at the projected expected loss. An emergence period is 
subsequently applied to the projected expected loss to determine the estimated level of incurred losses at each reporting date. 
In addition, an adjustment is made to discount the imputed cash flows from the model at the assets’ original EIR to arrive at the 
recorded collective provisions. The model’s results are adjusted for management’s judgement as to whether current economic 
and credit conditions are such that actual losses are likely to differ from those suggested by historical modelling.
In assessing the level of collective impairment provisions, the Group uses statistical modelling of historical trends of probability 
of default, the timing of recoveries and the amount of loss incurred, adjusted for management’s judgement as to whether current 
economic and credit conditions are such that actual losses are likely to be greater or less than suggested by historical trends. 
Default rates, loss rates and the expected timing of future recoveries are benchmarked against actual outcomes to ensure they 
remain appropriate.
Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the income statement and a corresponding reduction in the value of the 
financial asset is recognised through the use of an allowance account.
Financial statements
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
continued
160 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 A write-off is made when all or part of a financial asset is deemed uncollectable or forgiven after all collection procedures have 
been completed and the amount of the loss has been determined. Write-offs are charged against amounts previously reflected 
in the allowance account or directly to the income statement. Any additional amounts recovered after a financial asset has been 
previously written-off are offset against the write-off charge in the income statement. Allowances for impairment losses are 
released at the point when it is deemed that, following a subsequent event, the risk has reduced such that an allowance is no 
longer required.
Interest on impaired financial assets is recognised at the same EIR as applied at the initial recognition of the financial asset but 
applied to the book value of the financial asset net of any individual impairment allowance that has been raised.
iv. Impairment of financial assets classified as available for sale
Impairment losses on available for sale debt securities are recognised by reclassifying the losses accumulated in the available for 
sale reserve in equity to the income statement. The cumulative loss that is reclassified from equity to the income statement is 
the difference between the acquisition cost, net of any principal repayment and amortisation, and the current fair value less any 
impairment loss recognised previously in the income statement. Changes in impairment provisions attributable to the effective 
interest method are reflected as a component of interest income.
If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of an impaired available for sale debt security increases and the increase can be related 
objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, then the impairment loss is reversed.
(h) Financial instruments—fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date in the principal market, or in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the 
Group has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk.
Where applicable, the Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that 
instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and 
volume to provide pricing on an ongoing basis.
Where there is no quoted price in an active market, the Group uses valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant 
observable inputs and minimises the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation techniques incorporate factors that 
market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction.
The best evidence of fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is normally the transaction price. If an asset 
measured at fair value has a bid and an offer price, the Group measures assets and long positions at the bid price and liabilities at 
the offer price.
(i) Derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into derivative transactions only for the purpose of reducing exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, 
exchange rates and market indices; they are not used for proprietary trading purposes.
Derivatives are carried at fair value with movements in fair values recorded in the income statement. Derivative financial 
instruments are principally valued by discounted cash flow models using yield curves that are based on observable market data 
or are based on valuations obtained from counterparties. As the Group’s derivatives are covered by master netting agreements 
with the Group’s counterparties, with any net exposures then being further covered by the payment or receipt of periodic cash 
margins, the Group has used a risk-free discount rate for the determination of their fair values.
All derivatives are classified as assets where their fair value is positive and liabilities where their fair value is negative. 
Where there is the current legal ability and intention to settle net, then the derivative is classified as a net asset or liability, as 
appropriate. Where cash collateral is received, to mitigate the risk inherent in amounts due to the Group, it is included as a liability 
within ‘Amounts due to banks’. Where cash collateral is given, to mitigate the risk inherent in amounts due from the Group, it is 
included as an asset in ‘Loans and advances to banks’.

2. Significant accounting policies continued
(j) Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain derivatives held for risk management as hedging instruments in qualifying hedging relationships. 
On initial designation of the hedge, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged 
items, including the risk management objective, the strategy in undertaking the hedge and the method that will be used to assess 
the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The Group makes an assessment, both at the inception of the hedge relationship as 
well as on an ongoing basis as to whether the hedging instruments are expected to be highly effective in offsetting the changes 
in the fair value of the respective hedged items during the period for which the hedge is designated.
i. Fair value hedge accounting for portfolio hedges of interest rate risk
The Group applies fair value hedge accounting for portfolio hedges of interest rate risk. As part of its risk management process, 
the Group identifies portfolios whose interest rate risk it wishes to hedge. The portfolios comprise either only assets or only 
liabilities. The Group analyses each portfolio into repricing time periods based on expected repricing dates, by scheduling cash 
flows into the periods in which they are expected to occur. Using this analysis, the Group designates as the hedged item an 
amount of the assets or liabilities from each portfolio that it wishes to hedge.
The Group measures monthly the change in fair value of the portfolio relating to the interest rate risk that is being hedged. 
Provided that the hedge has been highly effective, the Group recognises the change in fair value of each hedged item in the 
income statement with the cumulative movement in their value being shown on the statement of financial position as a separate 
item, ‘Fair value adjustment for portfolio hedged risk’, either within assets or liabilities as appropriate. This amount is amortised 
on a straight line basis to the income statement over the remaining average life of the original hedge relationship from the month 
in which it is first recognised.
The Group measures the fair value of each hedging instrument monthly. The value is included in derivative financial instruments 
in either assets or liabilities as appropriate, with the change in value recorded in the income statement. Any hedge ineffectiveness 
is recognised in the income statement as the difference between the change in fair value of the hedged item and the change in fair 
value of the hedging instrument.
(k) Embedded derivatives
A derivative may be embedded in another instrument, known as the host contract. Where the economic characteristics and risks 
of an embedded derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract (and the host contract is not carried at fair value 
through profit or loss), the embedded derivative is separated from the host and held on the statement of financial position with 
‘Derivatives held for risk management’ at fair value. Movements in fair value are recognised in the income statement, whilst the 
host contract is accounted for according to the relevant accounting policy for that particular asset or liability. 
Embedded derivatives contained within equity instruments are considered separately. The embedded derivative on the 
contingent convertible securities is not separated as the Group has an accounting policy not to separate a feature that has 
already been considered in determining that the entire issue is a non-derivative equity instrument. 
(l) Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, or deemed cost on transition to IFRSs, less accumulated depreciation 
and any provision for impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset or costs 
incurred in bringing the asset in to use. Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write 
off the cost of each asset to realisable values on a straight line basis over its expected useful life, as follows:
• Fixtures, fittings and equipment five years
• Computer hardware  one to five years
Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment. 
162 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 (m) Intangible assets
i. Goodwill
Goodwill is stated at deemed cost upon transition to IFRSs less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised but 
is tested for impairment on an annual basis. Where impairment is required, the amount is recognised in the income statement and 
cannot be subsequently reversed.
ii. Computer systems
Software acquired by the Group is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Expenditure on internally developed software is recognised as an asset when the Group is able to demonstrate its intention 
and ability to complete the development and use the software in a manner that will generate future economic benefits and can 
reliably measure the costs to complete the development. The capitalised costs of internally developed software include all costs 
directly attributable to developing the software and are amortised over its useful life. Internally developed software is stated at 
capitalised cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment.
Software is amortised on a straight line basis in the income statement over its useful life from the date that it is available for use. 
The estimated useful life of software is one to five years.
(n) Impairment of non financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, i.e. goodwill and other intangible assets, are reviewed at least annually 
to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount 
is estimated.
i. Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to operating 
segments. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of a segment is less than its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount of a segment is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is calculated 
from forecasts by management of post-tax profits for the subsequent five years and a residual value discounted at a risk 
adjusted interest rate appropriate to the cash generating unit. Fair value is determined through review of precedent transactions 
for comparable businesses.
Where impairment is required, the amount is recognised in the income statement and cannot be subsequently reversed.
ii. Other intangible assets
If impairment is indicated, the asset’s recoverable amount, being the greater of value in use and fair value less costs to sell, is 
estimated. Value in use is calculated by discounting the future cash flows from continuing use of the asset. If the carrying value 
of the asset is less than the greater of the value in use and the fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognised in the 
income statement.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
(o) Assets leased to customers
Leases of assets to customers are finance leases as defined by IAS 17. When assets are leased to customers under finance leases, 
the present value of the lease payments is recognised as a receivable. The difference between the gross receivable and the 
present value of the receivable is recognised as unearned finance income. Lease income is recognised within interest income in 
the income statement over the term of the lease using the net investment method (before tax) which reflects a constant periodic 
rate of return ignoring tax cash flows.
(p) Assets leased from third parties
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. 
Payments made under operating leases, net of any incentives received from the lessor, are charged to the income statement, 
within administrative expenses or staff costs (in the case of company cars), on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. 
The Group holds no assets under finance leases.
163 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices 2. Significant accounting policies continued
(q) Provisions
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be 
estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
The Group has an obligation to contribute to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) to enable the FSCS to meet 
compensation claims from, in particular, retail depositors of failed banks. A provision is recognised to the extent it can be reliably 
estimated and from the point when the Group has an obligation in accordance with IAS 37. The amount provided is based on 
information received from the FSCS, forecast future interest rates and the Group’s historic share of industry protected deposits. 
The FSCS provision is recognised at the commencement of the scheme year in line with IFRIC 21.
(r) Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities held at the statement of financial position date are translated into sterling using the exchange rates ruling at the 
statement of financial position date. Exchange differences are charged or credited to the income statement.
(s) Taxation
Taxation comprises current and deferred tax, and is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to 
items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for:
• temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and 
that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
• temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future; and
• taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow the manner in which the Group expects at the 
end of the reporting period to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is measured using 
tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
(t) Pension costs
The cost of providing retirement benefits is charged to the income statement at the amount of the defined contributions payable 
for each year. Differences between contributions payable and those actually paid are shown as accruals or prepayments. 
The Group has no defined benefit pension scheme.
(u) Shareholders’ funds
i. Capital instruments
The Company classifies capital instruments as financial liabilities or equity instruments in accordance with the substance of 
the contractual terms of the instruments. Where an instrument contains no obligation on the Company to deliver cash or other 
financial assets, or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially 
unfavourable to the Group, or where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments but includes 
no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments, then it is treated as an equity instrument. 
Accordingly, the Company’s share capital and contingent convertible securities are presented as components of equity. 
Financial statements
Notes to the consolidated financial statements

164 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Any dividends, interest or other distributions on capital instruments are also recognised in equity. Any related tax is accounted 
for in accordance with IAS 12.
ii. Share premium
Share premium is the amount by which the fair value of the consideration received exceeds the nominal value of the 
shares issued.
(v) Capital raising costs
Costs directly incremental to the raising of share capital are netted against the share premium account. Costs directly 
incremental to the raising of convertible securities included in equity are offset against the proceeds from the issue within equity.
(w) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and balances with a maturity of three months or less from the acquisition 
date which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
(x) Investment in group undertakings
Investments in group undertakings are initially recognised at cost. At each reporting date, an assessment is made as to whether 
there is any indication that the investment may be impaired such that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value. 
(y) Warrants
The Company’s subsidiary, Aldermore Bank PLC, previously issued subordinated notes with attached warrants. The warrants 
gave the holders the right to subscribe for shares in the Company. These warrants were exercised during 2015 resulting in an 
increase in share capital and share premium. On exercise, the warrant reserve was re-classified to retained earnings.
(z) Share-based payment transactions
Employees (including Senior Executives) of the Group may receive remuneration in the form of equity settled share-based 
payments to incentivise and reward future strong, long-term business performance and growth.
The grant date fair value is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity over the period that 
the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards. The grant date fair value is determined using valuation models 
which take into account the terms and conditions attached to the awards. Inputs into valuation models may include the risk-free 
interest rate, the expected volatility of the Company’s share price and other factors related to performance conditions attached 
to the awards.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect differences between expected and actual outcomes, such that the 
amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market 
performance conditions at the vesting date. For share-based payment awards with market performance conditions or non-
vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no 
true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
Within the Parent Company standalone financial statements, the share-based payment transactions are recognised as an 
investment in Group undertakings with an associated credit to the share-based payment reserve.
Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”)
An EBT purchased shares in the Company for the sole purpose of satisfying awards under employee share plans. These shares 
continue to be held within the acquiring EBT, which is consolidated in these financial statements as the EBT is deemed to be 
controlled by the Group.
Where an Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’) purchases the Company’s share capital, the consideration paid is deducted from 
shareholders’ equity as own shares until they are cancelled. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any 
consideration received is included in shareholders’ equity. 
165 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices 3. Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial information requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. The judgements and assumptions that are considered to be 
the most important to the portrayal of the Group’s financial condition are those relating to loan impairment provisions, EIR, and 
Invoice Finance goodwill.
(a) Loan impairment provisions
Loan portfolios across all segments of the Group are reviewed on at least a monthly basis to assess for impairment. 
In determining whether an impairment provision should be recorded, judgements are made as to whether there is objective 
evidence that a financial asset or portfolio of financial assets is impaired as a result of loss events that occurred after recognition 
of the asset and by the reporting date. The calculation of impairment loss is management’s best estimate of losses incurred in the 
portfolio at the statement of financial position date and reflects expected future cash flows based on both the likelihood of a loan 
or advance being written-off and the estimated loss on such a write-off.
At 31 December 2016, gross loans and advances to customers totalled £7,504.7 million (31 December 2015: £6,165.5 million) 
against which impairment allowances of £27.4 million (31 December 2015: £20.7 million) had been made (see Note 22). The Group’s 
accounting policy for loan impairment provisions on financial assets classified as loans and receivables is described in Note 
2(g). Impairment allowances are made up of two components, those determined individually against specific assets and 
those determined collectively. Of the impairment allowance of £27.4 million at 31 December 2016, £14.3 million (31 December 
2015: £10.2 million) relates to individual provisions and £13.1 million (31 December 2015: £10.5 million) relates to collective 
provisions. The section below provides details of the critical elements of judgement within the loan impairment calculations. 
Less significant judgements are not disclosed.
i. Individual
Individual impairment allowances are established against the Group’s individual financial assets that are deemed by management 
to be impaired. The determination of individual impairment allowances requires the exercise of considerable judgement by 
management involving matters such as local economic conditions, the financial status of the customer and the realisable value of 
the security held. The actual amount of the future cash flows and their timing may differ significantly from the assumptions made 
for the purposes of determining the impairment allowances and consequently these allowances can be subject to variation as 
time progresses and the circumstances of the customer become clearer.
ii. Collective
The collective impairment allowance is also subject to estimation uncertainty and, in particular, is sensitive to changes in 
economic and credit conditions, including house prices, unemployment rates, interest rates, borrowers’ behaviour and consumer 
bankruptcy trends. All of these factors can influence the key assumptions detailed below. However, it is inherently difficult to 
estimate how changes in one or more of these factors might impact the collective impairment allowance.
The key assumptions used in the collective impairment model are: probability of default (“PD”), the loss given default (“LGD”) 
and the loss emergence period (“EP”) (the time between a trigger event occurring and the loans being identified as individually 
impaired). An additional element is included within the collective provision to reflect fraud losses that are incurred as at the 
reporting date but are yet to be individually identified. 
The Group uses two types of underlying models to calculate the LGD, depending on the availability of default data. For SME 
Commercial Mortgages, Buy-to-Let and Residential Mortgages the models use a range of key assumptions to derive an 
expected LGD. The key assumptions are based on management expertise and are validated against available data. For Asset 
Finance and Invoice Finance, the models are empirical models which use historical loss data to determine the risk drivers behind 
the loss. 
Financial statements
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
continued
166 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 This allows the portfolios to be segmented into homogeneous buckets to derive an LGD. Further details in respect of assumptions 
and details of the sensitivity of the estimate to changes in significant assumptions are as follows:
Probability of default:
The PD is based on external individual customer credit rating information updated for each reporting date. This external credit 
rating information gives a PD in the next 12 months where ‘default’ is defined as loans which are 2 months or more in arrears 
(“2 MIA”) and incorporates credit information from a broad range of financial services products for each customer.
Management make an estimate so as to adjust the external data to reflect both the individual nature of the Group’s lending and 
the Group’s policy of classifying loans which are 3 months or more in arrears (“3 MIA”) as ‘impaired’. This adjustment is achieved 
by using two management assumptions: firstly a ‘conversion rate’ that reflects how many of the loans which fall into 2 MIA will 
also fall into 3 MIA; and secondly a scalar that adjusts the external PDs to reflect the individual nature of the Group’s lending.
• A 10 per cent. absolute increase in the ‘conversion rate’ assumed by management between 2 MIA and 3 MIA (e.g. a PD increasing 
from 50 per cent to 60 per cent), when the loans are considered to be individually impaired would increase the impairment 
allowance by £0.5 million.
• A 10 per cent. relative reduction in the scaling factors applied to external data in order to arise at PDs appropriate to the 
individual nature of lending being undertaken would increase the impairment allowance by £0.7 million.
Loss given default:
The model calculates the LGD from the point of repossession of the asset. Not all cases that are 3 MIA will reach repossession. 
Management therefore adjust the model by applying an assumption of the percentage of accounts 3 MIA that will 
reach repossession.
• A 10 per cent. absolute reduction in this assumption would decrease the impairment allowance by £0.5 million.
The LGD is also sensitive to the application of the House Price Index (“HPI”) and Forced Sale Discount (“FSD”) which affect the 
underlying value of the collateral which is expected to be received.
• A 10 per cent. relative reduction in the HPI would increase the overall impairment allowance by £2.6 million.
• A 5 per cent. absolute increase in the FSD would increase the overall impairment provision by £2.0 million.
The above assumptions are important factors when calculating the LGD to be applied for the Mortgage business. 
For the Asset Finance and Invoice Finance model, the assumption with most judgment is the absolute LGD value calculated.
• A 10 per cent. relative increase in the LGD’s applied in Asset Finance and Invoice Finance would increase the overall impairment 
allowance by £0.9 million.
Emergence period:
The Group’s collective models estimate the expected losses for the next 12 months, these are then scaled back using the 
emergence period to reflect the level of incurred loss as at the reporting date. The emergence period is the time taken from 
the trigger event (such as a job loss) to the Group identifying the loan as impaired. The emergence period varies by segment 
and requires management to make judgements because of the limited data available. During the year, management increased 
the emergence period applied to the Mortgage businesses by three months in order to apply a degree of caution to reflect the 
potential impact of political and economic uncertainty resulting from the EU referendum. The impact of this change was to 
increase the collective provisions by £1.6 million.
• A further three month increase in emergence periods for Asset Finance and Invoice Finance would increase the overall 
impairment allowance by £4.5 million.
167 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices 3. Use of estimates and judgements continued
(b) Effective interest rate (“EIR”)
IAS 39 requires interest earned from mortgages to be measured under the EIR method. Management must therefore use 
judgement to estimate the expected life of each type of instrument and hence the expected related cash flows. The accuracy of 
the EIR would therefore be affected by unexpected market movements resulting in altered customer behaviour and inaccuracies 
in the models used compared to actual outcomes.
A critical estimate in determining EIR is the expected life to maturity of the Group’s SME Commercial, Buy-to-Let and Residential 
Mortgage portfolios, as a change in these estimates will impact the period over which the directly attributable costs and fees and 
any discount received on the acquisition of mortgage portfolios are recognised as part of the EIR.
Included within the overall Mortgages book, are a small number of portfolios which were acquired by the Group and, as at 
31 December 2016, represent approximately 2 per cent, 2 per cent and 3 per cent of SME Commercial, Buy-to-Let and Residential 
Mortgages net loans respectively. These portfolios were acquired at a discount which is being recognised under the EIR method. 
As disclosed below, these portfolios, although representing a small proportion of overall lending, are sensitive to a change in the 
expected repayment profiles which would impact the periods over which the discount is to be unwound.
As at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 , a reassessment was made of the estimates used in respect of the expected lives 
of the SME Commercial, Buy-to-Let and Residential Mortgage portfolios and also of those for the Asset Finance portfolios. As a 
consequence, an overall adjustment of £0.5 million (2015: £0.4 million) was recorded to increase the value of the loan portfolios 
and the interest income recognised in the current period, so that interest can continue to be recognised at the original effective 
interest rate over the remaining life of the relevant lending portfolios.
The adjustment made at 31 December is analysed as follows:
Impact on 2016 
interest income 
£m
Impact on 2015 
interest income 
£m
Asset Finance - organic lending (1.8) (1.6)
SME Commercial - acquired portfolios – (0.7)
SME Commercial - organic lending 0.2 (0.9)
Buy-to-Let - acquired portfolios (1.1) (0.6)
Buy-to-Let - organic lending 0.1 0.1 
Residential - acquired portfolios (0.4) (1.1)
Residential - organic lending 3.5 5.2 
0.5 0.4 
A change in the estimated expected lives, after taking account of the above adjustment, to extend the expected lives of 
the SME Commercial, Buy-to-Let and Residential Mortgage portfolios by six months would have the effect of reducing the 
cumulative profit before tax recognised as at 31 December 2016 by £1.4 million (31 December 2015: £1.5 million). Included within 
this sensitivity of £1.4 million, is a £3.1 million cumulative reduction in profit relating to acquired portfolios (31 December 
2015: £2.8 million) due to a change in the unwind of the discount which is offset by a £1.7 million cumulative increase in profit 
relating to the organic portfolios (31 December 2015: £1.3 million).
A 0.5 per cent. increase in the rate of early redemptions, expressed as a percentage of the outstanding balance in respect of the 
Asset Finance portfolio would have the impact of reducing cumulative profit before tax recognised as at 31 December 2016 by 
£0.5 million (31 December 2015: £0.3 million).
(c) Share-based payments
The fair value of the share awards is calculated using statistical models. The inputs to these models require management 
judgement to estimate the probability and timings of events taking place in the future. The significant inputs used in the models 
include the exercise price, share price, expected volatility, expected life and the risk free rate. The share-based payment 
recognised can be materially affected by these assumptions. Further information on the key assumptions can be found in Note 37. 
Financial statements
Notes to the consolidated financial statements

168 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 (d) Invoice Finance goodwill
IAS 36 requires an assessment of goodwill balances for impairment on at least an annual basis. An impairment charge should be 
recognised where the recoverable amount from the segment is less than the carrying value of the goodwill.
During 2016, as a result of the general fall in market values of financial services businesses that occurred following the EU 
referendum, there was an indication of impairment and the Invoice Finance goodwill was fully impaired. An impairment charge of 
£4.1 million has been recognised in the income statement. 
4. Segmental information
The Group has five reportable operating segments as described below which are based on the Group’s five lending segments 
plus Central Functions. Each segment offers groups of similar products and services and are managed separately based on the 
Group’s internal reporting structure.
SME Commercial Mortgages, Buy-to-Let and Residential Mortgages are operated under a single management team and 
supported by a single IT platform. Shared administrative expenses in the mortgage business have been apportioned across these 
segments on the basis of business activity levels in each segment. 
However, the characteristics of the three segments are sufficiently different, are reported separately to the Board and therefore, 
they represent separate operating segments in accordance with IFRS 8. 
For each of the reportable segments, the Board, which is the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker, reviews internal 
management reports on a monthly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s 
reportable segments:
• Asset Finance - Lease and hire purchase financing for SMEs, focusing on sectors with strong returns and liquid secondary 
asset markets;
• Invoice Finance - provides UK SMEs with working capital solutions through invoice discounting, factoring and asset 
based lending;
• SME Commercial Mortgages - Property finance needs of professional, commercial property investors, and owner-occupier 
SMEs. Targets prime and specialist prime segments with loan sizes generally below £5 million;
• Buy-to-Let - Offers a wide range of standard and specialist buy-to-let mortgages for residential units, multi-unit freehold or 
houses with multiple-occupation (“HMO”) to both individuals and companies; and
• Residential Mortgages - Prime residential mortgages targeting underserved segments of creditworthy borrowers that 
provide attractive and sustainable margins.
Central Functions includes the reconciling items between the total of the five reportable operating segments and the 
consolidated income statement. As well as common costs, Central Functions includes the Group’s Treasury and Savings 
functions which are responsible for raising finance on behalf of the operating segments. The costs of raising finance are all 
recharged by Central Functions to the operating segments, apart from those costs relating to the subordinated notes and the net 
expense/income from derivatives held at fair value shown in Note 6.
Common costs are incurred on behalf of the operating segments and typically represent savings administration, back 
office and support function costs such as Finance, Risk and Human Resources. The costs are not directly attributable to the 
operating segments.
Information regarding the results of each reportable segment and their reconciliation to the total results of the Group is shown 
below. Performance is measured based on the segmental result as included in the internal management reports.

Long-term incentive schemes
The Directors held certain shares pre-IPO which converted into ordinary shares on IPO. The reported gains, at IPO, have been 
calculated as the market value of shares held at IPO (£1.92) less the actual cost on any shares bought pre-IPO regardless of 
whether such shares were acquired as an investment or an incentive. The aggregate gains as at 31 December 2015 on such 
shares held by Directors on IPO were £7.8 million.
The Deferred Share Plan is an equity settled share-based payment and represents the portion of the Annual Incentive Plan that is 
deferred to align the interests of senior employees and the Executive team with shareholders. The shares granted as part of the 
Deferred Share Plan are detailed in Note 37.
14. Pension and other post-retirement benefit commitments
The Group operates two defined contribution pension schemes. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those 
of the Group in independently administered funds. Pension contributions of £1.7 million (31 December 2015: £1.6 million) were 
charged to the income statement during the year in respect of these schemes. The Group made payments amounting to £5,300 
(31 December 2015: £26,500) in aggregate in respect of Directors’ individual personal pension plans during the year. There were 
outstanding contributions of £0.3 million at the year end (31 December 2015: £0.3 million).

18. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Group by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
2016 2015
Profit after taxation - attributable to equity holders of the Group (£ million) 93.5 78.3 
Coupon paid on contingent convertible securities, net of tax relief (£ million) (6.6) (2.8)
Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Group (£ million) 86.9 75.5 
Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue (million) 344.5 332.4 
Basic earnings per share (p) 25.2p 22.7p
The ordinary shares in issue used in the denominator in the calculation of basic earnings per share are the ordinary shares of the 
Company since the share reorganisation that occurred on the Company’s admission to the LSE on 13 March 2015. Further details 
of the share reorganisation are provided in Note 36. 
The calculation of diluted earnings per share has been based on the same profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the 
Group as for basic earnings and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding after the potential dilutive effect 
of share-based payment awards to Directors and employees. The share warrants, giving rise to dilution for the first half of 2015, 
were exercised on 9 September 2015 and new shares were issued and listed on the London Stock Exchange.

Reductions have been enacted in the mainstream UK corporation tax rate from 21% to 20% (effective from 1 April 2015). 
Further planned reductions have been enacted to reduce the mainstream rate to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and to 17% with 
effect from 1 April 2020. The 8% corporation tax banking surcharge applicable to banking companies is effective from 1 January 
2016. The surcharge is levied on the profits chargeable to corporation tax of banking companies which exceed a £25 million 
threshold. The net result of these changes will be to increase the Group’s effective tax rate for years commencing from 
1 January 2016.
Deferred tax has been provided at the revised substantively enacted rates that will apply when the deferred tax assets are 
realised or the deferred tax liabilities settled in line with the prior year.
There were no unrecognised deferred tax balances at 31 December 2016 (31 December 2015: £nil).

Goodwill arose on the acquisitions of Ruffler Holdings Limited (subsequently renamed Aldermore Holdings Limited), Base 
Commercial Mortgages Holdings Limited and Absolute Invoice Finance (Holdings) Limited. For the purpose of impairment testing, 
goodwill is allocated to the Group’s operating segments with the aggregate amount allocated to each segment as follows:
2016
£m
2015
£m
SME Commercial Mortgages 8.5 8.5 
Invoice Finance – 4.1 
8.5 12.6 
At 1 January 2016, the Invoice Finance goodwill was fully supported using the Fair Value less Costs of Disposal (“FVLCD”) 
method. During 2016, as a result of the general fall in market values of financial services businesses following the EU referendum, 
management concluded the goodwill balance was fully impaired and a charge of £4.1 million has been recognised in the 
income statement.
The Value in Use (“VIU”) for SME Commercial Mortgages was determined by discounting the future cash flows to be 
generated from the continuing use of the segment. VIU at 31 December 2016 has been determined in a similar manner as at 
31 December 2015.
182 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Key assumptions used in the calculation of VIU were the following: 
• Cash flows were projected based on past experience, actual operating results and the five year business plan (31 December 
2015: the five year business plan). Cash flows after the planning period were extrapolated using a constant growth rate of 2 per 
cent (31 December 2015: 2 per cent) into perpetuity. 
• A pre-tax discount rate of 13.0 per cent (31 December 2015: 13.0 per cent) was applied in determining the recoverable amounts 
for the SME Commercial Mortgages operating segment. These discount rates were based on the weighted average cost of 
funding for the segment, taking into account the Group’s regulatory capital requirement and expected market returns for debt 
and equity funding, then adjusted for risk premiums to reflect the systemic risk of the segment.
IAS 36 requires an assessment of goodwill balances for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if there is an indication 
of impairment. An impairment charge should be recognised where the recoverable amount from the segment is less than the 
carrying value of the goodwill. Under IAS 36, the recoverable amount is the greater of either the VIU of a business or its Fair Value 
less Costs of Disposal (“FVLCD”). 
The VIU of the SME Commercial Mortgages segment is significantly above the carrying value of the attributable goodwill and 
net assets. The Group estimates that reasonably possible changes in the above assumptions are not expected to cause the 
recoverable amount of SME Commercial Mortgages to reduce below the carrying amount.

Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”)
In common with all regulated UK deposit takers, the Group’s principal subsidiary, Aldermore Bank PLC, pays levies to the 
FSCS to enable the FSCS to meet claims against it. The FSCS levy consists of two parts: a management expenses levy and a 
compensation levy. The management expenses levy covers the costs of running the scheme and the compensation levy covers 
the amount of compensation the scheme pays net of any recoveries it makes using the rights that have been assigned to it. 
The FSCS provision at 31 December 2016 of £0.8 million (31 December 2015: £1.1 million) represents the interest element of the 
compensation levy for the 2016/2017 scheme year (31 December 2015: interest levy for the 2015/2016 scheme year).

184 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Customer redress
The Group has a small number of loans which are regulated under the Consumer Credit Act (“CCA”) and had identified that, 
following changes to the CCA in 2008, certain letters and statements were sent to customers that did not fully comply with 
the requirements prescribed by the CCA. Accordingly, these customers were entitled to redress for interest and fees charged 
on the relevant loans as a result of this technical non-compliance notwithstanding there is unlikely to have been any customer 
detriment. Remediation payments to customers impacted were completed during the year ended 31 December 2015.

part from time to time, such redemptions being limited to the net capital received from mortgage customers in respect of the 
underlying assets. There is no obligation for the Group to make good any shortfall. Further disclosure relating to the underlying 
assets is contained in Note 22.

During 2012, the Group issued £40 million subordinated 12.875 per cent loan notes, repayable in 2022, with an option for the Group 
to redeem after five years. The interest rate is fixed until May 2017. The loan notes were issued at a discount and are carried in 
the statement of financial position at amortised cost using an EIR of 18.597 per cent. In addition to the loan notes, a warrant was 
issued by the Group’s parent company, Aldermore Group PLC. The warrants were valued at £2.2 million, and this was treated as 
a warrant reserve within equity in accordance with the accounting policy in Note 2(f). On 9 September 2015, the warrants were 
exercised resulting in 5.5 million ordinary £0.10 shares being issued (see Note 36). 
On 28 October 2016, the Group issued £60 million subordinated 8.50 per cent loan notes, repayable in 2026, with an option for 
the Group to redeem after five years. The interest rate is fixed until October 2021. The loan is carried in the statement of financial

On 13 March 2015, the Company reorganised its share capital in preparation for listing on the LSE. Following the reorganisation, 
117,934,783 ordinary shares of £0.10 each were issued in the IPO at a price of £1.92 per share. Of the 117,934,783 shares in the 
offer, 78,872,283 were sold by existing shareholders, with the remaining 39,062,500 being issued by the Company, resulting in an 
increase in share capital of £3,906,250 and share premium account of £71,093,750 (excluding costs).
Ordinary shares have full voting rights, dividend rights and distribution rights in the event of sale or wind up.
Following the listing, the Company made an award of free share awards under the Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”). Further details 
regarding the SIP are provided in Note 37. Of that original award 734 shares remain unallocated and are held in the SIP Trust, and 
are recorded against retained earnings within equity. The SIP Trustee waives any dividends that may be declared in respect of 
unallocated shares.

During June 2016, an Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”) purchased 466,179 Aldermore Group PLC ordinary £0.10 shares from the 
market for consideration of £0.9 million. Purchases were made to enable the Group to meet a future share-based payment 
obligation in respect of the recruitment award detailed in Note 37. These purchases constitute Aldermore Group PLC shares held 
by a Group EBT and are recorded against retained earnings within equity. The EBT waives any dividends that may be declared in 
respect of such shares prior to their release to the participant.
At 31 December 2016, there were 344,739,584 ordinary £0.10 shares in issue resulting in share capital of £34,473,958

186 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 The terms of the schemes are as follows:
a) Performance Share Plan
The Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) is open to senior employees including the Executive team. There are currently awards 
outstanding for two plan years as per the table above. Individuals are required to remain in employment for three years following 
the grant date and the awards are subject to a two-year holding period following the required employment date.
Awards under the PSP are subject to performance conditions which are set by the Remuneration Committee and determine the 
extent to which awards can become available to individuals. Performance conditions for the PSP awards relate to the growth 
in Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) for 50% of each award and Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) performance for the remaining 50% 
of each award. The outcome of the performance conditions, as assessed by the Remuneration Committee, will determine the 
vesting outcome of the awards and the shares available for exercise.
In addition, there are “underpin” performance conditions which must be met in relation to both elements of the award and 
the result achieved must both appropriately reflect the performance of the Company and be consistent with the Company’s 
risk appetite. Furthermore, in respect of the TSR element of the grant made in 2015, the value of the TSR achieved over the 
performance period must be equal to or greater than the TSR of the median company of FTSE 350 companies, excluding 
Investment Trusts and the Company itself.
b) Pre-IPO Award under the Performance Share Plan
Pre-IPO Awards in respect of 6,920,420 shares, which were granted on 2 March 2015 to individuals as a one-off reward to 
recognise their contribution up to the Company’s IPO, have lapsed as the principal performance condition relating to growth in 
TSR for the period to 31 December 2016 was not satisfied.
c) “Top Up” Pre-IPO awards under the Performance Share Plan
For the small number of employees who had been granted a “Top Up” Pre-IPO Award at the time of IPO which was intended to 
promote their retention and to reward them for their performance both pre-IPO and post-IPO, the Remuneration Committee 
amended the “Top Up” portion of those awards over 513,589 shares such that:
• The principal performance condition was a personal performance condition, as well as an underpin whereby the Remuneration 
Committee would determine that the performance of the Company justified the vesting. The Remuneration Committee 
determined that the amended performance condition and underpin had been met as at 31 December 2016. 
• The awards normally become exercisable on 31 December 2018 and are contingent on employment to this date, with a leaver 
receiving a pro-rated proportion of the shares (for the period 31 December 2016 to 31 December 2018) except if the individual 
ceases employment because of misconduct in which case the whole award would lapse. 
The total incremental fair value arising from the modification of the awards is £1,188,000 of which £16,000 has been reflected in 
the 2016 income statement charge. The fair value of the awards has been determined using the market price of Aldermore Group 
PLC shares as at 22 December 2016.
d) Restricted Share Plan
The Restricted Share Plan (“RSP”) is open to a small number of senior employees engaged in risk and control functions. There is 
a requirement for individuals to remain in employment for three years following the grant date, following which the awards are 
subject to a two-year holding period. There are no financial performance conditions attached to the awards under the RSP.
e) Recruitment Award
The Recruitment Award was granted for the purpose of buying out awards forfeited by senior employees on resignation from 
their previous employment. There are no performance conditions attached to this award. The award will be released in tranches 
with twenty per cent vesting on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date and forty per cent on the fourth 
anniversary of the award, subject to continued employment.
187 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices 37. Share-based payments continued
f) Share Incentive Plan
All employees who were in employment on both 13 March 2015 and the grant date were eligible to participate in the Share 
Incentive Plan (“SIP”). An award of ‘free shares’ was granted under the SIP on 17 April 2015. Each eligible employee received 
shares worth £200, with an additional £200 for each year of service up to a maximum award of £1,000. There are no performance 
conditions associated with the share awards. Participants in the SIP are the beneficial owners of the shares granted to them, but 
not the registered owner. Voting rights are normally exercised by the registered owner at the direction of the participant.
g) Sharesave Plan
All employees are eligible to participate in the Group’s annual invitation to join the Sharesave Plan. The grant dates of the awards 
are shown in the table above, with individuals in the Plan contributing a set amount each month for three years. At the end of 
the savings period, participants have the option to buy shares in Aldermore Group PLC at an option price which was fixed at the 
grant date.
There are no financial performance conditions attached to the awards but employees may only continue to participate in the Plan 
whilst in the employment of the Group, and subject to having made all monthly contributions. Participants have the option, but 
not the obligation, to buy shares at the end of the plan. There are no holding conditions in respect of shares acquired pursuant to 
the exercise of an option.
h) Deferred Share Plan
The Deferred Share Plan (“DSP”) is open to senior employees, including the Executive team, and represents the portion of 
awards under the Annual Incentive Plan that is deferred to align the interests of senior employees and the Executive team with 
shareholders. The awards typically vest in tranches of one-third on the first, second and third anniversary of the award date, 
subject to continued employment. There are no market performance conditions attached to the awards made under the DSP. 
Share awards, representing the deferred element of the 2015 bonus payments, with a grant date fair value of £1.2 million, were 
granted in March 2016.
There is an anticipation that share awards for the deferred element of the 2016 bonuses, with a grant date fair value of 
£1.6 million, will be made in 2017.

Determination of grant date fair values
Share awards are not entitled to dividends until the awards vest, but the number of shares subject to vested PSP, RSP and DSP 
awards may be increased to reflect the value of dividends that would have been paid up to the end of the holding period for the 
awards. This is designed to deliver a benefit similar to that which ordinary shareholders may receive in respect of any dividends 
paid during the vesting period. Accordingly, the grant date fair value of the awards with no performance conditions other than 
service conditions has been taken as the market value of the Company’s ordinary shares at the grant date.
In respect of awards for which there are non-market performance conditions (e.g. EPS), the grant date fair value per award has 
been taken as the market value of an ordinary share at the grant date. A forecast is made of the number of awards expected 
to vest in order to determine the overall share-based payment charge to be recognised over the vesting period. In respect of 
awards for which there are market performance conditions (e.g. TSR), the grant date fair value of each award is required to reflect 
the likelihood of achieving the market conditions within the valuation. 
For the awards concerned, the grant date fair values for each award were determined using stochastic simulation models with 
the following significant inputs:
PSP
Ordinary share price £2.29
Risk-free rate 0.50% p.a.
Probability distributions of TSRs for Aldermore and the median FTSE 350 (excluding Investment Trust companies) Log normal

Contingent convertible securities 74.0 74.0 
On 9 December 2014, the Company issued £75 million Fixed Rate Reset Additional Tier 1 Perpetual Subordinated Contingent 
Convertible Securities (the “Securities”). Net proceeds arising from the issuance, after deducting issuance costs and the 
associated tax credit, totalled £74.0 million.
The Securities are perpetual and have no fixed redemption date. Redemption of the Securities is at the option of the Company 
on 30 April 2020 and annually thereafter. The Securities bear interest at an initial rate of 11.875 per cent per annum until 30 April 
2020 and thereafter at the relevant Reset Interest Rate as provided in the Information Memorandum. Interest is payable on the 
Securities annually in arrears on each interest payment date commencing 30 April 2015 and is non-cumulative. The Borrower has 
the full discretion to cancel any interest scheduled to be paid on the Securities.
The Securities are convertible into Ordinary Shares of the Company in the event of the Group’s Common equity ratio falling 
below 7 per cent. As the Securities contain no obligation on the Company to make payments of principal or interest, they have 
been classified as equity instruments as required by IAS 32. Accordingly, the Securities have been included in equity at the 
fair value of the proceeds received less any direct costs attributable to the issue of the Securities, net of tax relief thereon. 
Any interest paid on the Securities, net of tax relief thereon, is a distribution to holders of equity instruments and has been 
recognised directly in equity on the payment date. Although there are number of additional terms relating to events such as 
acquisition and wind up, there are no circumstances in which the Group has an unavoidable obligation to issue a variable number 
of its own shares. The Group has not separated any embedded derivative features because the Group has an accounting 
policy not to separate a feature that has already been considered in determining that the entire issue is a non-derivative 
equity instrument.

Legislation
As a financial services group, Aldermore Group PLC is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation. The Group must 
comply with numerous laws and regulations which significantly affect the way it does business. Whilst the Group believes there 
are no unidentified areas of failure to comply with these laws and regulations which would have a material impact on the financial 
statements, there can be no guarantee that all issues have been identified.
41. Related parties
(a) Controlling parties
Prior to IPO, the Group was controlled by AnaCap Financial Partners, II L.P. (52.3 per cent. of voting rights) and AnaCap Financial 
Partners, L.P. (47.7 per cent. of voting rights) who were the sole voting shareholders of Aldermore Group PLC. 
On 13 March 2015, the Company was admitted to the LSE, offering 117,934,783 Ordinary shares, of which 78,872,283 shares were 
sold by the Selling shareholders. Upon admission, AnaCap Financial Partners L.P., AnaCap Financial Partners II L.P., AnaCap Derby 
Co-Investment (No.1.) L.P. and AnaCap Derby Co-Investment (No.2.) (collectively “the Principal Shareholders”) and the Company 
entered into the ‘Relationship agreement’. Details of the Relationship agreement were provided within the Prospectus issued 
prior to the admission to the LSE.
On 15 September 2015, the Principal Shareholders sold 40,885,613 Ordinary £0.10 shares on the open market.
At 31 December 2016, AnaCap Financial Partners L.P., AnaCap Financial Partners II L.P., AnaCap Derby Co-Investment (No.1.) L.P. 
and AnaCap Derby Co-Investment (No.2.) L.P held 8.33 per cent, 11.01 per cent, 11.26 per cent and 9.54 per cent of the Company’s 
ordinary share capital respectively. Although the Principal Shareholders are no longer a controlling party for the Group they 
continue to have significant influence and are therefore considered to be a related party.
The Group had agreements in place with Syscap Limited which was previously under the control of Anacap Financial Partners 
II L.P and Anacap Financial Partners, L.P. Syscap Limited ceased to be a related party when Anacap sold their interest on 
20 February 2015. Details of the previous agreements in place are listed in the Aldermore Group PLC 2015 report and accounts.
During 2016, the Group also incurred fees of £0.1 million in relation to the Directors who represent the Principal Shareholders 
(2015: £0.1 million).

The table above includes transactions and balances relating to KMP in post at the end of the year. 
From 1 January 2015 until admission to the LSE, a number of KMP had loans with the Company. Upon admission, the Company 
forgave loans totalling £0.2 million. A number of KMP continue to have loans and deposits in the ordinary course of business with 
the Group. 
At 31 December 2016, there is one loan with KMP for the value of £40,000 (31 December 2015: two loans, £126,000). All current 
transactions, loans and deposits, with KMP are conducted through the ordinary course of business with the Group. 
During 2015 and up to admission, interest rates charged on loan balances outstanding from related parties were lower than the 
rates that would be charged in arm’s length transactions. Interest was charged on these loans at an annual rate of 0.8 per cent 
above one month LIBOR. 
All deposit arrangements have been operated by the Group on commercial terms and conditions.

the statement of financial position at fair value. The fair values in this note are stated at a specific date and may be significantly 
different from the amounts which will actually be paid on the maturity or settlement dates of the instruments. As a wide range of 
valuation techniques are available, it may be inappropriate to compare this fair value information to that of independent market or 
other financial institutions.

Total financial liabilities 7 ,679.0 7,714.3 6,396.7 6,418.3 
Key considerations in the calculation of the disclosed fair values for those financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost 
include the following:
(a) Cash and balances at central banks 
These represent amounts with an initial maturity of less than three months and, as such, their carrying value is considered a 
reasonable approximation of their fair value.
(b) Loans and advances to banks
These represent either amounts with an initial maturity of less than three months or longer term variable rate deposits placed 
with banks, where adjustments to fair value in respect of the credit risk of the counterparty are not considered necessary. 
Accordingly, the carrying value of the assets is considered to be not materially different from their fair value.
(c) Loans and advances to customers
For fixed rate lending products, the Group has estimated the fair value of the fixed rate interest cash flows by discounting 
those cash flows by the current appropriate market reference rate used for pricing equivalent products plus the credit spread 
attributable to the borrower. For standard variable rate lending products, and fixed rate products when they revert to the Group’s 
standard variable rate, the interest rate on such products is considered equivalent to a current market product rate and, as 
such, the Group considers the discounted future cash flows of these mortgages to be equal to their carrying value. The fair value 
estimations do not incorporate adjustments for changes in future credit risk, since loans were granted. However, incurred loss 
provisions are deducted from the fair value amounts.
(d) Other assets and liabilities
These represent short term receivables and payables and, as such, their carrying value is not considered to be materially 
different from their fair value.
(e) Amounts due to banks
These mainly represent securities sold under agreements to repurchase which were drawn down from the Bank of England 
under the terms of the Funding for Lending and Term Funding Schemes. These transactions are collateralised by UK Government 
Treasury Bills, which have a low susceptibility to credit risk, so adjustments to fair value in respect of the credit risk of the 
counterparty are not considered necessary. Accordingly, the carrying value of the liabilities are not considered to be materially 
different from their fair value.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

42. Financial instruments and fair value continued
(f) Customers’ accounts
The fair value of fixed rate customers’ accounts have been determined by discounting estimated future cash flows based on 
rates currently offered by the Group for equivalent deposits. Customers’ accounts at variable rates are at current market rates 
and therefore, the Group regards the fair value to be equal to the carrying value. The estimated fair value of deposits with no 
stated maturity is the amount repayable on demand.
(g) Debt securities in issue 
As the securities are actively traded in a recognised market, with readily available and quoted prices, these have been used to 
value the securities. These securities are therefore regarded as having Level 1 fair values, see below. 
(h) Subordinated notes
The estimated fair value of the subordinated notes is based on discounted cash flows using interest rates for similar liabilities 
with the same remaining maturity, credit ranking and rating. The calculated fair value takes no account of the warrants issued 
separately to the holders of the 2012 subordinated notes, which have been separately accounted for as a capital contribution 
within equity on issue. The warrants attached to the subordinated notes were exercised during September 2015 (see note 36).
The following table provides an analysis of financial assets and liabilities held on the consolidated statement of financial position 
at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:

196 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Level 1: Fair value determined using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2:  Fair value determined using directly or indirectly observable inputs other than unadjusted quoted prices included within 
Level 1 that are observable.
Level 3: Fair value determined using one or more significant inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The fair values of UK Gilts, Supranational bonds, Corporate bonds and Covered bonds are based on quoted bid prices in 
active markets.
The fair value of asset-backed securities are based on indicative prices provided by market counterparties, but before relying on 
these prices, the Group has obtained an understanding of how the prices were derived to ensure that each investment is assigned 
an appropriate classification within the fair value hierarchy.
The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities are determined using widely recognised valuation methods for financial 
instruments such as interest rate swaps and use only observable market data that require little management judgement 
and estimation. Credit value and debit value adjustments have not been applied as the derivative assets and liabilities are 
largely collateralised.
Fair value measurement – financial assets and liabilities held at amortised cost
All the fair values of financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost are considered to be Level 2 valuations which are 
determined using directly or indirectly observable inputs other than unadjusted quoted prices, except for debt securities in issue 
which are Level 1 and loans and advances to customers which are Level 3.
Fair value of transferred assets and associated liabilities
Securitisation vehicle
The sale of the beneficial ownership of the loans and advances to customers to the securitisation vehicle by the Bank fail the 
derecognition criteria, and consequently, these loans remain on the statement of financial position of the Group. The Bank, 
therefore, recognises a deemed loan financial liability on its statement of financial position and an equivalent deemed loan 
asset is held on the securitisation vehicle’s statement of financial position. As the securitisation vehicle is consolidated into the 
Group with the Bank, the deemed loans net out in the consolidated accounts. The deemed loans are repaid as and when principal 
repayments are made by customers against these transferred loans and advances.
The securitisation vehicle has issued fixed and floating rate notes which are secured on loans and advances to customers. 
The notes are redeemable in part from time to time, such redemptions being limited to the net capital received from mortgagors 
in respect of the underlying assets.
The Group retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. The Group benefits to the extent to which surplus 
income generated by the transferred mortgage portfolios exceeds the administration costs of these mortgages. The Group 
continues to bear the credit risk of these mortgage assets.

Share fraud – warning to 
shareholders
In recent years, a number of other 
companies have become aware 
that their shareholders have 
received unsolicited phone calls 
or correspondence concerning 
investment matters. These are typically 
from overseas-based organisations 
who target UK shareholders, offering 
to sell them what often turn out to be 
worthless or high-risk shares in US 
or UK investments. These operations 
are commonly known as “boiler 
rooms”. They can be very persistent 
and extremely persuasive, and may 
attempt to persuade individuals to 
provide email addresses or other 
personal information. We are not aware 
of any Aldermore Group investors 
having been targeted, but we would 
urge you to remain vigilant.
It is not just the novice investor that 
has been duped in this way; many of the 
victims had been successfully investing 
for several years. 5,000 people contact 
the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) 
about share fraud each year, with 
victims losing an average of £20,000. 
The FCA provides the following 
guidance should you be contacted in 
this manner:
• obtain the name of the person calling 
and the organisation they represent;

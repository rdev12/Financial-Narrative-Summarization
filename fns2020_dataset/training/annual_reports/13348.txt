Prospering in a
challenging marketplace
This information has been extracted from the statutory accounts of the group which were approved on 4 April 2007. 
This information in itself does not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of section 240 Companies Act 1985. I am delighted to report that the Group has enjoyed another
successful year of profitable growth. 2006 was, in many ways, 
a watershed year for The Restaurant Group – the first full twelve
months of trading in its new form. You will recall that 2005 was 
a year of considerable change for the Group on the corporate
front, as we continued to direct our focus away from the
increasingly crowded high street marketplace and positioned 
our business firmly in the out of town segments of the eating 
out market. This was in line with our strategy of focusing on
markets with distinct barriers to entry, good growth prospects 
and high returns on investment. The impact of these changes 
is clear to see in this set of results. 
For 2006 we delivered a like-for-like sales increase of 5% which
was a fantastic performance. As a result, our adjusted profit
before tax grew by 19% on the prior year. In addition, our strong
cash generation enabled the Group to add 47 new restaurants
(including rebranding former DPP units) to its portfolio during the
year, taking the total number of outlets to 284. 
Building on a strong first half performance we made further good
progress during the second six months to produce excellent full
year results. Full year adjusted pre-tax profit increased by 19% to
£35.0m (2005: £29.5m) with turnover from our principal trading
brands increasing by 24% to £308.7m (2005: £248.8m). Adjusted
earnings per share increased by 27% to 11.50p (2005: 9.08p). 
As a result of this excellent performance the Board is
recommending an increased final dividend of 4.95p per share
(2005: 3.84p), an increase of 29%, giving a total dividend for 
the year of 6.00p (2005: 4.75p) per share. Subject to approval 
at the Annual General Meeting, the final dividend will be payable
on 4 July 2007 to shareholders on the register on 8 June 2007
and the shares will be marked ex-dividend on 6 June 2007. As
detailed in my interim statement, we also paid a special dividend
of £34.8m during the first half of the year. 
Our Leisure Division which incorporates Frankie & Benny’s,
Chiquito, Blubeckers and Garfunkel’s enjoyed another excellent
year, recording a 27% increase in operating profit. All of the
brands delivered strong like-for-like growth during 2006 and we
look forward to a continuation of this trend in 2007. During the
year we opened 41 new restaurants in this division and we expect
to open approximately 30 more units in the Leisure Division during
2007. Our new openings are performing well and we continue to
enjoy high levels of return on investment. The performance of 
our co-located units (Frankie & Benny’s and Chiquito) has been
particularly pleasing and we believe that there is scope to continue
this pattern of dual roll-out. 
Our Concessions Division delivered a terrific set of results with
operating profits for this division increasing by 24%. Against a very
challenging backdrop for parts of 2006, this was an outstanding
performance. We opened six new units during the year and we
are pleased with the initial performance. This year we expect to
open a further 2-5 new units in the Concessions Division. 
During 2006 we concluded the conversion programme for 13 
of the DPP sites which we acquired in early 2006 and the results
from these have been pleasing. The remaining sites have been, or
will be, sold or closed. Although the performance of our associate
company, Living Ventures, was disappointing we are encouraged
that the actions being taken by their management are beginning 
to impact positively on performance. Notwithstanding this, we
have made a provision of £9.5m against our carrying value of the
loan note, which has no cash impact, following an impairment
review of our investment and loan note.
Overall, this is an outstanding set of results and demonstrates
both the strength and potential of our business and its brands.
However, none of this would have been possible without the hard
work and dedication of our senior management team and staff.
We have a fantastic team at The Restaurant Group and on behalf
of the Board I would like to thank them all for their valued
contribution over the past year. 
We have started the current year well, with like-for-like sales 
for the first nine weeks 5% ahead. This year our target will 
be to open 30-35 new restaurants, we will be seeking to 
deliver further improvement in margins and our people will be
looking to match or exceed the expectations of our customers
and shareholders. 
I am confident that we will continue to make further good 
progress during the coming year.

“2006 was a very satisfactory

Our strategy is designed 
to deliver sustainable and
growing cash flows combined
with consistently high returns
on investment and these

Chief Executive Officer
The Restaurant Group plc 
Annual Report 2006 06
This information has been extracted from the statutory accounts of the group which were approved on 4 April 2007. 
This information in itself does not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of section 240 Companies Act 1985. Introduction
The Restaurant Group (“TRG”) performed strongly throughout
2006 with the benefits from the strategic repositioning undertaken
during the previous year evident in all of our key performance
metrics. All of our businesses performed well, delivering a 19%
increase in adjusted profit before tax. We have also made further
good progress in terms of margin growth with a 140 basis point
increase in our operating profit margin. This improvement resulted
from, inter alia, increased trading levels, driving further economies
through scale, enhanced operating practices and other Group
initiatives to improve efficiency. 
Our core objective continues to be growth in shareholder value
and the strategy we have deployed to achieve this is to build a
business capable of delivering long-term, sustainable and growing
cashflows. Cash generation is a key area of focus for the team 
at TRG and I am delighted that we have, again, converted our
profits into cash at a very healthy rate and that both earnings 
and operating cashflow per share have grown strongly. 
Our model for generating value is straightforward and robust. 
It has five key components, as follows: 
> 1. Strong underlying like-for-like profit growth from our
existing estate through focusing on our customers and 
as a result of initiatives to secure further operational
improvements and efficiencies;
> 2. Incremental profit improvements through economies of scale; 
> 3. Clear and sustainable conversion of those growing profits 
into cash; 
> 4. A new unit rollout programme funded from those internally
generated cashflows; and
> 5. Consistently high returns from those new openings,
significantly ahead of our cost of capital, to generate 
further growth in profits and cashflow. 
This virtuous circle enables the Group to continue its growth in 
a predominantly organic and value–accretive way. The quality 
of our cashflow is a distinctive feature of TRG’s model, with 
our businesses occupying leading positions within our chosen
market segments. Since the beginning of 2006 our focus has
been on markets away from the high streets, concentrating on
edge of town, out of town, rural, semi-rural and concessions
locations. We believe that these segments have distinct barriers 
to entry, offer the opportunity for significant further growth and
enable us to generate high returns. Going forward we intend to
continue our development along these lines. 
All of the key performance metrics improved during 2006: 
> A 5% increase in like-for-like sales – the bulk of which was as 
a result of more customers using our restaurants as opposed
to price or spend increases – combined with our new openings
resulted in turnover increasing by 10%; 
> Adjusted EBITDA increasing by 11% and adjusted operating
profit increasing by 23%; and 
> Margins improved at both divisional and group levels with 
our Group operating profit margin rising by 140 basis points
to 12.5% – a very satisfactory result particularly against 
the background of a 90 basis point operating profit margin
improvement in the previous year. 
Again, the increase in profit was the product of three 
principal components – like-for-like profit increases from 
the existing estate, profitable contribution from new 
openings and further cost savings from purchasing initiatives 
and operational improvements and efficiencies. This
combination represents a healthy background to our 
continuing profitable development.

> 139 units
Frankie & Benny’s had an excellent year with both EBITDA 
and profit growing by more than 20%. The brand delivered 
strong growth in like-for-like sales and yet again produced 
further growth in both EBITDA and operating profit margins. 
This brand forms a key part of TRG’s future plans for growth 
and it is encouraging that we were able to open 25 new units
during 2006. Of these, 11 were conversions of former Deep 
Pan Pizza sites, nine of which are branded as “Little Frankie’s”, 
a derivative concept of Frankie & Benny’s designed to operate 
on a smaller footprint than a standard Frankie & Benny’s
restaurant. The performance of the new openings has been 
very good and it is particularly encouraging to see that the 
returns from the new Frankie & Benny’s are consistently high 
both in absolute terms and also, very importantly, in comparison
with the returns derived from earlier years’ openings. This gives 
us much confidence for the future as we look to continue our
rollout at a rate of 15-20 new Frankie & Benny’s restaurants 
per annum. Our pipeline of new sites is strong with good 
visibility on rollout to the end of the decade.

> 45 units
2006 was another good year for Chiquito with the highest 
like-for-like sales and operating profit growth within the Group.
EBITDA increased by 38% and operating profit was up 44%.
Margins also improved significantly with the EBITDA margin up
90 basis points and operating profit margin up 120 basis points.
Against a background of significant profit growth and margin
enhancement in 2005 this is a terrific performance and one that
the Chiquito team are keen to build on in 2007. During the year
we opened 11 new restaurants and we are expecting to open 
5-10 new restaurants in the current year, a rate which we expect
to maintain for the next few years. Returns from the new openings
are good and this gives us confidence as we grow this brand.
We are particularly encouraged by the performance of our
restaurants co-located with Frankie & Benny’s and we will
continue to pursue dual roll-out opportunities. 
> Blubeckers 
> 22 units
2006 was the first full year of operating Blubeckers within TRG
and we are encouraged with the results. Blubeckers delivered
strong growth in like-for-like sales and delivered a very good level
of EBITDA and operating profit. During 2006 Blubeckers became
fully integrated into TRG and since June we have begun to roll
out new Blubeckers restaurants. We added five new units during
2006, one of which was a conversion of a Garfunkel’s restaurant
in Cambridge. 
We are encouraged by the performance of these new sites
where typically the build-up in trade takes longer (approximately
two to three years) than it does for our other brands. We expect
to earn good returns from these new openings and this has
encouraged us to step up the openings programme in 2007 
to 5-10 new restaurants. Blubeckers is well placed to benefit
from the trends towards increased eating out and its widespread
appeal across most socio-economic and age groups makes it
particularly attractive to much of the UK population. 
> Garfunkel’s
> 29 units
Garfunkel’s produced a very solid performance during 2006 with
operating profits up by 15%. It enjoyed strong like-for-like sales
growth and delivered significant improvements in margins with
the operating profit margin increasing by 140 basis points.
During the second half of 2006 we commenced a refreshment
and refurbishment programme within Garfunkel’s. The first site 
to undergo these changes was our restaurant at Northumberland
Avenue followed by the unit at Irving Street. The results have
been extremely pleasing with strong growth in sales and a
widening of the customer base. We are currently planning to
refresh and refurbish approximately 10 sites during 2007 and 
we anticipate that this will deliver a significant level of incremental
cashflow at each site to generate very satisfactory levels of
return on investment. In December 2006 a former Deep Pan
Pizza site on Oxford Street was converted into a Garfunkel’s 
and we are pleased with its performance since opening.

> Operating margin: 15.3%
Our Concessions business faced some very challenging
operating conditions for parts of 2006. The increasing focus on
airport security initiated by the Department of Transport during
the first quarter followed by further disruption during the summer
meant that our Concessions team at the major UK airports faced
some demanding conditions. Our team responded superbly to
produce a very satisfactory set of results. 
Solid like-for-like sales growth together with a contribution from 
the six new openings delivered a 21% increase in turnover, and
EBITDA and operating profit growth of 23% and 24% respectively.
It is particularly pleasing to report that both EBITDA and operating
profit margins grew, by 20 and 40 basis points respectively. 
Our six new openings included three sites at Birmingham airport
and a new unit at Victoria Station. We are pleased with the
performance of these new sites and we anticipate opening
between two and five new concessions units in 2007. We
recently announced that we have won concessions for four

This information in itself does not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of section 240 Companies Act 1985. Non-core brands and associate
During the year losses from non-core activities increased from
£0.9m to £2.0m. This largely reflects the workout from the old
Deep Pan Pizza estate. We anticipate a significant reduction in
these losses going forward.
Losses from our investment in Living Ventures amounted to 
£0.9m and the returns from this investment have fallen below 
our expectations at the time the investment was made in March
2005. However, we are encouraged that the actions initiated 
by their management during 2006 are now starting to yield 
some benefits and we are looking for further improvement 
during 2007. Nevertheless, in the light of the recent poor
performance of this investment we have carried out an
assessment of its balance sheet carrying value and concluded 
that it is appropriate to make an impairment provision for the
amount of £9.5m. Further details are contained in the Group
Finance Director’s review.
Corporate
During 2006 we completed the transfer of all of our operations
and administrative functions into one site in Borough, London.
This exercise ran very smoothly and was carried out in a highly
professional manner by our people. The positive impact of
bringing everyone together as one team is already very evident
and I am confident that we will continue to derive further benefits
in the future. 
Market dynamics and economic backdrop
The prospects for the UK eating out market look favourable 
on both short and medium term bases. Socio-economic factors
such as an ageing population, more females in work and levels 
of disposable income significantly higher than for previous
generations augur well for our industry. Lifestyle changes are 
also positive with an increasing level of consumer spending 
on leisure activities. Projections for future growth in eating out
spend indicate a continuation of recent trends for a rate of
growth ahead of GDP growth. 
We believe that interest rates and employment levels are two 
key drivers of consumer spend which can potentially impact 
our marketplace. We have seen interest rates rise three times 
in the past nine months and whilst we are encouraged by the
resilience of our business in the face of such rises, we remain
vigilant to the potential impact of significant further increases in
the cost of borrowing. In terms of the outlook for employment
we are encouraged by the high levels of employment and believe
that the increases seen in recent years have provided some
underpinning for consumer–facing businesses such as ourselves. 
Cost inflation in our sector has been an issue for the past twelve
to eighteen months and TRG has clearly demonstrated its ability
to cope with this. On balance, we believe that the macro-
economic backdrop remains broadly favourable for our sector. 
Against a backdrop of positive demand-side dynamics, a key
concern for some time has been supply-side risk. In this regard
we believe that we have positioned TRG in market segments
which afford some protection from supply-side risk whilst
benefiting significantly from the positive demand trends in our
marketplace. This has resulted in a more resilient business with
the potential to deliver higher-quality, long-term, sustainable and
growing cash flows. 
Future prospects 
2006 was another good year for the Group but our attention 
is now focused on 2007 and beyond. We have a superb
portfolio of brands, good visibility on rollout of new restaurants,
occupy leading market positions in our chosen segments and
have a fantastic team of people. The year has started well with
like-for-like sales for the first nine weeks 5% ahead of last year
and we are confident of continuing our progress in 2007.

Generating sustainable
and growing cash flows
This information has been extracted from the statutory accounts of the group which were approved on 4 April 2007. 
This information in itself does not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of section 240 Companies Act 1985. Results
As described in the Chairman’s statement the Group has had
another excellent year. Total Group turnover increased by 9.6% 
to £314.7m and turnover of the principal trading brands increased
by 24.1% to £308.7m. This strong level of turnover growth reflects
an impressive level of 5% like-for-like sales growth in the principal
brands, a full year impact of new openings in 2005 and a part
year impact of openings during 2006. Group EBITDA increased by
11.3% to £55.6m, and Group adjusted operating profit increased
by 22.6% to £39.2m. These levels of growth would have been
even stronger had it not been for a higher level of losses in 
non-core brands and discontinued operations (relating respectively
to Deep Pan Pizza and the Caffe Uno sites not sold to Paramount
at the end of 2005).
Total adjusted profit before tax excluding Living Ventures was
£35.9m, an increase of 19.2% on the prior year. After accounting
for our share of the losses of Living Ventures, which amounted to
£0.9m, total reported Group profit before tax and non-trading items
amounted to £35.0m, an increase of 18.5% on the prior year. 
Non-trading items 
The Group results include a net charge before taxation of £13.4m in
respect of non-trading items. This is made up of the following items:
2006 2005
£m £m
Impairment of loan note due 
from Living Ventures (9.5)–
DPP integration and rationalisation (4.6) –
Interest rate swap impact 0.7 (0.1)
Other items (net) – (1.2)
(13.4) (1.3)
In the light of the continuing poor performance of the Living
Ventures business we have conducted a detailed review of the
current carrying value of this investment. As a result of this review
we have concluded that it is appropriate to make a provision of
£9.5m against our balance sheet carrying value. Going forward 
we will continue to encourage the executive management of Living
Ventures to improve the financial performance of the business. 
It continues to be our very firm intention to maximise the value 
of our investment in this business.
The one-off charge relating to the Deep Pan Pizza rationalisation
process is a little higher than the initial estimate of up to £4m. We
have adopted a prudent approach regarding provision for onerous
lease conditions for certain Deep Pan Pizza properties.
Non-trading items also include a credit relating to the Group’s
interest rate swap arrangements. New swap arrangements were
put in place in January 2006. Under IFRS this swap is re-valued 
at each accounting date. The upward movement of interest rates
over the course of the last twelve months has resulted in this
positive revaluation.

Profit on disposal of businesses
We are pleased to report further profits relating to the Caffe Uno
disposal in December 2005. The additional profit after taxation of
£3.8m (profit before taxation of £2.7m), which is in addition to the
profit after taxation of £3.5m reported in 2005 (profit before taxation
of £3.7m) relates to cost and potential warranty accruals no longer
required and the completion of significantly better than anticipated
deals on disposal of the residual Caffe Uno sites not sold to
Paramount in December 2005. Including the profit before taxation 
of £3.7m recognised last year, this brings the cumulative profit on
disposal before taxation of the Caffe Uno business to £6.4m.
Capital expenditure
During 2006 the Group invested a total of £40.8m (2005: £40.9m)
in capital additions. This consisted of the following: 
> £28.6m invested in 47 new units (16 Frankie & Benny’s 
and nine Little Frankie’s, 11 Chiquito, six Concession outlets, 
four Blubeckers and one Garfunkel’s). This includes an amount
of £3.7m spent on converting 13 former Deep Pan Pizza sites,
with the balance spent on 34 brand new locations.
> £8.5m on refurbishment and maintenance expenditure. 
> £3.7m on completing the new head office development
referred to in last year’s report.

The Restaurant Group plc 
Annual Report 2006 14
This information has been extracted from the statutory accounts of the group which were approved on 4 April 2007. 
This information in itself does not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of section 240 Companies Act 1985. The Group continues to be focused on optimising financial
returns from our capital investments. As we have described 
in previous reports the Group operates a rigorous investment
appraisal process with the financial viability of all new
developments being subject to a detailed review. This review
covers all aspects of proposed new developments including
financial projections, socio-economic and demographic 
analysis, and local competitor and market analysis. All significant
projects are subject to approval by the Group Board and we
conduct post-completion appraisals which confirm that we are
consistently achieving the expected levels of financial return.
Cash flow
The Group continues to be strongly cash generative with a very
healthy and transparent conversion of operating profits into cash
flow. Net cash flow from operations of £63.4m grew by 14%
compared to the previous year. Free cash flow (defined as cash
flow from operating activities less interest, tax and maintenance
capital expenditure) was £42.4m, an increase of 19% compared 
to the prior year (2005: £35.7m). 
Once again, the Group’s substantial new site development
programme, as well as the ordinary dividend, has been entirely
financed out of internally generated cash flow. 
Balance sheet & key financial ratios
Total Group net assets in the year reduced from £91.4m to
£65.2m. This reduction is due to the special dividend of £34.8m
paid in March. Total non-current assets increased from £181.7m 
to £194.0m, reflecting the Group’s strong capital expenditure
programme net of depreciation charges. 
The key financial ratios for the year were as follows:
2006 2005
Interest cover 12.0x 17.5x
Fixed charge cover 2.3x 2.3x
Balance sheet gearing 73% 14%
Interest cover has reduced significantly as a result of the much higher
levels of average net debt during 2006 compared to 2005. For TRG,
given that this is a primarily lease based business model, fixed
charge cover is the key financial ratio that we focus on. For 2006 
the Group’s fixed charge cover was 2.3 times, in line with 2005. 
Taxation
The total taxation charge (excluding the impact of disposal of
businesses) for the year is £11.2m compared with £8.6m in the
prior year. The taxation charge on the trading business reflects a
normalised tax rate in 2006 of 34% (2005: 33%). The total taxation
charge of £11.2m (2005: £8.6m) consists of a corporation tax
charge of £8.5m (2005: £9.0m) and a deferred tax charge of
£2.7m (2005: £0.4m credit).

Corporate governance
The Company is committed to high standards of corporate governance. The Board is accountable to the Company’s shareholders for
good corporate governance. This statement describes how the principles of corporate governance are applied to the Company and the
Company’s compliance with the best practice provisions of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance and the Guidance on Audit
Committees, together “the Code”. The Company has been in full compliance throughout the year with the provisions set out in the Code
except for provisions concerning the number of Directors considered to be independent, and the independence of the Chairman.
The Board
The Board’s role is to provide entrepreneurial leadership of the Company and Group within a framework of prudent and effective controls
which enable risk to be assessed and managed. The Board reviews the Group’s strategic objectives and looks to ensure that the
necessary financial and human resources are in place to achieve these objectives, and to review management performance against these
objectives. The Board also sets the Company’s values and standards and manages the business in a manner to meet its obligations to
shareholders and other stakeholders.
The Board currently comprises the non-executive Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, the Group Finance Director, the Executive Director
of the Leisure division, the Executive Director of the Concessions division and three non-executive Directors. Their biographies appear 
on pages 16 and 17 and these demonstrate a range of experience and sufficient calibre to bring independent judgement on issues of
strategy, performance, resources and standards of conduct which is vital for the success of the Group. 
John E. Jackson acts as senior independent non-executive Director and is available to shareholders if they have reasons for concern 
on which contact through the normal channels is inappropriate or has failed to resolve an issue.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are clearly defined. The Chairman is responsible for the leadership of the Board and 
the Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the strategic direction and operational management of the Group.
The Board meets on a regular basis and there is a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for its decision. This includes approval 
of the annual budget and the three-year business plan, approval of the interim and year end report and accounts, review and approval of
significant capital expenditure (including development of new sites), significant disposals of assets and acquisitions or disposals of businesses.  Report of the Directors continued

The Board (continued)
Operational management are responsible for the day-to-day running of the Group and report on a regular basis on that performance to 
the Board. The Board is responsible for reviewing, challenging and approving the strategic direction of the Group and monitoring
operational performance. 
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the proper management of the Group and has access to the necessary information to enable
it to discharge its duties. All Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first opportunity after their appointment, except where
they are appointed by shareholders, and to re-election thereafter at intervals of not more than three years.
There is significant involvement from the non-executive Directors. This involves an on-going dialogue with executive Directors with
constructive challenges of performance and the Group’s strategy. The non-executive Directors are provided with sufficient information to
allow them to monitor, assess and challenge the executive management of the Group. Comprehensive board papers including financial
information are circulated to all Directors prior to Board meetings and, on a weekly basis, they receive up-to-date trading information. 
The non-executive Directors have the opportunity to meet without the executive Directors present, and this includes discussions of 
targets set and met by management.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and a procedure has been agreed for the Directors in the
furtherance of their duties to take independent professional advice, if necessary, at the expense of the Company. 
On joining the Board there is a process for Directors to receive training as to their role and its requirements and for non-executive Directors
to gain an understanding of the whole business. Non-executive Directors are actively encouraged to meet with operational management 
to enhance their understanding of the Group’s business, its brands, employees and processes. During 2006 there were nine Board
meetings. Overall attendance at meetings was 100% by Board members.
Executive Directors are included in the annual performance evaluation of all senior employees within the Group. This involves 
a comprehensive review of performance against objectives and covers areas for future development through appraisal documentation 
and meetings. The non-executive Directors also meet in the absence of the Chairman to appraise the Chairman’s performance in the light 
of his fee review. 
The Company acknowledges the importance of developing the skills of the Directors to run an effective Board. To assist in this, Directors
are given the opportunity to attend relevant courses and seminars and to acquire skills and experience which may enhance their
contribution to the on-going progress of the Group. The Board and committees of the Board have been subject to a formal performance
appraisal, through an internal questionnaire, and the performance of all members of the Board is considered as part of the annual
remuneration review process.
Communications with shareholders
Communications with shareholders are given high priority. The Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive Officer’s review and Group Finance
Director’s review on pages 4 to 15 include a detailed review of the business and the Chief Executive Officer’s review on pages 6 to 11
includes a review of planned future developments. There is a regular dialogue with institutional investors including presentations after the
Company’s preliminary announcement of the year end results, and at the half year.
Feedback from major institutional shareholders is provided to the Board on a regular basis and where appropriate the Board will take steps
to address concerns and recommendations. The Board uses the Annual General Meeting to communicate with private and institutional
investors and welcomes their participation. The Chairman aims to ensure that the chairmen of the Audit Committee, Remuneration
Committee and Nominations Committee are available at the Annual General Meeting to answer questions, and for all Directors to attend.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of the non-executive Directors. There was 100% attendance of the two Remuneration Committee
meetings during 2006. The role of this Committee and details of how the Company complies with the principles of the Code are set out 
in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 24 to 29.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee consists of the non-executive Directors, the non-executive Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer. It met
once during 2006 with full attendance. There are written terms of reference for the Nominations Committee. It makes recommendations
to the Board for the appointment or replacement of additional Directors. It is also responsible for succession planning for the Group.
Kevin J. Bacon and Patricia A. Corzine offer themselves for re-election at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 16 May 2007. 
The Board have confirmed that they are satisfied that each of the Directors continues to contribute effectively and has demonstrated
commitment to the role. 
It was not felt necessary to employ an external search consultant in the recruitment of David H. Richardson, given his profile, experience
and professional background. This does not mean the Company would not use external search consultants for future appointments of
Directors to the Board.
John E. Jackson has been a non-executive Director of the Company for more than nine years, and in accordance with corporate
governance best practice, also offers himself for re-election at the Annual General Meeting. The Chairman and Board are satisfied that
John E. Jackson is considered to be independent in his role as senior non-executive Director notwithstanding his length of service on 
the Board, and that he continues to provide valuable experience, judgement and insight to the Board and its Committees.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee consists of the three non-executive Directors. The Committee is chaired by John E. Jackson who is a qualified
accountant. It meets on a regular basis under its terms of reference, and with the Group Finance Director and the external auditors  The Restaurant Group plc

to review the financial statements and external financial announcements made by the Company. It has responsibility for reviewing and
monitoring the external auditors’ independence and objectivity, and reviews supplies of all non-audit services provided by the external
auditors to ensure that independence and objectivity are not compromised. 
Andrew Thomas is a partner in an independent firm of Chartered Accountants. The other members of the Audit Committee are 
non-executive Directors. The Audit Committee met twice during 2006 with full attendance.
The Restaurant Group plc – strategy
The Restaurant Group’s key objective is to grow shareholder value and the strategy deployed to achieve this is to build a business capable
of generating long-term sustainable and growing cash flows. In pursuit of this we have built a business which is focused on the growing
casual eating-out market. We have targeted segments of this market which offer distinct barriers to entry and where we can be confident 
of delivering good growth in profits and cash flows and where there is good potential for high returns on investment.
This has led the Group to focus our activities in two areas – Leisure and Concessions, and this emphasis was underlined by the divesting
of our high street businesses (Caffe Uno and Est Est Est) during 2005. The Group operates in the expanding casual dining market, and 
our offerings continue to provide good value for money in comfortable surroundings and excellent service from our dedicated teams.
The Group’s strategy is set to deliver further organic growth through the roll-out of our brands, in particular Frankie & Benny’s, Chiquito 
and Blubeckers. We have a robust pipeline of sites for development, coupled with a strong focus on continuing to deliver like-for-like sales
growth from our existing restaurants. Our Concessions business operates in a dynamic and complicated market where our management
teams have market-leading expertise and a track record of innovation and improving sales performance. 
The Restaurant Group plc – risk factors
The Board of Directors continually identify, monitor and manage potential risks and uncertainties to the Group. The list below sets out what
the Directors consider to be the current principal risks and uncertainties. This list is not presumed to be exhaustive, and by its very nature
is subject to change.
• Increased supply of new restaurant concepts into the market
• Adverse economic conditions and decline in consumer confidence in the UK
• Increase in prices of key raw materials, wages and overheads (including utilities)
• Impact of terrorism in key locations (including airports)
• Increased regulation of industry leading to higher costs 
• Possible health pandemic that may cause customers to stay away or prevent restaurants being adequately staffed
• Failure to provide customers with brand-standard value for money offerings and service levels
• Failure of key suppliers to deliver products into branches 
• Damage to brand image due to failures in environmental health in the branches or from contamination of products
• The loss of key personnel or failure to manage succession planning
• Breakdown in internal controls through fraud or error
The Restaurant Group plc – key performance indicators
The Board of Directors and executive management receive a wide range of management information delivered in a timely manner. 
Listed below are the principal measures of progress that are reviewed on a regular basis to monitor the development of the Group:
Like-for-like sales
This measure provides an indicator of the underlying performance of our existing restaurants, and highlights successful development 
of our offerings to best match changing consumer demands over time. During 2006, the Group like-for-like sales increased by 5%, 
which followed a 3% increase in 2005.
New sites opened
The expansion of our brands is a key driver of Group’s profitability. As noted in the Group Finance Director’s review, potential new 
sites are subject to a rigorous appraisal process before they are presented to the Board for approval. This process ensures we maintain
the quality of openings as well as the quantity of sites opened. During 2006 the Group opened 47 new sites (including 13 conversions 
of former Deep Pan Pizza units) and plans to open 30-35 new restaurants during 2007.
EBITDA
The ability of the Group to finance its roll-out programme is aided by strong cash flows from the existing business. EBITDA serves 
as a useful proxy for cash flows generated by operations and is closely monitored. During 2006 the Group generated £55.6m EBITDA, 
an increase of 11% on 2005.
Operating profit margin
The Board and management closely monitor profit margins as an indicator of operating efficiency within restaurants and across the Group.
During 2006 the Group adjusted operating margin improved by 140 basis points to 12.5%.
In addition, the Group closely scrutinises the returns on invested capital from new site openings and the average EBITDA generated 
by restaurants.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. In accordance with guidance for
directors “Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code” (the “Turnbull Guidance”), the Board has ensured that there 
is an ongoing process for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control including identifying, evaluating and managing the
significant risks faced by the Group. This process, which is regularly reviewed by the Board, is carried out in conjunction with business
planning and is documented in a risk register that has been progressively enhanced during the financial year and up to the date of
approval of the Annual Report and Accounts.  Report of the Directors continued

This information in itself does not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of section 240 Companies Act 1985.
Internal control (continued)
Whilst acknowledging its overall responsibility for the system of internal control, the Board is aware that the system is designed to manage
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against
material misstatement or loss. 
The Group has well established procedures which have been developed over many years which meet the requirements of the Turnbull
Guidance. A key control procedure is the day-to-day involvement of executive members of the Board in all aspects of the business and
their attendance at regular management meetings at which performance against plan and business prospects are reviewed. Additionally,
the Board seeks to continually strengthen the internal control system where this is consistent with improving the relationship between risk
and reward. The Group’s associate company, Living Ventures Limited, does not fall under the same internal controls as the Group. The
internal controls within Living Ventures Limited are discussed with management of that company on a regular basis and are considered 
to be appropriate for an entity of its size.
Other key features and the processes for reviewing effectiveness of the internal control system are described below:
• terms of reference for the Board and its sub-committees, including a schedule of matters reserved for the Board and an agreed annual
programme of fixed agenda items for Board approval;
• an established organisational structure with clear lines of responsibility and rigorous reporting requirements. Operational performance
and operational matters are considered at monthly meetings of the executive Directors with senior management. Financial performance
is monitored and action taken through weekly reporting to the executive Directors and monthly reporting to the Board against annual
budgets approved by the Board; 
• capital investment is regulated by a budgetary process and authorisation levels, with appraisals and post-investment reviews;
• comprehensive policy manuals setting out agreed standards and control procedures. These include human resources related policies,
information technology and health and safety; and
• an internal audit function headed by an experienced internal auditor has access to all areas of the Company and Group’s business 
and reports to the Board.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in relation to the accounts 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the company, for safeguarding the assets, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other
irregularities and for the preparation of a Report of the Directors and Directors’ remuneration report which comply with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 1985.
Financial statements are published on the Group’s website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation
and dissemination of financial statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the
Group’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial
statements contained therein.
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors are required to prepare financial statements for the Group in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulations and have chosen to prepare financial statements for the
Company in accordance with UK GAAP .
Group financial statements
Company law requires the Directors to prepare such financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards,
the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Group’s financial position,
financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions 
in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting
Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the preparation and presentation of financial statements’. 
In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable International Financial Reporting
Standards. A fair presentation also requires the Directors to:
• consistently select and apply appropriate accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable
information; and
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand the
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance.
Parent company financial statements
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs
of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements. The Restaurant Group plc

This information has been extracted from the statutory accounts of the group which were approved on 4 April 2007. 
This information in itself does not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of section 240 Companies Act 1985.
Information provided to auditors
All of the current Directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any information needed 
by the Company’s auditors for the purpose of their audit and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information. The Directors 
are not aware of any relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware.
Going concern
Based on the Group’s plans for 2007 and after making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has
adequate resources to continue operations for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the financial statements.
Employees
The Restaurant Group plc is committed to the fair treatment and development of all employees. Wherever possible, the Directors aim to
promote talent from within by reviewing succession plans and offering development opportunities. Through the application of appropriate
policies, the Directors and their management teams ensure employees are not mistreated or discriminated against on the grounds of
gender, colour, ethnic or national origin, disability, age, marital status, sexual orientation, religion or part-time employment status. The
Company’s performance in these areas (regarding employment practices) is tracked and reported at Board level. The Directors also ensure
regular communication happens throughout the business through written material, team briefings and one-to-one reviews.
Environment
The Restaurant Group plc acknowledges the importance of environmental matters within its role in the community. The Group has
established an environmental committee to develop initiatives to reduce the impact on the environment from the operations of the Group
and is working with several key suppliers, partners and external agencies to ensure environmental concerns are considered in conjunction
with economic factors. In particular, the Group looks to reduce the production of waste in its operations and to maximise efficiency 
of water consumption and the use of non-renewable fuels.
Donations
No donations for political purposes have been directly made by the Company during the year. Charitable events, fund raising and
sponsorship are organised by restaurants for organisations in their locality. 
Creditor payment policy
The Company’s policy is to agree the terms of payments with its suppliers as and when a trading relationship is established. The Company
ensures that the terms of payment are clear and its policy is to abide by the agreed terms, provided the supplier meets its obligations. 
At 31 December 2006 the Company had no trade creditors. The Group had an average of 52 days (2005: 54 days) purchases
outstanding in trade creditors.
Financial risk management
The Board of The Restaurant Group plc regularly reviews the financial requirements of the Group and the risks associated therewith. The
Group does not use complicated financial instruments, and where financial instruments are used it is for reducing interest rate risk. The
Group does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Group operations are primarily financed from retained earnings
and bank borrowings (including an overdraft facility). 
In addition to the primary financial instruments, the Group also has other financial instruments such as debtors, prepayments, trade
creditors and accruals that arise directly from the Group’s operations. Further information is provided in note 24 to the accounts.
Effective from 16 January 2006, the Group entered into a new three-year interest rate swap, for an initial notional amount of £20,000,000,
rising to £50,000,000 from 18 April 2006 until 16 January 2008, when it reduces to £30,000,000 until 16 January 2009, at which date it
terminates. The fixed rate for the duration of the three years is 4.695%. 
Before the impact of the interest rate swap, the average rate of interest charged during the year on the Group’s debt was 5.76% (2005: 5.32%),
and the average year end rate was 6.30% (2005: 5.50%). On 2006 results, net interest was covered 12.0 times (2005: 17.5 times) 
by profit before tax, interest and exceptional items. Based on year end debt and profits for 2006, a 1% rise in interest rates would 
reduce profits before tax and exceptional items by 0.1% (2005: 0.1%) and interest cover would remain at 12.0 times (2005: 17.4 times). 
At 31 December 2006 the Group had gross borrowings (including overdraft) of £48.2 million (2005: £12.8 million) and cash balances 
of £0.7 million (2005: £0.4 million).
Annual General Meeting
A separate Circular is included with the mailing of the Annual Report to shareholders setting out the resolutions to be voted on at the 
Annual General Meeting, which is to take place on at 11am on 16 May 2007 at the offices of Dresdner Kleinwort Investment Bank, 
30 Gresham Street, London EC2P 2XY.
The Board believes that the proposed resolutions to be put to the Annual General Meeting to be held on 16 May 2007 are in the best
interests of shareholders and, accordingly, recommends that shareholders vote in favour of the resolutions, as the Directors intend to 
do in respect of their own beneficial shareholdings in the Company.
Auditors
BDO Stoy Hayward LLP have expressed their willingness to continue as auditors, and a resolution will be proposed at the Annual General
Meeting for their reappointment.

Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7a of the Companies Act 1985. The report also meets the relevant
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good
Governance relating to directors’ remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the
Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved. 
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Company’s members on the “auditable part” of the Directors’ remuneration report and
to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with Schedule 7a of the Companies Act
1985 (as amended by the Regulations). The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations
of the Combined Code. The members of the committee during the year were John E. Jackson, Andrew Thomas, and Robert Ivell (until his
resignation from the Board on 8 September 2006), who were all independent non-executive Directors. David H. Richardson was appointed
to the Remuneration Committee on 1 February 2007. The Committee is chaired by Andrew Thomas.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest in the Company (other than as shareholders). The Committee makes
recommendations to the Board. No Director plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration. In determining the other executive
Directors’ remuneration for the year the Committee consulted Alan M. Jackson (Chairman) about its proposals.
Remuneration policy
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain Directors of the high calibre needed to progress and develop
the Group and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders. The performance measurement of the executive Directors and the
determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the Committee. In addition, the Committee determines the
remuneration for the Chairman. The remuneration of the other non-executive Directors is determined by the Board. There are four main
elements of the remuneration package for executive Directors:
• Basic annual salary (including Directors’ fees) and benefits;
• Annual bonus payments which cannot exceed 100% (2006: 75%) of basic salary for executive Directors;
• Long-Term Incentive Plan awards; and
• Pension arrangements. 
The Company’s policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive Directors should be performance related. 
As described below, executive Directors may earn annual incentive payments of up to 100% of their basic salary together with the 
benefits of the participation in the Long-Term Incentive Plan.
During 2006, the Company undertook a review of its remuneration and incentive arrangements for executive Directors and other senior
management, with the advice of New Bridge Street Consultants LLP (appointed independent advisers who provided no other services 
to the Group during the year), encompassing all elements of the remuneration packages. 
The Committee believes that this management team will be highly attractive to other listed companies as well as private equity-backed
businesses. The retention of this team is critically important and the Committee has made some significant adjustments to their remuneration
packages to ensure that there is adequate lock-in and reward for continued excellent performance and shareholder value creation.
Following the review of the remuneration and incentive arrangements of executive Directors, base salary levels have been increased 
and the maximum level of bonus payable has been increased from 75% to 100% of base salary. The incremental 25% that is potentially
payable to executive Directors is based on a more stretching outperformance against budget by the Group. Furthermore, any bonus
earned in excess of 75% of salary must be invested in shares in The Restaurant Group plc as part of the Long-Term Incentive Plan. 
The Remuneration Committee has been advised that the potential maximum level of bonus payable, as well as the total level of cash
remuneration, is in line with comparable companies and the tougher targets and share-based deferral element make the plan tougher 
than those found in most companies. 
Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside the Company or Group. There is no requirement for Directors to remit 
fees earned from appointments outside of the Company or Group to the Company or Group. 
Basic salary
An executive Director’s basic salary is determined by the Committee prior to the beginning of each year and when an individual changes
position or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group as a whole and by reference to remuneration
levels at other companies in the leisure and hospitality sectors. Basic salaries were reviewed in December 2005 with increases taking effect
from 1 January 2006. They were again reviewed in December 2006 with increases from 1 January 2007. Executive Directors’ contracts 
of service which include details of remuneration will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
In addition to basic salary, the executive Directors receive pension contributions and certain benefits-in-kind, principally a car (or car
allowance), and health and life insurance. The Restaurant Group plc

This information in itself does not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of section 240 Companies Act 1985.
Annual bonus payments
The annual bonus is based on the achievement of stretching profit before tax targets.
Performance targets are set annually as part of the budgeting process and performance is reviewed against those targets at the end of the
financial year. The maximum performance related bonus that can be paid in respect of performance in 2007 is 100% of basic annual salary
and for significant bonuses to be paid, performance must be outstanding.
Long-term incentives
The Company operates the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”), and the 2003 SAYE Scheme under which awards may be granted 
to Directors. No further awards may be granted under the 1998 Executive Share Option Scheme or 2003 Executive Mirror Option Scheme
following the introduction of the LTIP in 2005.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
The 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”), approved by shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting on 9 November 2005, is 
the primary long-term incentive scheme of the Company. Under the terms of the LTIP , individuals may receive an award of conditional free
shares (“Conditional Awards”) with a face value at grant of up to 100% of salary per annum, vesting at least three years after grant subject
to performance conditions and continued employment.
In addition, the Plan has the flexibility to grant conditional awards on a matching basis, pro rata to the number of shares purchased 
via annual bonus (“Matching Awards”). Matching Awards may be granted over shares worth up to 37.5% of base salary per annum. 
The aggregate value of annual awards (Conditional and Matching) is capped at 137.5% of base salary. 
The Committee considers that Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) and Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) are the most appropriate measures 
of performance, with EPS targets rewarding significant and sustained earnings growth and TSR providing a balance to the financial
performance and retaining a share price discipline in the remuneration package.
For the Conditional Awards to executive Directors to be made in 2007, two separate performance conditions apply to a proportion 
of the award. These have been reviewed to ensure their continued appropriateness:
• The performance condition attached to 50% of the Conditional Awards requires average annual EPS growth from 1 January 2007 
to 31 December 2009 of between RPI plus 4% to RPI plus 10% p.a. for between 30% and 100% of this part of the award to vest 
(i.e. between 15% and 50% of the total award).
• The performance condition attached to the other 50% of the Conditional Awards is based on Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”)
performance measured against the constituents of the FTSE SmallCap Index over a single three-year period from 1 January 2007 
to 31 December 2009 for between 30% for median performance increasing on a straight line basis to 100% for upper quartile
performance of this award to vest (i.e. between 15% (for median) and 50% (for upper quartile performance) of the total award).
• Awards will vest on a straight line basis between minimum and maximum thresholds.
• For Matching Awards, there will be a 0.3:1 match for average EPS growth of RPI plus 4% p.a., rising on a straight line basis to 
the full 1:1 match for average EPS growth of RPI plus 10% p.a..
Performance against the TSR and EPS targets will be independently calculated and reviewed by the Committee. 
Following the approval of the LTIP , shareholding guidelines for executive Directors have been introduced, linked to the out-turn of the 
Plan. At the time Conditional and Matching Awards vest under the Plan (or any other executive plan established in the future), there 
is a requirement to retain no fewer than 50% of the shares net of taxes until a shareholding with a market value equal to 100% of base
salary is achieved.
SAYE Scheme
The Company also operates a SAYE Share Option Scheme, the 2003 SAYE Scheme, for eligible employees under which options may be
granted at a discount of up to 20% of market value. Eligible employees are full time employees and executive Directors who have worked
for the Group for at least one year. Under the terms of the Scheme the eligible employees are able to purchase shares under a three-year
savings contract. Awards under the SAYE scheme were made in 2004 and 2006 to eligible employees and Directors.
Pension arrangements
Executive Directors have individual pension arrangements in the form of personal pension plans. The Company makes a contribution at 
a rate of up to 20% of basic salary towards funding each executive Director’s pension plan. To the extent that this funding exceeds the
relevant current HMRC limit, the surplus may be paid as a salary supplement. There are no unfunded pension promises or similar
arrangement for Directors. Directors’ remuneration report

Performance graph
As required by the Regulations, the graph below compares the Company’s total shareholder return performance with the FTSE 350 
Travel and Leisure Share Index for each of the past five years.
The FTSE 350 Travel and Leisure Share Index has been selected for this comparison because it is the index most relevant 
to gauging the Company’s relative performance.
Total Shareholder Return
This graph shows the value, by 1 January 2007, of £100 invested in The Restaurant Group plc on 1 January 2002 compared with 
the value of £100 invested in the FTSE All-Share Index and the FTSE 350 Travel and Leisure Share Index.
As can be seen, performance against these two indices has been excellent. An investment in shares in The Restaurant Group plc 
on 1 January 2002 would have generated a return of 542% by 1 January 2007 (assuming dividends were reinvested into the shares 
on a net basis over the period).
Directors’ contracts
It is the Company’s policy that executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of one year’s
notice. However, it may be necessary occasionally to offer longer initial notice periods to new Directors. All executive Directors have
contracts which are subject to one year’s notice by either party. In the event of early termination, the Directors’ contracts provide for
compensation in line with their contractual notice period.
The details of the executive Directors’ contracts are summarised in the table below:
Date of contract Notice period
Andrew Page 28 August 2002 1 year
Stephen M.A. Critoph 7 July 2004 1 year
Kevin J. Bacon 17 March 2003 1 year
Patricia A. Corzine 31 March 2003 1 year
Non-executive Directors
The service contracts of the non-executive Directors were each set for an initial three-year period (thereafter renewable for periods 
of three years). They are required to submit themselves for re election every three years and the Board believes this to be appropriate 
in the Company’s circumstances. Alan M. Jackson, Andrew Thomas and John E. Jackson were re-elected in 2006. In accordance 
with the Articles of Association of the Company, David H. Richardson offers himself for election at the Annual General Meeting of the
Company to be held on 16 May 2007, being the first opportunity for shareholders to approve his appointment.
In accordance with best practice, John E. Jackson is standing for re-election at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 16 May 2007 
as he has served on the Board for more than nine years. 
Their appointments were made as follows:
Date of appointment as non-executive Director Notice period
Alan M. Jackson* 9 November 2005 1 year
John E. Jackson 1 October 1996 nil
Andrew Thomas 1 May 2001 nil
David H. Richardson 1 February 2007 nil
* Alan M. Jackson was previously Executive Chairman of the Company, and was appointed in March 2001. From 1 January 2006 he has
held the position of non-executive Chairman. 
All non-executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board based on a review of
fees paid to non-executive Directors of similar companies and reflects the time commitment and responsibilities of each role. The basic 
fee paid to the non-executive Directors (excluding Alan M. Jackson) in the year was £40,000.

Directors’ share options
Aggregate emoluments disclosed above do not include any amounts for the value of options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company
granted to or held by the Directors. The Company operates a number of share option schemes which executive Directors may participate in. 
Following the Placing of 19,430,000 shares on 14 January 2004, an application to restate the number and price of share options granted
under the 1998 and 2003 schemes to Directors and employees was approved by the HMRC. This restatement was calculated to ensure
the effective number and price attributed to the options was as before the Placing with no incremental benefit to the option holders. The

Under the 2003 Mirror Scheme the performance criteria that must be met requires the Company’s earnings per share to grow at an annual rate of the Retail Price Index plus 2.5% over the three-year period
prior to exercise of the option. No further awards may be made under the 2003 Scheme following the adoption of the LTIP .
LTIP (1) – these are Conditional Shares awarded under the LTIP scheme. They are free shares awarded to the Directors should the performance criteria be met. The vesting criteria are dependent on earnings
per share growth of the 2008 results compared with the 2005 results.
LTIP (2) – these are Matching Shares awarded under the LTIP scheme. They are free shares and are conditional on the Directors acquiring a certain number of shares by 7 May 2006 for the respective Director
to be entitled to the Matching Shares available under the scheme, and the performance criteria be met. The vesting criteria are dependent on earnings per share growth of the 2008 results compared with the
2005 results.
LTIP (3) – these are Conditional Shares awarded under the LTIP scheme. They are free shares awarded to the Directors should the performance criteria be met. The vesting criteria are dependent on earnings
per share growth of the 2009 results compared with the 2006 results.
LTIP (4) – these are Matching Shares awarded under the LTIP scheme. They are free shares and are conditional on the Directors acquiring a certain number of shares by 30 June 2007 for the respective
Director to be entitled to the Matching Shares available under the scheme, and the performance criteria be met. The vesting criteria are dependent on earnings per share growth of the 2009 results compared
with the 2006 results.
Those options awarded under LTIP (3) and LTIP (4) were granted on 8 March 2007.
Note (1): Alan M. Jackson was granted an option over 2,400,000 ordinary shares on 5 June 2001 at an exercise price of 45p per share.
This option was divided into three tranches of 800,000 shares, each of which may only be exercised if certain performance criteria are 
met. The Company’s share price must meet a specified target, which is 75p in the case of the first tranche, 105p in the case of the
second tranche and 135p in the case of the third tranche. In addition, the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that there has been 
a sustained improvement in the underlying performance of the Group before any tranche of the option can be exercised. For the second
and third tranches, half of each tranche of the option may be exercised after three years and half after four years in each case following 
the date of the grant. Each tranche of the option will lapse six years following the date of the grant if the target share price has not by 
then been met. If, however, the target share price relating to any tranche of the option is met within this period that tranche will remain
exercisable until ten years following the date of grant. If a change of control of the Company occurs, Mr. Jackson is entitled to exercise 
the option in full.
The Company’s share price has met the criteria of the three tranches and the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that there has been 
a sustained improvement in the underlying performance of the Group. Alan M. Jackson has exercised all of those options available to 
him under the first and second tranches, and has exercised half of the third tranche.
During 2006 certain Directors exercised share options that had vested. Details of the exercises are noted below:

Report to the shareholders of The Restaurant Group plc
We have audited the Group and parent company financial statements (the “financial statements”) of The Restaurant Group plc for the year
ended 31 December 2006 which comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated and parent company balance sheets, the
consolidated cash flow statement, the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity and the related notes. These financial
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’
remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union, and for preparing the parent company financial
statements and the Directors’ remuneration report in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the
part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and
whether, in addition, the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We
also report to you if, in our opinion, the Report of the Directors is not consistent with the financial statements, if the company has not kept
proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified
by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed. 
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not
required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. 
The other information comprises only the report of the Directors including the corporate governance statement, the unaudited part of the
Directors’ remuneration report, the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive Officer’s review of operations, the Group Finance Director’s
review, the financial highlights and the Group financial record. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Our report has been prepared pursuant to the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. No person is entitled to
rely on this report unless such a person is a person entitled to rely upon this report by virtue of and for the purpose of the Companies Act
1985 or has been expressly authorised to do so by our prior written consent. Save as above, we do not accept responsibility for this report
to any other person or for any other purpose and we hereby expressly disclaim any and all such liability.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part
of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by
the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and
Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration
report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we
also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’
remuneration report to be audited. The Restaurant Group plc

4 April 2007 Accounting policies for 
the consolidated accounts
The Restaurant Group plc 
Annual Report 2006 32
This information has been extracted from the statutory accounts of the group which were approved on 4 April 2007. 
This information in itself does not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of section 240 Companies Act 1985.
Significant accounting policies
The Restaurant Group plc (the “Company”) is a company incorporated and registered in Scotland. The consolidated financial statements 
of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2006 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”)
and the Group’s interest in its associate. 
(a) Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) and 
its interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and as adopted by the European Union. 
(b) Basis of preparation
For accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2005, the accounting year runs to the nearest Sunday to 31 December each
year which will be a 52 or 53 week period. 
The financial statements are presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand. They are prepared on the historical cost basis except
derivative financial instruments which are held at their fair value. Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are stated at the
lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions
that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated
assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods.
Future accounting policies
IFRS 7 “Financial instruments: disclosures” will be mandatory for the Group for the year ending 30 December 2007. This will require 
the Group to amend certain disclosures in relation to its financial instruments, but will have no impact on the results presented. IAS 1
Amendment – Capital Disclosures will also be mandatory for the Group for the year ending 30 December 2007, and this will not have any
impact on the results presented but will amend certain disclosures. IFRS 8 “Operating Segments” will be mandatory for the Group for the
2009 year end results, and again will provide amendments to disclosures but will not change the Group’s result. The Group does not
consider that any other standards or interpretations issued by the IASB, but not yet applicable, will have a significant impact on the 
financial statements.
(c) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern 
the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that
presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account, regardless of management’s intention to exercise that option or warrant.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until
the date that control ceases.
(ii) Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. The
consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the total recognised gains and losses of associates on an equity accounted
basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases. When the Group’s share of losses
exceeds its interest in an associate, the Group’s carrying amount would be reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued
except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an associate.
(iii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intragroup balances and any gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing 
the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s
interest in the entity. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence
of impairment.
(d) Foreign currency
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the date of the balance sheet.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. The profit and loss
accounts for overseas operations are translated at the average rate of exchange for the periods covered by the accounts. Exchange
differences that relate to the net equity investment in overseas activities are taken directly to reserves. All other translation differences 
are taken to the income statement.
(e) Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and
investment activities. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading
purposes. However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments. The Restaurant Group plc 
Annual Report 2006 33
This information has been extracted from the statutory accounts of the group which were approved on 4 April 2007. 
This information in itself does not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of section 240 Companies Act 1985.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at cost. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial instruments are stated at
fair value. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement. However, where derivatives
qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance
sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
(f) Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation (see below) and impairment losses (see
accounting policy k). 
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property,
plant and equipment.
Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. The
owner-occupied property (excluding land element) acquired by way of finance lease is stated at an amount equal to the lower of its fair
value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation (see below) and
impairment losses (see accounting policy k). Lease payments are accounted for as described in accounting policy r.
Subsequent costs
The Group recognises in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment the cost of replacing part of such an item when
that cost is incurred if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the
item can be measured reliably. All other costs are recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property,
plant and equipment. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Freehold land Indefinite
Freehold buildings 50 years
Long and short leasehold property Term of lease or 25 years, whichever is lower
Fixtures and equipment 3-10 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
Computer equipment 3-5 years
(g) Intangible assets – goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition 
of subsidiaries. In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the difference between
the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to 1 January 2004 has not been reconsidered 
in preparing the Group’s opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units and is tested annually 
for impairment (see accounting policy k). In respect of associates, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of 
the investment in the associate.
Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in the income statement.
(h) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at their cost less impairment losses (see accounting policy k).
(i) Stock
Stock is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course 
of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
(j) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an
integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement
of cash flows.
(k) Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of
impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and assets that have an indefinite
useful life, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying
amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. Accounting policies for

Annual Report 2006 34
This information has been extracted from the statutory accounts of the group which were approved on 4 April 2007. 
This information in itself does not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of section 240 Companies Act 1985.
(l) Share-based payment transactions
The share option programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Company. The fair value of options granted is recognised
as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period
during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using a
Stochastic model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an
expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to market based conditions
not achieving the threshold for vesting.
(m) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event,
and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
(n) Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences identified at the balance sheet date, except to the extent that the deferred
tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill. Temporary differences are differences between the carrying amount of the Group’s assets
and liabilities and their tax base.
(o) Pensions
The Group makes contributions for selected employees into defined contribution pension plans and these contributions are charged to the
income statement as they become payable. The Group does not operate any defined benefit plans.
(p) Onerous contracts
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the
unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
(q) Revenue
Revenue represents amounts received and receivable for services and goods provided (excluding value added tax and voluntary gratuities
left by customers for the benefit of employees).
(r) Expenses
(i) Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
(ii) Finance lease payments
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is
allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
(iii) Pre-opening expenses
Property rentals and related costs incurred up to the date of opening of a new restaurant are written off to the income statement in the year 
in which they are incurred. Promotional and training costs are written off to the income statement in the year in which they are incurred.
(s) Dividend policy
In accordance with IAS 10, ‘Events after the Balance Sheet Date’, dividends declared after the balance sheet date are not recognised 
as a liability at that balance sheet date, and are recognised in the financial statements when they have received approval by shareholders.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies as described above, management has made the following judgements and
estimations that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements:
(a) Impairment of carrying value of loan note from associate
Following a detailed review of the carrying value of Living Ventures, and in light of current trading performance, the Board has concluded
that it is appropriate to make a provision of £9.5m against the loan note repayable in 2008.
(b) Impairment of goodwill
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on a twice-annual basis. This requires an estimate of the value in use of the
assets to which goodwill is ascribed. Estimating the value-in-use requires the Group to make an estimate of the future cash flows from
those assets and to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. Note 11 provides further
information on assumptions used.
(c) DPP Restaurants Limited
DPP Restaurants Ltd (“DPP”) was consolidated as a subsidiary under IAS 27 throughout 2005 even though The Restaurant Group plc
(“TRG” or “The Group”) legally only held 19.9% of the issued share capital due to the existence of an option to take full control of DPP
which became exercisable on 31 December 2004. The additional income statement segregates the results of DPP in 2005 when the
business was not under the direct control of the Board. TRG acquired full control of DPP on 12 January 2006 for a nominal sum and
therefore the Group results include those of DPP in 2006 (as detailed further in note 2). Consolidated

Note 2 – Additional income statement
Additional income statement information is provided as a useful guide to underlying trading performance. The adjustments from the
statutory income statement are to aid understanding of the income statement and should be read in conjunction with, rather than as 
a substitute for, the reported information.
DPP Restaurants Ltd (“DPP”) was consolidated as a subsidiary under IAS 27 throughout 2005 even though The Restaurant Group plc
(“TRG” or “The Group”) legally only held 19.9% of the issued share capital due to the existence of an option to take full control of DPP
which became exercisable on 31 December 2004. The additional income statement segregates the results of DPP in 2005 when the
business was not under the direct control of the Board. TRG acquired full control of DPP on 12 January 2006 for a nominal sum and
therefore the Group results include those of DPP in 2006. 
The 2006 and 2005 results include a number of items which are of a one-off nature and not representative of the underlying trading
performance of the business. These have been separately identified in the additional income statement as non-trading items.
For the purposes of the additional income statement, a normalised tax rate of 34% has been applied to the trading business to reflect 
the underlying effective tax rate.

DPP Restaurants Ltd (“DPP”) was consolidated as a subsidiary under IAS 27 throughout 2005 even though The Restaurant Group plc
(“TRG” or “The Group”) legally only held 19.9% of the issued share capital due to the existence of an option to take full control of DPP
which became exercisable on 31 December 2004. The results of DPP in 2005 are segregated as the business was not under the direct
control of the Board. TRG acquired full control of DPP on 12 January 2006 for a nominal sum and therefore the Group results include
those of DPP in 2006.

Limited in 2008. Interest is receivable from Living Ventures Limited at a rate of LIBOR. No interest receivable from Living Ventures Limited
has been recognised in the income statement of The Restaurant Group plc in 2006. Following a detailed review of the carrying value 
of the investment, and in light of current trading performance, the Board has concluded that it is appropriate to make a provision 
of £9.5m against the loan note.

Directors’ remuneration report on page 29. During the year Mr Alan M. Jackson exercised 400,000 share options at an exercise price 
of 45p, and as at 31 December 2006 there are 400,000 share options outstanding. No charge to the income statement is recognised 
in respect of Mr Alan M. Jackson’s share options as they were granted prior to 7 November 2002.
Note (2): To ensure comparability of the value of options to option holders, the exercise price and number of shares awarded were subject
to amendment following the Placing on 14 January 2004.
Executive Share Option Plans (ESOPs)
The Group has in place two ESOPs, the 1998 scheme and 2003 scheme. Under these schemes the Remuneration Committee may grant
options over shares in The Restaurant Group plc to employees of the Group. The contractual life of an option is ten years. Awards under
the ESOPs are generally reserved for senior management level and above and 33 employees were eligible to participate at 31 December
2006. Options granted under the ESOPs become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to growth in earnings
per share exceeding RPI growth by more than 4% (under the 1998 scheme) or 2
1
/2% (under the 2003 scheme). Exercise of options is
subject to continued employment within the Group.
Options were valued using a Stochastic option pricing model. No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations. 
As permitted by IFRS 2, only options granted since 7 November 2002 which were unvested at 1 January 2005 have been valued. 
A reconciliation of the movement in outstanding share options under the ESOPs is provided below:

During 2006, the weighted average market price at date of exercise was 227p per share (2005: 137p).
During 2003 the Group adopted the 2003 Executive Share Option Mirror Scheme. The 2003 Mirror Scheme was introduced on similar
terms to the 1998 Scheme save for certain changes which are incorporated into the 2003 Mirror Scheme. The 2003 Mirror Scheme was
designed so that an option granted pursuant to the 2003 Mirror Scheme (“Mirror Options”) could be issued to both existing holders of
options under the 1998 Scheme (“1998 Options”) and to new participants. However holders of share options granted under the 1998
Scheme can only exercise either their mirror options or their 1998 options, but not both. Mirror Options can only be exercised by 1998
Option holders if their 1998 Options have not already been exercised. If their 1998 Options are exercised or lapse then the Mirror Options
will lapse. The Mirror Options held by 1998 Option holders have a life for the residue of the life of the existing 1998 Options. The Restaurant Group plc

Long-Term Incentive Plan
On 9 November 2005 an Extraordinary General Meeting of The Restaurant Group plc approved the adoption of a new Long-Term
Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) for the Group. Details of the LTIP are provided in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 24 to 29. Options
were granted to Directors and selected employees on 7 December 2005 1,131,188 Conditional Award share options and 643,515
Matching Award share options were granted. In respect of the Matching Award share options, the respective Director or employee is
required to acquire a number of shares by 7 May 2006, known as “Deposited Shares”, and retain these shares until the Matching Award
share options vest, for those Matching Award share options to be valid. During the period to 31 December 2006, a total of 308,652
options have lapsed and a total of 1,466,051 options were outstanding at 31 December 2006 and are not exercisable until 2009. The
options from the LTIP scheme will be satisfied through share purchases via a trust. The fair value of a share at the time of grant was 
£1.47. Vesting of share options under the LTIP is dependent on continuing employment. None of the options under the LTIP scheme 
were exercisable at the year end.
Following the year end, a further award was made to Directors and selected employees. On 8 March 2007, 567,263 Conditional Award
share options and 247,908 Matching Award share options were granted at a value of £3.255 per option. The conditions pertaining to the
2007 award mirror those of the award made on 7 November 2005.
Save As You Earn scheme
Under the Save As You Earn (“SAYE”) scheme the Board may grant options over shares in The Restaurant Group plc to UK-based
employees of the Group. Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to 80% of the average market price of the shares for the
five days prior to invitation. Employees pay a fixed amount from salary into a savings account each month, for a three-year savings period.
At the end of the savings period, employees have six months in which to exercise their options using the funds saved. If employees decide
not to exercise their options, they may withdraw their funds saved and the options expire. Exercise of options is subject to continued
employment within the Group. Options were valued using the Stochastic share pricing model. As permitted by IFRS 2, only options
granted since 7 November 2002, which were unvested at 1 January 2005, have been valued. None of the share options under the SAYE
scheme were exercisable at 31 December 2006 and 1 January 2006.

No separate cash flow has been presented in respect of discontinued activities as it is not possible to separately identify working capital 
or financing payments and receipts in respect of these operations, as these are centrally managed. EBITDA and capital additions
approximately represent operating and investing cash flows.
Major non-cash transactions
As disclosed in notes 5 and 13, during the year the Group performed an impairment review on the carrying value of Living Ventures. In light
of the recent trading performance, the Board has concluded that it is appropriate to make a provision of £9.5m against the carrying value
of the loan note payable in 2008. The impairment represents a significant non-cash transaction. The Restaurant Group plc

24 Financial instruments and derivatives (continued)
Financial liabilities
The financial liabilities of the Group comprised:
2006 2005
£’000 £’000
Short-term borrowings – at floating interest rates* 1,165 1,845
Trade and other payables 74,864 71,476
Short-term financial liabilities 76,029 73,321
Long-term borrowings – at floating interest rates* 47,000 11,000
Finance lease debt 2,737 2,696
Provisions 3,466 763
Long-term financial liabilities 53,203 14,459
Financial liabilities 129,232 87,780
* Total financial liabilities attracting interest were £48,165,000 (2005: £12,845,000). Interest is payable at floating interest rates which fluctuate
and are dependent on LIBOR or base rate. The average weighted year end interest rate for these borrowings was 6.30% (2005: 5.50%).
Effective from 16 January 2003, the Group entered into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of £20,000,000 to be fixed at 4.55%
per annum for a period of three years, terminating on 15 January 2006. The Group also entered into an interest rate swap for a further
notional amount of £20,000,000 to be fixed at 4.395% per annum for a period of three years, effective from 16 January 2003 which
terminated on 15 January 2006. This second interest rate swap provided the counterparty with the right, but not the obligation, to enter 
into a further transaction to renew the interest rate swap on £20,000,000 at 4.395% for a further two years, terminating on 15 January 2008.
This option was not taken up by the counterparty.
Effective from 16 January 2006, the Group entered into a new interest rate swap for an initial notional amount of £20,000,000, rising to
£50,000,000 from 18 April 2006 until 16 January 2008, when it reduces to £30,000,000 until 16 January 2009, when it terminates. The
fixed rate for the duration of the three years is 4.695%.
The Group has £33,000,000 (2005: £69,000,000) of committed borrowing facilities in excess of gross borrowings at 31 December 2006
which are due to expire in 2008, when the bank loan of £47,000,000 (2005: £11,000,000) is also due to expire.
(b) Foreign currency exposure profile as at 31 December 2006
The Group has invested in and operates three restaurants in Spain, where the currency is the Euro. Consequently the Group has 
a potential currency exposure on the translation of results from its Spanish operations, and translating the assets and liabilities from Euros
to the Group’s reporting currency, Sterling. This exposure is reviewed on a regular basis, and is not considered to be material to the
performance of the Group, or to the balance sheet.
(c) Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
Book value Fair value Book value Fair value
Primary financial instruments held or used 2006 2006 2005 2005
to finance the Group’s operations: £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000

(47,482) (47,482) (12,419) (12,419)
The Group does not hold any financial instruments for trading purposes. The fair value of short term borrowings and cash in hand together
with short-term non-interest bearing trade and other receivables and trade and other payables approximate to book values due to the
short-term maturity of these instruments. As highlighted in note 13, book value approximates to fair value in respect of the non-current
receivable of £875,000. The Group has derivative instruments relating to interest rate swaps. In accordance with IAS 39 this has been
valued at 31 December 2006. The fair value of this instrument was £652,000 (2005: £7,000) and this is accounted for in the consolidated
balance sheet. Movements on the fair value are recorded through the consolidated income statement. In accordance with the transitional
provisions available under IFRS 1, the Group did not adopt IAS 39 until periods commencing after 1 January 2005. Consequently, opening
reserves were adjusted by the fair value of the interest rate swap on 1 January 2005 and net assets of the Group increased by £127,000,
with an equivalent increase in equity.
(d) Credit risk
The Group has credit risks on its trade debtors and the long-term receivable from Living Ventures Limited. In light of the current trading
performance of Living Ventures Limited, and following a detailed review of the carrying value of the business, including the loan note
receivable, the Board has concluded it is appropriate to make a £9.5m provision against the long-term receivable. Due to the nature of the
Group’s business there are not significant exposures on underlying revenue trading. Counterparties for cash and derivative balances are with
financial institutions with strong credit ratings. The Restaurant Group plc

The Group has entered into a number of property leases on standard commercial terms. There are no restrictions imposed by the Group’s
operating leases, either in the current or prior year.
Included within the minimum rentals are amounts payable as concession fees. These arrangements are principally in the Group’s
Concessions division, which operates in UK airports. Within these concession arrangements there is usually a concession fee for each 
unit which is based on the revenue derived from that unit.

27 Related party transactions
Living Ventures Limited is a related party to The Restaurant Group plc through the Group’s 40% holding. During the year interest of
£634,000 was accrued on the loan note between Living Ventures Limited and The Restaurant Group plc at the rate of LIBOR. The Group
recognised £nil (2005: £522,000) in respect of interest income due from Living Ventures Limited. Under the terms of the loan note none 
of this interest was payable as at 31 December 2006, consequently in addition to the loan note of £10,375,000 outstanding at that date,
£1,156,000 of interest receivable was also due from Living Ventures Limited. Following a detailed review of the carrying value of Living

Solid Waste is the collection, transfer, recycling and treatment of 
non-hazardous waste. The market can be divided into Industrial 
and Commercial (I&C), Construction and Demolition (C&D) and 
Municipal. I&C represents general commercial waste where 
contracts are generally short term. The C&D market is more 
cyclical in nature and is also typiﬁed by shorter term contracts. 
Municipal represents short or medium-term contracts for the 
collection and treatment of household waste. Many elements 
of the waste can be recycled and re-used.
The Organics market includes source segregated streams 
from both the industrial and municipal sectors with both shorter 
term and longer term contracts. Through specialist processing, 
biogas is produced from the natural biological activity. 
The biogas is then used to produce electricity which is then 
transferred directly into the local grid. We also use composting 
techniques to produce a quality pathogen free soil enhancer 
or fertiliser. Organic processing is one of the fastest growing 
segments within the waste sector.
The Hazardous Waste market focuses on the processing 
and ﬁnal disposal of lightly contaminated materials 
including the thermal treatment of soils, the biological 
and physio-chemical treatment of waste water and the 
pyrolysis of paint waste. We also supply industrial cleaning 
services to the oil and gas and petrochemical industries.
The UK Municipal market represents the provision of waste 
disposal services to local authorities in the UK. We treat it 
separately from the rest of the municipal markets referred 
to in the solid waste section above because of the nature 
of the contracts. They are 25 year Private Finance Initiative (PFI) 
or Public Private Partnership (PPP) arrangements where we 
have an operating contract to treat the municipal waste delivered 
to the recycling facilities. This market is driven by the need to 
reduce substantially the amount of UK waste going to landﬁll 
as set out in the EU Landﬁll Directive.

 Shanks Group plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2012
The Group’s strategy of providing 
sustainable waste management 
solutions has continued to gain 
traction this year. 
Our investment programme is generating good 
returns and we have delivered earnings growth 
despite continued tough economic conditions. 
In particular, activity levels in the Benelux region 
have remained slow. However, our business 
centres on ‘making more from waste’ and 
we had another good year in this respect. 
Our recycling and recovery rate reached an 
all-time high for the Group at 78%. This is an 
industry-leading level of recycling and reﬂects 
our strategic focus on sustainable alternatives 
to landﬁll and mass incineration.
We have continued to make investments in new 
infrastructure during the year, as we have 
throughout this recession. This ongoing 
investment has been enabled by management’s 
continued actions on trading and operational 
gains, together with tight cost and cash 
management. The combination of new facilities 
coming on line, and lean operations, will put us in a 
strong position as underlying economies improve. 
We were disappointed not to progress a number 
of UK municipal waste contracts, however our PFI 
portfolio has performed very well. We achieved 
ﬁnancial close on the £750m Barnsley, Doncaster 
and Rotherham contract in March 2012 and our 
existing PFI businesses have continued to perform 
strongly with signiﬁcant improvements in trading 
margins to the 9%–10% range. This represents a 
signiﬁcant turnaround from the loss making position 
just three years ago and we are conﬁdent the gains 
will be sustained. Our Benelux business produced 
a robust performance in tough markets with 
Hazardous Waste delivering strong proﬁt gains from 
international contract growth. This helped offset 
domestic price pressures in the Solid Waste business 
resulting from lower volumes and incineration 
overcapacity, particularly in the Netherlands.
The industry in which we operate continues to 
evolve at pace. The challenge of protecting the 
environment and developing new sources of 
energy, while stimulating economic growth is 
intensifying. At the same time, society needs to 
deal with waste in a more responsible way than 
simply burying or burning it. Shanks is well placed 
to provide both cost-effective and sustainable 
waste management solutions. In our treatment 
processes we also produce valuable products, 
including green energy, recovered fuel and 
recyclates that minimise our reliance on ﬁnite raw 
materials. We therefore continue to invest in 
sustainable facilities and technologies that will meet 
future needs and improve the world we live in, as 
well as generate strong returns for shareholders. 

At the year-end the ratio of core net debt to 
EBITDA stood at 1.7 times, well within our 
banking covenant test of 3 times and our target 
Chairman’s statement

 Group Chairman Shanks Group plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2012
of less than 2.5 times. This has been achieved 
through operational delivery and robust cash 
management. Following the re-ﬁnancing last year 
which extended our debt proﬁle, we now have 
funding in place with maturities in the three to six 
year range, at an average cost of 5%. This stable 
and ﬂexible funding structure is an essential 
platform upon which to build our future growth.

Underlying earnings per share for the year grew 
by 1 1% to 7 .2 pence. Consistent with our stated 
policy of maintaining dividend cover between 
2 and 2.5 times, the Board will be recommending 
a ﬁnal dividend of 2.35 pence per share, payable 
on 1 August 2012 to shareholders on the register 
on 6 July 2012. It remains the Board’s intention to 
pursue a progressive dividend policy as earnings 
per share increases.

The Board was pleased to appoint Peter Dilnot as 
the Group’s new Chief Executive, who joined us 
from Danaher Corporation on 1 February 2012. 
We would like to express our appreciation to Tom 
Drury, Peter’s predecessor, for his leadership and 
contribution during his four years as Chief Executive. 
We would also like to thank Chris Surch for his role 
as Acting Chief Executive until Peter’s arrival. 
Once again, on behalf of the Board, I would like to 
thank all Shanks’ employees for their tremendous 
efforts in providing excellent services to our 
customers during another challenging year. 
Our people are the key to our future success and 
under Peter’s overall leadership we are increasing 
the focus on developing the Group’s teams and 
capabilities. To improve understanding of what 
Shanks does for its people and their contribution 
to the Group, we have introduced a new section 
on ‘Our culture and people’ in this report (see 
pages 34 to 37).
It is increasingly important for us to understand the 
full range of our people’s capabilities, skills and 
perspectives. We have many talented people in the 
Group and embracing diversity further will help 
create a stronger team. Managing and building a 
diverse workforce is not only the right thing to do, 
it is also valuable for our business. By effectively 
harnessing all of our people’s talents we will be 
more innovative and serve our customers better. 
On 14 May 2012 the Board announced that Chris 
Surch, Group Finance Director, will be leaving the 
Company with effect from 31 August 2012, to join 
FirstGroup plc as Group Finance Director. We will 
be sorry to see Chris go, but we can see that this 
is an exciting new challenge for him and we are 
grateful to Chris for the signiﬁcant contribution he 
has made over the last three years. A search for his 
successor has commenced.

The Board is committed to the highest standards 
of corporate governance. Details on our 
processes and approach, including those relating 
to the role and effectiveness of the Board and 
compliance with the Governance Code are set 
out in the Governance section on pages 68 to 74. 

I am pleased to report continued progress in 
delivering against our nine clear Corporate 
Responsibility commitments. These include 
quantiﬁed targets for carbon avoidance, employee 
wellbeing and recycling and recovery rates. 
Further details are given on pages 38 to 41 of this 
report. Our ongoing focus in these areas has once 
again been recognised by Shanks’ inclusion in the 
independently assessed FTSE4Good Index.
Shanks has one of the lowest reported accident 
ﬁgures in the waste industry. However we will not 
be satisﬁed until we have zero accidents and this 
remains a key goal. Our Group-wide ‘Action on 
Safety’ initiative has been led strongly by the 
Group’s senior management and signiﬁcant time 
has been invested in conducting safety audits 
and improvements throughout our operations. 
The initiative has raised the overall performance 
of health and safety across the Group and has 
been instrumental in reducing our RIDDOR rates 
by 13% this year. We have made progress, but 
will continue and intensify our efforts in this area. 

We are pleased with the progress made on 
executing our strategy this year. The underlying 
growth from our investment programme remains 
strong and the executive management are taking 
positive action to build a leaner and more focused 
business. We will up the pace of our execution 
further in the year ahead. This should deliver 
short-term earnings growth with signiﬁcant 
acceleration once economic conditions improve. 
Shanks Group uses sustainable and cost-effective 
technologies to make valuable products from 
waste. In doing so, we can deliver solutions 
to society’s environmental challenges while 
generating good returns for our shareholders. 
Thank you for your continued support.
 
Group Chairman

Chief Executive’s statement


 Group Chief Executive

This is my ﬁrst statement as Chief Executive, 
having joined the Group in February. I came to 
Shanks because I believe it is a strong and 
well-positioned business in an increasingly 
important growth market. My time in the 
business has reinforced this view. 
Clearly we are operating in a challenging 
macro-economic environment at the moment. 
However, Shanks has many compelling 
opportunities to deliver proﬁtable growth and 
shareholder value. By ‘making more from waste’, 
I am conﬁdent that we will do just that. 
Shanks’ strategy is focused on delivering 
cost-effective and sustainable alternatives to 
landﬁll and mass incineration. The need for such 
solutions is increasing due to regulation and 
legislation, together with society’s determination 
to protect our environment. Shanks is well 
placed to meet these growing demands with 
its strong portfolio of businesses, capabilities 
and technologies. 

During the year, Shanks continued to deliver 
proﬁtable growth despite softer market volumes 
and price pressure in some of our markets. 
Revenue grew by 3% at constant currency and 
underlying earnings per share increased by 9%. 
This was a direct result of strong returns from 
Shanks’ strategic investment programme, 
together with focused management action 
to streamline operations and reduce costs. 
It was particularly encouraging to deliver 
improved results in our core growth areas 
of the UK and Organics which grew revenue 
by 6% and 28% year-on-year respectively. 
Our Benelux Hazardous Waste business also 
performed strongly with trading proﬁt up 26%. 
These operational gains, coupled with returns 
from the investment programme and £11m 
cost savings achieved during the year, more 
than offset the difﬁcult trading conditions in our 
Solid Waste markets. 
Shanks has many compelling 
opportunities to deliver proﬁtable 
growth and shareholder value.  Bio-Diesel
Responsible
Shanks Group plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2012
The Group-wide ‘Action on Safety’ initiative led 
by senior management has been instrumental 
in achieving a reduction of 13% to our level 
of reportable accidents in the year. The focus 
on safety continues and we will drive further 
improvements. 

Shanks’ overall vision remains consistent and 
has become more focused. We retain a clear 
aim to be the leading provider of sustainable 
alternatives to landﬁll and mass incineration. 
We plan to lead in selected target markets which 
have strong sustainable growth drivers and 
characteristics that enable Shanks to gain 
competitive advantage. This aspiration reﬂects 
opportunities in our current growth markets, 
such as Organics in Canada, and also our 
commitment to be highly selective about where 
we will operate in the future.

 Shanks’ strategy to deliver growth from sustainable waste management is robust and 
supported by long-term growth drivers. We create value from recycling, recovering energy 
and making products from material that is otherwise thrown away. We believe that our 
approach of ‘making more from waste’ delivers cost-effective and environmentally 
sustainable solutions to dealing with a wide range of waste streams. 
To focus and accelerate our execution, four strategic priorities have been identiﬁed:
The background and future outlook for each of these is described on the following pages. 
 Shanks Group plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2012


We have invested £140m in sustainable waste 
management infrastructure since 2008. The 
performance of these investments has improved 
over time and we are now consistently delivering 
our target post-tax returns of 12–15% when 
plants are fully operational. We have developed 
project management capabilities and 
operational metrics to ensure that we continue 
to generate superior returns on investment.
A further £110m will be deployed as part of the 
second phase of the strategic investment 
programme. We are already working on a 
signiﬁcant number of sustainable projects that 
leverage our existing core capabilities and the 
pipeline of such opportunities continues to grow 
at a promising rate. Our target projects are 
increasingly in Organics where we have proven 
expertise and can deliver excellent operating 
margins. In the UK municipal market we are 
detecting early signs of a more difﬁcult funding 
environment, together with local authorities 
planning for shorter term contracts and less 
capital intensive facilities. We believe that there 
will be ongoing opportunities for Shanks in this 
market and we will continue to invest heavily in 
the UK given the strong need for further 
sustainable diversion from landﬁll.


Shanks Group sustainably recycles and 
reprocesses waste into valuable products. 
We get value from the products we make 
so our recycling and recovery rate is a critical 
operational metric. In 2011/12 we achieved 
an industry-leading recycling and recovery 
rate of 78% up from 70% three years ago. 
More broadly in 2011/12, we improved our 
Organics operating margins from 13% to 18%. 
Additionally, in our UK PFI/PPP business we 
delivered excellent service to Local Authorities 
while driving operating margins from 6.4% to 
10.1% in the year.
We are now refocusing the Group to be more 
product-oriented. This includes signiﬁcant effort 
on delivering outstanding productivity. The core 
principles of lean manufacturing can be applied 
to our industry and they will be implemented 
going forward. By way of illustration, we have 
started to develop an improved set of ‘daily 
management’ tools to measure and increase 
the operational performance of our facilities. 
These will be rolled out across the Group and 
will ensure that we really are ‘making more from 
waste’. Our productivity focus is particularly 
important given that solid waste volumes are 
currently suppressed by the macro-economic 
environment.

Annual Report & Accounts 2012


We have a decentralised structure that enables 
local entrepreneurial management teams to 
deliver responsive and innovative services 
to our customers. Over recent years, we have 
sought to foster this cultural advantage whilst 
developing a stronger central framework to 
deliver Group-wide beneﬁts. To drive this, the 
Group’s Executive Committee (Excom*) has 
driven a wider range of initiatives. For example, 
we have started a centrally coordinated 
procurement project and have increased 
cross-border trading activities. In addition, 
a new overall Shanks brand was successfully 
rolled out across the Group, including in the 
Netherlands where there have been only 
local brands in the past. 
In addition to recent improvements, we still have 
many opportunities to leverage further our 
Group capabilities, technologies and scale. We 
are escalating our overall focus on people and 
capability development. We are also developing 
the organisation to be more closely aligned with 
our core activities. To this end Henk Kaskens, 
the Managing Director of our Organics business, 
was recently appointed to the Group Excom 
and now reports directly to me. In addition, 
we are targeting further synergies from across 
the Group and announcements will be made 
as our plans develop during the year.

Over the years Shanks has delivered signiﬁcant 
value from bolt-on acquisitions. In March 2012 
this continued with the acquisition of the 
Dutch glass recycling business, Van Tuijl. 
This acquisition expands our capabilities in 
an important recyclate market and complements 
our existing operations. We have clear plans to 
grow Van Tuijl and the business is off to a strong 
start under our ownership. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to use 
acquisitions to strengthen our core businesses. 
We believe buying and integrating bolt-on 
businesses in the current environment can 
accelerate the Group’s proﬁtable growth. 
Our balance sheet provides us with this strategic 
ﬂexibility and we are actively looking for 
appropriate opportunities that meet our target 
returns on investment. In parallel, we are also 
assessing the Group’s current portfolio to 
identify non-core businesses. This process 
is ongoing, but has already highlighted some 
small regional operations that might create 
more value under alternative ownership. 

We have four core activities: Solid Waste, 
Hazardous Waste, Organics and UK Municipal 
(PFI/PPP). Each of these activities has different 
demand drivers, proﬁtability proﬁles and capital 
requirements. We also have distinct ways in 
which we create competitive advantage in each 
of these activities. At the same time, all of them 
provide cost-effective and sustainable solutions 
to reduce landﬁll and mass incineration. They all 
‘make more from waste’ by creating products 
such as green energy, recyclate commodities, 
recovered fuel and organic fertilisers. Our 
activities are described in more detail throughout 
this report, together with ‘how we win’.
Our portfolio of activities have the following 
key attributes: 
• Solid Waste – productive, lean business 
with leading recycling rates; well positioned 
for recovery 
• Hazardous Waste – strong proﬁtable business 
with competitive advantage and international 
reach
• Organics – growing international green 
business with proven capabilities and 
attractive economics 
• UK Municipal (long-term PFI/PPP contracts) – 
strong stable business with improving service 
and returns, plus continued growth 
opportunities 
Over the last three years, the proportion of 
Group proﬁt from Hazardous, Organics and 
UK Municipal has increased from 33% to around 
60%. This more balanced business mix reduces 
the cyclical exposure of the Group.
We believe our combination of established 
sustainable businesses, coupled with a renewed 
focus on growth, operational excellence and 
Group capability, will generate signiﬁcant 
shareholder value in the years ahead. 

Going into 2012/13, we are building on Shanks’ 
stable platform by accelerating and intensifying 
the execution of our strategy. Our markets look 
set to remain challenging in the year ahead. 
To offset these macro headwinds we are taking 
action to deliver cost reductions and Group 
synergies. We will also continue to generate 
further returns from our ongoing investment 
programme and through a renewed focus 
on operational performance. 
I believe that we are well-positioned to deliver 
growth in line with the Board’s expectations for 
2012/13 and that the future outlook for Shanks 
Group is very positive.

Annual Report & Accounts 2012
Measuring our performance – KPIs


Earnings per share growth is 
considered the key indicator of the 
Group’s success and is closely 
aligned to management incentives. 
Our measure is deﬁned as underlying 
post-tax earnings for continuing 
operations only and excluding 
exceptional items, ﬁnancing fair value 
remeasurement and amortisation 
of acquisition related intangibles.

Strong proﬁt growth and further 
reduction in the Group tax rate. 

As we continue to invest in sustainable 
projects our revenue from such 
activities should increase. The way we 
measure this is the growth in revenue 
derived from recycling, reuse, diversion 
or energy recovery thereby avoiding 
landﬁll or contaminated materials.

Although a slight decline year on year, 
revenue from sustainable activities is 
still strong at 69% of overall revenue. 

To review the performance of our 
operations the key proﬁt measure is 
trading proﬁt before interest and tax. 
The organic growth is deﬁned as the 
percentage excluding signiﬁcant 
acquisitions and discontinued activities 
at constant currency.

Strong growth coming from the UK 
and Organics. 
For measuring underlying business performance the Group uses certain non-GAAP 
proﬁt measurements which are deﬁned in note 2 to the ﬁnancial statements.

As we continue to invest in sustainable 
waste management infrastructure it is 
important to ensure that our target 
returns are being achieved. Our measure 
here is the post-tax return as a 
percentage of the original invested 
capital on those projects fully operational 
and running at normal operating levels.

Our target is to achieve a post-tax return 
of 12% to 15% once the assets are fully 
operational. The initial £100m investment 
programme has been completed and for 
those projects operating at normal levels 
the return was 12.2%. The more mature 
projects are at the top end of the range. 
We measure our performance against our strategy through the use of quantitative and 
qualitative assessments. The number of waste processes undertaken by the Group is 
signiﬁcant, with each site involved in a different range of activities resulting in a varied 
and broad range of measures. There are however, a number of key measures 
including recycling rates, productivity and accident rates, which are designated 
as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
It is a key principle to align the interests of the senior management with those of our 
shareholders and executive remuneration includes measures linked to some of the KPIs 
below. Full details of the schemes in operation are given in the Remuneration Report. 
A new Long Term Incentive Plan was introduced during the year, post shareholder 
approval, which links awards to growth in earnings per share and share price.

Annual Report & Accounts 2012



We sustainably recycle and reprocess 
waste and get value from the products 
we make and as such the recycling and 
recovery rate is a key operational metric. 
We have set the objective to have a rate 
of 80% by March 2015. The rate is 
deﬁned as tonnes of material recovered 
from processing expressed as a 
percentage of the tonnes of waste 
handled.

An increase in the year to 78% and 
we remain conﬁdent that the new 
investment projects coming online will 
help us reach our long-term target. 

The waste management industry is 
a known high risk sector with a high 
accident rate level. Health and safety is 
key with a requirement for continuous 
improvement and we have set a 
quantiﬁable long-term objective to 
reduce our more serious accident rate 
by 25% by March 2015. RIDDOR is 
the more serious accident rate 
per 100,000 employees. 

The Group-wide ‘Action on Safety’ 
initiative led by senior management 
has been instrumental in a further 
reduction of 13% in our RIDDOR rates. 
We have now achieved 16% of the 
March 2015 target of 25%. 

It is important to ensure that the 
portfolio is delivering appropriate 
returns and value for our shareholders. 
This measurement is closely aligned 
with the performance related 
remuneration for senior management. 
It is calculated as trading proﬁt 
over depreciated operating assets. 
Operating assets exclude core debt, tax, 
goodwill and acquisition intangibles.

Continued management of the asset 
base with improving proﬁts has led 
to a signiﬁcant increase. 

Conversion of waste to renewable 
energy is another key sustainability 
measure which we monitor based 
on the megawatt hours of energy 
generated.

Strong increase in the year as new 
Organic facilities in the Netherlands 
and UK are commissioned. 

Productivity focus is particularly 
important given that volumes in our 
solid waste businesses are currently 
suppressed by the macro-economic 
environment. The plant utilisation 
we monitor is for solid waste only 
and is deﬁned as tonnes of material 
processed as a percentage of the 
available sorting centre capacity.

The decline in the year was due to 
weak economic conditions in the 
Netherlands and the UK and the lower 
level of solid waste volumes available 
for processing. 

Sustainability and carbon issues are 
key in our industry and we are focused 
on the environmental impact of our 
operations. Our measure is expressed 
in tonnes and comprises both the 
beneﬁts Shanks helps others achieve 
through the use of our waste derived 
fuel as well as the direct reductions 
in our own operations from initiatives 
such as energy efﬁciencies.

Another good performance as we 
move towards the March 2015 target 
of 1.3 million tonnes.

Changing perceptions of waste in Glasgow
M MA AK K KING G G GM MO OR R RE E FR RO O OM M M “Glasgow MRF can process 150,000 tonnes per year 
of material from both municipal and commercial 
customers whilst substantially increasing recycling 
and recovery rates.”
Gerry Henderson  
Glasgow MRF Site Manager
Shanks new Materials Recycling Facility (MRF) in Glasgow is designed to achieve a 
95% recovery rate from non-segregated general waste. We sort co-mingled recyclate 
to extract cardboard, paper, aluminium, glass, wood and metals. The remaining waste 
can then be converted into a fuel used to generate heat and power. 

“We must reduce our impact on 
the local and global environment. 
Shanks’ Glasgow facility clearly 
demonstrates that sending rubbish 
to landﬁll is increasingly becoming 
a thing of the past.”
Richard Lochhead  
Scottish Environment Secretary  Shanks Group plc

Once sorted materials are sent to 
reprocessors where they are turned 
into new products reducing our 
dependency on virgin materials.
Shanks produces a range of waste derived fuels which 
are often manufactured to speciﬁc requirements and 
used by customers to offset fossil fuels.
“BAA are committed to reducing our carbon footprint and with 
Shanks’ help we have increased our recycling and recovery 
rate to over 80%, exceeding our target for landﬁll diversion.”

The primary markets in which Shanks operates are set out on 
page 6. The demand dynamics, our strengths in these markets, 
the competitive environment and growth opportunities are 
explained below.
Across the world, governments are urging the waste industry 
to support them in recovering more resources and energy 
from waste. The driving factors behind this are climate change, 
the price and security of fossil fuels and the need for society at 
large to develop sustainable waste solutions. Through legislation 
and ﬁscal incentives, governments are forcing and encouraging 
everyone to think about recovering more resources from waste. 

The chart below shows the waste management cycle and 
where we operate. Shanks has a distinct position in this industry 
structure and we have a reputation as a leading provider 
of sustainable alternatives to landﬁll and mass incineration. 
We focus our activities on sustainable waste solutions 
and ‘making more from waste’.

Annual Report & Accounts 2012
In some industrial and 
commercial markets it is 
helpful to have a ﬂeet of 
collection vehicles available 
to ensure delivery of the 
base load of waste to our 
processing plants alongside 
waste from other third party 
collectors. For the UK 
municipal markets, a 
collection ﬂeet is less 
important as the contract 
with the municipality usually 
provides for the waste to be 
delivered to our plants. We try 
to avoid highly competitive 
municipal collections unless 
backed by long-term 
contracts. In Organics, our 
focus is on the treatment 
plants and we rely on others 
to bring the waste to us.
We invest in highly automated 
sorting facilities including 
high-tech separation 
processes such as automatic 
optical sorting to sort waste 
into speciﬁc recyclates and 
streams for further treatment. 
Examples of sorting 
processes: 
• Eddy current separation of 
non-ferrous metals
• Magnet separation of ferrous 
metals
• Trommels and sieves
• Depackaging
• Manual sorting cabin
We process segregated waste 
streams into valuable recyclate 
products which are used by 
reprocessors to replace virgin 
raw materials. We have a 
market-leading position in the 
conversion of waste to high 
caloriﬁc value fuels. These fuels 
include SRF (solid recovered 
fuel) and wood biomass, both 
of which are used as a fossil 
fuel substitute by power 
generators and cement 
manufacturers. Our Organics 
technology focuses on food 
waste and the generation of 
biogas for conversion into 
renewable energy. In our 
Hazardous Waste sector we 
treat contaminated soils, water 
and paint. After treatment the 
products are either used as 
alternative sources of fuel, for 
other activities such as land 
reclamation, or discharged 
back into the water systems. 
We have to pay to dispose 
of any non-recycled incoming 
waste either through landﬁll or 
incineration. Given our strategy 
of providing sustainable 
solutions we avoid investment 
in the high capital requirements 
of mass incineration and have 
a limited investment in landﬁll.

The market environment

Demand dynamics
This is a cyclical ‘local’ business 
linked to the macro economy and 
typically involves annual contracts. 
How Shanks wins
We have an entrepreneurial 
approach to customer facing 
activities and in depth knowledge 
of local markets which results in a 
strong regionalised market share. 
This is complemented by a 
central framework for sharing 
technologies.
Competitive environment
There remains an excess capacity 
in the Continental European 
incineration market. Although 
this does not directly impact our 
Benelux businesses as we do 
not own mass incineration assets, 
it does have a signiﬁcant indirect 
impact and is exerting downward 
pressure on overall gate prices. 
We have taken action to mitigate 
this through management of costs 
and maximising the efﬁciency 
of our plants. We expect that this 
over capacity will gradually be 
removed from the system as the 
economy recovers, waste imports 
increase and less efﬁcient plant 
is retired. 
Growth opportunities
The markets in the Benelux are 
well developed with regard to 
recycling rates and diversion 
from landﬁll. This knowledge 
is shared with our UK business 
as the UK market implements 
EU legislation on recycling 
and diversion rates.

Demand dynamics
The market is characterised by 
international ‘clean up’ projects 
and long-term service contracts. 
How Shanks wins
We have world-class treatment 
capability with best-in-class 
equipment and plant productivity 
and deliver outstanding service 
levels. Our principal hazardous 
waste subsidiary in the 
Netherlands, ATM, is the market 
leader in its ﬁeld for the treatment 
of contaminated soil and waste 
water. Recent investments in 
the waste water facilities have 
increased our storage capacity 
to match the increased demand. 
The Hazardous Waste businesses 
work with the Solid Waste 
businesses under the banner of 
Total Care, to provide customers 
with a combined solution for 
their waste needs.
Competitive environment
This is a specialised market with 
a small number of players given 
the level of investment required to 
establish competitive operations.
Growth opportunities
Although the business is located 
only in our core countries we do 
seek to do business on a wider 
scale. For example, at our ATM 
facility soil from many parts of the 
world is treated before being used 
for land reclamation in the 
Netherlands.

Demand dynamics
The market covers long-term 
municipal contracts together with 
medium-term industrial contracts 
typically linked to the food sector.
How Shanks wins
Our Organics business, 
Orgaworld, has signiﬁcant 
experience in the design, build, 
optimisation and operation of 
organics installations. We offer 
a wide scope of processing 
techniques for the total range 
of organic waste focusing on 
traceability and sustainability. 
Competitive environment
The number of players in the 
UK market offering Organic 
processing has increased over 
the last few years. There is limited 
competition in North America 
where our competitors are unable 
to achieve stringent technical 
requirements.
Growth opportunities
There is an increasing focus 
on Organics as a technology. 
The North American markets 
are evolving rapidly and enforcing 
an increasing level of regulation 
in the drive for sustainable 
solutions to reduce the level 
of waste going to landﬁll.

Demand dynamics
The market is based on contracted 
volumes secured as part of 20 
to 25 year contracts.  
How Shanks wins
A leading player in the UK Private 
Finance Initiative (PFI)/Public 
Private Partnership (PPP) market 
providing an outstanding 
operational service to the local 
authorities. Shanks had the ﬁrst 
MBT plant in the UK which has 
been operational since 2006 
and we are now running ﬁve 
operational contracts, working 
on the delivery of the infrastructure 
for one contract and preferred 
bidder for another contract.
Competitive environment
The PFI/PPP market remains 
active as a number of local 
authorities still need to enter 
the process. The funding market 
is becoming more difﬁcult with 
self-ﬁnancing becoming more 
advantageous.
Growth opportunities
We adopt a disciplined approach 
to contract bidding. There is 
the opportunity for technology 
leverage, in particular with 
Organics.

Shanks has a distinct position amongst other 
large waste competitors due to its sustainable 
activities compared with landﬁll and mass 
incineration.  Shanks Group plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2012
Products and technology

Shanks’ operations sustainably recycle and 
reprocess waste into valuable products. We get 
value from the products we make, but also have 
to pay to dispose of any non-recycled incoming 
waste. Our recycling rate is therefore the critical 
operational metric – both for our economics 
and our sustainable strategy. Going forwards, 
we are reorienting the Group to be more 
product-focused. This includes signiﬁcant effort 
on driving productivity and on delivering 
outstanding operational performance.
The key products we produce throughout 
the Group are shown opposite. 

Shanks has proven capability and technological 
expertise and is a market-leader in implementing 
such technologies as Anaerobic Digestion (AD), 
Mechanical Biological Treatment (MBT) and the 
production of high caloriﬁc value fuel from 
waste. Our enhanced central framework is 
leading to greater co-ordination in this area as 
expertise in technologies is shared throughout 
the Group.
The key types of technology we use throughout 
the Group are shown on page 26.

The programme of signiﬁcant strategic 
investments is key for the future development 
of the Group. Our programme is broadly 
balanced with no single project over £20m, 
but it is focused on the higher growth territories 
of the UK and Canada and focused on recycling 
and organics facilities. Given our strong balance 
sheet and cash ﬂow we are conﬁdent that this 
programme can be funded and gearing kept 
within our target of 2.5 times EBITDA. Our 
investment criteria is to achieve an overall post 
tax return of 12% to 15% once the assets have 
reached normal operating capacity which is 
usually achieved in less than three years.
The ﬁrst phase of our investment programme 
has reached the end of its investment cycle. 
The annualised post-tax return for the year to 
March 2012 for those projects fully operational 
was 12.2% and 6.7% for those still ramping up. 
We continue to make good progress with the 
second £150m phase of which circa £65m 
of projects are underway.

Sorting centres use rudimentary techniques to separate I&C and C&D waste into different 
fractions for onward transfer to more specialised processing centres such as Materials 
Recycling Facilities (MRFs).



MRFs use a combination of advanced optical, mechanical and manual sorting to separate 
co-mingled waste streams by shape, dimension, colour and material type to separate 
I&C/C&D/municipal recyclates into various materials to feed established recycling markets.
Shanks operate a large number of MRFs across the Group.




MBTs use a combination of mechanical and biological treatment to dry, stabilise and sort 
Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) into various materials to feed recycling markets and Solid 
Recovered Fuel (SRF) for energy generation as a replacement for fossil fuel. Shanks works 
in partnership with Sistema Ecodeco to deliver MBTs in the UK. The process uses naturally 
generated heat from the degradation of the organic fraction within the MSW prior to mechanical 
sorting into various recyclates and SRF. Shanks is the sole waste management provider 
able to use Ecodeco technology in the UK.




AD enhances the natural breakdown in the absence of air of organic material from I&C and 
municipal sources to generate biogas for conversion into renewable energy and digestate 
for use as a nutrient rich soil conditioner.
Our Organics business, Orgaworld, has signiﬁcant experience in the design, build and 
operation of installations and offers a wide scope of processing techniques for the total 
range of organic waste focusing on traceability and sustainability.


Composting enhances the natural breakdown in the presence of air of organic material 
from I&C and municipal sources to generate a quality pathogen free soil enhancer/
conditioner for use in landscaping and/or agriculture.
This is a key technology in the growing Canadian market where there is limited competition.




There are three principal processes at the ATM plant in the Netherlands:

There are a number of external factors that inﬂuence the success 
of our business and future earnings growth. These drivers are set 
out and discussed below.

It is recognised that more sustainable forms of waste management 
have a role to play in accelerating the move to a low carbon 
economy. In short we have to make more from the waste we create.

The driving forces behind our industry are climate change, 
greenhouse gas emissions, fossil fuel dependency and society’s 
need to manage waste without damaging the environment. 
Biodegradable waste in landﬁll is a major source of methane 
emissions to the atmosphere. Methane is a potent greenhouse 
gas with 21 times the impact of a carbon dioxide emission of 
the same mass. 
Governments globally are responding with legislation and ﬁscal 
incentives to drive change. 

Waste management is an essential service. In the countries 
where the Group operates, there is a high level of regulation 
and enforcement and increasingly it is becoming a sophisticated 
industry using advanced technologies. 
The speciﬁc legislative drivers, both regulation and environmental 
taxation, are: 

This is the key measure that is driving change in the industry. 
This tax is used by many European states to divert waste from 
landﬁll to more environmentally acceptable options such as 
recycling and energy recovery. The UK Government has 
announced that landﬁll tax rates will increase by £8 per tonne 
per annum to £80 per tonne by 2014/15, and moving towards 
rates in the Benelux of circa €90 per tonne. The level in the UK 
from 1 April 2012 was £64 per tonne.

The dynamics of the energy markets has led to increased 
pressure to ﬁnd alternative fuels and waste is one solution. 
Many waste based electricity generation projects qualify for 
renewable electricity subsidies and credits, available in various 
forms across Europe. This is because a major component of 
waste derived fuels comprises renewable short carbon cycle 
materials, for example; wood, paper, and other vegetable matter.

Further to the increased cost of fossil fuels and 
the need to limit our dependency, waste derived 
fuels can be exempt from carbon emissions 
calculations, thereby increasing the level of 
interest in this alternative source.


In the EU, the level of environmental regulation is 
high, however unlike trade regulations there are 
no common standards for waste management. 
EU legislation sets minimum standards which 
member nations must meet. Each member state 
is, however, free to exceed these standards 
in order to follow their own political and 
environmental agendas.
The revised European Waste Framework 
Directive published in November 2008 sets 
minimum energy recovery criteria and 
introduces statutory recycling targets for 
member states to achieve by 2020 both 
for municipal waste, 50%, and construction 
and demolition waste, 70%.
Biodegradable waste, a key component of 
municipal waste, is a major source of methane 
emissions from landﬁll and a key objective of 
the European Landﬁll Directive is to signiﬁcantly 
reduce the land-ﬁlling of biodegradable waste. 
Based on 1995 levels, the Directive requires a 
25% reduction by 2010, 50% by 2013 and 65% 
by 2020. The Directive also aims to substantially 
restrict other types of polluting waste that may 
be landﬁlled.
The Canadian market is evolving rapidly and 
enforcing an increasing level of regulation. As in 
Europe there is a drive for sustainable solutions 
and there is an increasing focus on organics as 
a technology.
Restrictions on the export of waste from Canada 
to the United States and provincial legislation 
such as the Waste Diversion Act and Green 
Energy Act in Ontario are providing a similar 
framework for stimulating the movement of 
biodegradable waste out of landﬁll to 
sustainable alternatives.


Underpinning these key legislative drivers is the 
level of industrial activity. Approximately 79% of 
the Group’s activities are derived from industrial 
and commercial (I&C) and construction and 
demolition (C&D) activities. There is a relationship 
between the level of industrial activity and the 
amount of waste generated.
Historically the drivers of waste volumes were 
well identiﬁed and volumes tracked industrial 
output and consumption or population growth. 
More recently however, there has been a 
de-coupling of this linkage. There are several 
reasons for this:
• Potential lag effect as certain sectors rebound 
at different rates.
• Acceleration in waste prevention in certain 
sectors, for example in the UK.
• Cost cutting initiatives in many companies 
as a result of the economic crisis.
Consequently underlying waste volumes are 
becoming less directly linked to GDP growth 
and industrial activity. Despite this, there are 
still strong growth opportunities for those 
companies that position themselves with 
sustainable technologies that process the 
waste that is very rapidly being diverted away 
from landﬁll.
The C&D market has a long cycle, resulting 
in a time lag between movements in GDP 
and the amount of C&D waste. C&D activity 
throughout the Group mirrors the cyclical 
nature of these underlying markets. The recent 
pronouncements from Euroconstruct in 
November 2011 stated that the European 
construction market will continue to register 
negative growth in 2012 with a slow return to 
growth in 2013 and 2014.

External drivers Shanks Group plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2012
In addition to volumes of waste available, 
macro-economics also affects pricing of waste 
inputs and the market value of recovered 
materials (recyclates). Income generated 
from the sale of recyclates represents circa 8% 
to 10% of the Group’s solid waste revenue. 
The key recovered materials include paper, 
metals, wood, glass and rubble. When end 
market prices for these commodities are high, 
the gate fees for receipt of waste from 
customers will be lower as the customer 
is aware of the value of the materials in the 
waste delivered and vice versa.
Limited capital resources means that 
governments and councils are currently looking 
for partners to work with them to provide 
solutions to their waste requirements. 
In the UK Municipal market we are detecting 
early signs of a more difﬁcult funding 
environment, together with local authorities 
planning for shorter term contracts and less 
capital intensive facilities. 
The inter relationship between these drivers is 
explained further in our business model on the 
following pages.

As one of the leading providers of sustainable waste management solutions, we 
generate revenue from the gate fees which customers pay us for handling their 
waste and the sale of outputs from processing this waste, including recyclates and 
energy. The success of our business model is driven by a combination of external 
and internal factors, which are set out below.


External drivers Internal drivers Shanks Group plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2012


We focus on producing higher value products, including energy and 
optimising the outputs from our facilities by reducing disposal costs. 
We call this optimising the mass balance. 
Our success in this area is driven by a combination of internal factors, 
including our use of technology, and external factors, including 
macro-economic conditions.

We manage the business within the context of these external drivers to maximise proﬁtable growth 
in the areas we operate in. We actively pursue a policy of maintaining customers and their volumes. 


Management actions which focus 
on support function efﬁciency are 
continually taken to lower the cost 
base of the business. Savings are 
targeted across a number of areas, 
including procurement. 


Our investment criteria is to achieve 
an overall post-tax return of 12% to 
15% once the assets are fully 
operational which is usually two to 
three years after commissioning. The 
ﬁrst phase (£100m) of our investment 
programme has reached the end of 
its investment cycle and target rates 
are being achieved. We have 
developed project management 
capabilities and operational metrics 
to ensure both operational and 
ﬁnancial delivery. The second 
programme (£150m) is well underway. 

The core principles of lean 
manufacturing can be applied 
to our industry. We have started 
to develop an improved set of 
daily management tools to measure 
and increase the operational 
performance of our facilities. 
We take action to review the efﬁciency and cost of all support functions and to deliver our growth 
strategy by investing in sustainable waste management infrastructure together with efﬁcient running 
of our existing UK PFI/PPP projects.
In normal times gate fee increases 
offset cost inﬂation. This is not the 
case during a recession. 
If recyclate prices increase there will 
be pressure on us to reduce the gate 
fee. Similarly if recyclate prices fall we 
have more opportunity to increase 
gate fees.
Our disposal costs are someone 
else’s gate fee so when gate fees 
are falling we expect to make 
savings on disposal costs. 
As explained in the previous section, gate fees, cost inﬂation, recyclate prices and volumes  
are largely driven by external factors, including regulation and macro-economic conditions.
These external drivers are inter-related, which means they cannot be considered in isolation.  
The key relationships between these drivers are set out below: Shanks Group plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2012
Our culture and people



The aim of the framework is to improve our 
execution ability and to ensure experience 
and good ideas are shared across the Group. 
Operations are managed through the Group 
Executive Committee comprising the Group 
Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director 
and the Country Managing Directors.
The main elements of this are collaboration, 
communication, performance management, 
project management, ﬁnancial discipline, 
risk management and talent development. 
Recent examples of these initiatives include:
• In the Netherlands a more centralised 
management of plant utilisation.
• A Group-wide procurement initiative 
which will deliver savings over time.
• The refreshed and more consistent use of 
the Shanks brand which has been launched 
across all of our operations this year.
• The use of engineering experts from one 
country to assist in the development of new 
plants in another country.
• The initial phase of the implementation of a 
Group-wide management information system 
which is allowing more direct comparisons 
of ﬁnancial and operating metrics across 
the differing businesses.

At Shanks we are committed to maintaining 
the highest standards in everything we do. 
One of the key strengths of Shanks is the 
well developed entrepreneurial culture 
of the individual businesses, which leads 
to responsiveness and innovation for all 
of our stakeholders. 
Underpinning this entrepreneurial culture is 
a programme to develop an enhanced central 
framework that delivers the beneﬁts of being a 
large group. This central framework is leading 
to greater co-ordination which has, and will, 
continue to deliver ﬁnancial beneﬁts and 
improved risk management. 
In both our Belgian and Dutch operations we 
have taken signiﬁcant steps to operate more 
as a single business rather than a federation of 
companies. In Belgium this has been facilitated 
by a management reorganisation that saw the 
appointment of regional directors and a national 
accounts team. In the Netherlands, the 
management structure was rationalised to 
create a smaller strategic executive group 
steering the overall management of the country 
and co-ordinating activity. 



• Responsible – we recognise our obligations to our fellow employees, 
the environment and the communities in which we operate and can be 
trusted to do the right thing
• Innovative – we aim to create an environment which encourages and 
supports an entrepreneurial spirit
• Straightforward – a ‘no nonsense’ approach means we do what we say 
we will do, empower our people to make decisions and are easy to do 
business with
• Open – a transparent approach means that we are able to maintain high 
professional and ethical standards and internally our open culture enables 
us to beneﬁt from shared knowledge and experience Shanks Group plc

Shanks is a service business and our employees 
are the foundation of our success. Our values 
are set out opposite and all of our employees 
are encouraged to live these values on a daily 
basis. Support and training is given to ensure 
these values are maintained.
It is also a key focus that we ensure our people 
are safe. There is signiﬁcant effort in ensuring 
not only that health and safety practices are 
complied with, but our overall attitude to safety 
is second to none. This is applied at all levels 
of the organisation including reviews of 
performance at our monthly country review 
meetings, Group Executive Committee and 
the Board. Safety visits with formal follow 
up processes are conducted by senior 
management as well as the health and safety 
team. We are pleased to report as set out on 
page 40 that as a result of our heightened focus 
in this area our accident rates have reduced. 


Our goal is to recruit individuals who will perform 
well and will ﬁt with Shanks’ values. We aim to 
ensure that all of our people are fully trained to 
perform their duties and in addition have in place 
development processes and structures to ensure 
they have progressive careers with Shanks. 
As the Group develops and in particular as 
part of the central framework referred to, 
we will enhance our leadership development 
programme.
The Group is an equal opportunities employer 
and full and fair consideration is given to 
applications from, and the continuing 
employment, career development and training 
of disabled people. A culture of two-way 
communications is actively promoted and trade 
unions, works councils and other employee 
groups are involved wherever appropriate. 
To ensure continuing employee satisfaction 
and wellbeing, Shanks has undertaken 
employee opinion surveys in its three main 
countries of operation and, from these surveys, 
has produced action plans aimed at 
improving employee engagement and 
retaining its competitive advantage in the 
employment market.

Marcel Koen is a director of Vliko, one of the major 
recycling operations in the Netherlands, and has worked 
for the company since 1998. Marcel believes that there 
are two reasons for Vliko’s success in working with 
household names such as Unilever and Heineken. 
“Firstly we are extremely close to our customers and take time 
to understand their ambitions and processes. Increasingly we 
have to assess our customers’ processes so we can advise 
on how these may be adjusted to increase recycling rates. 
For example, in 2007 we established a joint client and Shanks 
employee group for one of our major national accounts. 
When we started this group the customer’s recycling rate 
for their waste was 80% – ﬁve years later it is now 98%.”
Secondly Marcel believes Shanks’ unique position in the 
Netherlands creates a competitive advantage.
“Customers stay with us and join us because Shanks is the only 
major waste management company in the Netherlands which 
has chosen to expand their recycling infrastructure rather than 
develop incineration capacity.” 
On a more personal note Marcel continued, “I am convinced that 
recycling is the best option. We must ensure future generations 
can live in a healthy environment and Shanks’ goal to make more 
from waste supports this.”
Evidence of this partnership approach and unique strategy is the 
recent extension of a material sorting line with optical sorting 
technology. This facility can automatically separate plastics 
and paper from general waste providing another opportunity 
to increase the amount of material that is recycled and diverted 
from disposal. “This was done directly to serve the needs of 
our customers,” commented Marcel.
Shanks’ reputation is 
built on more than 
what we deliver to our 
customers. The people 
who work at Shanks are 
committed to changing 
the way people think 
about waste. Three of 
our people explain how 
they help the Group 
achieve its goals on

“ Good companies, like 
Shanks, understand the 
positive effects safety 
can have on employee 
loyalty and productivity.”
  Martine Pottier 
Safety Adviser

Martine Pottier is Safety Adviser at the Roeselare facility 
in Belgium and is also a member of the Group Health 
& Safety Committee. She has worked for Shanks 
for 12 years and believes that Shanks is committed 
to improving its health and safety standards.
“Shanks understands the positive effects safety can have on 
employee loyalty and productivity. If an organisation cares about 
its people, then it must ensure their health and safety is a top 
priority”, commented Martine.
“Of course we are not perfect and must always try to improve. 
The twelve key safety essentials we released last year are a good 
example of improvement – clear messages for everyone on 
common safety standards.”
On the topic of what she brings personally to Shanks safety effort, 
Martine noted: “It is always difﬁcult to prove the beneﬁts of good 
safety standards, but communicating with and gaining the 
involvement of employees is key – this is where I can make a 
difference as the link to ensure safety is embedded in the way 
we work.”
A typical day for Martine will see her arrive at work having given 
colleagues a lift as part of their car-pool scheme “this is better for 
the environment and fuel costs” she highlights. She will then meet 
with any contractors working on site to agree work plans before 
spending some time in the ofﬁce to plan activities including health 
assessments and training. Martine’s advice is not just limited to 
Shanks’ sites and she also has to consider customers health 
and safety.
Martine commented “I often have meetings with customers, 
such as those we will be doing industrial cleaning tasks for. 
A typical issue may be fall protection while doing a job. I need to 
ensure that our employees will be safe and that the customer is 
not at risk – safety is part of the service we provide to customers.” 

Abi Cox is Waste Education and Minimisation Ofﬁcer 
for the Derbyshire operations in the UK. Abi has worked 
for Shanks for 18 months and is clear about her role. 
“The work I do allows us to give understandable and accurate 
information to community stakeholders and dispel any myths 
about recycling and recovery. This communication is two-way. 
Not only can I give information out, I can also act as the conduit 
through which the community can make its feelings known to 
Shanks”, Abi said when asked about the work she does.
“A large part of my role is educational, from giving talks at schools 
and training teachers to attending road shows and presenting to 
local groups. The youngest age group I give talks to are ﬁve year 
olds, and the oldest person who has attended one of my 
presentations was 102 years old.”
Commenting on the value she brings to Shanks, Abi said: 
“My entire job is about community relations and stakeholder 
engagement. Most people understand that landﬁll is not an option 
anymore, but are unsure about what to replace it with. Shanks is 
all about sustainable waste management and the more effectively 
we can communicate what this means to community 
stakeholders, the better.
“There is no typical day for me, but it might start with loading 
the car with educational resource equipment and packs before 
arriving at a school for a series of lessons focusing on composting 
or an introduction to reducing, re-using and recycling wastes.
“Evening work is a given, such as presentations to local 
community groups. People are always interested in what 
happens to their waste. One evening a person attending a 
presentation brought along a bag of waste and asked me to 
describe what the best waste management route for each of the 
items in their bag would be – an unusual, but effective approach.” Shanks Group plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2012
The issue of carbon is probably the highest 
proﬁle environmental concern today. For many 
organisations their response to carbon and 
climate change is in energy efﬁciency and this is 
a valid approach. For Shanks the issue is more 
complex. A recycling or recovery plant, because 
of the equipment required, will consume more 
energy than a landﬁll site. However, recycling 
and recovery plants produce products which 
have a carbon beneﬁt which outweighs the 
additional energy consumption required. 
A landﬁll site does not produce these beneﬁts 
and emits methane which is a greenhouse gas. 


While responsibility for delivering sustainable 
performance rests at an operational level, our 
Corporate Responsibility Committee and 
dedicated Group Health & Safety Committee 
ensure we actively drive sustainable practices, 
be these in the areas of the environment, 
employee wellbeing or community relations. 
Reporting directly into the Group’s Executive 
Committee these committees, staffed by senior 
specialists from across the Group, provide the 
supportive environment within which sustainable 
practice can ﬂourish. 

Environmental sustainability is considered in 
terms of reducing the use of non-renewable 
resources, avoiding or offsetting environmental 
emissions (in particular those relating to carbon 
and climate change) and sustainable energy 
use. These areas are all core to Shanks. We take 
waste and make more from it by turning it into 
products and energy. Our recycling facilities turn 
waste into recyclate products which are used 
to replace virgin raw materials and our recovery 
operations produce renewable fuels which 
replace fossil fuels. Through our activities, 
we support society’s move to a more 
environmentally sustainable future.
In the past year we have brought on line more 
than 300,000 tonnes of entirely new waste 
recycling and recovery capacity aimed at fulﬁlling 
our strategy. To ensure that we continue to 
implement our strategy we have set ourselves 
publicly available and quantiﬁed objectives in 
the areas of recycling and recovery rate and 
carbon avoidance. Details of these objectives 
and our progress towards them can be found 
in our Corporate Responsibility reports.
Sustainability is embedded in all that we do. We measure our 
performance in three areas: the environment, employee health 
and safety and the wider community. We have set ourselves 
key performance indicators for each of these areas.









Delivering sustainable performance
We have set ourselves three long-term 
key corporate responsibility objectives 
to achieve by the end of March 2015: 
• Increase the potential carbon avoidance 
facilitated by our activities to more than 
1.3 million tonnes per year
• Increase our recycling and recovery rate 
to more than 80%
• Reduce our more serious accident rate 
by 25%  Shanks Group plc

Our key performance measures for environmental sustainability are our 
recycling and recovery rate and the carbon avoidance our facilities provide 
through their activities. We also measure our environmental sustainability 
performance across a much wider range of measures, from full carbon 
footprints by country of operation and signiﬁcant emissions from our facilities. 
Full details of these wider environmental measures and other measures 
referred to below, can be found in our annual Corporate Responsibility 
Report and wider environmental indicators document, both of which are 
available on our website.



Health and safety is our primary concern and we are actively managing and 
measuring our accident rate. Waste management is a high-risk sector with 
accident rates equivalent to those found in the construction and agricultural 
industries – so ongoing focus is required in this area.
Beyond these basic measures of health and safety performance, we have 
a wider commitment to our people, to their development and their right 
to work in an environment which is free from discrimination and where 
their talents are used to the full. All of our people need to be competent 
in the tasks they perform to ensure that we both achieve our sustainability 
targets and comply with the varied and strict regulation in the waste 
management industry.

Sustainable waste management operations provide a beneﬁt to society. 
We are more than aware that for those people living in the communities 
near to our facilities these beneﬁts may be obscured if we fail to control the 
potential nuisance from our sites. Such communities are a key stakeholder 
group for us and it is for this reason that the number of complaints received 
is a key performance measure for Shanks.
We also have many more stakeholder groups including shareholders,

Risk management framework

The main elements of the risk 
management process are as follows: 
• The schedule of matters reserved 
for the Board, and its adherence, 
ensures that all signiﬁcant factors 
affecting Group strategy, structure 
and ﬁnancing are properly managed 
by the directors.
• The Group risk management 
framework ensures that each business 
annually assesses the risks it faces 
and its monitoring and control of those 
risks. The output of this process is a 
summary of all signiﬁcant strategic, 
operational, ﬁnancial and compliance 
risks, mitigating controls and the action 
plans necessary to reduce risks to a 
level deemed appropriate by the Board. 
These are reviewed by both country 
management and the Board to 
ensure the appropriateness of the 
risks identiﬁed and the controls 
and action plans reported. 
Embedding risk management 
processes into the day-to-day running 
of the business is important if it is to be 
effective. The following requirements 
help ensure the effectiveness of the risk 
management framework:
• Involvement of an increasing number 
of managers across the Group in 
assessing risks and producing the 
risk register in each country. 
During the year a Risk Committee was 
established, reporting to the Group 
Executive Committee, to revitalise this 
process by ensuring more effective 
input by operational managers.
• A requirement that an enhanced risk 
assessment is completed for all major 
capital requests. The risk template 
covers ﬁnancial and commercial 
assumptions, reputational risk plus 
additional business-speciﬁc risks to 
ensure all threats to achieving the 
stated returns are fully considered 
before any investment is made.
• The top risks in each country are 
discussed at the monthly country 
review meetings to help monitor risk 
mitigation actions.
As well as being embedded in the major 
decision-making processes involved 
in delivering the Group’s strategy, 
speciﬁcally in relation to investment 
projects and infrastructure development 
and acquisitions, risk management 
is also embedded in the day-to-day 
management of operations including 
health, safety and environmental 
compliance where there is regular 
monitoring, auditing and reporting of 
procedures and controls. More details 
regarding the KPIs in these areas are 
set out on pages 38 to 41.
  Further information on the Board’s 
assessment of the effectiveness of internal 
control can be found on page 73
Shanks Group’s approach to risk management is governed by its risk management framework.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and 
risk management and has established a continuous process in relation to the identiﬁcation, 
evaluation and management of the signiﬁcant risks faced by the Group, in compliance with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code. This process has been in place for the ﬁnancial year 
ended March 2012 and to the date of approval of this report and is in accordance with 
the Turnbull guidance.




• Manage risk to a level acceptable 
to the Group Board
• Maximise the achievement of our 
business objectives by managing 
our risks and opportunities across 
the Group
• Make sure that the fundamentals 
of good risk management are 
incorporated into decision-making

The main focus during the year has been the 
continued quest to ensure that risk management 
is ﬁrmly embedded into the day-to-day running 
of the business. 
The establishment of a Risk Committee is aimed 
at providing a better link between Group and the 
operating companies, will afford a better risk focus 
at the local level and help ensure that more 
operational managers have an input to the risk 
identiﬁcation and mitigation process. This process 
has been instrumental in the identiﬁcation of new 
risks facing the Group, as detailed below.
Ensuring that risk management is ﬁrmly 
embedded in the capital allocation process was 
the reason behind the introduction of a more 
rigorous investment authorisation process. 

Three new major risks have been identiﬁed this year: 
• Plant availability and insurance Given 
inﬂationary risk and the increasing number 
of capital-intensive activities as a result of 
the ongoing investment programme, plant 
availability and insurance is recognised 
as an emerging risk to the Group. 
• Fuel pricing Also treated as a growing risk 
is energy consumption which reﬂects the 
ongoing price inﬂation of all forms of energy 
used across the Group. 
• Succession planning Effective succession 
planning and the continued ability to retain 
and replace key senior managers is also 
recognised for the ﬁrst time. 
There are controls and processes in place to 
adequately mitigate these new risks. These are 
explained more fully on pages 46 and 47 . 
Product quality, listed last year, is no longer 
included as a key risk due to management 
actions effectively mitigating this risk with 
product quality being consistently monitored.
As the importance of long-term contracts to 
the Group increases in the form of PFI and PPP 
initiatives so it is expected that the potential 
impact on the business in terms of risk naturally 
increases also. The existing procedures 
effectively mitigate this increasing risk.
With increasing amounts of capital investment 
scheduled it is to be expected that the risks 
associated with the management of these 
projects will also rise in monetary terms. It is for 
this reason that the enhanced capital authorisation 
process has been implemented and an updated 
post-investment review programme will be rolled 
out in the coming year. 
Financial risk has increased due to the instability 
of the Euro.

1 – Waste volumes
The inability to attract sufﬁcient waste 
volumes due to external economic factors 
including over capacity of incineration in the 
Netherlands, limiting the availability of waste 
by commercial and municipal customers. 
If facilities are working at below full capacity, 
there is the likelihood of increased unit costs.
• Regular reporting and monitoring of 
volumes both at local and Board level 
through the use of performance measures.
• Dedicated sales teams.
• Innovative action taken to increase volumes 
through the sourcing of new waste streams 
such as waste importation into the 
Netherlands and increasing presence in 
household waste markets in Belgium.
• Reorganising the processing and disposal 
of waste to optimise asset utilisation and 
reduce costs with a higher focus on energy 
production.
No change due 
to the continuing 
macro-economic 
environment.

Annual Report & Accounts 2012

4 – Long-term contracts
The Group enters into long-term contracts 
with municipalities in the UK (including PFI 
contracts), the Benelux countries and 
Canada. Entering into unfavourable contracts 
will potentially subject the Group to low 
margins or contract losses for many years.
• Selective bidding process.
• Detailed risk assessments for 
all major contracts.
• Authorisation matrix requiring appropriate 
senior management sign-off.
• Of total revenue circa 30% relates to 
contracts of over two years duration 
and this percentage has been improving 
over time. 
Increased risk and 
opportunity as the 
level of long-term 
contracts rise.

3 – Market/ legislative drivers
Our business is driven by legislative and 
market drivers that signiﬁcantly affect our 
waste treatment activities. As a business 
we have to understand and anticipate these 
changes or risk loss of market share as a 
consequence. In the main, these changes 
present an opportunity to drive the business 
forward through our positioning within the 
waste hierarchy. However, a failure to properly 
understand the likely changes or being unable 
to develop new technologies could also result 
in unanticipated cost increases or, in extreme 
cases, the write-off of investments.
• Corporate strategy aligned with EU waste 
policy towards more sustainable waste 
management.
• Employment of waste professionals who 
understand the underlying legislative 
landscape and the effects on the business.
• Membership of trade associations in all 
geographic areas in which the business 
operates that lobby at regional and national 
level in the interest of the waste industry.
• Continuing search for new technologies 
and, increasingly, the sharing of that 
technology across the Group.
No change from 
last year.


 2 – Financial risks
The Group is exposed to both interest rate 
risk and foreign exchange risk. Adverse 
movements in interest rates or foreign 
exchange will reduce proﬁtability and/or 
asset values. 
Interest rate and foreign exchange sensitivity 
is set out in note 20 to the Financial 
Statements.
• Group Treasury is charged with managing 
these risks in line with policies approved 
by the Board. Interest rate risk is managed 
though the use of interest rate swaps, 
senior notes taken out at ﬁxed rates 
and by the retail bond.
• Foreign exchange risk is mitigated by 
arranging borrowings to be drawn, 
as far as possible, in the same currencies 
as the underlying investment to reduce 
net translation exposure. Group strategy 
remains to leave income risk unhedged.
Increased risk due 
to the instability 
of the Euro. Shanks Group plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2012

6 – Project management
To meet our commitments relating to our 
vision and strategy we are making signiﬁcant 
capital investments in our infrastructure. 
Failure to bring in capital projects on time 
and on budget will lead to an inability to meet 
contract terms and deliver business plan 
returns. In addition, there is also the risk 
that capital investments will not provide the 
necessary returns if the underlying assets are 
not properly managed on a long-term basis.
• The appointment of project management 
professionals to oversee key projects.
• Minimum hurdle rates set and monitored.
• Large developments such as Wescott Park, 
Kettering and East London in the UK and 
enhancements at ATM in the Netherlands 
are subject to rigorous monitoring by 
local management.
• A central project management ofﬁce so 
that the progress of all signiﬁcant projects is 
reported back to Group senior management 
and the Board.
• An enhanced capital authorisation process 
has been implemented during the year. 
Increasing risk 
as the level of 
investment 
increases.

Principal risks and uncertainties

7 – Succession planning
The resignation of the previous Chief Executive 
and the successful search for his replacement 
have highlighted the continued need to be able 
to retain and replace key staff in the future.
• Appointment of an interim Group 
HR Director to oversee organisational 
design, talent management, hiring 
and remuneration.
• Permanent Group HR Director actively 
being sought.
• Succession plans in place where 
appropriate.
New risk.



5 – Price competition
Price competition both in terms of incoming 
waste streams and the sales of recyclate 
material. This is largely affected by external 
factors such as macro-economic conditions, 
competition and commodity prices with the 
risk of a fall in margins if prices are not 
maintained or costs kept under control.
• Regular reporting and monitoring of price 
levels both at local and Board level through 
the use of KPIs.
• Use of long-term contracts where possible 
to minimise the effect of pricing pressures. 
• Seeking creative alternative low-cost outlets 
for waste (such as SRF) to offset incoming 
waste price pressure. Both the UK and 
the Netherlands export recycled material 
to the Far East.
• Cost saving initiatives to offset pricing 
pressures such as optimising sorting 
efﬁciencies and other cost saving projects.
• A commitment to good customer relations 
and service through ongoing staff training 
and the use of customer relationship 
professionals.
Continuing pricing 
pressure offset 
by longer term 
contracts. Shanks Group plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2012



8 – Plant availability and insurance
The Group operates an increasing number of 
capital-intensive sites. Fire or other disaster, 
failure of a technical installation or severe 
weather could lead to the loss of availability 
of a site. Inadequate insurance cover due to 
inﬂation or new facilities could result in the 
inability to rebuild a plant without a fresh 
capital injection.
• Active monitoring and enforcement in relation 
to maintenance, security, health and safety 
and staff training standards.
• Use of experienced insurance brokers. 
In addition, a full review of locations, 
equipment and stock has been conducted 
over the year in conjunction with the brokers 
to reduce insurance cover risk.
• Other developments during the year have 
included the upgrade of disaster recovery 
planning in the UK and the upgrading of 
business interruption insurance in terms of 
duration of loss at UK AD plants. In Belgium, 
there has been investment in new ﬁre 
detection and suppression systems at 
Mont-Saint Guibert, Villerot and Monceau 
while new procedures have been 
implemented to ensure that waste is 
adequately segregated.
New risk.

10 – SHE (safety, health, environmental) compliance
Shanks’ employees are the Group’s most 
important and valuable asset and their health 
and safety are paramount. 
Operating sites require local licences, permits 
and other permissions to operate and 
compliance with these is monitored by 
various regulatory agencies.
Failure to comply with either health and safety 
or environmental legislation could result in 
prosecution, loss of permits and site closure 
as well as reputational damage.
• Safety leadership scheme in place. 
Amongst other initiatives this requires senior 
executives to make regular health and safety 
visits to plants across the Group.
• Health and safety is the top agenda item 
at all management meetings.
• Monthly SHE reporting across all levels 
of the organisation.
• Employment of health and safety 
professionals.
• Conduct of SHE audits.
• Environmental management systems and 
action programmes including regular site 
inspections.
No change. 

9 – Fuel pricing
Continued increases in diesel and other fuel 
prices have heightened awareness of energy 
consumption. Failure to control the effects 
of price inﬂation or reduce consumption 
will result in reduced operating margins. 
• Hedging of diesel costs initiated at 
Group level. 
• Fuel surcharges in place in the Netherlands 
and the UK where possible. In Belgium an 
indexation mechanism is in place to pass 
increased costs on to municipal customers.
• In Belgium, driver training piloted in Liege 
has reduced fuel consumption by 2% 
and will be rolled out further during the 
coming year.
• In the UK, intelligent cab-based systems 
are being tested to reduce fuel costs as well 
as reduce the risk of accidents.

Group



This year saw a robust performance in a tough 
economic climate with trading proﬁt up 7%. 
A strong performance in management actions 
(efﬁciency, cost savings and returns from the 
investment programme) has continued to mitigate 
the adverse market conditions which increased 
during the second half of the year, particularly 
in Solid Waste. The Euro strengthened against 
Sterling during the year resulting in a 1% increase 
in Euro denominated proﬁts. Excluding the effects 
of currency translation of £0.8m, trading proﬁt 
was 6% up on the prior year. 
During the year, our business in the Netherlands 
contributed 63% (2011: 69%) of the Group’s 
trading proﬁt (before the allocation of Group 
central services), with Belgium contributing 
18% (2011: 20%), the UK 12% (2011: 9%) and 
Canada 7% (2011: 2%). Further details of the 
Group’s trading performance and results by 
waste activity are given in the country reviews 
included on pages 52 to 65. Group central 
services refers to the cost of the Group’s head 
ofﬁce functions including ﬁnance, treasury, 
tax, internal audit and company secretarial. 
The increased costs in the year relate to 
employee and strategic business review costs.
During the year, there has been a negative gross 
market impact (the net of cost inﬂation, volumes, 
price and recyclate prices which are all linked) 
of £19m. This impact has been reduced by 
further efﬁciency and cost savings of £11m 
achieved during the year. Overall net price has 
been positive year on year with strong pricing 
in UK Solid Waste and Netherlands Hazardous 
Waste compensating for ongoing pricing 
pressure in Netherlands Solid Waste where 
commercial pricing was down 7% in the year. 
Overall costs have increased by circa 2% 
principally due to salary inﬂation together with 
some one-off costs. The selling price for our main 
recyclates of metal and paper continued at high 
levels for the majority of the period resulting in a 
beneﬁt of £7m in the year, although the beneﬁt in 
the second half was lower due to the fall in paper 
prices in October 201 1. The volume declines 
are principally in Solid Waste in all territories. 
Efﬁciency and cost savings come from reductions 
in ﬁnal costs of disposal to landﬁll or incineration 
and other operational and support function 
savings as well as increased plant efﬁciency.
A strong performance from our 
strategic investment programme 
and continued cost efﬁciencies 
has mitigated the adverse 
market effects.  Trading proﬁt

The projects and investments increase of 
£9.9m represents the year on year proﬁt impact 
of the £100m strategic investment programme. 
The principal growth projects which contributed 
in the year were the Ghent Solid Recovered 
Fuel (SRF) plant, ATM waste water treatment 
improvements, the Orgaworld Amsterdam 
Anaerobic Digestion (AD) plant and the 
Canadian plants. The recycling and AD plants in 
Scotland remained in commissioning for a large 
part of the year and consequently have had a 
minimal effect on the result for the year. Those 
projects in the initial £100m strategic investment 
programme which were fully up and running at 
normal operating levels have achieved a 12.2% 
return and those commissioned and ramping up 
6.7%. This rate of return remains in line with the 
post-tax target of 12% to 15% once the assets 
are fully operational which is usually two to three 
years after commissioning. The next phase of 
the investment programme, totalling £150m, 
has now started and approximately £65m 
of the projects are under construction.


Revenue from continuing operations increased 
by £33m to £750m. Excluding the positive effect 
of currency translation of £9m, revenue was 3% 
up on the prior year.

Certain items are excluded from trading proﬁt 
and underlying proﬁt due to their size, nature 
or incidence to enable a better understanding 
of performance.
Total non-trading and exceptional items of 
£7 .4m (2010/11: £14.0m) are further explained 
in note 4 to the ﬁnancial statements on page 105 
and include:
• Amortisation of intangible assets acquired in a 
business combination of £3.7m (2010/1 1: £3.9m).
• Financing fair value remeasurement charge of 
£0.8m (2010/11: £5.8m).
• Impairment charge of £2.5m (2010/11: £11.9m) 
– changes in market conditions in the volumes 
delivered to and prices achieved in our small 
UK joint venture landﬁll have resulted in a 
goodwill impairment. The prior year charge 
related to impairments due to changes in 
market conditions in wood based and landﬁll 
markets in Belgium and the Netherlands.

Annual Report & Accounts 2012

The strong focus on cash management has 
continued throughout the year resulting in a free 
cash ﬂow conversion ratio of 81%. Working 
capital levels have been tightly monitored during 
the year. 
The ratio of replacement capital spend to 
depreciation was 78% for the year which was 
within our targeted range.
Growth capital spend of £38m included the UK 
recycling and organics facilities and a number 
of other growth projects in the Netherlands 
in both Solid Waste and Hazardous Waste. 
Also included is £3m relating to the acquisition 
of the business and assets of a glass recycling 
business in the Netherlands.
The prior year acquisitions and disposals 
income of £17m included the proceeds from 
the PFI equity sale in September 2010 with the 
outﬂow this year including a number of deferred 
consideration payments.
The current year PFI funding and others total 
included the receipt of £8.7m (€10.5m) following 
a court decision in respect of a claim for 
business interruption in the Netherlands that 
occurred in 2002. The court’s decision has been 
appealed and the ultimate outcome of the case 
remains uncertain. The amount has been 
recorded in provisions until the ﬁnal outcome 
of the case is known with greater certainty.
The exchange rate on the Euro has moved from 
1.13 at 31 March 2011 to 1.20 at 31 March 2012 
which has resulted in a £10m beneﬁt on the 
translation into Sterling of the Group’s Euro 
and Canadian Dollar denominated debt. 

Finance charges, excluding the change in fair 
value of derivatives, have increased by £0.2m 
to £14.7m (2010/11: £14.5m). Core interest, 
excluding the project ﬁnance relating to the 
PFI contracts, reduced by £0.6m primarily 
due to a lower amortisation charge for loan 
fees incurred in the 2011 reﬁnancing.

The underlying tax charge for the year of £10.1m 
equated to an effective rate of 26% down from 
26.4% last year. The exceptional tax credit of 
£5.2m in the current year related to a favourable 
judgement issued with regard to certain tax 
liabilities in Belgium.

Underlying earnings per share, which excludes 
the effect of non-trading and exceptional items, 
increased at constant currency by 9% to 
7 .2 pence per share (2011: 6.5 pence per share) 
as a result of the increased proﬁts and a further 
reduction in the effective tax rate. Basic earnings 
per share from continuing operations increased 
from 5.5 pence per share to 6.7 pence per share.

The Group intends to pursue a progressive 
dividend policy within a range of 2 to 2.5 times 
cover in the medium term. Consistent with this 
policy, the Board has recommended a ﬁnal 
dividend of 2.35 pence, making the full year 
dividend 3.45 pence, an increase of 6% 
on the total paid in respect of 2011.

 Shanks Group plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2012

The Group’s treasury policy is to use ﬁnancial 
instruments with a spread of maturity dates 
and sources in order to reduce funding risk. 
Borrowings are drawn in the same currencies 
as the underlying investment to reduce cash 
and net translation exposures on exchange rate 
movements. The Group maintains a signiﬁcant 
proportion of its debt on ﬁxed rates of interest in 
order to protect interest cover. It is and has been 
throughout the period under review, the Group’s 
policy that no speculative trading in ﬁnancial 
instruments shall be undertaken.

At 31 March 2012, the Group’s core bank 
ﬁnancing was a €200m term loan and 
multicurrency revolving credit facility with six 
major banks entered into on 2 February 2011 
and expiring in June 2015. At 31 March 2012, 
€67m equivalent of term loan was drawn in Euro 
and Canadian Dollars on three month interest 
periods plus €33m of the revolving credit facility. 
The remaining €100m represented committed 
funds available for drawing in Sterling, Euro or 
Canadian Dollars by way of a revolving credit 
facility on a maximum of three days notice or 
for ancillary derivative facilities. Interest is based 
on LIBOR or EURIBOR plus the margin for the 
relevant period. The Group has entered into 
three year ﬁxed interest rate swaps with a 
principal of €30m and Canadian $49.5m 
underwritten at effective interest rates of 2.82% 
and 2.85% before margin. The deﬁnitions of the 
covenants of this facility exclude the results of 
PFI and other project companies and the results 
of joint ventures except where received in cash. 
The margin varies on a ratchet ﬁxed by the 
Debt:EBITDA ratio for the prior quarter on a 
rolling 12 month calculation. The ﬁnancial 
covenants of this facility are principally the ratio 
of Debt:EBITDA of less than 3.00:1, interest 
cover of not less than 3.00:1 and a minimum net 
worth of £225m. At the end of March, the ratio 
of core net debt to EBITDA was 1.7 times which 
is well within our banking covenant test of 3.0 
and our target of less than 2.5 times.
The ﬁve year retail bonds of €100m, issued to 
Belgium and Luxembourg investors in October 
2010 have an annual coupon of 5.0% and are 
quoted on the London Stock Exchange.
The €18m of notes issued under the Group’s 
Pricoa private placement carry ﬁxed interest at 
6.9% and are due for repayment in September 
2013. An additional €40m of private placement 
with maturity in April 2018 and an interest rate 
of 5.025% was secured on 11 April 2011. 
The ﬁnancial covenants of this facility are 
identical to those of the Group’s bank ﬁnancing 
outlined above.
The Group also has approximately £23m of 
working capital facilities with various banks. 
Cash ﬂows are pooled at a country level and 
each operation is tasked with operating within 
the limits of the locally available working 
capital facilities.
Each of the Group’s PFI/PPP projects has senior 
debt facilities which contribute approximately 
85% of the capital funding required. These 
facilities are secured by a legal mortgage over 
land and/or a ﬁxed and ﬂoating charge over 
the assets of the PFI/PPP company with no 
recourse to the Group as a whole. Repayment 
of these facilities, and any equity bridge facility 
in respect of the remaining capital funding, 
commences when construction is complete 
and concludes one to two years prior to the 
expiry of the PFI/PPP contract period. For those 
contracts where the Group currently holds 
100% of the equity in its PFI/PPP companies, 
the net debt of £45m and the fair value of the 
interest rate swaps used to ﬁx interest rates 
of £15m are fully consolidated in the Group 
balance sheet. The maximum which could be 
drawn down under these facilities at 31 March 
2012 was £103m. The interest rates on these 
loans vary with one month LIBOR during the 
construction period and three month or six 
month LIBOR in the post construction period. 
In order to provide a ﬁxed price to the client local 
authority varying only with inﬂation, interest rates 
are ﬁxed by means of interest rate swaps at the 
time of contract inception. 

The assets of both the ﬁnal salary and money 
purchase schemes in the UK are held separately 
from those of the Group and are invested by 
independent professional investment managers. 
At 31 March 2012 the net retirement beneﬁt 
deﬁcit relating to these UK schemes was £7 .6m 
compared to an asset of £4.9m at 31 March 
2011 primarily as a result of the movement in 
discount rates in the year. Following discussions 
with the trustees, the Group agreed in 2010 
a funding plan over eight years. The plan 
comprised an annual payment of £1.8m per 
annum to April 2012 and then increasing to 
£3.0m per annum. This payment proﬁle will be 
reconsidered at the next actuarial valuation 
which is due as at 5 April 2012.
In the Netherlands, employees participate in 
compulsory collective transport industry wide 
pension schemes, or equivalent schemes, which 
provide beneﬁts up to a certain level of pay. 
These are accounted for as deﬁned contribution 
plans as it is not possible to split the assets and 
liabilities of the schemes between participating 
companies and the Group has been informed 
by the schemes that it has no obligation to make 
additional contributions in the event that the 
schemes have an overall deﬁcit. 

The Group manages its property and third party 
risks through insurance policies that mainly 
cover property, business interruption, public 
liability, environmental pollution and employer’s 
liability. The Group covers its operating risks 
by self insurance, whereby the operating 
businesses pay a moderate deductible on most 
claims, together with cover provided by the 
external insurance market, arranged by our 
brokers with insurance companies which have 
good credit ratings.

The Dutch Solid Waste market is advanced, 
with a high level of recycling of the overall 
waste volumes of circa 51m tonnes. The State 
Secretary of Infrastructure and the Environment 
has stated recently that the recycling rate for 
the Netherlands should be at 83% by 2015. 
Volumes sent to landﬁll are very low at 
approximately 3%. On 1 January 2012 tax 
on waste sent to landﬁll was reduced to nil, 
however new strict guidelines on what can be 
sent to landﬁll have been issued. Overcapacity 
in the waste incineration market has continued 
and this has resulted in lower gate fees on 
the spot market and ongoing price pressures. 
Within these waste volumes the C&D market 
is important and accounts for approximately 
one third of the whole market. The other major 
sectors are general commercial and industrial 
and municipal. 
The main competitors to Shanks include Van 
Gansewinkel Group and Sita with a number of 
other strong regional players. In the Randstad 
area for both I&C and C&D Shanks is the market 
leader whereas at a national level we are market 
leader for C&D and number two for I&C.
Hazardous Waste is a more specialist market 
with annual revenues in excess of circa €570m 
and the number of players is smaller due to 
the investment required to establish efﬁcient 
competitive operations. ATM is the market 
leader in its ﬁeld and there is strong potential 
for growth in waterside activities as legislation 
becomes more stringent. Similarly Reym has 
a strong market position and is market leader 
for industrial cleaning.
The Organics market is circa 3.5m tonnes and 
Shanks is the third largest competitor with Attero 
being the market leader. Expansion of the AD 
market sector is anticipated in the coming years 
due to the shift from composting to dry and wet 
digestion driven by green subsidies.

There are three divisions in the Netherlands: 
Solid Waste, Hazardous Waste and Organics.
The Solid Waste business comprises 23 recycling 
and transfer sites many of which are substantial 
in size, together with supporting collection 
vehicle ﬂeets of 456 vehicles. Overall the 
businesses typically recycle and divert from 
landﬁll or incineration more than 85% of the 
waste they process. In normal times, the 
business derives approximately half its trading 
proﬁt from construction and demolition (C&D) 
waste, the other half being from more general 
industrial and commercial (I&C) waste and other 
activities. In the current recessionary climate the 
split is 45% for C&D and 55% for I&C. The work 
from the municipal sector has increased 
in recent years with bulky waste, municipal 
collection and electrical waste contracts. The 
business is principally based in the populous 
Randstad area to the west of the country.
The Hazardous Waste business comprises two 
units: Afvalstoffen Terminal Moerdijk (ATM), a 
treatment plant and Reym, which focuses on 
industrial cleaning. ATM is one of the world’s 
largest single site hazardous waste facilities, 
processing more than 1.5m tonnes of low 
contamination hazardous waste per annum. 
There are three principal processes: thermal 
treatment of contaminated soils, pyrolysis of 
paint waste and biological and physio-chemical 
treatment of waste water. Reym supplies 
industrial cleaning services to the oil and gas, 
petrochemical and other industries.
Organics comprises the Orgaworld business 
which consists of a number of treatment facilities 
for organic wastes by wet or dry anaerobic 
digestion (AD) or tunnel composting. These 
facilities include a ﬂagship industrial AD and 
waste water facility in Amsterdam. The waste 
streams originate from industry, mainly from 
food processing companies and supermarkets, 
and source segregated organic municipal 
collections.

The strategic goal for the Dutch operations 
continues to be further improvements in the mature 
Solid Waste market together with development 
in both Hazardous Waste and Organics. 
For the Solid Waste business this will be achieved 
by diversiﬁcation into municipal markets and 
broadening the product portfolio to offset falling 
volumes and lower prices in the traditional solid 
waste markets. Also, there will be more focus 
on the production of high quality fuel substitutes 
and recyclates. The key strategic drivers 
remain the availability of waste and the highly 
competitive pricing in the incineration market.
For Hazardous Waste, the availability of soil 
volumes is key and with less Netherlands 
based activities it is important to win overseas 
contracts. The lower activity in the industrial 
market for paint waste will be replaced with 
further waterside activities given our recent 
expansion of capacity in this area. 
For Organics the increased focus on processing 
organic waste will lead to opportunities in this 
market.
We are also focused on using the attributes of all 
three businesses to provide combined solutions 
(involving Solid Waste, Hazardous Waste and 
Organics) to our customers. We believe that 
increasingly customers will require a single supplier 
to deal with all of their waste requirements.

Despite the challenging market conditions in 
Solid Waste, the Netherlands has performed 
well with overall revenue and trading proﬁt, 
excluding exchange, rising by 3% and 1% 
respectively and trading margins remained 
strong at 10%.
The Solid Waste business continued to be 
impacted by downward pricing pressure and 
lower volumes which have been compensated 
in part by recyclate pricing and strong 
management actions in the achievement of cost 
savings. The excess capacity in the incineration 
market has continued throughout the year and 
prices for Commercial and C&D wastes have 
declined on average by 7% and 5% respectively 
compared with the prior year. Overall volumes 
were 1% down for Commercial and 2% down 
for C&D. In early 2012, the Economic Institute 
for the Building Industry stated that volumes 
in the Dutch construction market would be 
down 3.5% in 2012 with no recovery in the 
Dutch housing market expected before 2014. 
Overall recyclate pricing has been strong 
throughout the year and has contributed €5m 
to the proﬁtability of the division year on year.

ATM is one of the world’s largest 
single site hazardous waste facilities, 
processing more than 1.5m tonnes of 
low contamination hazardous waste 
per annum. 

Based in Rotterdam, KLOK Containers 
provides waste collection and recycling 
services. Waste is sorted, treated

Annual Report & Accounts 2012
On 1 March 2012 we acquired the business 
and assets of Van Tuijl, a key player in the Dutch 
glass recycling market. This acquisition has 
given us access to the glass recycling market 
and offers the opportunity to provide our larger 
customers such as Unilever and Heineken with 
a closed loop cycle for their waste streams. 
In Hazardous Waste, our ATM waste water and 
soil treatment facility has had an exceptional 
performance. For both activities, volumes were 
up on the prior year boosted by a one-off 
contract and this together with continued 
control of treatment costs and the recent 
investments have resulted in good proﬁt growth. 
Reym, our industrial cleaning business, has had 
a satisfactory year with strong revenues but has 
seen continued pressures on pricing which 
resulted in lower overall margins.
The growth in the Organics activity of Orgaworld 
was principally attributable to the ﬁnal 
commissioning and ramping up of the AD and 
waste water facility in the port of Amsterdam. 
This project has performed well in the year with 
production of green electricity from the biogas 
and the capture of the heat from the plant 
processes which has been exported to the 
Amsterdam ‘heat grid’ for access by other 
companies requiring heat. Overall margins 
have fallen slightly due to further business 
development expenditure as we continue 
to investigate opportunities to expand.
Continued focus on accident rates and safety 
has resulted in a 6% improvement to the 
RIDDOR rate in the year.

Markets in the more mature Solid Waste 
business are expected to remain challenging 
in the short term due to pricing pressures and 
availability of waste volumes. The continued 
investment in growth projects in Hazardous 
Waste and Organics activities, together with 
focus on cost control and margin improvement 
will position the business for future growth.

In Belgium, environmental responsibility is 
devolved to the three regions, namely Flanders, 
Wallonia and Brussels. Flemish environmental 
legislation and landﬁll tax levels are very similar 
to those in the Netherlands resulting in similar 
market characteristics with high levels of 
recycling, a reliance on incineration for ﬁnal 
disposal and very little landﬁll. In Wallonia landﬁll 
has historically been more prominent, however 
landﬁll tax rose signiﬁcantly in 2010 to an effective 
rate of €90 per tonne as an incentive to promote 
increased recycling and other forms of energy 
recovery. In addition, the region adopted a 
strict interpretation of the Landﬁll Directive 
requirement for the pre-treatment of organic 
waste and residual waste from household 
collection. The Brussels region has limited 
landﬁll capacity and has its own incinerator 
but beyond that depends on the two other 
regions for ﬁnal disposal.
Exports of waste from Belgium are only allowed 
in accordance with strict pre-treatment criteria 
which in practice limit the extent of such 
movements of waste and encourage the 
treatment of waste using local capacity.
The Belgian waste market is still highly 
fragmented with the largest ﬁve players 
accounting for circa 40% of the total market 
value. Overall Shanks is the fourth largest player 
in the Belgian market with Sita being the market 
leader. Collection services remain increasingly 
important in view of EU recycling and sorting 
requirements and the market can be split 
between Industrial and Commercial (I&C) which 
accounts for more than 60% of the total waste 
revenues and is based on short-term contracts 
and municipal which is based on longer 
contracts. As in the Netherlands, volumes of 
waste have started to decline with pricing 
pressure for I&C contracts.
Power generation from waste (biogas) continues 
to beneﬁt from environmental subsidies, 
although power prices are volatile from period 
to period.

The activities in Belgium are broken down into 
Solid Waste, Hazardous Waste, Landﬁll and 
Power and a Sand Quarry.
The Solid Waste business is similar to that in the 
Netherlands, however the division is less reliant 
on the Construction and Demolition (C&D) 
sector and also includes the operation of 
municipal waste collection contracts including 
the City of Liege and an intermunicipality 
partnership in the Hainaut region of Wallonia. 
Solid Waste also includes Foronex. This 
business, which was acquired in 2008, is 
principally focused on the growing wood 
biomass market with a subsidiary wood 
trading activity.
The Hazardous Waste division comprises 
industrial cleaning activities, hazardous and 
medical waste collection. The industrial cleaning 
businesses service the steel, cement, chemical 
and other large industries across Belgium and 
also in northern France. The main treatment 
facility at Roeselare in West Flanders specialises 
in the preparation of waste derived fuels and 
minerals for the cement industry. Like the ATM 
facility in the Netherlands, the facility also treats 
contaminated waste water streams using 
physio-chemical and biological processes. 
Green electricity certiﬁcates are received 
for the electricity and heat produced during 
the processes.
The Landﬁll and Power operations are situated 
in the Walloon region where we have one of the 
largest landﬁlls in the area. Landﬁll activity has 
now stabilised following changes to taxation 
rates and types of waste that can be landﬁlled 
in the last few years. A major source of income 
remains the generation of renewable electricity 
from the methane produced as the 
biodegradable waste decays.
In addition we operate a Sand Quarry which 
is adjacent to the landﬁll in Wallonia. This 
remains a small but proﬁtable activity.

In Belgium the strategy is to grow the Solid Waste 
businesses by ensuring competitive advantage 
through lower average processing and disposal 
costs and the production of high quality Solid 
Recovered Fuel (SRF) and biomass products.
As in the Netherlands the key drivers are the 
amount of waste available and the competitive 
pressure on prices. The increase in landﬁll taxes 
has offset this impact to an extent with reduced 
levels of waste going into landﬁll and increased 
waste sent to incinerators and sustainable 
recycling facilities.
Our focus remains on treating waste in 
innovative ways and maximising the volume of 
products such as SRF produced by our facilities 
as an alternative to sending the waste to landﬁll 
and incinerators.

Overall the result for the year shows a small 
decline in revenue with trading proﬁt remaining 
unchanged year on year.
The core Solid Waste businesses have 
performed well with I&C volumes at the sorting 
centres up 5%, although levels declined in the 
latter months of the year. Overall price was 2% 
down on the prior year. The result has been 
adversely affected by a €0.7m year on year 
reduction in the return from our investment 
in an inter-municipality incinerator.
The Foronex business is included within 
Solid Waste and as communicated in earlier 
statements, a number of changes were made to 
strengthen the management team. This has had 
a beneﬁcial impact on trading with an overall 
€2m improvement to proﬁts year on year. 
As reported at the half year, there had been 
delays in the commissioning of the combined 
heat and power plant in our joint venture 
arrangement with Enviva (formerly known as 
Intrinergy). It became apparent that signiﬁcant 
further investment would be required to get the 
plant operational albeit at a lower level of 
proﬁtability. As a consequence of the joint 
venture company being in breach of its banking 
covenants, we no longer have control and 
accordingly have written off our investment 
in this venture. This has resulted in an overall 
charge of £2m which has been treated as a 
non-trading exceptional item.

preparation of waste derived fuels.

Like the Netherlands market, the Belgian market 
is expected to remain challenging for the short 
to medium term. However, we plan to build on 
the improvements made in Foronex and other 
cost savings to offset the impact of the market 
conditions.
Overall proﬁts from the Hazardous Waste 
businesses were down signiﬁcantly year on year. 
Biogas production at the green energy plant in 
Flanders was down in the ﬁrst half but following 
efﬁciency improvements this has now been 
addressed and has returned to more normal 
levels. Proﬁts have been affected by lower power 
prices which are expected to increase in the 
medium term.
Pricing in the electricity market continues to be 
difﬁcult and this has resulted in lower Power 
revenues year on year.
As part of the Group-wide ‘Action on Safety’ 
initiative, signiﬁcant effort has been spent on 
safety audits and this has resulted in a 16% 
reduction to the RIDDOR rate in the year. London

Annual Report & Accounts 2012

The UK’s historical heavy reliance on landﬁll 
means that the imposition of the European 
Landﬁll Directive is having a major impact. 
Implementation of the Directive requires waste 
disposal authorities to develop new strategies 
to reduce the amount of biodegradable 
municipal waste (BMW) that they send to landﬁll. 
Based on 1995 levels, the Directive requires a 
25% reduction in BMW landﬁlled by 2010, 50% 
by 2013 and 65% by 2020. As part of this the 
UK Government has strengthened the existing 
drivers for diverting I&C waste from landﬁll and 
provided further ﬁnancial support for alternative 
ways to deal with waste (including reuse, 
recycling, energy from waste and anaerobic 
digestion). The key element of this was the 
agreement to increase the standard rate of 
landﬁll tax by £8 per tonne on 1 April each year 
to £80 per tonne by 1 April 2014.
In our regional I&C and C&D markets we are 
strong with our main competitors being Veolia, 
Biffa, Viridor and large regional and local players.
The long-term municipal market is accelerating 
in an attempt to fulﬁl landﬁll diversion targets 
as set out in the European Landﬁll Directive 
and is currently at circa 17m tonnes per annum. 
Shanks remains a key player in this sector 
with Veolia as the market leader. We have 
detected early signs of a more difﬁcult funding 
environment, together with local authorities 
planning for shorter term contracts and less 
capital intensive facilities. 
The potential food waste market for AD and 
composting solutions is currently estimated at 
circa 5.9m tonnes per annum. This market is still 
emerging in the UK, with a number of AD plants 
having become operational in the last year. 
Shanks continues to invest in this sector, 
where there is no clear market leader.

The UK business principally comprises solid 
waste collection and recycling, municipal  
PFI/PPP contracts and organics processing 
businesses.
The Solid Waste collection and recycling 
business, which has both Industrial and 
Commercial (I&C) and Construction and 
Demolition (C&D) customers is focused in 
Scotland, East Midlands and the Northern 
Home Counties. Currently we process 47% 
of the waste collected through our recycling 
facilities. The plan is to increase this signiﬁcantly 
with the investment in new recycling and 
organics facilities as we strive to divert more 
waste away from ﬁnal disposal to landﬁll.
The Organics processing activity is principally 
in a joint partnership in a 60,000 tonne per 
annum Anaerobic Digestion (AD) plant in 
Glasgow which utilises Orgaworld AD 
technology to process a range of organic 
materials including supermarket waste, 
household and commercial kitchen waste, 
food processing waste and organic materials 
resulting in the generation of biogas and high 
quality compost.
The 25 year municipal PFI/PPP contracts 
include providing waste disposal services 
for local authorities in East London, Dumfries 
and Galloway, Argyll & Bute and Cumbria. 
The Barnsley, Doncaster and Rotherham (BDR) 
contract has recently reached ﬁnancial close 
and the delivery of waste management services 
will only commence when the treatment facilities 
have been built in 2015. We have preferred 
bidder status for two other contracts (Derby 
and Wakeﬁeld) and remain active in bidding 
for further contracts where we have a clear 
market advantage. It remains our intention, 
where appropriate, to limit our equity 
contribution into PFI/PPP whilst retaining the 
long-term operating contracts. 
In addition we have a share in landﬁll 
operations through a joint venture partnership. 
The contaminated land services business 
which organised the treatment and disposal for 
clean-up projects is no longer a principal activity.

In the UK, the aim is to extract the maximum 
value from the products we produce with a 
geographically integrated infrastructure across 
municipal, organic and recycling facilities and an 
expansion of our energy generation capability. 
Legislative and regulatory drivers remain key 
together with the availability of waste volumes 
as feedstock for our facilities.

Revenue and trading proﬁt before PFI bid team 
costs rose by 6% and 10% respectively.
The structural decline in volumes in the UK Solid 
Waste market has continued with our overall 
volumes in the collections business down 9%. 
The proﬁt effect of these volume shortfalls has 
been compensated by a number of decisive 
management actions, including improvements 
in processing leading to greater diversion 
from landﬁll and price increases of circa 2%. 
Overall recyclate prices were still favourable year 
on year despite the decline in paper pricing in 
the last quarter.
The commissioning of the Glasgow recycling 
facility was extended, as the plant was 
developed to handle a wider range of waste, 
in response to increasing price competition in 
obtaining recyclate materials. The Edinburgh 
facility was redeveloped ahead of time, 
facilitating the two plants to be run together, with 
both seeing a signiﬁcant ramping up of output in 
the last couple of months of the year. The new 
recycling facility at Kettering was commissioned 
ahead of time in the last quarter and will be 
fully operational in the new ﬁnancial year. 
The ﬁnal commissioning of the Organics AD 
plant in Glasgow, a joint venture partnership 
in Energen Biogas, was delayed and this 
together with operational issues resulted in 
losses in the year. Gate fees and availability 
of waste volumes have been under pressure 
as other infrastructures have come on stream. 
Electricity is being generated and delivered 
to the grid and outputs will increase in the new 
ﬁnancial year. The development of the other AD 
plants in the UK remains on track.
The proﬁtability of the existing PFI/PPP portfolio 
has continued to improve in line with our plans 
with further operational enhancements being 
delivered and a full twelve months beneﬁt from 
the management of the Derby waste collection 
service. Margins in the portfolio were 10% in the 
year, up from 6.4% last year. We expect these to 
be in the 8% to 10% range going forward. The

(MBT) facilities for the Cumbria contract was 
delivered ahead of schedule and within budget

in December 2011. The second facility is also 
on track to be completed early. 
We continue to invest in the PFI market albeit 
at a lower level of activity as indicated by the 
reduction in bid costs expensed of £1.5m in the 
year. The Barnsley, Doncaster and Rotherham 
contract, a majority owned joint venture with 
SSE, reached ﬁnancial close on 30 March 2012 
and work has commenced on the delivery of 
the infrastructure which is scheduled to be 
completed in 2015. The Bolton Road facility 
will be one of the ﬁrst where Shanks delivers 
a MBT plant and an AD plant on the same site. 
It will treat up to 265,000 tonnes per year of 
leftover household waste and a small amount 
of commercial waste from the three councils. 
As part of this contract we signed an agreement 
with SSE for the supply of Solid Recovered Fuel 
(SRF) to a new multi-fuel plant for the generation 
of electricity at Ferrybridge.
We remain preferred bidder for the Wakeﬁeld 
and the Derby contracts. It is anticipated that 
the Wakeﬁeld contract will reach ﬁnancial close 
by September 2012. The Derby contract is 
subject to a planning appeal which will 
determine the long-term location of the 
combined MBT and gasiﬁcation infrastructure. 
This appeal is scheduled to be held in June 
2012 and the outcome will determine the timing 
of ﬁnancial close of this contract.
We have once again prepared a Directors’ 
valuation of our PFI/PPP interests to assist the 
market in valuing these stakes. Using the cash 
ﬂows of the remaining ﬁnancing vehicles and 
the operating contracts discounted at circa 8%, 
the Directors estimate the value of the existing 
PFI/PPP contracts to be circa £80m which is 
unchanged from last year end.
The decrease in Hazardous Waste proﬁts 
related to a major one-off contract in the 
prior year.
Reduced volumes and pricing pressures 
have resulted in a lower performance at our 
Landﬁll and Power joint venture. The goodwill 
associated with this asset has been written off 
during the year.
As anticipated, there has been an increase 
in central overhead costs as the organisation 
has been strengthened to support the growth 
and development of the business with a 
proportion of this resource redeployed from 
PFI bidding.
The signiﬁcant increase in the return on 
operating assets from 10% to 20% came 
as a result of the increased proﬁts and lower 
operating assets, following the full year effect 
of the September 2010 disposal of the equity 
interest in the ELWA and D&G PFI contracts, 
which removed approximately £20m from the 
operating asset base.
The recycling and recovery rate has continued 
to increase year on year as the new recycling 
facilities start to come on line.

Legislative support for landﬁll diversion 
strategy continues to strengthen in the UK. 
The continued improvements from the recent 
investments in recycling and organics facilities 
should continue to compensate for any further 
decline in volumes.

composting facility. Shanks Group plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2012

As in Europe, there is a drive to reduce waste 
going to landﬁll in Canada and the Orgaworld 
management in the Netherlands identiﬁed an 
opportunity in the Canadian market to offer 
biological treatment of source segregated 
organic municipal waste. We currently have 
two aerobic tunnel composting sites in Ontario 
– a 150,000 tonne per annum facility in London 
and a 100,000 tonne per annum facility in 
Ottawa. Both sites are backed by long-term 
municipal contracts.

In recent years there has been strong public 
opinion against landﬁll, which in some areas 
has led to a shortage of consented capacity. 
Consequently the Canadian provinces have 
targeted the diversion of waste from landﬁll. 
The introduction of feed in tariffs and ‘green’ 
aspirations has led to stimulation of interest 
in anaerobic digestion. Circa 6m tonnes 
of organic waste is produced annually in 
Ontario and currently less than 20% of 
source segregated organics is composted.
The waste management industry is fragmented 
with competitors being principally local with a 
few European suppliers. Our main competitors 
are currently unable to meet the stringent 
regulations and technical requirements 
of the Ministry of Environment in Canada. 
Orgaworld is the market-leader in its region 
and can offer a wide range of processing 
techniques for the total range of organic waste.

The strategy in Canada is to become market 
leader in the treatment of organic waste 
streams from municipalities through the 
development of further production plants 
to grow across the country.
The key strategic drivers are regulatory 
developments and the security of input volumes. 
Investment will focus on regions where input 
volumes are secured through long-term 
municipal contracts.

Proﬁts in the year were signiﬁcantly up on the 
prior year which was affected by the temporary 
closure of the London Ontario site for an 
upgrade to increase efﬁciency and to reduce 
odour levels. The facility returned to normal 
operating levels in March. The Ottawa site 
continued to perform satisfactorily. Trading 
margins and the return on operating assets 
have returned to more acceptable levels.

We expect further progress in growth and 
margins with both sites operating at more 
normal levels . We continue to pursue further 
opportunities for expansion in this territory 
which will lead to further Shanks plants 
being built.

Financial savings and improved risk

principles of good corporate governance.
of a Risk Committee together with a new Health 
& Safety Committee further strengthened our 
governance framework and reporting structure. 
A clear priority for the Board during the year was 
the recruitment of a new Group Chief Executive 
charged with bringing the energy and leadership 
to maintain the momentum of the Group’s 
progress and manage the next phase of growth. 
Following on from a comprehensive search 
and recruitment process led by the Nomination 
Committee and external recruitment consultants, 
I was therefore delighted to announce the 
appointment of Peter Dilnot who was appointed 
to the Board in February 2012 and whom 
shareholders now have an opportunity to elect 
for the ﬁrst time at the forthcoming AGM. 
This year we report against the new UK 
Corporate Governance Code which has 
superseded the Combined Code. Having fully 
considered the new code the Board are pleased 
to conﬁrm compliance in all material respects 
save for one, as identiﬁed in last year’s 
Governance Report, regarding the annual 
re-election of executive directors. A more 
detailed explanation of this together with our 
wider corporate governance arrangements 
are set out on the following pages. 
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present 
the Corporate Governance Report for 2012. 
The Board fully supports the principles of good 
corporate governance and is committed to the 
improvement and development of appropriate 
structures, processes and procedures 
throughout the Group in support of these 
principles.
Underpinning our entrepreneurial culture is 
a central framework which enhances 
co-ordination throughout the Group and which 
will continue to deliver ﬁnancial savings and 
improved risk management consistent with 
the principles of good corporate governance. 
This framework is in turn built around our 
core values of responsibility, innovation, 
straightforwardness and openness. The aim 
of the central framework is to improve our 
ability to execute right ﬁrst time and to ensure 
experience and good ideas are shared across 
the Group. 
The Board also recognises its responsibility 
to ensure its governance is relevant and focused 
on improving the business, strengthening 
our internal controls and its management 
processes. The establishment during the year

*Additional reporting line to Group Board The Board fully supports the principles of good corporate 
governance. This statement, together with the Remuneration 
Report on pages 75 to 80, explains how the Group has applied 
the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code in force 
for the year to 31 March 2012 and also with the provisions of 
the Disclosure and Transparency Rules on Audit Committees 
and Corporate Governance Statements (DTR7). The Board 
considers that it has complied with Section 1 of the Governance 
Code and DTR7 throughout the year with the single exception 
of Code Provision B.7.1 relating to the annual re-election of all 
directors. The Board’s rationale for this was set out in last year’s 
Annual Report and Accounts and is explained again in the 
Nomination Committee section on page 71. 

The Board comprises the Chairman, a further four independent 
non-executive directors, the Group Chief Executive and Group 
Finance Director. The only change to the Board during the year 
was the resignation of Tom Drury as Group Chief Executive 
on 30 September 2011 and the subsequent appointment of 
Peter Dilnot to this position on 1 February 2012. The Chairman, 
who has been independent since his original appointment, has 
primary responsibility for running the Board. The Group Chief 
Executive is responsible for the operations of the Group and 
for the development of strategic plans and initiatives for 
consideration by the Board. The formal division of 
responsibilities between the Chairman and the Group Chief 
Executive has been agreed by the Board and documented, a 
copy of which is available on the Group’s website. During the 
period from 30 September 2011 to 1 February 2012, Chris 
Surch undertook the role of Acting Group Chief Executive in 
addition to his existing duties of Group Finance Director. 
The non-executive directors bring a wide range of experience to 
the Group and are considered by the Board to be independent 
of management and free from any business or other relationship 
which could materially interfere with the exercise of their 
independent judgement. The non-executive directors make a 
significant contribution to the functioning of the Board, thereby 
ensuring that no one individual or group dominates the decision 
making process. Non-executive directors are not eligible to 
participate in any of the Company’s share option or pension 
schemes. The Chairman also meets and communicates 
regularly with the other non-executive directors without the 
presence of the executive directors.  
Eric van Amerongen continues to hold the position of Senior 
Independent Director, being available to shareholders should 
they have concerns which contact through the normal channels 
of Chairman, Group Chief Executive or Group Finance Director 
has failed to resolve or for which such contact is inappropriate. 
The table below details the number of formal Board meetings 
held in the year and the attendance record of each director.

Bracketed figures indicate maximum potential attendance of each director. 
Three of these meetings were held by telephone conference. 

On appointment, directors are given an introduction to the 
Group’s operations, including visits to principal sites and 
meetings with operational management. As part of a planned 
induction programme in February 2012, during the first month 
of his appointment, Peter Dilnot visited some 25 sites across 
the Group, met with senior and operational managers and 
worked alongside staff on picking lines and on collections.  
Specific training requirements of directors are met either directly 
or by the Company through legal/regulatory updates. Non-
executive directors also have access to PricewaterhouseCoopers’ 
non-executive database and course programme. There is a 
rolling programme of holding Board meetings at various Group 
locations in order to review local operations and make site visits. 
In the year under review the Board visited facilities in Nieuwegen 
(Netherlands), Ghent (Belgium) and Elstow (UK).  
In September 2011 as part of their practical commitment to 
reinvigorating the safety culture throughout the Group the Board 
attended a Safety Leadership presentation/training session 
given by the UK Safety, Health and Environment Department. 
The presentation was followed by a site visit of the Elstow waste 
facility, focusing on health and safety. One of the purposes of 
the training, which was also provided to senior managers 
throughout the Group, was that of confirming the key essential 
health and safety standards applicable across all of the Group’s 
activities. This is now being taken forward by the Health & Safety 
Committee reporting into the Group Executive Committee.

Annual Report & Accounts 2012
 Corporate Governance There is a formal schedule of matters reserved 
specifically for the Board’s decision. These 
include approval of financial statements, 
strategic policy, acquisitions and disposals, 
capital projects over defined limits, annual 
plans and new borrowing facilities. The Board 
meets regularly, having met ten times during 
the year, with a further three meetings being 
held by telephone conference. In addition, 
the Board held an annual strategy conference 
with senior management in attendance. 
At each main meeting, following a review of 
the minutes of the previous meeting and 
any actions arising the first standing item 
of business for consideration by the Board 
is the Safety, Health and Environmental report. 
Other regular reports include those from the 
Group Chief Executive covering business 
performance, markets and competition, 
investor and analyst updates as well as 
progress against strategic objectives and 
capital expenditure projects. 
The Group Finance Director presents a monthly 
report on trading results, key metrics and 
performance indicators whilst one of the 
purposes of the regular Company Secretary’s 
report is to ensure that the Board are kept up 
to date on governance matters generally.  
The Board is provided with appropriate 
information in a timely manner to enable it to 
effectively discharge its duties. All directors 
have access to the Company Secretary 
whose role includes ensuring that Board 
procedures and regulations are followed. 
In addition, directors are entitled, if necessary, 
to seek independent professional advice in 
the furtherance of their duties at the 
Company’s expense.  
All directors are required to notify the Company 
on an ongoing basis of any other commitments 
and through the Company Secretary there are 
procedures for ensuring that the Board’s 
powers for authorising directors’ conflicts of 
interest are operated effectively.  
The work of the Board is further supported by 
three formal Committees (Audit, Remuneration 
and Nomination), detailed on the following 
pages. In addition, whilst not a Committee with 
specific powers of its own delegated by the 
Board, the Group Chief Executive is assisted 
in the performance of his duties by a Group 
Executive Committee, which meets monthly 
and whose permanent members include the 
Group Finance Director and the Managing 
Directors of the Netherlands, Belgium, the UK 
and since May 2012 the Managing Director of 
Orgaworld. In addition there are three specialist 
committees reporting through to the Group 
Executive Committee; Risk, Corporate 
Responsibility and Health & Safety. 

Performance evaluation of the Board, its 
Committees and directors during the year 
was based upon formalised self assessment 
questionnaires supplemented by structured 
interviews conducted by the Chairman with 
individual directors. The performance evaluation 
of the Chairman was undertaken by the non-
executive directors, led by the Senior Independent 
Director. Following this year’s performance 
evaluation the Board recommends to shareholders 
the election and re-election of those directors 
standing at the forthcoming AGM, all of whom 
continue to demonstrate commitment to their role 
and whose performance continues to be effective.  
The Board recognise that a continuous and 
constructively critical evaluation of their 
performance is an important factor in unlocking 
the full potential of the Group. A number of 
topics were also identified for the Board to 
focus further attention on in 2012.  
As a consequence of the change of Group Chief 
Executive during the year and Peter Dilnot’s 
appointment date being just two months from 
the financial year end, the Board determined to 
defer the planned external evaluation to 2012/13 
to allow a sufficient passage of time in order 
to reflect a more informed assessment of the 
contribution of the new Group Chief Executive 
and his interaction with other Board members.

Corporate Governance  
 

The Nomination Committee is chaired by Adrian Auer and is 
comprised solely of non-executive directors; Eric van Amerongen, 
Peter Johnson, Stephen Riley and Jacques Petry. The Committee 
is formally constituted with written terms of reference which 
are available on the Group’s website. It met on three occasions 
during the year and is responsible for making recommendations 
to the Board on the appointment of directors and succession 
planning. It also reviews organisation and resourcing plans for 
the purpose of providing assurance that appropriate processes 
are in place to ensure a sufficient supply of competent executive 
and senior management.  
During the year the Committee were engaged primarily in the 
selection of a new Group Chief Executive necessitated by the 
announcement in July 2011 of Tom Drury’s decision to resign 
in the autumn of 2011. Facilitated by an external recruitment 
consultancy a two phase process was undertaken including 
a preliminary mapping exercise, during which the candidate 
role was refined and developed. This was followed by a 
comprehensive search for an individual with the requisite 
competencies and a proven track record of growth and 
value creation within a highly capital intensive business. 
Candidates at both the long and short list stages of the 
process were purposively drawn from a diverse population 
in terms of experience and nationality as well as gender. 
Any new director appointed to the Board is subject to election 
by shareholders at the first opportunity after their appointment. 
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association 
non-executive directors are also required to stand for re-election 
on an annual basis. Non-executive directors have previously 
been appointed for renewable three year terms but for 
consistency with their annual re-election requirements, letters 
of re-appointment are now issued on the basis of renewable 
annual terms. 
Both the executive directors have contractual notice periods of 
one year and are required to stand for re-election every three 
years. The Board does not believe it is necessary to require 
executive directors to stand for annual re-election as the 
Chairman and non-executives have an existing accountability 
to shareholders for ensuring executives perform effectively and 
a responsibility if necessary to remove them from their post if 
they fail to do so. However, in recognition of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code requirement for annual re-elections, the 
Board will review, on an annual basis, their position regarding 
applicability to the executive directors.  
As previously reported, following discussion of the 
recommendations of the Lord Davies report on Board Room 
Diversity, whilst the Committee at the current time has not 
determined to set a specific female Board member quota, 
appointments to the Board and throughout the Group will 
continue to be based on the diversity of contribution and 
required competencies, irrespective of gender. Statistical 
employment data for the Group can be found in the Shanks 
Corporate Responsibility report available on the Group website.

The Remuneration Committee, which met five times in the year, 
is formally constituted with written terms of reference which are 
available on the Group’s website. The Committee is comprised 
solely of non-executive directors; Eric van Amerongen, Adrian 
Auer, Peter Johnson, Stephen Riley and Jacques Petry. The 
Committee is chaired by Eric van Amerongen and determines 
the Company’s policy on remuneration and on a specific 
package for each of the executive directors. It also determines 
the terms on which the Long Term Incentive Plan and the 
Savings Related Share options are awarded to employees.  
The Committee also determines the remuneration of the Group’s 
senior management and that of the Chairman. It recommends 
the remuneration of the non-executive directors for determination 
by the Board. In exercising its responsibilities the Committee 
has access to professional advice, both internally and externally, 
and may consult the Group Chief Executive about its proposals. 
The Remuneration Report on pages 75 to 80 contains 
particulars of directors’ remuneration and their interests in 
the Company’s shares.

The Audit Committee which met three times in the year is 
formally constituted with written terms of reference which are 
available on the Group’s website. The Committee is comprised 
solely of non-executive directors Peter Johnson, Stephen Riley, 
Jacques Petry and Eric van Amerongen. Peter Johnson, who 
continues to have current and relevant financial experience 
under UK Corporate Governance Code requirements, chaired 
the Committee throughout the year. Representatives from the 
external auditors (PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP), the Risk 
Management and Internal Audit manager, the Chairman and 
the executive directors are regularly invited to attend meetings. 
The Committee also has access to the external auditors’ advice 
without the presence of the executive directors. In the course 
of the financial year, Peter Johnson, the Audit Committee 
Chairman, also met with each of the divisional Finance Directors 
to obtain first hand a clear understanding of some of the 
underlying details behind the financial information presented 
to and considered by the Committee and the Board. 
The Audit Committee has the authority to examine any matters 
relating to the financial affairs of the Group. This includes 
the appointment, terms of engagement, objectivity and 
independence of the external auditors, the nature and scope 
of the audit, reviews of the interim and annual financial 
statements, internal control procedures, accounting policies, 
adherence with accounting standards and such other related 
functions as the Board may require. The Committee also 
considers and regularly reviews other risk management 
and control documentation, including the Group’s policy 
on whistleblowing and security reporting procedures.  
Specifically, at their May 2011 meeting the Committee considered 
Combined Code/Corporate Governance compliance, taxation 
and the 2011 financial statements. The October 2011 meeting 
was concerned primarily with the interim results whilst the 
February 2012 meeting reviewed goodwill and other intangibles, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers’ audit plan and preparation of the 
2012 financial statements.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP rotate their lead audit 
engagement partner as a minimum at least every five years, 
as required by their own rules and by regulatory bodies. 
Rotation ensures a fresh look without sacrificing institutional 
knowledge. Rotation of key audit partners, other partners 
including specialist partners and senior engagement personnel 
is reviewed on a regular basis by the lead audit engagement 
partner in consultation with the Audit Committee. As well as 
the lead audit partner being required to rotate every five years, 
key partners involved in the audit are required to do so every 
seven years and other partners and senior staff members every 
ten years. 
Specified non-audit services may be provided by the external 
auditor subject to a competitive bid process other than in 
situations where it is determined by the Group Finance Director 
that the work is closely related to the audit or when a significant 
benefit can be obtained from work previously conducted by 
the external auditor. Whilst the Group Finance Director may 
approve any new engagement up to the value of £25,000, 
anything in excess requires Audit Committee approval up to an 
agreed annual aggregate limit of 75% of the prior year audit fee. 
In exceptional circumstances this limit may be exceeded with 
the approval of the Board. In determining whether or not to 
engage the external auditor to provide any non-audit services 
consideration will be given to whether this would create a threat 
to their independence. Similarly the external auditor will not be 
permitted to undertake any advocacy role for the Group such 
that their objectivity may be compromised. The external auditor 
may not provide services involving the preparation of accounting 
records or financial statements, the design, implementation 
and operation of financial information systems, actuarial and 
internal control functions or the management of internal audits. 
Fees paid to the auditors are disclosed in note 5 of the 
financial statements. 
Tax and other professional services have also been provided to 
the Group by audit firms KPMG and Ernst & Young during the 
year. A resolution proposing PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s 
re-appointment as Group auditors will be put to shareholders 
at the forthcoming AGM.

Corporate Governance  
 

The responsibilities of the directors and the auditors in relation 
to the financial statements are set out on pages 84 to 86. 

The Group risk management framework and the steps taken 
to manage risk are outlined on pages 42 to 47.  

The system of internal control is based on a continuous process 
of identifying, evaluating and managing risks including the risk 
management processes outlined on pages 42 and 43. The 
Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the Group’s 
system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
The Board recognises that internal control systems are designed 
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can therefore only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material misstatements, 
losses and the breach of laws and regulations. 
 In addition to the Board’s ongoing internal control monitoring 
process it has also conducted an annual review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control in 
compliance with Provision C.2.1 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. This review covered all material controls 
including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk 
management systems. Specifically, the Board’s review 
consisted of the following elements: 
• Consideration of changes in the risk environment and the 
Group’s ability to respond to these through its review of 
business risk registers controls and improvement action plans. 
• Review of the six-monthly certification by country 
management that appropriate internal controls are in place 
following assessment by the Risk Management and Internal 
Audit function.  
• Review of reports by internal audit and external auditors. 
During the year internal audits were conducted on purchases 
and payments systems, weighbridge operations, accrued 
income, controls over cash transactions as well as financial 
controls audits at operational level. 

 Regular features of the Group’s internal control system which 
contribute towards its continuous monitoring are as follows: 
• A defined schedule of matters for decision by the Board. 
• A clear management structure including clear limits of 
authority over items such as capital expenditure, pricing 
strategy and contract authorisation. 
• A comprehensive planning and budgeting exercise. 
Performance is measured monthly against plan and prior year 
results and explanations sought for significant variances. 
Key performance indicators (KPIs) are also extensively used 
to help management of the business and to provide early 
warning of potential additional risk factors. See pages 18 
and 19 for additional information on the use of KPIs. 
• Monthly meetings of the Group’s most senior managers and 
executive directors to discuss performance and plans. 
• Monthly visits to key operating locations by the executive 
directors to attend local management meetings which include 
discussion of key risk areas. 
• Appointment and retention of appropriately experienced and 
qualified staff to help achieve business objectives. 
• An annual risk-based internal audit plan approved by the Audit 
Committee. Audits are performed under the guidance of the 
Risk Management and Internal Audit Manager with findings 
discussed at business unit meetings. Summaries of audit 
findings and the status of action plans to remedy significant 
failings are discussed at Group Board and Audit Committee 
meetings on a regular basis. The Risk Management and 
Internal Audit manager attends all Audit Committee meetings. 
• A range of quality assurance and environmental management 
systems in use across the Group. Where appropriate these 
are independently certified to internationally recognised 
standards including ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 and subject 
to regular independent auditing. 
• Regular meetings of the Audit Committee, comprising non-
executive directors, to consider all key aspects of the risk 
management and internal control systems.  
Where weaknesses in the internal control system have been 
identified through the monitoring processes outlined above, 
plans for strengthening them are put in place and action plans 
regularly monitored until complete. The Board confirms that 
no material weaknesses were identified during the year and 
therefore no remedial action is required in relation to them.

Annual Report & Accounts 2012
  

In addition to the general risk management and internal control 
processes described above, the Group has also implemented 
internal controls specific to the financial reporting process and 
the preparation of the annual consolidated financial statements. 
The main control aspects are as follows: 
• Formal written financial policies and procedures applicable 
to all business units. 
• A detailed reporting calendar including the submission of 
detailed monthly accounts for each business unit in addition 
to the year-end and interim reporting process. 
• Detailed management review to Board level of both monthly 
management accounts and year-end and interim accounts. 
• Bi-annual certification by country managing directors and 
finance directors and executive directors on compliance with 
appropriate policies and the accuracy of financial information.  
Information on the Company’s share capital is set out in the 
Directors’ Report. 

Over the last year the Group has considered its response to the 
UK Bribery Act which came into force in July 2011. The main 
steps taken to ensure compliance have been as follows: 
• Distribution of the new Group Anti-bribery policy to all 
business units. 
• Follow-up of the policy by an article in the Group newsletter. 
• Manager briefing presentations given to all key staff.  
• Regular updates given to the Audit Committee on progress 
against the Anti-bribery policy implementation plan. 
Internal Audit will be reviewing compliance with various aspects 
of the policy across the Group. 
Subsequent to the year end, a 24 hour/7 days a week 
confidential reporting, ‘whistleblowing’, service has also been 
established for employees. 

The Company has an active investor relations programme, 
regularly meeting with institutional investors, analysts, press and 
other parties. The Board obtains feedback from its joint brokers, 
Jefferies Hoare Govett (formally RBS Hoare Govett) and Investec 
on the views of institutional shareholders and the Chairman 
attends meetings with major shareholders whose views are 
communicated to the Board as a whole. Detailed shareholder 
and market comment in particular is reported to the Board 
after results announcements. The Group website contains 
useful information for shareholders and the general public. 
The Company also communicates with private and institutional 
investors through the AGM. 
The UK Stewardship Code introduced by the Financial 
Reporting Council in 2010 encourages enhanced shareholder 
engagement particularly with a Company’s institutional investors 
to improve long-term returns to shareholders which the Board 
recognises and supports. The Board was therefore delighted 
that the 2011 Report and Accounts won two prestigious 
awards; ‘Best Strategy Disclosure’ of a FTSE 250 Company 
at the ICSA Hermes Transparency in Governance Awards in 
November 2011 and ‘Best Investor Communication’ at the 2011 
PLC Awards held in March 2012.

Corporate Governance The principal objectives of the Remuneration 
Committee, which is chaired by Eric van 
Amerongen and comprises the non-executive 
directors, are to attract, retain and motivate 
high quality senior management and to provide 
a competitive package of incentives linked to 
performance and the interests of shareholders. 
The Committee seeks to ensure that the 
executive directors are fairly rewarded taking 
into account all elements of their remuneration 
package in the light of the Group’s 
performance. The Committee members and 
their attendance at meetings held during the 
year are set out in the Corporate Governance 
section on page 71. The Committee’s duties 
are outlined in its terms of reference which 
are available on the Group website. 
Kepler Associates Partnership LLP (Kepler) 
provided independent advice to the Committee 
relating to executive remuneration and benefits 
during the year. Kepler were considered to be 
independent as they provided no other services 
to the Group. 
A significant proportion of executive directors’ 
potential total remuneration is performance 
related and therefore variable. This comprises 
annual (bonus) and longer term (LTIP) 
incentives. The fixed proportion of their overall 
remuneration comprises base salary and a 
cash element in lieu of pension. For directors 
achieving median performance, performance 
related pay would represent almost 50% of 
total remuneration. If performance were such 
that the maximum award available under each 
variable incentive was paid, performance 
related pay would represent approximately 
70% of total remuneration as shown below.

 Remuneration Report
 
Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee
Incentive arrangements include targets 
which are very stretching and are in 
alignment with the interests of shareholders.  

The basic salary element is determined primarily by reference to 
external data which takes into account the executive directors’ 
duties and responsibilities. Basic salary is generally reviewed 
on an annual basis or following a significant change in 
responsibilities. The Committee also have regard specifically to 
the general level of pay awards around the Group. The Group 
Chief Executive Peter Dilnot’s initial base salary of £432,600 
is scheduled to be reviewed for the first time in April 2013. 
In addition to his basic salary of £283,250 as Group Finance 
Director, Chris Surch received an additional responsibility 
allowance of £150,000 in respect of carrying out the duties 
of Acting Group Chief Executive in the interregnum between 
Tom Drury’s departure and Peter Dilnot’s appointment.  

Annual cash bonuses for executive directors are paid at the 
discretion of the Remuneration Committee and are determined 
as a percentage of base salary dependent upon corporate 
financial performance compared to target and the achievement 
of personal objectives set by the Committee.  
For the year to 31 March 2012, the maximum bonus potential 
for executive directors was 100% of base salary. 75% of the 
bonus was measured against financial targets and 25% was 
based on the achievement of personal objectives. For the 
financial component, 25% of base salary was payable for 
achievement of 2011/12 budgeted profit before tax, whilst 
a maximum of 70% of salary was payable for achievement 
of Full Potential Plan (FPP) profit targets, representing a 
stretch of approximately 13% outperformance of budget. 
The remaining 5% of salary was based on underlying free 
cash flow performance. In Peter Dilnot’s case, the maximum 
was limited to two-twelfths of the maximum, reflecting his 
joining date of 1 February 2012.  
Minimum threshold performance for the corporate financial 
component was exceeded for 2011/12 and the underlying 
free cash flow element target was partially met. This led to a 
payout of 66% of salary, pro-rated for period in employment, 
for Peter Dilnot. Achievement of personal objectives relating 
to safety, cost efficiencies, project milestones and strategic 
planning resulted in a pro-rated payout of 21% resulting in 
a total bonus for 2011/12 of 87% (pro rata) of salary for Peter 
Dilnot. Further to the announcement that Chris Surch would be 
stepping down from the Board with effect from 31 August 2012 
to take up a new appointment as Group Finance Director of 
FirstGroup plc, and therefore being under notice at the time 
bonuses are paid, he received no 2011/12 bonus. 
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the 2012/13 annual 
bonus plan to ensure this short-term reward mechanism for 
senior executives continues to be aligned with the interests of 
shareholders and more specifically places additional emphasis 
on performance incentivisation being closely in line with the 
achievement of the Shanks Group strategy. Profit growth must be 
achieved for any financial performance reward, with further linkage 
to profit improvement and shareholder return. The annual bonus 
plan is intended to motivate senior executives to focus on both 
short-term performance and drive initiatives which will support 
long-term value creation. The Committee acknowledge that a 
fundamental measure of effective management at Shanks is 
the superior management of capital projects and as such it is 
appropriate to reflect this in the bonus plan structure.  
Whilst retaining a 75% bonus opportunity for achievement of 
financial targets the Committee have therefore reweighted the 
components such that 50% will now be linked to a Group profit 
before tax target and greater emphasis placed on Group 
underlying free cash flow such that it represents a 13% 
opportunity, with the remaining 12% being linked to a new, 
return on assets, target.  
The 25% bonus opportunity for personal objectives will also 
be retained though the number of targets has been reduced 
down to a maximum of five, inclusive of a Safety, Health & 
Environment target. 

Executive directors and senior employees may be granted awards 
annually as determined by the Committee. The vesting of these 
awards is subject to the attainment of performance conditions 
measured over a three year period. Awards are in the form of 
Shanks Group plc shares.  
For outstanding awards originally granted in 2010 the 
Company’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance will 
be compared to the TSR of the FTSE Support Services Sector, 
with awards only vesting to the extent the Committee is satisfied 
that the Company’s TSR performance reflects underlying 
performance of the Company. None of the awards will vest 
if the Company’s TSR is ranked below median, whilst 25% 
will vest for median performance.  
At the 2011 AGM shareholders approved a replacement LTIP. 
For awards granted in 2011 and 2012 vesting is linked to three 
years growth in earnings per share (EPS) and share price. 
The Committee believes that EPS growth is a key indicator of 
success for the Company, while share price growth will help 
ensure strong alignment with shareholders. Both measures are 
transparent and motivational to executives. They are combined 
in a multiplicative manner, with sliding scales for each measure 
so that share price growth without EPS growth would not be 
rewarded. It provides a progressive relationship between pay 
and performance and a highly motivational incentive.  
Annual grants of shares are up to a maximum of 200% of salary. 
The initial target award is 50% of salary (200% maximum) for the 
Group Chief Executive and 37.5% (150% maximum) of salary 
for the Group Finance Director. Shares vest on three year 
growth in EPS and share price, as shown in the charts opposite. 
Chris Surch’s outstanding LTIPs will lapse upon his leaving the 
Company on 31 August 2012. 

Shanks Group plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2012

Remuneration Report Three year EPS growth determines the ‘core award’ as follows: 
• No award for EPS growth of less than 7% p.a. 
• 20% of the target award for EPS growth of 7% p.a. 
• 100% of the target award for EPS growth of 15% p.a. 
(maximum vesting for the majority of participants). 
• For the most senior executives only (including the two 
executive directors), 200% of target award vesting for EPS 
growth of 25% p.a. or more. 
• Straight-line vesting in-between these points. 
The ‘core award’ is subject to a ‘share price multiplier’ as follows: 
• 1 times for share price growth of up to and including 15% p.a. 
• 1.5 times for share price growth of 20% p.a. 
• For the most senior executives only (including the two 
executive directors), 2 times for share price growth of 
25% p.a. or more. 
• Straight-line vesting in-between these points. 
Share price growth is calculated using three month average 
share prices immediately prior to the start and end of the 
performance period.  
In addition to meeting the EPS and share price growth targets 
outlined above, the Committee must satisfy itself that the 
recorded outcome is a fair reflection of the underlying 
performance of the Group. 
The Remuneration Committee believes that these incentive 
arrangements include targets which are very stretching and are 
in alignment with the interests of shareholders, as they help to 
motivate and retain executives and senior managers to deliver 
the Group’s long-term strategy and goals.  
It is the Committee’s policy to periodically review executive 
remuneration arrangements, including the LTIP performance 
measures and targets, which the Committee will continue to do, 
from time to time. 
The Shanks Group plc Employee Share Trust has been 
established for the purpose of granting awards under the LTIP 
and to hold shares in the Company either purchased in the 
market or new shares subscribed for, with funds provided by the 
Company or its subsidiaries. As at 31 March 2012 the Employee 
Share Trust did not hold any of the Company’s shares.  
 
The graph above shows the TSR of the Company over the five 
year period to 31 March 2012. The two comparator indices, for 
which TSR is also shown, have been selected as they are broad 
equity indices of which the Company is a constituent member.

 The Remuneration Committee believes that share ownership by employees encourages the matching of long-term interests 
between employees and shareholders. UK employees including executive directors may participate in an HMRC approved SRSOS. 
Under the terms of this scheme options may be granted during the ten year period to July 2015 to acquire up to 10% of the issued 
equity share capital of the Company. Options are granted at the higher of the nominal value of an ordinary 10p share and an 
amount determined by the Remuneration Committee being not less than 80% of the market value. Employees held options over 
circa 1.3 million shares under the SRSOS as at 31 March 2012. 

The Remuneration Committee has agreed that the policy with regard to the notice period for executive directors is one year. 
Accordingly, Peter Dilnot and Chris Surch have rolling service contracts dated 1 February 2012 and 27 April 2009 respectively 
which require one year’s notice from the Company.  
The executive directors’ service contracts contain the ability for the Company to terminate the employment of the executive 
directors by making a payment in lieu of salary and contractual benefits for the twelve month notice period. The Company has 
the ability to pay such sums in instalments, requiring the director to mitigate his loss (for example, by gaining new employment) 
over the relevant period. 

The non-executive directors do not have service contracts as their terms of engagement are governed by letters of appointment. 
These letters of appointment have previously included renewable three year terms but since 31 March 2011 re-appointment letters 
have been issued with an annual renewable term linked, for consistency, to the end of July, being the month of the Company’s 
AGM at which all non-executive directors must stand for annual re-election. As such, subject to re-election by shareholders both 
Adrian Auer’s and Peter Johnson’s letters of appointment will be renewed on 31 July 2012. 
The Chairman and non-executive directors do not participate in the Company’s share or bonus plans and do not receive any 
pension contributions.

the directors may not be indemnified, the Company maintained 
a Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance policy throughout

Preceding sections of this Annual Report include: 
About Shanks, Understanding our strategy and markets, 
Managing a sustainable business, Risks and uncertainties and 
Our performance. These refer to the objectives and strategy of 
the Group, its competition and the markets in which it operates, 
the principal risks and uncertainties it faces, a review of the 
development and performance of the business for the year 
ended 31 March 2012, the Group’s financial position, key 
performance indicators and likely future developments of 
the business. Together with the Governance section, the 
information referred to above fulfils the requirements of the 
business review provisions in section 417 of the Companies Act 
2006 and is incorporated by reference into, and is deemed to 
form part of, this Report together with the other information 
referred to in this Directors’ Report. 

During the year acquisitions have been made for an initial cash 
consideration of £3.4m (2011: £6.9m). On 1 March 2012 the 
Group acquired the assets of Van Tuijl Glasrecycling BV for a 
cash consideration of £3.4m with contingent consideration of 
£1.7m. Further details are set out in note 17 of the financial 
statements. Disposals amounted to nil (2011: £24.6m).  

The Group spent £55,000 (2011: £274,000) on research 
and development during the year ended 31 March 2012. 
This expenditure related to the Group’s participation in a four 
year project by a consortium of universities, research centres 
and commercial companies in Belgium aimed at developing 
technologies for mapping landfill sites, optimising waste 
decomposition processes and the recovery of energy 
and materials through excavation techniques and waste  
pre-treatment. 

The Group’s Consolidated Income Statement appears on page 
88 and note 3 to the financial statements shows the contribution 
to revenue and profits made by the different segments of the 
Group’s business. The Group’s profit for the year amounted 
to £26.8m (2011: £21.9m).  
The directors recommend a final dividend of 2.35p (2011: 2.25p) 
per share be paid on 1 August 2012 to ordinary shareholders 
on the register of members at close of business on 6 July 2012. 
This dividend, if approved by shareholders, together with the 
interim dividend of 1.1p (2011: 1.0p) per share already paid on 
13 January 2012, will make a total dividend for the year of 3.45p 
per share (2011: 3.25p).  

After making enquiries, the directors have formed the view, 
at the time of approving the financial statements, that the 
Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future and that 
the Group’s business is a going concern. For this reason the 
directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.

 Directors’ Report  

As at 31 March 2012 the Company had been notified of the 
following direct and indirect interests in voting rights equal to 
or exceeding 3% of the ordinary share capital of the Company, 
there being no further notified changes up to 17 May 2012:

Artemis Investment 
Management LLP 29,110,210 7.34

The Company’s share capital comprises ordinary shares of 
10 pence each par value. As at 31 March 2012 and as at the 
date of this Report there were 396,857,212 ordinary shares in 
issue. During the year ended 31 March 2012 no ordinary shares 
were issued other than in respect of the exercise of options or 
awards under the Company’s share schemes, details of which 
are given in note 7 to the financial statements. The principal 
rights and obligations attaching to the ordinary shares are 
as follows: 
• Dividend rights – holders of the Company’s ordinary shares 
may, by ordinary resolution, declare dividends but may not 
declare dividends in excess of the amount recommended by 
the directors. The directors may also pay interim dividends. 
No dividend may be paid other than out of profits available 
for distribution. Payment or satisfaction of a dividend may 
be made wholly or partly by distribution of assets, including 
fully paid shares or debentures of any other company. 
The directors may deduct from any dividend payable to a 
member all sums of money (if any) payable by such member 
to the Company in respect of their ordinary shares. 
• Voting rights – voting at any general meeting is by a show of 
hands unless a poll is duly demanded. Voting at this year’s 
AGM will be by a poll only. On a show of hands, every 
shareholder who is present in person or by proxy or 
represented by a corporate representative has one vote 
regardless of the number of shares held by the shareholder. 
On a poll, every shareholder who is present in person or by 
proxy or represented by a corporate representative has one 
vote for every share held by that shareholder. A poll may be 
demanded by any of the following: (a) the chairman of the 
meeting; (b) at least five shareholders entitled to vote and 
present in person or by proxy or represented by corporate 
representatives at the meeting; (c) any shareholder(s) present 
in person or by proxy or represented by corporate 
representatives and representing in the aggregate not less 
than one-tenth of the total voting rights of all shareholders 
entitled to attend and vote at the meeting; or (d) any 
shareholder(s) present in person or by proxy or represented 
by corporate representatives and holding shares conferring 
a right to attend and vote at the meeting on which there have 
been paid up sums in the aggregate equal to not less than 
one-tenth of the total sum paid up on all the shares conferring 
that right. In the case of joint holders of an ordinary share, 
the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, shall be accepted 
to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders. 
Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of 
the joint holders appear in the Company’s register of members 
in respect of the joint holding. The deadline for appointing 
proxies to exercise voting rights at any general meeting is 
set out in the notice convening the relevant meeting. The 
Company is not aware of any agreements between holders 
of its shares that may result in restrictions on voting rights.  
• Return of capital – in the event of the liquidation of the 
Company, after payment of all liabilities and deductions taking 
priority, the balance of assets available for distribution will be 
distributed among the holders of ordinary shares according 
to the amounts paid up on the shares held by them. 
A liquidator may, with the sanction of a special resolution 
of the shareholders and any other sanction required by law, 
divide among the shareholders in kind the whole or any part of 
the Company’s assets or vest the Company’s assets, in whole 
or in part, in trustees such trust for the benefit of shareholders, 
but no shareholder may be compelled to accept any assets 
upon which there is any liability.  

There are no restrictions under the Company’s Memorandum 
or Articles of Association that restrict the rights of members to 
hold or transfer the Company’s shares. Certain restrictions may 
however from time to time be imposed by laws and regulations 
(for example insider trading laws). The Company is not aware 
of any agreements between holders of its shares that may result 
in restrictions on the transfer of securities.  

The Company operates a number of employee share schemes. 
Under one of those schemes, ordinary shares may be held by 
trustees on behalf of employees. Employees are not entitled 
to exercise directly any voting or other control rights in respect 
of any shares held by such trustees and the trustees have full 
discretion to vote or abstain from voting at general meetings 
of the Company in respect of such shares.  

As at 31 March 2012 and as at the date of this Report the 
Company had in issue a retail bond comprising €100 million 
5% guaranteed notes due 22 October 2015. There are no 
restrictions under the instrument governing the guaranteed 
notes that restrict the rights of investors to hold or transfer 
the guaranteed notes. The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between the holders of guaranteed notes that may 
result in restrictions on the transfer of guaranteed notes.

Directors’ Report  
 

The Company shall appoint not less than two directors 
(disregarding alternate directors). The appointment and 
replacement of directors may be made as follows:  
• The Company’s members may, by ordinary resolution, 
appoint any person who is willing to act to be a director. 
• The Board may appoint any person who is willing to act to be 
a director. Any director so appointed shall hold office only until 
the next AGM and shall then be eligible for election.  
• Each executive director shall retire from office no later than 
at the third AGM after the AGM at which he or she was last 
elected but he or she may be re-appointed by ordinary 
resolution if eligible and willing.  
• Each non-executive director shall retire from office at every 
AGM but he or she may be re-appointed by ordinary 
resolution if eligible and willing.  
• The Company may, by special resolution, remove any 
director before the expiry of his or her period of office or may, 
by ordinary resolution, remove a director where special notice 
has been given and the necessary statutory procedures are 
complied with. 
• A director must vacate his or her office if any of the 
circumstances in Article 100 of the Articles of Association 
arise. 

The Articles of Association of the Company provide that the 
business of the Company shall be managed by the Board which 
may exercise all the powers of the Company, whether relating to 
the management of the business of the Company or not. This 
power is subject to any limitations imposed on the Company by 
legislation. It is also limited by the provisions of the Articles of 
Association and by any directions given by special resolution of 
the members of the Company which are applicable on the date 
that any power is exercised. Specific provisions relevant to the 
exercise of powers by the directors include the following:  
• Pre-emptive rights and new issues of shares – while holders 
of ordinary shares have no pre-emptive rights under the 
Articles of Association, the ability of the directors to cause 
the Company to issue shares, securities convertible into 
shares or rights to shares, otherwise than pursuant to an 
employees share scheme, is restricted. Under the Companies 
Act 2006, the directors of a company are, with certain 
exceptions, unable to allot any equity securities without 
express authorisation, which may be contained in a 
company’s articles of association or given by its shareholders 
in general meeting, but which in either event cannot last for 
more than five years. Under the Companies Act 2006, the 
Company may also not allot shares for cash (otherwise than 
pursuant to an employees share scheme) without first making 
an offer to existing shareholders to allot such shares to them 
on the same or more favourable terms in proportion to their 
respective shareholdings, unless this requirement is waived 
by a special resolution of the Company’s shareholders. 
The Company received authority at the last AGM to allot 
shares for cash on a non pre-emptive basis up to a maximum 
nominal amount of £1,984,230. This authority lasts until the 
earlier of the Company’s AGM in 2012 or 30 September 2012. 
• Repurchase of shares – subject to authorisation by 
shareholder resolution, the Company may purchase all or any 
of its own shares in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 
and the Listing Rules. Any shares which have been bought 
back may be held as treasury shares or, if not so held, must 
be cancelled immediately upon completion of the purchase, 
thereby reducing the amount of the Company’s issued share 
capital. The Company received authority at the last AGM to 
purchase up to 39,684,602 ordinary shares. This authority 
lasts until the earlier of the Company’s AGM in 2012 or 
30 September 2012. 
• Borrowing powers – the directors are empowered to exercise 
all the powers of the Company to borrow money and to 
mortgage or charge all or any part of the Company’s assets, 
provided that the aggregate amount of borrowings of the 
Group outstanding at any time does not exceed the limit set 
out in the Company’s Articles of Association, unless 
sanctioned by an ordinary resolution of the Company’s 
shareholders. 

The Company may alter its Articles of Association by special 
resolution passed at a general meeting. 

The Board is fully committed to high standards of corporate 
governance. Details relating to the Company’s compliance with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code for the financial year are 
given in the Corporate Governance and Remuneration Reports 
on pages 68 to 80.  

Information on Corporate Responsibility matters including the 
environment, employment policies, health and safety and 
community relations are set out on pages 34 to 41. The Group 
Corporate Responsibility Policy is available on the Group 
website as is the 2012 Group Corporate Responsibility Report. 

During the financial year donations made by the Group for 
charitable purposes amounted to £17,000 (2011: £19,000), 
inclusive of £15,000 to the UK youth charity, the Prince’s Trust. 
Also, in the UK, through the Landfill Communities Fund, the 
Group has applied £754,000 (2011: £546,000) via not-for-profit 
organisations to undertake projects such as disused land 
restoration, public park maintenance and habitat conservation. 
In addition, staff at individual Group businesses have organised 
various fund raising events to support local and national charities. 
No donations were made by the Group for political purposes 
during the financial year (2011: £nil).

The Company does not currently subscribe to any code or 
standard on payment practice. It is the Company’s policy, 
however, to settle terms of payment with suppliers when 
agreeing the terms of each transaction, to ensure that suppliers 
are made aware of the terms of payment and to abide by the 
terms of payment. The amount owed to trade creditors at the 
year end in proportion to the amounts invoiced by suppliers 
during the year, expressed as a number of days, was 58 days 
(2011: 67 days) for the Group and was 38 days (2011: 35 days) 
for the Company.  
 The Group’s principal financing instrument at 31 March 2012, 
a €200m term loan and multicurrency revolving credit facility 
with six major banks, contains an option for those banks to 
declare by notice that all sums outstanding under that 
agreement are repayable immediately in the event of a change 
of control of the Company. Any such notice may take effect no 
earlier than 30 days from the change of control and, if exercised 
at 31 March 2012, would have required the repayment of 
£84.6m in principal and interest.  
The Group’s five year Retail Bond issued in October 2010 
requires notice to be given to bondholders within seven 
business days of a change of control following which the 
holders have an option to seek repayment at a 1% premium, 
within 60 days of that notice. Such repayment must be made 
within 10 business days of the expiry of the option period. 
If exercised at 31 March 2012, repayment of £86.0m 
in principal and interest would have been required.  
The notes issued under the Group’s 24 March 2011 private 
placement contain an option for the noteholders to enforce 
prepayment between 30 and 60 days from a change of control 
of outstanding principal and interest which would have 
amounted in total at 31 March 2012 to £49.2m. In addition, 
a make-whole payment amounting to £9.2m which is not 
provided for in these financial statements would be payable 
to private placement noteholders based on treasury yields 
at 31 March 2012. 
In addition, the rules of the Company’s employee share plans 
provide that awards and options may vest and become 
exercisable on a change of control of the Company. 


The Group’s largest customers for its products and services 
include local authorities and municipalities. In the UK these 
include, notably, long-term integrated waste management 
contracts with the East London Waste Authority, Dumfries 
and Galloway, Argyll & Bute, Cumbria, Derbyshire, Barnsley, 
Doncaster and Rotherham Councils. Under these contracts, 
the Group is responsible for managing the municipal wastes 
and recyclables collected by the local authority or their 
subcontractors. In the Netherlands, the Group’s hazardous 
waste business has long-term contracts with the oil and gas 
industry and is a major supplier of cleaning services to the 
petrochemical industry. The Netherlands business also has 
a number of long-term source segregated organic contracts 
with municipalities and provinces. In Belgium there are a 
number of municipal waste collection contracts, the largest 
being for the city of Liege. In Canada there are long-term 
contracts with the London and Ottawa municipalities. 

Notice of the AGM of the Company to be held at the offices 
of the Royal Bank of Scotland, 250 Bishopsgate, London 
EC2M 4AA on Thursday 19, July 2012 at 11.00am will be made 
available to shareholders, together with a form of proxy, and will 
also be available on the Group website at www.shanksplc.com. 
The directors consider that all the resolutions to be proposed 
at the AGM are in the best interests of the Company and its 
shareholders as a whole and they recommend unanimously 
that all shareholders vote in favour of the resolutions, as they 
intend to do in respect of their own shareholdings.  

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors 
have prepared the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.  
Under company law, the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and 
of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing 
these financial statements, the directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; 
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.

uncertainties that it faces; 
• there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s 
auditors are unaware; and

directors in order to make themselves aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors 
are aware of that information.

We have audited the financial statements of Shanks Group plc 
for the year ended 31 March 2012 which comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income, the Group and Parent Company 
Balance Sheets, the Group and Parent Company Statements 
of Changes in Equity, the Group and Parent Company 
Statements of Cash Flows and the related notes. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the 
Parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 

As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 84, the directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.  
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 

An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all 
the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 
and Accounts 2012 to identify material inconsistencies with 
the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider 
the implications for our report. 

In our opinion:  
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 
31 March 2012 and of the Group’s profit and Group’s and 
Parent Company’s cash flows for the year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;  
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and as applied in accordance with 
the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 
of the lAS Regulation.  


In our opinion:  
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and 
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial 
year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements. 


We have nothing to report in respect of the following:  
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion:  
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or  
• the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or  
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or  
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:  
• the Directors’ Statement, set out on page 81, in relation to 
going concern; 
• the parts of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to 
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and 
• certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board 
on directors’ remuneration.

Shanks Group plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2012
 Statements of Cash Flows Shanks Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in Scotland under the Companies Act 2006. 

The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, which are stated 
at fair value. The policies set out below have been consistently applied. The Group has applied all accounting standards and 
interpretations issued relevant to its operations and effective for accounting periods beginning on 1 April 2011. The set of 
financial statements included in this annual report have been prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors consider that 
the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 

The financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union (EU) and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation and with those parts of the Companies Act 
2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 

The Directors have made certain presentational and classification changes to the income statement in this annual report. 
The Group has opted to present its Income Statement for the year ended 31 March 2012 and 31 March 2011 in a three-column 
format. Such presentation allows non-trading and exceptional items to be presented separately in the middle column of the 
Income Statement. The various line items of the Income Statement are therefore shown both before and after these items 
in the first and last columns, respectively. This allows shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance 
in the current year, so as to facilitate comparison with the prior year. 
The Group has made a classification change with regards to the allocation of items between cost of sales and administrative 
expenses. This change has been undertaken in order to achieve a more appropriate presentation. In accordance with IAS 1 
Presentation of Financial Statements, the 31 March 2011 comparative figures have been restated to reflect this change. 
The impact of this change was a reduction to cost of sales and an increase to administrative expenses of £4.9m. There is no 
impact on the overall profitability or equity of the Group and consequently a third balance sheet has not been presented. 
The comparative figures in respect of certain income statement disclosure items have been restated as a result of the 
misstatements identified. Total remuneration of employees has reduced from £182.4m to £171.6m, employee numbers have 
reduced from 4,246 to 4,020, operating lease costs have increased from £17.6m to £20.0m and repairs and maintenance 
expenditure has reduced from £44.5m to £40.9m. These changes have no impact on the primary statements, overall 
profitability or equity of the Group.

Annual Report & Accounts 2012

Notes to the Financial Statements  

The Group has adopted in the year the following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations which 
are mandatory for the first time for the Group’s financial year beginning 1 April 2011: 
Accounting Standard  Requirement Impact on financial statements 
IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures The key amendments were: 
Provide a partial exemption from related 
party disclosure requirements for 
government-related entities. 
Clarify the definition of a related party. 
Include an explicit requirement to disclose 
commitments involving related parties. 
The adoption of the amendment by 
the Group has had no material impact. 
IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum 
Funding Requirement 
Amendments apply when an entity is 
subject to minimum funding requirements 
and makes an early payment of 
contributions to cover those requirements, 
permitting the benefit of such an early 
payment to be recognised as an asset. 
The adoption of the amendment by 
the Group has had no material impact. 
IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Liabilities with 
Equity Instruments 
Requires the extinguishment of a financial 
liability by the issue of equity instruments 
to be measured at fair value with the 
difference between the fair value of the 
instrument issued and the carrying value 
of the liability extinguished being 
recognised in profit or loss. 
The adoption of the amendment by 
the Group has had no material impact. 
Improvements to IFRSs (2010) Amends several pronouncements as a 
result of the IASB’s 2008–2010 cycle of 
annual improvements. Key amendments: 
IFRS 1 – accounting policy changes 
in year of adoption and amendments 
to deemed cost. 
IFRS 3/IAS 27 – clarification of transition 
requirements, measurement of non-
controlling interests, unreplaced and 
voluntarily replaced share-based 
payment awards. 
IFRIC 13 – fair value of award credits. 
Financial statement disclosures: 
Clarification of content of statement 
of changes in equity (IAS 1), financial 
instrument disclosures (IFRS 7) and 
significant events and transactions 
in interim reports (IAS 34). 
The adoption of the amendment by 
the Group has had no material impact.

Standards and interpretations issued by the IASB are only applicable if endorsed by the European Union.  
The following revisions to IFRS will be applicable in future periods: 
• IAS 19 Employee Benefits was amended in June 2011 but the amendments are not applicable until 1 January 2013, subject 
to EU endorsement. The impact on the Group will be to replace interest cost and expected return on plan assets with a net 
interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability (or asset). The Group is yet to 
assess the full impact of the amendment. 
• IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 which will impact the 
accounts for the year ended 31 March 2014, subject to EU endorsement. Given the Group has a number of joint ventures 
which are currently proportionately consolidated it is possible that the standard will have a material impact on the Group’s 
reporting as this will no longer be permitted. The Group is yet to assess the full impact of the amendment. Full details of the 
Group’s interest in joint ventures are shown in note 15. 
It is anticipated that the adoption of the following amendments to standards and interpretations in future periods will have no 
material impact on the Group’s reported results or financial position: 
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2010) effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015. 
• IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 
• IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 
• IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.  
• IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements (2011) effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 
• IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011) effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 
• Amendments to IFRS 1 Severe Hyperinflation and Removal of Fixed Dates for First-time Adopters. Effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 July 2011. 
• Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures. Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011. 
• Amendments to IAS 1: Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income. Effective for annual periods beginning on 
or after 1 July 2012. 
• Amendments to IAS 12 Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets. Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2012. 
• IFRIC 20: Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine. Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2013. 
The Group continues to monitor the potential impact of other new standards and interpretations which may be endorsed 
by the European Union and require adoption by the Group in future accounting periods. 

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Shanks Group plc and all its subsidiary 
undertakings (subsidiaries). Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group. Control exists where 
the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity in order to obtain benefits from its activities. 
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. 
Entities which are jointly controlled with another party or parties (joint ventures) are incorporated in the financial statements 
by proportional consolidation. A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds an interest under a contractual arrangement 
where the Group and one or more other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control. 
Subsidiary companies set up under PFI/PPP contracts are fully consolidated by the Group. 
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost or, in 
the case of a disposal of the majority shareholding, fair value. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against 
the carrying amount of the investment. An associate is an entity, other than a subsidiary or joint venture, over which the Group 

Shanks Group plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2012

Notes to the Financial Statements continued  
has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating decisions of an entity 
but is not in control or joint control over those policies. 
The results of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates acquired or sold during the year are included in the consolidated 
financial statements up to, or from, the date control passes. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses 
are eliminated on consolidation. Where a Group company transacts with a joint venture or associate of the Group, profits 
and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the relevant joint venture or associate. 

The acquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of acquisition is measured as the fair 
value of assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities 
assumed, meeting the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (Revised), are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition 
date. The fair value of businesses acquired may include customer lists, these are recognised as intangible assets, the value 
is calculated by discounting the future revenue stream attributable to these lists or relationships and they are amortised. 
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded 
as goodwill. The costs of acquisition are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. 

Revenue 
Revenue represents the fair value of consideration received or receivable, including landfill tax but excluding sales taxes, 
discounts and inter-company sales, for goods and services provided in the normal course of business. Revenue is recognised 
when processing occurs or when the goods and services have been provided to the customer. 
Income from electricity generated from gas produced by waste processes at landfill sites and anaerobic digestion facilities 
includes an estimation of the amount to be received. 
Revenue from the sale of recyclate materials is recognised, based on contractually agreed prices, when the risks and rewards 
have passed to the buyer, can be reliably measured and recovery of consideration is probable.  
Accrued income 
Accrued income is recognised at the fair value based on contractually agreed prices; it is subsequently invoiced and accounted 
for as a trade receivable. 
PFI/PPP contracts 
The Group’s PFI/PPP contracts are either integrated or residual waste management contracts. The contracts require the 
building of new infrastructure and all rights to the infrastructure pass to the Local Authority at the termination or expiry of the 
contract. The payments made to contractors for the construction of the infrastructure are accounted for as financial assets.  
The Group splits the local authority payment between a service element as revenue and a repayment element that is deducted 
from the financial asset. Interest receivable is added to the financial asset based on the rate implied in the contract payments. 
Reviews are undertaken regularly to ensure that the financial asset will be recovered over the contract life. 
Borrowing costs relating to contract specific external borrowings are expensed in the income statement. 
Bid costs are expensed in the Income Statement until the Group is appointed preferred bidder and there is a high probability 
that a contract will be awarded. Bid costs incurred after this point are capitalised within trade and other receivables. When the 
contract is awarded, the costs are included in the relevant financial asset. 
Win fees are transferred to deferred income upon financial close and released to the Income Statement over the period 
of construction of the infrastructure. 
Unprocessed waste 
The deferred income relating to unprocessed waste is calculated at the higher of sales value and processing cost. Where there 
is a significant delay between the acceptance of waste and its final disposal then profit may be recognised in advance of final 
disposal over the period of delay provided the outcome of the waste treatment process is certain. 
Government grants and subsidies 
Capital related government grants are released to the Income Statement evenly over the expected useful lives of the related 
assets. Revenue grants and subsidies are credited in the same period as the items to which they relate. 
Shanks Group plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2012
 continued 
Interest 
Interest is recognised on a time proportion basis, taking account of the principal outstanding and the effective rate over the 
period to maturity, when it is determined that such income will accrue to the Group. 

Deferred consideration is provided for at the net present value (NPV) of the Group’s expected cost or receipt at the date of 
acquisition or disposal. The likelihood of payment for deferred consideration conditional on meeting certain performance targets 
is considered on acquisition or disposal. For acquisitions after 1 April 2010, any differences between consideration accrued 
and consideration paid or received are charged or released to the Income Statement, before this date differences are adjusted 
through goodwill. 

Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets 
of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. 
Separately recognised goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
Any impairment is charged immediately to the Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units (CGUs) for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those 
CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to the date of transition to IFRS (31 March 2004) has been retained at the previous 
UK GAAP net book value following impairment tests. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not 
been reinstated. 
Landfill void 
When landfill operations are acquired, landfill void is capitalised based on the fair value of the void acquired and is amortised 
over its estimated useful life on a void usage basis. 
Other intangibles 
Other intangible assets are capitalised on the basis of the fair value of the assets acquired or on the basis of costs incurred 
to purchase and bring the assets into use. These are amortised over the estimated useful life on a straight-line basis, as follows: 
Computer software 1 to 5 years 
Acquisition related intangibles:  
Waste permits and licences 5 to 20 years 
Others including customer lists 5 to 10 years 
Impairment of assets 
Assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated in order to determine the extent of 
any impairment loss. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value 
in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value. If the recoverable amount is estimated to be less 
than the carrying amount the asset is reduced to the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately as an 
operating expense. 

Property, plant and equipment, except for freehold land, is stated at cost less depreciation and provision for impairment. 
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition 
for its intended use. Freehold land is not depreciated. 

Shanks Group plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2012

Notes to the Financial Statements continued  
Buildings, plant and machinery 
Depreciation is provided on these assets to write off their cost by equal annual instalments over the expected useful economic 
lives. The expected useful life of buildings is 25 to 50 years. Plant and machinery lives are as follows: 
Computer equipment 1 to 5 years 
Mobile plant 5 years 
Generation equipment 8 to 15 years 
Heavy goods vehicles 5 to 10 years 
Other items 3 to 20 years 
As required under IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, the Directors have undertaken a review of the residual value and the 
useful life of the Group’s Property, Plant and Equipment as at 31 March 2012. As a result of this review, the Group has revised 
upwards the estimated useful life of elements of Plant and Machinery with effect from 1 April 2012. As this is a change in 
accounting estimate the impact will be accounted for prospectively. 
Landfill sites 
Site development costs including engineering works and the discounted cost of final site restoration are capitalised. These costs 
are written off over the operational life of each site based on the amount of void space consumed. 

Finance leases 
Where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a leased asset, the lease is treated as a finance 
lease. Leased assets are included in property, plant and equipment at the total of the capital elements of the payments during 
the lease term and the corresponding obligation is included in payables. Depreciation is provided to write down the assets over 
the shorter of the expected useful life and the lease term. 
Operating leases 
All leases other than finance leases are treated as operating leases. Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the 
Income Statement in the year to which they relate. The obligation to pay future rentals on operating leases is shown in note 30 
to the accounts. 

Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost in the Company’s balance sheet, less any provision for impairment 
in value. 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value and are measured on a first in first out basis. 

Site restoration provision 
Full provision is made for the net present value, (NPV), of the Group’s unavoidable costs in relation to restoration liabilities at its 
landfill sites and this value is capitalised and amortised over the useful life of the site. In addition the Group continues to provide 
for the NPV of intermediate restoration costs over the life of its landfill sites and mineral extraction sites, based on the quantity of 
waste deposited or mineral extracted in the year. 
Aftercare provision 
Provision is made for the NPV of post closure costs at the Group’s landfill sites based on the quantity of waste deposited in the 
year. Similar costs incurred during the operating life of the sites are written off directly to the Income Statement and not charged 
to the provision. 
Other provisions 
Other provisions are recognised when a present legal or constructive obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past 
event and it is probable that this will result in an outflow of resources, the amount of which can be estimated reliably.  
Shanks Group plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2012
 continued Discounting 
All long-term provisions for restoration, aftercare and onerous leases are calculated based on the NPV of estimated future 
costs. The effects of inflation and unwinding of the discount element on existing provisions are reflected within the financial 
statements as a finance charge. The real discount factor currently applied is 2%. 

Retirement benefits 
The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under IAS 19 Employee Benefits. For defined benefit plans, obligations 
are measured at discounted present value whilst plan assets are recorded at market value. The operating and financing costs 
of the plans are recognised separately in the Income Statement and actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full through 
the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Surpluses on defined benefit plans are recognised only to the extent that they are 
recoverable. Movements in irrecoverable surpluses are recognised immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged to the Income Statement as they become due. The Group participates 
in several multi-employer schemes in the Netherlands. These are accounted for as defined contribution plans as it is not 
possible to split the assets and liabilities of the schemes between participating companies, and the Group has been informed 
by the schemes that it has no obligation to make additional contributions in the event that the schemes have an overall deficit. 
Share-based payments 
The Group issues equity-settled share-based awards to certain employees. The fair value of share-based awards is determined 
at the date of grant and expensed based on the Group’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest, with a corresponding 
increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The amount expensed is adjusted over the vesting period for 
changes in the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest, save for changes resulting from any market-related 
performance conditions. 

Current tax 
Current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before tax in the Income Statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years or that are never taxable or 
deductible. The liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the 
balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is recognised in full where the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the financial statements is different to the 
corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all 
taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the taxable profits 
will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that 
have been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited through 
the Statement of Comprehensive Income or directly to reserves, when it is charged or credited there. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set-off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities, when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle 
its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

 Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the year end exchange rate. 
Transactions and the results of overseas subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures in foreign currencies are translated at the 
average rate of exchange for the year and the resulting exchange differences are recognised in the Group’s exchange reserve. 
Cumulative exchange differences are recognised in the income statement in the year in which an overseas subsidiary 
undertaking is disposed of. 
The most significant currencies for the Group were translated at the following exchange rates:

Canadian Dollar 1.60 1.56 2.4% 1.59 1.56 1.7%
The Group applies the hedge accounting principles of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement relating 
to net investment hedging to offset the exchange differences arising on foreign currency denominated borrowings with 
the translation of foreign operations. Net investment hedges are accounted for by recognising exchange rate movements 
in the exchange reserve, with any hedge ineffectiveness being charged to the Income Statement in the period the 
ineffectiveness arises. 

Trade receivables 
Trade receivables do not carry interest and are stated initially at their fair value. The carrying amount of trade receivables 
is reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
Financial assets in PFI/PPP contracts 
Financial assets in PFI/PPP contracts are classified as loans and receivables and are initially recognised at the fair value of the 
consideration paid and subsequently amortised using the effective interest rate method. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with a maturity of three months or less. Where the Group 
has a legally enforceable right to offset with a financial institution, then bank overdrafts are offset against the cash balances. 
External borrowings 
Interest bearing loans and bonds are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including 
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the Income 
Statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the borrowings to the extent that 
they are not settled in the period in which they arise. 
Trade payables 
Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated initially at fair value. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group only holds or issues derivative financial instruments to manage the Group’s 
exposure to financial risk, not for trading or speculative purposes. 
Such financial risk includes: 
• Interest risk on the Group’s variable-rate borrowings; 
• Fair value risk on the Group’s fixed-rate borrowings; 
• Commodity risk in relation to diesel consumption and recyclate prices; and 
• Foreign exchange risk on transactions. 
The Group manages these risks through a range of derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, fuel 
derivatives, forward foreign exchange contracts and contingent forward foreign exchange contracts. 
Interest rate swaps entered into before 31 March 2009 are measured at fair value at each reporting date with gains or losses 
between period ends being taken to finance charges in the income statement. Interest rate swaps entered into after 31 March 
2009 are considered to be used for hedging purposes when it alters the risk profile of an underlying exposure of the Group in 
line with the Group’s risk management policies and is in accordance with established guidelines. 
Shanks Group plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2012
 continued At the inception of the hedge relationship the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged 
item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the 
inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a 
hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. 
The change in the fair value of the portion of the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised 
in equity and subsequently recycled to the Income Statement when the hedged cash flow impacts the Income Statement. 
The ineffective portion of the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the Income Statement. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies 
for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in 
equity until the forecast transaction occurs at which point it is recognised in the Income Statement. If a hedged transaction 
is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the Income Statement 
immediately. 
Details of the fair values of the derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 16. 
Other receivables and other payables 
Other receivables and other payables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Lease 
agreements in which the other party, as lessee, is regarded as the economic owner of the leased assets give rise to accounts 
receivable in the amount of the discounted future lease payments. 

Dividend distributions to the equity holders are recognised in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders in 
general meeting. 

The Group’s organisational structure reflects the national nature of markets in which it operates, with divisions in the 
Netherlands, Belgium, the UK and Canada.

Notes to the Financial Statements continued  

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. 
Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, actual results 
ultimately may differ from those estimates. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate 
is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if these are also affected. 
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity are set out below and in more detail in the related notes: 
 The Group believes that trading profit, underlying profit before tax, underlying profit after tax, underlying free cash flow, 
underlying earnings per share and EBITDA provide useful information on underlying trends to shareholders. These measures 
are used by the Group for internal performance analysis and incentive compensation arrangements for employees. 
The terms ‘trading profit’, ‘exceptional items’ and ‘underlying’ are not defined terms under IFRS and may therefore not be 
comparable with similarly titled profit measures reported by other companies. It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior 
to, GAAP measurements of profit. 
The term ‘underlying’ refers to the relevant measure being reported for continuing operations excluding exceptional items, 
financing fair value remeasurements and amortisation of acquisition intangibles, excluding landfill void and computer software. 
‘Trading profit’ is defined as continuing operating profit before amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional items. 
Reconciliations are set out in note 4. 

Items classified as non-trading and exceptional are disclosed separately due to their size or incidence to enable a better 
understanding of performance. These include, but are not limited to, significant impairments and the profit or loss on disposal 
of properties. 

Financial assets are recognised in accordance with IFRIC 12. They represent the present value of the future cash flows of the 
contract. These cash flows are dependent on, amongst other things, tonnages, indexation, recycling rates and labour costs. 

In conducting the impairment review on goodwill and intangibles, management is required to make estimates of discount rates, 
future profitability, growth rates and tax rates. Detailed descriptions of assumptions and values are given in note 13. 

Restoration and aftercare provisions are recognised in the financial statements at the net present value of the estimated future 
expenditure required to settle the Group’s restoration and aftercare provisions. A discount is applied to recognise the time value 
of money and is unwound over the life of the provision. Provisions also include the present value of the estimated operating 
losses on loss making contracts. Further information is set out in note 25. 

The Group operates defined benefit schemes for which actuarial valuations are carried out as determined by the trustees at 
intervals of not more than three years. The pension cost under IAS 19 is assessed in accordance with management’s best 
estimates using the advice of an independent qualified actuary and assumptions in the latest actuarial valuation. The principal 
assumptions in connection with the Group’s retirement benefit schemes are set out in note 26. 

The Group operates in the Netherlands, Belgium, the UK and Canada, all of which have their own tax legislation. Deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are recognised at the current tax rate which may not be the tax rate at which they unwind. The Group has 
available tax losses, some of which have been recognised as a tax asset and some have not based on management’s best 
estimate of the ability of the Group to utilise those losses. Further information is set out in note 18. 
Shanks Group plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2012
 Operating segments are based on the reports provided to the Board of Directors, the chief operating decision-maker. 
The Group operates in the Netherlands, Belgium, the UK and Canada. Each geographical location can be analysed according 
to the following types of activity: 
Solid Waste Non-hazardous solid waste collections, transfer, recycling and treatment 
Hazardous Waste Principally contaminated waste including industrial cleaning, transport, 
treatment (including contaminated soils) and disposal and contaminated land 
remediation 
Organics Anaerobic digestion and tunnel composting of source segregated organic 
waste streams 
UK Municipal - PFI/PPP Contracts Long-term UK municipal waste treatment contracts 
Landfill and Power Landfill disposal (including contaminated soils) and power generation from 
landfill gas 
Sand Quarry Mineral extraction 
In addition to the waste activities detailed above, the Group has small infrastructure and groundworks operations in Belgium 
and the Netherlands which, due to their small size, are reported as part of the Solid Waste activities. 
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in note 1, except that the pension 
expense for the UK is recognised and measured on the basis of cash payments to the pension plan. 
The profit measure the Group uses to evaluate performance is trading profit. Trading profit is operating profit before 
the amortisation of acquisition intangibles (excluding landfill void and computer software) and exceptional items. 
The Group accounts for inter-segment trading on an arm’s length basis.

The Group has recognised a charge of £2.0m following the loss of control and subsequent impairment of the investment in a 
joint venture arrangement. This was a result of difficulties in the construction of a biomass plant and changes in market 
conditions. The charge was the net impact of an impairment of a loan of £1.8m and deconsolidation of net assets of £0.2m 
including land and buildings, bank loans and derivatives. 
A gain of £1.6m (2011: £nil) has been recognised following the reassessment and settlement of contingent consideration in 
relation to an acquisition made in the UK in the year ended 31 March 2011. 
Changes in market conditions in the volumes delivered to and prices achieved in our small UK joint venture landfill have resulted 
in a goodwill impairment charge of £2.5m. The prior year impairment charge of £11.9m arose from changes in market 
conditions in wood based and landfill markets in Belgium and the Netherlands. 
In the prior year the Group recognised an exceptional gain of £3.7m net of associated taxes arising from the £24.6m sale of all 
of the subordinated debt and 80% of the equity in the East London Waste Authority and Dumfries and Galloway PFI contracts. 
An exceptional tax credit of £8.5m arose due to the partial release of provisions booked in March 2009 in respect of the 
abolition of Industrial Buildings Allowances relating to these contracts.  
With effect from 31 March 2011, the Group introduced a pensionable pay increase cap of 1% per annum that applies to the 
benefit that active non-local government section members can accrue in the scheme. This led to an exceptional credit of £3.9m 
in the prior year. 
The exceptional tax credit of £5.2m in the current period related to a favourable judgement issued with regard to certain tax 
liabilities in Belgium.

For the LTIP awards granted during the year the fair value of the element subject to non-market conditions has been calculated 
using a discounted model based on the share price at the award date. For the EPS performance element of these LTIP awards 
the expense recognised is based on expectations of these conditions being met and these are reassessed at each balance 
sheet date. 
Expected volatility has been calculated using average volatility historical data over a five year period from the grant date. 
The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield of zero-coupon government bonds with a remaining term equal 
to the expected life. The expected life used in the models equals the vesting period as employees are expected to receive 
their vested shares on vesting or soon after vesting.

The exceptional current tax credit of £5.2m in the current period related to a favourable judgement issued with regard to certain 
historic tax issues in Belgium. 
The exceptional deferred tax credit of £8.5m in the prior year related to the partial release of provisions booked in March 2009 
in respect of the abolition of Industrial Buildings Allowances. A detailed review of historic capital allowances on PFI infrastructure 
was performed which has been agreed with the taxation authorities.

The Directors believe that adjusting basic earnings per share for the effect of the amortisation of acquisition intangibles, 
(excluding landfill void and computer software), the change in value of interest rate swaps and exceptional items enables 
comparison with historical data calculated on the same basis. Exceptional items are those items that need to be disclosed 
separately on the face of the Income Statement, because of their size or incidence, to enable a better understanding 
of performance. 

As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own Income 
Statement for the year. Shanks Group plc reported a profit for the year ended 31 March 2012 of £23.5m (2011: £4.3m loss). 
The Company operates solely in the UK providing central services. The Company is registered in Scotland under company

of sales and £0.1 (2011: £nil) has been charged in administration expenses. 
Contingent consideration for the 2007 acquisition of Orgaworld in the Netherlands was reassessed in the current and prior year 
resulting in a decrease of £0.8m (2011: £1.7m) to goodwill. The outstanding contingent consideration is payable in May 2012. 
 
  

Shanks Group plc

Impairment testing is carried out at cash generating unit (CGU) level on an annual basis. A summary of goodwill by geographical 
area is presented below: 
 
2012
£m
2011
£m
Netherlands 202.4 212.8
Belgium 13.6 14.4
UK 16.3 18.8
 232.3 246.0
A significant part of the goodwill, £135.9m (2011: £144.3m), relates to the acquisition of the original business in the Netherlands 
in 2000. 
The Group estimates the recoverable amount of a CGU using a value in use model by projecting cash flows for the next five 
years from the annual strategy review together with a terminal value using a growth rate. Management determined the five year 
plan based on past performance and its expectation of market developments. All pre-tax cash flows are discounted at a pre-tax 
rate of 10%-11% based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC). As most CGUs have integrated operations 
across large parts of the Group this is considered appropriate for all parts of the business. The following rates are used: 
• Post-tax discount rate 7% (2011: 8%). Group WACC is equivalent to a pre-tax discount rate of 10%–11%. 
• Growth rate used in the annuity is 2% (2011: 2%). This does not exceed the long-term economic average growth of the 
countries that the Group operates in. 
The valuations indicated sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions would not result in an 
impairment of the related goodwill. 
 During the year there have been changes in market conditions in the volumes delivered to and prices achieved in our small UK 
joint venture landfill site and as a result there has been an impairment to the associated goodwill of £2.5m. No class of asset 
other than goodwill was impaired. 
In the prior year, the Group recognised an impairment provision of £11.9m in relation to the Netherlands and Belgium Solid 
Waste businesses. 
The net impairment losses recognised in the consolidated income statement within exceptional administrative expenses, 
in respect of goodwill and intangibles were as follows: 
 
2012
£m
2011
£m
Netherlands – Solid Waste – 7.9
Belgium – Solid Waste – 4.0
UK– Landfill 2.5 –
 2.5 11.9
There is no residual goodwill of the UK CGU after impairing the goodwill, there is residual goodwill of £14.2m (2011: £15.1m) 
and £0.2m (2011: £0.2m) in the Netherlands and Belgian CGUs respectively after impairing the goodwill to its recoverable 
amount in the prior year.

On 1 October 2011, the Group reclassified its investment in Valorbois SPRL from a joint venture to that of a trade investment 
due to the loss of joint control. Following reclassification the fair value of the investment and the loan to the joint venture 
arrangement were revalued to nil as reflected in the table above. 
On 15 December 2011, the Group purchased 49% of the share capital of HYGEA SCRL for a consideration of £0.6m. 
The remaining 51% is held by IDEA SCRL, an entity controlled by the participating Municipalities of the Walloon region 
of Belgium. As at 31 March 2012 HYGEA SCRL had only been trading for three months. As the results for the period were 
immaterial, no share of profit or loss has been included.

On 1 March 2012 Shanks acquired the business and assets of Van Tuijl Glasrecycling BV a glass recycling business 
based in the Netherlands. The intangible assets acquired were permits, the brand and a customer list totalling £0.8m. 
The residual excess over the net assets acquired has been recognised as goodwill representing the opportunity to access 
the glass recycling market.

been acquired on 1 April 2011 it would have contributed £2.9m to revenue and £0.1m to profit after tax. The contingent 
consideration is payable in two instalments (in 2014 and 2015) based upon achievement of projected cumulative EBITDA 
during the three years ending March 2015. The amount accrued of £1.7m represents the maximum amount payable under 
the contract. 
For acquisitions completed in the year ended 31 March 2011 there have been no amendments to the provisional values 
disclosed last year.

As at 31 March 2012, the Group had unused trading losses (tax effect) of £19.5m (2011: £16.2m) available for offset against 
future profits. A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £8.0m (2011: £6.3m) of such losses. No deferred tax 
asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining £11.5m (2011: £9.9m) due to the unpredictability of future profit streams. 
Tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely. 
No liability has been recognised on the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of 
subsidiaries. This is because the Group is in a position to control the timing and method of the reversal of these differences and 
it is probable that such differences will not give rise to a tax liability in the foreseeable future. 
As mentioned in note 9 there was an exceptional tax credit of £5.2m in the current period relating to a favourable judgement 
issued with regard to certain tax liabilities in Belgium. Following this decision, current and deferred tax balances have been 
reviewed and appropriately classified to reflect all remaining tax assets and liabilities.

The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation 
technique: 
• Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
• Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, 
either directly or indirectly; and 
• Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on 
observable market data. 
The fair values of the retail bond and senior notes are measured by discounting the future cash flows using observable market 
interest rate information as no similar instrument is available due to the specific profiles of the instruments. They are considered 
to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
The fair value of interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and fuel derivatives are determined by discounting 
the future cash flows using the applicable period-end yield curve. They are considered to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
None of the change in fair value of interest rate swaps is attributable to changes in the Group’s credit risk. 
The Group considers that the fair value of bank overdrafts and loans, trade and other payables and finance lease obligations 
are not materially different to their carrying value. 
The fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged 
item is more than one year and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity is less than one year. 
During the year ended 31 March 2012, there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements and no 
transfers into and out of level 3. 
 The Group is exposed to market risk (interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity price risk), liquidity risk and credit 
risk. Group Treasury is charged with managing and controlling risk relating to the financing and liquidity of the Group under 
policies approved by the Board of Directors. Group Treasury does not enter into speculative transactions.

Notes to the Financial Statements continued  
 The Group has continued to limit its exposure to interest rate risk by entering into a fixed rate retail bond of €100m, fixed rate 
senior notes and further interest rate swaps that fix a substantial part of the Group’s core borrowings. 
The debt relating to project finance non-recourse borrowings is at floating rates and the Group has entered into interest rate 
swaps. The interest rate swaps represent a hedge of the interest cash flows. The interest rate swaps entered into after 
31 March 2009 are accounted for under IAS 39 hedge accounting with changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps being 
recognised directly in reserves as they are effective hedges. Any other outstanding interest rate swaps have not previously 
been allocated as hedges by the Group and are therefore classified as held for trading in accordance with IAS 39. 
The interest rate swaps are presented in non-current liabilities or assets as they are related to long-term borrowings and the 
Group believes this best reflects the commercial reality of the instruments. Changes in interest rates could have a significant 
impact on banking covenants relating to interest cover and on the interest charge in the income statement. In order to measure 
the risk, borrowings and the expected interest cost for the year are forecast on a quarterly basis and scenarios run using 
management’s expectations of a reasonably possible change in interest rates. Interest expense volatility remained within 
acceptable limits throughout the year. The Group’s exposure has not significantly changed. 
The weighted average effective interest rates at the balance sheet dates were as follows:

Excluded from the analysis above is £7.5m (2011: £8.9m) of amounts payable under finance leases as set out in note 23, which 
are subject to fixed rates of interest. In addition, trade and other receivables and payables have been excluded as they are not 
interest bearing. 
The average term for short-term deposits is no more than three months.

A 1% movement has been applied to interest rates for the year ended 31 March 2012, representing management’s assessment 
of a reasonably possible change in interest rates (2011: 1%). The interest rate sensitivity is taken to occur from 31 March 2011 
and so the change in the fair value of the swaps is shown as an equity sensitivity which results in an increase of £14.5m 
(2011: £8.2m) for a 1% increase in interest rate and a decrease of £16.8m (2011: £9.3m) for a 1% decrease in rates.  
For the Company, there were £25.1m short-term deposits (2011: £11.8m) at an effective interest rate of 0.4% (2011: 0.6%). 
The effective interest rate on the Company’s cash and cash equivalents was nil% (2011: nil%). The weighted average effective 
interest rates relating to the Company were 2.5% (2011: 4.1%) for bank loans. Interest on inter-company loan balances 
are charged at rates of between 0% and 12% (2011: 0% and 12%). 

The Group operates in Europe and Canada and is exposed to foreign exchange risk for movements between the Euro, 
Canadian Dollar and Sterling. The majority of the Group’s subsidiaries conduct their business in their respective functional 
currencies; therefore there is limited transaction risk. Foreign exchange risk arises mainly from net investments in foreign 
operations. This exposure is reduced by funding the investments as far as possible with borrowings in the same currency. 
The Group applies hedge accounting principles to net investments in foreign operations and the related borrowings. 
The Group has designated the carrying value of Euro borrowings of £82.4m (2011: £87.1m) (fair value of £84.9m (2011: £84.2m)) 
as a net investment hedge of the Group’s investments denominated in Euros. The hedge was 100% effective for the year ended 
31 March 2012 (2011: 100%) and as a result the related exchange gain of £4.7m (2011: £0.3m loss) on translation of the 
borrowings into Sterling has been recognised in the exchange reserve. 
The Group mitigates some foreign exchange risk on financial assets arising in the UK through the use of forward exchange 
contracts.

Fuel price risk 
The Group is exposed to fuel price risk therefore management’s risk strategy aims to provide protection against sudden and 
significant increases in oil prices whilst ensuring that the Group is not competitively disadvantaged in a serious way in the event of a 
substantial fall in the price of fuel. It is expected that part of this risk can be off-set through customers paying fuel surcharges and 
recovery via escalation clauses linked to the price of fuel within contracts such as UK PFI/PPP. 
To meet these objectives the fuel risk management programme allows for the use of a number of derivatives available on the 
over-the-counter (OTC) markets with approved counterparties and within approved limits. The value of wholesale fuel covered 
by derivatives at 31 March 2012 amounted to £0.6m (2011: £nil). These fuel derivatives contracts have been designated as 
cash flow hedges against highly probable future fuel purchase forecasts to occur over the next six months. 
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of a reasonably possible change in fuel prices, with all other variables held constant:

Recyclate price risk 
The Group is exposed to recyclate price risk in its normal operations. The main commodities where the Group has exposure 
are paper, cardboard and ferrous metal. The Group de-risks part of this exposure by pass-through pricing and fixed price 
contracts. The Group has not entered into any recyclate price derivatives however this remains under regular review.

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations as they fall due. 
As well as term borrowings under a syndicated loan facility, the Group maintains uncommitted lending facilities with a range of 
banks for working capital purposes. The Group manages liquidity risk by monitoring forecast cash flows to ensure that facility 
draw-downs are arranged as necessary and an adequate level of headroom is maintained. The Group’s exposure to and the 
way it manages liquidity risk has not changed from the previous year.

The Group’s bank loans, retail bond and senior notes are unsecured but are subject to cross guarantees within the Group. 
Each PFI/PPP company has loan facilities which are secured by a legal mortgage over land and/or a fixed and floating charge 
over the assets of the PFI/PPP company. 

Shanks Group plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2012

Notes to the Financial Statements continued  
 Credit risk is the risk of financial loss where counterparties are not able to meet their obligations. 
Surplus cash, when not used to repay borrowings, is placed on deposit with banks and money market funds in accordance 
with a policy that specifies the minimum acceptable credit rating and the maximum exposure to each counterparty. At 31 March 
2012 the amount of credit risk totalled £59.8m (2011: £54.5m). 
Credit risk on derivatives where the fair value is positive is closely monitored to ensure that it remains within the limits set for 
each counterparty. At 31 March 2012 the credit risk was £0.1m (2011: £0.3m). 
Trade and other receivables mainly comprise amounts due from customers for services performed. Management consider that 
the exposure to any single customer is not significant and that where credit quality is in doubt, adequate provision has been 
made for probable losses. At 31 March 2012 the credit risk amounted to £158.0m (2011: £181.1m). The Group does not hold 
any collateral as security. 
The financial assets relating to PFI/PPP contracts are recoverable from the future revenues relating to these contracts. 
Management consider that as the counterparties for the future revenues are UK local authorities or councils, there is minimal 
credit risk. At 31 March 2012, the credit risk was £69.0m (2011: £51.8m). 

The Group has a funding strategy to ensure that the Group maintains an appropriate debt to equity ratio as well as an 
appropriate debt maturity profile. The strategy is based on the requirements of the Company’s Articles of Association, which 
state that debt should be limited to three times the level of capital and reserves. The Group’s funding strategy has not changed 
from the previous year. 
The Group has to comply with a number of banking covenants which are set out in the agreements for bank loans and senior 
notes. There are financial covenants which are measured using the performance of the core Group, excluding PFI companies 
and joint ventures, and relate to interest cover, the ratio of debt to EBITDA and the net worth of the Group. There are other 
restrictions in the loan documentation concerning acquisitions, disposals, security and other issues. The Group has complied 
with its banking covenants during the year.

At 31 March 2012, the Group’s bank financing was a €200m term loan and multicurrency revolving credit facility with six major 
banks entered into on 2 February 2011 and expiring in June 2015. At 31 March 2012, €67m (2011: €64m) equivalent of term 
loan was drawn in Euro and Canadian Dollars on a three month interest period plus €33m (2011: €36m) of the revolving credit 
facility. The remaining €100m represented committed funds available for drawing in Sterling, Euro or Canadian Dollars by way 
of a revolving credit facility on a maximum of three days notice or for ancillary derivative facilities. 
The senior notes issued under the Group’s Pricoa private placement include €18m at a fixed interest rate of 6.9% with 
repayment due in September 2013 and €40m of seven year senior notes issued in April 2011 at a fixed interest rate of 5.025%.  
The five year retail bonds of €100m, issued to Belgium and Luxembourg investors in October 2010 have an annual coupon of 
5.0% and are quoted on the London Stock Exchange.

 Site restoration provision as at 31 March 2012 related to the cost of final capping and covering of the landfill sites. The Group’s 
minimum unavoidable costs have been reassessed at the year end and the net present value fully provided for. These costs are 
expected to be paid over a period of up to 25 years from the balance sheet date and may be impacted by a number of factors 
including changes in legislation and technology. 
 Post-closure costs of landfill sites, including such items as monitoring, gas and leachate management and licensing, have been 
estimated by management based on current best practice and technology available. These costs may be impacted by a 
number of factors including changes in legislation and technology. The dates of payments of these aftercare costs are uncertain 
but are anticipated to be over a period of approximately 30 years from closure of the relevant landfill site. 

Other provisions principally cover onerous contracts, leases, warranties and indemnities. Onerous contracts are provided at the 
net present value of the operating losses of the onerous contracts. The provision is to be utilised over the period of the contract 
to which they relate which is up to 2029. Under the terms of the agreements for the disposal of the UK landfill and power and 
other UK operations, the Company has given a number of warranties and indemnities to the purchasers which may give rise to 
payments. The timing of expected outflows is uncertain therefore an estimate has been made and the majority of the provision 
has been classified as non-current.  
Included within other provisions is £8.7m (€10.5m) received during the year following a court decision in respect of a claim 
for business interruption in the Netherlands that occurred in 2002. The receipt of the amount was conditional on a parent 
company guarantee. The court’s decision has been appealed and the ultimate outcome of the case remains uncertain. 
Accordingly, the Directors believe the amount should be recorded within provisions until the ultimate outcome of the case 
is known with greater certainty.

*The comparative amounts have been restated. Further explanation of the restatement is included in note 1. 

The Group and Company’s principal pension scheme is the Shanks Group Pension Scheme which covers eligible UK 
employees and has both funded defined benefit and defined contribution sections. The Group also has one other small funded 
defined benefit scheme, which is included in the defined benefit disclosures below. Pension costs for the defined benefit section 
are determined by an independent qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method. 

The valuation has been based on a full assessment of the liabilities of the scheme as at 5 April 2009 updated by independent 
qualified actuaries to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 Employee Benefits in order to assess the liabilities of these 
schemes at 31 March 2012. The main assumptions were as follows: 
 
2012
% p.a
2011
% p.a
Discount rate 4.8 5.6
Future salary growth (non-Local Government Passport Section members) 1.0 1.0

Rate of increase in pensions payment (cap 2.5%) 2.2 2.2
Rate of price inflation 3.4 3.6
Consumer price inflation 2.4 2.7
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements. 
The assumptions are that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 22 years if they are male and for 
a further 24 years if they are female. For a member who retires in 2027 at age 65 the assumptions are that they will live on 
average for around a further 24 years after retirement if they are male or for a further 26 years after retirement if they are female. 
The assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible 
actuarial assumptions.

The overall expected rate of return on scheme assets is 5.9% (2011: 6.9%) and is a weighted average of the expected rates 
of return on each asset class. The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on 
pension plan assets. Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns 
consistent with widely accepted capital market principles. The assumed long-term rate of return on each asset class is set 
out in the table above. The overall expected rate of return is derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class 
over the actual asset allocation for the schemes as at 31 March 2012. 
At 31 March 2012 the IAS 19 net retirement deficit was £7.6m (2011: £4.9m surplus). The amount of the liability varies if the 
main financial assumptions change, particularly the discount rate. If the discount rate increased or decreased by 0.25%, the  
IAS 19 liability would increase or decrease by circa £1.9m.

 In the Netherlands, employees are members of either a multi-employer pension scheme or other similar externally funded 
schemes. These schemes are treated as defined contribution plans as it is not possible to separately identify the Group’s share 
of the assets and liabilities of those schemes. The Group has been informed by the schemes that it has no obligation to make 
additional contributions in the event that the schemes have an overall deficit. In Belgium, the Group operates small defined 
contribution schemes. The total cost in the year for overseas pensions was £9.9m (2011: £8.7m).

Provision is made for the Directors’ best estimate of all known claims and all legal actions in progress. The Group takes legal advice 
as to the likelihood of success of claims and actions and no provision is made where the Directors consider, based on that advice 
that the action is unlikely to succeed or a sufficiently reliable estimate of the potential obligation cannot be made. 
Under the terms of the sale agreement with Terra Firma for the disposal of the Group’s landfill and power operations in 2004, the 
Group gave a number of indemnities and warranties relating to the disposed operations for which appropriate provisions are held. 
At the start of the year the Group held a provision of £3.1m (€3.5m) relating to a claim from authorities for operating outside of 
permitted volumes in the period 1997 to 1999 at a location in the Netherlands. During the year, the court issued a decision that 
£5.9m (€7.1m) was payable. An appeal against the decision has been lodged. The Directors believe that no further amount should 
be provided at this stage as the outcome of the appeal process is uncertain and the provision of £2.9m (€3.5m) established 
remains appropriate. The claim relates to the period prior to the acquisition of the Netherlands group of companies in 2000 and 
accordingly any payment to the authorities may be recoverable from the previous owners under the sale and purchase agreement. 
Any such recovery represents a contingent asset at 31 March 2012 and no receivable for a potential payment from the previous 
owners will be recorded until its receipt is virtually certain. 
The Company and certain subsidiaries have, in the normal course of business, given guarantees and performance bonds relating to 
the Group’s contracts totalling £52.6m (2011: £40.6m). In addition, the Company has contingent liabilities in respect of both VAT 
and HM Revenue & Customs group payment arrangements of £0.2m (2011: £0.2m). 
The Company has given guarantees in respect of the Group’s subsidiary undertakings’ borrowing facilities totalling £88.8m 
(2011: £90.8m). 

The Group’s joint ventures have no significant contingent liabilities or assets. 


A list of the Company’s principal subsidiaries is set out in note 33. Transactions with subsidiaries relate to interest on 
intercompany loans and management charges. Net interest expense was £5.5m (2011: £7.5m) and management charges 
received were £3.8m (2011: £3.8m). Total outstanding balances are listed in notes 21 and 24. 
 Key management comprises the Board of Directors and the managing directors of the country operations. The disclosures required

Shareholder Information Shanks Group plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2012


Shareholders may elect to receive future shareholder documents and information by email or via the Company’s website.

Shareholder information will be made available by way of publication on the website. Shareholders have the following options: 
Option A. Receive email notiﬁcation that documents and information are available on the Shanks Group plc website. 
You may choose this option by registering your email address at www.etreeuk.com/shanksplc. (You will require your Shareholder

In recent years many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited telephone calls or 
correspondence concerning investment matters. These are typically from overseas based ‘brokers’ who target UK shareholders 
offering to sell them what often turns out to be worthless, high risk or non-existent shares. 
They can be very persistent and extremely persuasive. It is not just the novice investor who has been duped in this way; 
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company 
reports. While high proﬁts are promised, those who buy and sell shares in this way usually lose their money.

If you are offered unsolicited investment advice, you should take these steps before handing over any money:
• Make sure you get the name of the person and organisation contacting you;
• Check the FSA Register at www.fsa.gov.uk/fsaregister to ensure they are authorised;
• Use the details on the FSA Register to contact the ﬁrm;
• Call the FSA Consumer Helpline on 0845 606 1234 if there are no contact details on the Register or you are advised they are 
out of date or complete an online form at www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/doing/regulated/law/alerts/form.shtml;
• The FSA also maintains on its website a list of unauthorised overseas ﬁrms who are targeting, or have targeted UK investors; and
• Inform our Registrars on 0870 707 1290. 
If you use an unauthorised ﬁrm to buy or sell shares or other investments, you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman 
Service or Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) if things go wrong.
REMEMBER: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!

If you are approached about a share scam you should tell the FSA using the fraud reporting form at www.fsa.gov.uk/scams, 
where you can also ﬁnd out about the latest investment scams or call the Consumer Helpline on 0845 606 1234.
Details of any sharedealing facilities that the Company endorses will be included in Company mailings. 
More detailed information on this or similar activity can be found on the FSA website www.moneymadeclear.org.uk.

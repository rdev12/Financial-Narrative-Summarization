2015 has been a mixed year for general insurers but one 
with 	 dev elopments 	 which 	 I 	 believ e 	 will 	 help 	 the 	 Group	
progress in future years.
In 	 Motor , 	 there 	 ha v e 	 been 	 positiv e 	 signs 	 that 	 r ates 	 are	
impro ving, 	 f ollowing 	 a 	 challenging 	 claims 	 en vironment.	 
The 	 Go v ernment 	 a nnouncement 	 that 	 it 	 will 	 end 	 the 	 right	 
to 	 cash 	 compensation 	 f or 	 minor 	 whiplash 	 injuries 	 a nd 	 r aise	
the upper limit for the small claims court is positive and  
we 	 will 	 be 	 working 	 with 	 the 	 Go v ernment 	 to 	 ensure 	 this	 
is implemented effectively.
In 	 Home, 	 pressure 	 remains 	 on 	 pricing 	 as 	 competitors	 
look to enter the market or maintain their market share 
and 	 profitability 	 has 	 been 	 aff ected 	 a cross 	 the 	 industry 	 b y	
the 	 sev ere 	 weather 	 ev ents 	 seen 	 la te 	 in 	 the 	 y ea r .
Our performance
T urning 	 to 	 our 	 results 	 in 	 more 	 detail, 	 despite 	 these	
challenging 	 mark et 	 conditions 	 we 	 ha v e 	 deliv ered 	 a 	 tr ading	
profit	 of 	 £92.3 	 million. 	 Gross 	 written 	 premiums 	 increased	
to 	 £550.3 	 million 	 a s 	 a 	 result 	 of 	 the 	 growth 	 of 	 in-force	
policies 	 to 	 o v er 	 two 	 million 	 a nd 	 an 	 increa se 	 in 	 r ates.	 
The 	 Group 	 is 	 f ocused 	 on 	 its 	 underwriting 	 performance	 
and continues to expand its footprints in Motor and  
Home to offer more customers our excellent products  
and services.

esure Group Annual Report 2015
4 Chairman’s statement What is happening with Solvency II?
W e 	 completed 	 our 	 final	 prepar ations 	 f or 	 the 	 introduction	 
of 	 Solv ency 	 II 	 in 	 2015, 	 which 	 came 	 into 	 force 	 on 	 1 	 J anuary	
2016. Our insurance business has a good capital position that 
is appropriate for our strategic plans in 2016 and beyond. 
What do the changes to payments for whiplash  
claims mean for esure Group?
The Government proposals announced in October should  
end 	 the 	 right 	 to 	 cash 	 compensation 	 f or 	 minor 	 whiplash 	 injuries	
and look to raise the upper limit for the small claims court  
for 	 personal 	 injury 	 claims 	 from 	 £1,000 	 to 	 £5,000. 	 These 	 mo v es	
will 	 ensure 	 tha t 	 those 	 who 	 a re 	 injured 	 continue 	 to 	 receiv e	
appropriate 	 treatment 	 a nd 	 will 	 help 	 deter 	 those 	 individuals	
who 	 a ttempt 	 to 	 defr aud 	 insurers. 	 This 	 is 	 welcome 	 news	 
and 	 the 	 changes, 	 which 	 are 	 due 	 to 	 come 	 into 	 f orce 	 in 	 201 7 ,	
should 	 mean 	 significant	 cost 	 sa vings 	 f or 	 consumers	
purchasing motor insurance.
What has been happening to motor prices?
The 	 r ating 	 cy cle 	 in 	 gener al 	 insur ance, 	 in 	 particular 	 motor ,	
has 	 a 	 significant	 impact 	 on 	 the 	 industry 	 and 	 has 	 finally 	
started to improve. We have remained disciplined 
throughout 	 2015, 	 increasing 	 prices 	 as 	 we 	 look 	 to 	 mitiga te	
rising claims costs. The signs are positive and esure Group 
is 	 well 	 placed 	 to 	 ma ximise 	 the 	 opportunities 	 the 	 impro ving	
r ate 	 en vironment 	 will 	 bring.

Q&A
W e 	 were 	 delighted 	 to 	 complete 	 the 	 acquisition 	 of	
Gocompare.com 	 in 	 March 	 and 	 I 	 am 	 pleased 	 with 	 progress	 
so far . The relaunch of Gio Compario has already reinvigorated 
the 	 br and 	 and 	 our 	 attention 	 now 	 turns 	 to 	 deliv ering 	 growth	
across all product lines in the future.
Our 	 goal 	 is, 	 as 	 ev er , 	 to 	 pro vide 	 a 	 good 	 lev el 	 of 	 return 	 f or	
shareholders 	 and 	 I 	 am 	 pleased 	 to 	 confirm	 the 	 B oard 	 ha s	
recommended 	 a 	 final	 dividend 	 of 	 7.3 	 pence 	 per 	 share.	 
This 	 together 	 with 	 the 	 interim 	 dividend 	 of 	 4.2 	 pence 	 tak es	
the full year dividend to 11.5 pence per share representing  
a 	 pa y out 	 r a tio 	 of 	 70% 	 of 	 underlying 	 profit	 af ter 	 tax.	 
The 	 pa y out 	 reflects	 our 	 str ategy 	 of 	 retaining 	 capita l 	 when	 
we 	 see 	 good 	 growth 	 opportunities. 	 Through 	 reta ining 	 profit, 	 
the 	 Group 	 rema ins 	 well 	 capitalised 	 and 	 is 	 well 	 positioned	 
f or 	 this 	 growth.
Our Board
As 	 Cha irman 	 of 	 the 	 B oard, 	 I 	 am 	 committed 	 to 	 ensuring	 
the highest levels of governance and expertise. Our Board 
continues to do an excellent job of providing leadership and 
o v erseeing 	 the 	 direction 	 of 	 the 	 business 	 and 	 I 	 would 	 lik e	 
to take this opportunity to thank them all for their input.
D uring 	 the 	 y ea r 	 we 	 ha v e 	 seen 	 a 	 number 	 of 	 changes	
including the departures of Dame Helen Alexander and 
Anthon y 	 Hobson, 	 both 	 of 	 whom 	 stepped 	 down 	 a t 	 our 	 AGM,

as 	 CEO 	 of 	 M& G 	 In v estments. 	 I 	 would 	 lik e 	 to 	 thank 	 them	 
for their support over the years; they have been invaluable 
in offering guidance and challenge. As a result of Dame Helen 
Alexander 	 stepping 	 down, 	 Shirley 	 Garrood, 	 a 	 member 	 of 	 the	
B oard 	 since 	 2013, 	 w as 	 appointed 	 as 	 the 	 Senior 	 Independent

2015 has been a year of steady progression on our strategic

Chief 	 Ex ecutiv e 	 Officer ’ s 	 statement
esure Group Annual Report 2015
6 What other strategic developments  
is the business working on?
We are looking at a number of areas of strategic development 
that aim to grow our customer base, increase profits  
and deliver our strategy of increased shareholder value.  
These include digital and self serve capability, further 
automation of our systems, how we can best use data  
to assist customers, and our multicar proposition. 
What is your outlook for 2016?
2016 will no doubt bring fresh challenges; however , I am 
confident in our business model. With our strategic initiatives 
coming into force, a focus on great customer service, 
diversification opportunities in Gocompare.com, plus  
a motivated workforce I believe esure Group will continue  
to deliver profitable growth over the medium-term  
and long-term to our shareholders.
What is your underwriting footprint  
expansion initiative?
The Group has historically targeted around 40% of the 
market in home and motor insurance. We believe with 
our high level of underwriting and pricing expertise  
we are well positioned to expand our appetite to new 
customers in a controlled and measured way.

People
Investment in our people is fundamental to our success and 
we aim to make esure Group a great place to work for all of 
our colleagues. Our people strategy is built upon a competitive 
reward and benefits package, a high level of colleague 
engagement, and career progression.
Everyone from our front-line staff to colleagues in support  
and specialist areas is important in ensuring we meet 
customers’ needs and during 2015 we partnered with Willis 
Towers Watson to survey every member of staff to find out 
their views on working at the Group, which has given us an 
excellent level of insight. Going forward, this will be 
undertaken on a yearly basis.
Outlook
We are in a strong position to deliver on our strategic 
objective of growing our insurance business and to take 
advantage of the opportunities presented through an improving 
Motor market. 2016 has got off to a good start and we  
expect to deliver gross written premium growth of 10-15% 
and policy growth of 4-6%. The combined operating ratio in 
Motor and Home is expected to be in the region of 97-98%. 
Gocompare.com is already benefitting from our full ownership 
and we expect the business to achieve an increase in 
profitability of 20-30% in 2016.
Summary
Looking back over 2015, we have progressed well against  
our strategic priorities. Looking ahead, we are now in  
a strong position for this year and thereafter . I would like  
to thank our customers, shareholders and colleagues for  
their continued support.
Stuart Vann
Chief Executive Officer
Our commitment to innovation is demonstrated in the launch 
of the midata initiative, which enables consumers to make 
meaningful comparisons on current accounts based on their 
own experience. This is an industry first which no other 
comparison site offers.
Gocompare.com’s comparison services are run on an 
independent basis, ensuring that it continues to be a highly 
regarded partner for the insurance industry, along with its 
other business partners.
Motor
In Motor , we have seen growth in written premiums and 
customer numbers. Competition has remained high but we 
have been able to implement rate increases, which we expect  
to continue to do in 2016. Latterly in the year , we launched 
further growth initiatives which will see us quoting for a more 
diverse selection of risks, meaning we will be able to provide 
cover for more motorists.
Home
Our Home customer base and premium income have 
remained steady year-on-year as we have chosen not to 
grow this line of business whilst pressure on rates continues. 
We insure over 500,000 homes across the UK, and similarly 
to Motor , we are in the early days of expanding our  
footprint and in future will be offering competitive prices  
for more households.
We had a small number of customers affected by the storms 
at the end of the year and exposure was relatively limited  
for us. We have focused on ensuring our customer claims 
are dealt with quickly and with an excellent level of care.
Customer
Customer service remains high on the agenda and as we 
evolve we look for ways to constantly improve our customer 
experience. Our retention rate of 80% shows a high level  
of satisfaction amongst our customers as they choose to stay 
with the Group year-on-year and continue to benefit from 
our good value, high quality products. This year , we have 
introduced a new Net Promoter Score
TM
, which measures 
customer satisfaction, and provides insightful information  
on which to build our proposition in 2016 and beyond.

10 Our business model and strategy Our strategy
The esure Group strategy has  
been designed to deliver increased 
shareholder value across three 
pilla rs 	 with 	 a n 	 o v er arching 	 theme	
of trying to make things simple  
for our customers.
Underwriting focus
esure Group takes a disciplined approach to risk selection 
based 	 on 	 careful 	 management 	 of 	 underwriting 	 risk 	 exposure.	
This 	 is 	 supplemented 	 through 	 data 	 enrichment 	 and 	 anti-fr aud	
controls. 	 The 	 business 	 targets 	 a 	 positiv e 	 underwriting	
contribution, 	 and 	 our 	 underwriting 	 f ocus 	 is 	 supplemented	 
b y 	 an 	 ef ficient	 expense 	 base.
Revenue diversification
esure Group derives income from a range of revenue streams 
across its insurance and price comparison businesses.  
This includes the provision of additional insurance products 
and services that complement the core Motor and Home 
insur ance 	 products, 	 along 	 with 	 income 	 deriv ed 	 f rom 	 the	
investment portfolio.
The acquisition of the remaining 50% of Gocompare.com  
in March 2015 provides further opportunities for income 
div ersification.
Targeted growth
esure 	 Group 	 has 	 a 	 r ange 	 of 	 opportunities 	 to 	 grow 	 across 	 its	
businesses in insurance and in price comparison services.
In 	 insur ance, 	 the 	 business 	 has 	 appro ximately 	 a 	 5%	 
mark et 	 share 	 of 	 the 	 motor 	 insur ance 	 mark et 	 in 	 the 	 UK	 
and approximately 2% of the home insurance market.  
Ma rk et 	 share 	 has 	 been 	 achiev ed 	 f rom 	 a 	 rela tiv ely 	 narrow	 
risk 	 selection 	 where 	 historically 	 we 	 ha v e 	 quoted 	 for 	 around	
40% 	 of 	 the 	 UK 	 motor 	 and 	 home 	 insur ance 	 mark ets.	 
There 	 are 	 growth 	 opportunities 	 within 	 our 	 current 	 risk	 
criteria 	 and, 	 f urthermore, 	 we 	 are 	 widening 	 our 	 risk 	 a ppetite	 
to offer competitively priced insurance products to  
a broader range of customers.
The 	 Group 	 targets 	 growth 	 when 	 the 	 en vironment 	 allows	 
f or 	 profitable	 growth, 	 balancing 	 this 	 with 	 discipline 	 at 	 other	
times 	 within 	 the 	 r ating 	 cy cle.
In 	 price 	 comparison, 	 there 	 are 	 a 	 number 	 of 	 opportunities	 
to 	 grow 	 Gocompare.com’ s 	 ma rk et 	 share 	 in 	 motor 	 and 	 home	
insur ance 	 comparison 	 services 	 alongside 	 growth 	 outside 	 these	
mark ets. 	 Growth 	 in 	 non-insur ance 	 sectors 	 is 	 a n 	 important 	 part	
of 	 the 	 str ategy 	 and 	 medium-term 	 growth 	 ambitions.
Making things simple
We recognise that insurance can sometimes be complicated 
and 	 confusing. 	 Theref ore, 	 a 	 k ey 	 f ocus 	 for 	 us 	 as 	 our 	 business	
evolves is to ensure all our products and services are easy  
to 	 understand 	 and 	 we 	 are 	 an 	 organisation 	 that 	 is 	 simple	 
to 	 deal 	 with. 	 W e 	 know 	 we 	 can 	 impro v e 	 and 	 work 	 is 	 ongoing	
across many aspects of our business.
A major part of our Gocompare.com proposition is helping 
consumers 	 understand 	 not 	 just 	 insur ance 	 but, 	 across 	 a 	 wide	
r a nge 	 of 	 products, 	 wha t 	 suits 	 them 	 best. 	 That ’ s 	 wh y	
Gocompare.com 	 w as 	 the 	 first	 comparison 	 site 	 to 	 include	
product features not just price.
B ut 	 we 	 don’t 	 just 	 stop 	 there. 	 W e 	 know 	 that 	 we 	 can 	 do 	 more	
and 	 there 	 are 	 a 	 number 	 of 	 str ategic 	 initia tiv es 	 underw a y	
that 	 will 	 mak e 	 dealing 	 with 	 the 	 Group 	 ev en 	 easier 	 f or	
our customers.

despite 	 a 	 reduction 	 in 	 the 	 Group’ s 	 underwriting 	 and	
in v estment 	 perf ormance, 	 largely 	 as 	 a 	 result 	 of 	 the 	 £63.8m	
joint venture deemed disposal gain. The Group incurred  
an effective tax rate (inclusive of deferred tax) of 9.0% 
(2014: 20.2%) primarily as a result of the tax treatment  
on 	 the 	 joint 	 v enture 	 deemed 	 disposal 	 gain. 	 The 	 UK 	 corpor ation	
tax 	 r ate 	 changed 	 f rom 	 21% 	 to 	 20% 	 with 	 effect 	 from	 
1 April 2015.
Underlying 	 profit	 after 	 tax 	 of 	 £68.2m 	 (2014: 	 £85.6m) 	 reflects 	
the Group’s net of tax position after adjusting for the Group’s 
joint venture deemed disposal gain and amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets. The Group incurred an effective 
tax rate on an underlying basis of 17.7% (2014: 20.2%).
Earnings per share
Earnings per share increased by 48.0% to 29.3 pence  
(2014: 19.8 pence) despite a reduction in the Group’s 
underwriting 	 a nd 	 in v estment 	 perf orma nce, 	 which 	 were 	 more

16.4 pence (2014: 20.5 pence) after adjusting for the Group’s 
joint venture deemed disposal gain and amortisation  
of acquired intangibles.
Dividend per share
The 	 B oard 	 has 	 proposed 	 a 	 fina l	 dividend 	 of 	 7.3 	 pence 	 per	
share, 	 which 	 together 	 with 	 the 	 interim 	 dividend 	 of 	 4.2 	 pence	
per 	 share, 	 tak es 	 the 	 full 	 y ear 	 dividend 	 to 	 11.5 	 pence 	 per	
share. The full year dividend of 11.5 pence per share 
represents an annualised payout ratio of 70% of the Group’s 
underlying 	 profit	 af ter 	 tax. 	 The 	 pa y out 	 r a tio 	 comprises	 
a base dividend of 50% and a special dividend of 20%.
When 	 setting 	 the 	 special 	 dividend, 	 the 	 B oard 	 considers 	 the	
Group’ s 	 capita l 	 requirements, 	 prospectiv e 	 premium 	 growth	
expectations and retains a prudent margin for contingencies.

recognised for PPOs and potential PPOs in the consolidated 
statement 	 of 	 financial	 position 	 represents 	 less 	 than 	 5%	 
of net claims outstanding at 31 December 2015.
D ue 	 to 	 the 	 inherent 	 uncertainties 	 in 	 reserving, 	 the 	 Group	
adopts a prudent approach to reserving through reserving  
in excess of the actuarial best estimate. Over time the 
inherent uncertainties in the actuarial best estimate reduce 
and the Group releases the margin above the best estimate. 
The Group’s current reserve margin is comfortably in excess 
of its actuarial best estimate.
The 	 Group 	 benefitted	 f rom 	 strong 	 f a v our able 	 dev elopment	 
of 	 prior 	 accident 	 y ear 	 reserv es, 	 with 	 total 	 prior 	 y ear 	 releases	
of £56.8m in 2015 (2014: £90.0m). The favourable 
development represents 11.4% of net earned premium 
(2014: 18.3%).
Reinsurance
The Group purchases reinsurance as a risk transfer 
mechanism to mitigate risks that are outside the Group’s 
appetite for individual claim or event exposure and to reduce 
the volatility caused by large individual and accumulation 
losses. 	 B y 	 doing 	 so , 	 the 	 Group 	 protects 	 its 	 capita l 	 and 	 the	
underwriting 	 result 	 of 	 both 	 Motor 	 a nd 	 Home.
Currently , 	 the 	 Group 	 has 	 in 	 place 	 non-proportional 	 ex cess	 
of loss reinsurance programmes for its Motor and Home 
underwriting 	 a ctivities. 	 The 	 purpose 	 of 	 these 	 progr ammes	 
is 	 to 	 pro vide 	 co v er 	 f or 	 both 	 individua l 	 large 	 losses, 	 for 	 Motor	
and 	 Home, 	 and 	 accumulation 	 losses 	 a rising 	 from 	 natur al	 
and other catastrophe events for Home. Motor reinsurance 
treaties 	 a re 	 in 	 place 	 co v ering 	 all 	 y ears 	 in 	 which 	 the 	 Group

esure Group’s people strategy is built upon a competitive 
rew ard 	 a nd 	 benefits	 packa ge, 	 a 	 high 	 lev el 	 of 	 colleague	
engagement, 	 opportunities 	 to 	 grow 	 and 	 dev elop 	 and 	 ex cellent	
internal 	 communications. 	 The 	 Group 	 philosoph y 	 is, 	 that 	 b y	
making 	 esure 	 a 	 great 	 place 	 to 	 work, 	 our 	 colleagues 	 will 	 be	
best placed to deliver an excellent customer experience.
Financially , 	 the 	 Group 	 is 	 committed 	 to 	 rew arding 	 our	
colleagues for the value that they bring to the Group  
and 	 the 	 service 	 they 	 deliv er 	 to 	 our 	 customers. 	 This 	 y ear ,	 
we 	 ha v e 	 tak en 	 the 	 opportunit y 	 to 	 review 	 our 	 rew ard 	 packa ge	
to 	 ensure 	 tha t 	 it 	 is 	 competitiv e 	 in 	 the 	 mark et, 	 consistent,	
tr ansparent 	 a nd 	 easy 	 f or 	 colleagues 	 to 	 understand 	 with	 
a clear link to performance and behaviours. It is not just  
wha t 	 colleagues 	 deliv er 	 that 	 is 	 important, 	 it 	 is 	 also 	 how	 
they deliver to customers.
W e 	 off er 	 a 	 r a nge 	 of 	 benefits	 to 	 colleagues 	 including 	 profit 	
share, 	 v oluntary 	 benefits,	 sala ry 	 sacrifice	 schemes 	 including	
childcare, 	 cy cle 	 to 	 work, 	 car 	 parking, 	 computers 	 a nd	 
mobile 	 phones, 	 sea son 	 tick ets 	 loans, 	 long 	 service 	 a w a rds	 
(f or 	 colleagues 	 who 	 ha v e 	 been 	 with 	 esure 	 f or 	 10 	 and 	 15 	 y ears)	
and discounts on Group insurance products.
We also operate an esure Group sharesave plan enabling 
members of staff to invest in the business through share 
ownership 	 at 	 80% 	 of 	 mark et 	 v a lue. 	 In 	 2015, 	 391 	 colleagues	
in v ested 	 in 	 this 	 scheme, 	 which 	 w a s 	 a 	 19% 	 increa se 	 on 	 the	
number 	 of 	 applica nts 	 in 	 2014. 	 This 	 y ea r 	 we 	 a lso 	 opened 	 the	
scheme to colleagues in Gocompare.com as they became  
part of the esure Group in April 2015.
The executive team is interested in all feedback from our 
colleagues 	 and 	 this 	 y ear 	 we 	 partnered 	 with 	 Willis 	 T owers	
W atson 	 to 	 run 	 the 	 first	 esure 	 wide 	 colleague 	 engagement	
survey. 92% of our colleagues participated in that survey  
and 	 our 	 o v er all 	 engagement 	 score 	 w as 	 70%. 	 R esults 	 were	
shared 	 fa ce-to-f ace 	 with 	 all 	 colleagues 	 a nd 	 action 	 plans	 
ha v e 	 been 	 built 	 to 	 look 	 at 	 how 	 we 	 can 	 continually 	 impro v e.	
The feedback supports the development of our commitment 
to 	 be 	 a 	 great 	 place 	 to 	 work 	 and 	 we 	 will 	 continue 	 to 	 seek	
colleague 	 views 	 on 	 an 	 annual 	 basis.
The Group looks to recognise colleagues regularly for going 
the 	 extr a 	 mile 	 and 	 deliv ering 	 ex cellent 	 customer 	 service, 	 and	
in 	 our 	 oper ational 	 areas 	 we 	 hold 	 recognition 	 ev ents 	 annually	
for these colleagues.
The 	 Group 	 is 	 proud 	 that, 	 in 	 our 	 view , 	 we 	 emplo y 	 some 	 of	 
the most ambitious and committed colleagues in the insurance 
industry. We aim to offer development opportunities to all  
our 	 colleagues, 	 starting 	 with 	 our 	 induction 	 progr amme 	 f or	 
all 	 new 	 colleagues 	 through 	 to 	 more 	 f ormalised 	 dev elopment	
programmes in our operations and claims teams.
The 	 Chief 	 Ex ecutiv e 	 Of ficer	 sponsors 	 our 	 talent 	 dev elopment	
progr amme, 	 which 	 is 	 tailored 	 f or 	 different 	 lev els 	 of 	 colleagues	
in our business. The programme provides the opportunity  
f or 	 colleagues 	 to 	 learn 	 from 	 senior 	 leaders 	 within 	 the 	 business,	
dev elop 	 new 	 skills, 	 identif y 	 career 	 opportunities, 	 and 	 helps	
esure 	 strengthen 	 its 	 talent 	 pool, 	 skills 	 and 	 capabilit y .
The 	 well-being 	 of 	 our 	 colleagues 	 is 	 a lso 	 centr al 	 to 	 our	
e m p l o y e e 	 proposition. 	 This 	 y ear , 	 we 	 launched 	 a 	 comprehensiv e

colleagues 	 and 	 their 	 f amilies, 	 and 	 we 	 also 	 introduced 	 f ree	 
flu	 v a ccinations.	
Engagement
W e 	 are 	 committed 	 to 	 ex cellent 	 communications 	 with 	 a ll	
colleagues. 	 A t 	 least 	 twice 	 a 	 y ear , 	 our 	 Chief 	 Ex ecutiv e 	 Officer 	
and 	 the 	 ex ecutiv e 	 team 	 share 	 compan y 	 news 	 through 	 a 	 series	
of 	 f ace-to-f ace 	 colleague 	 briefings	 a cross 	 all 	 of 	 our 	 locations.	
Each 	 briefing	 pro vides 	 an 	 opportunit y 	 f or 	 staff 	 to 	 understand	
our strategy and performance but also to ask questions  
of the senior management team.
Our people

esure Group Annual Report 2015 Risk management
Risk management and principal risks
The 	 B oard 	 is 	 responsible 	 for 	 prudent 	 o v ersight 	 of 	 esure 	 Group ,	
ensuring 	 that 	 it 	 is 	 conducted 	 in 	 a ccordance 	 with 	 sound	
business 	 principles 	 and 	 with 	 applica ble 	 la w 	 and 	 regulation.	
This encompasses responsibility to articulate and monitor 
adherence 	 to 	 quantifiable	 a nd 	 measur able 	 statements 	 of	 
the Board’s appetite for exposure to all risk types. The Board 
also ensures that measures are in place to provide effective 
and 	 objectiv e 	 assur ance 	 on 	 the 	 identifica tion	 and 	 management	
of risk and on the controls in place to mitigate those risks.
In 	 order 	 to 	 set 	 boundaries 	 to 	 the 	 accepta nce 	 of 	 risk 	 exposures,	
the 	 B oard 	 has 	 set 	 out 	 the 	 following 	 str ategic 	 risk 	 statements	
that 	 underpin 	 our 	 risk 	 appetite 	 and 	 how 	 the 	 Group 	 oper ates	
(see 	 table 	 below).
The Board has set a robust risk management strategy as  
an integral element in its pursuit of business objectives and  
in 	 the 	 f ulfilment	 of 	 its 	 obligations 	 to 	 shareholders, 	 regula tors,	
customers and staff.
The 	 Group’ s 	 risk 	 management 	 f r amework 	 and 	 ORS A	
processes 	 are 	 proportionate 	 to 	 the 	 risks 	 that 	 we 	 fa ce 	 and	 
are organised around the core elements of risk strategy and 
appetite, 	 risk 	 go v erna nce, 	 a nd 	 the 	 associated 	 risk 	 reporting.
The 	 Group’ s 	 risk 	 management 	 f r amework 	 is 	 dynamic 	 and	
continues to be enhanced and developed to ensure it meets 
the needs of the business.
Risk strategy and appetite
The Group’s risk appetite incorporates a range of quantitative 
and qualitative measures of risk supporting our strategic  
risk 	 objectiv es, 	 against 	 which 	 the 	 actual 	 or 	 planned 	 exposures	
and 	 uncertainties 	 can 	 be 	 monitored. 	 This 	 monitoring 	 is 	 reflected 	
in regular reporting to the Group Executive Committee  
and the Board Risk Committee.
The 	 risk 	 a ppetite 	 f orms 	 a 	 f undamental 	 part 	 of 	 the 	 w a y 	 the	
Group 	 thinks 	 a bout 	 and 	 assesses 	 risk, 	 setting 	 out 	 the 	 t ypes	
and 	 lev el 	 of 	 risk 	 that 	 it 	 is 	 willing 	 to 	 accept 	 or 	 a v oid 	 in 	 the	
pursuit 	 of 	 the 	 str ategy . 	 These 	 are 	 considered 	 within 	 our	
strategic decisions and business planning but also form  
a 	 critical 	 element 	 in 	 the 	 w a y 	 that 	 we 	 think 	 about 	 risk 	 within	
the 	 business. 	 This 	 ensures 	 that 	 our 	 staff 	 understand 	 how	 
their 	 da y -to-da y 	 decisions 	 support 	 the 	 risk 	 appetite 	 and	
strategic risk objectives. This feedback ensures that our  
risk 	 appetite 	 is 	 cascaded 	 and 	 embedded 	 within 	 the 	 Group .
Risk reporting
The 	 risk 	 management 	 f r amework 	 is 	 designed 	 to 	 ensure 	 that	
the Risk Committee receives timely and appropriate reporting 
on our exposure to existing and emerging risks in each of  
the 	 core 	 risk 	 categories 	 – 	 insur a nce, 	 mark et, 	 counterpart y	
credit, 	 oper ational, 	 regulatory 	 and 	 liquidit y . 	 Str ategic 	 risks	 
and the reputational consequences of these risk exposures  
are 	 considered 	 within 	 this 	 risk 	 reporting.
Such reporting is supported by:
• Updates 	 to 	 the 	 Group’ s 	 risk 	 registers 	 co v ering 	 current	 
and emerging risks
• Reports on events that have resulted in actual or potential 
financial	 or 	 reputational 	 losses 	 to 	 the 	 Group 	 or 	 its 	 customers
• The 	 results 	 of 	 stress, 	 scenario 	 and 	 sensitivit y 	 testing 	 as 	 well 	 as	
the 	 modelling 	 of 	 our 	 risks 	 within 	 our 	 economic 	 capital 	 model	
• The 	 findings,	 recommendations 	 and 	 management 	 a ctions	
arising 	 f rom 	 reviews 	 conducted 	 b y 	 the 	 risk, 	 compliance	 
and Internal Audit functions
A key strength of the Group’s risk management strategy is the 
integration of risk assessment and evaluation into the Group’s 
business 	 oper ations, 	 planning 	 a nd 	 capita l 	 management.

oper ates 	 a 	 “three 	 lines 	 of 	 defence” 	 go v ernance 	 f r amework.	
This is set out on page 24. The Group’s risk governance

Viability statement
In 	 a ccordance 	 with 	 pro vision 	 C.2.2 	 of 	 the 	 UK 	 Corpor ate	
Governance Code 2014 the Directors have assessed the 
Group’ s 	 prospects 	 and 	 viabilit y 	 f or 	 the 	 three- y ear 	 period	 
to 	 31 	 D ecember 	 2018, 	 taking 	 into 	 account 	 the 	 Group’ s	 
current position and the potential impact of the principal  
risks as detailed in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 27.  
This 	 is 	 based 	 on 	 the 	 Own 	 Risk 	 and 	 Solv ency 	 A ssessment	 
as 	 described 	 within 	 the 	 Risk 	 Section 	 on 	 pages 	 22 	 to 	 27;	 
the 	 report 	 on 	 this 	 process 	 w as 	 submitted 	 to 	 the 	 UK 	 financial 	
services 	 regulator , 	 the 	 PRA.
This assessment encompasses business planning as a central 
estimate and variability derived from both the stress and 
scenario testing and risk modelling. The Directors consider  
this to be a robust process for assessing the current and  
future principal risks facing the Group.
In making this statement the Board carried out a robust 
assessment 	 of 	 the 	 principal 	 risks 	 f acing 	 the 	 Group , 	 including	
those 	 that 	 would 	 threaten 	 its 	 business 	 model, 	 f uture	
perf ormance, 	 solv ency 	 or 	 liquidit y .
The assessment period of three years has been chosen  
as 	 it 	 is 	 in 	 line 	 with 	 our 	 business 	 planning 	 horiz on 	 and 	 f or	 
the 	 following 	 reasons:
• W e 	 ha v e 	 an 	 annual 	 renew al 	 cy cle; 	 which 	 mea ns 	 that 	 three

threaten 	 the 	 business 	 model, 	 f uture 	 perf ormance 	 or 	 the 	 solv ency/liquidit y:	
Principal risks
Insurance Risk
Risk Impact Mitigation and management
Underwriting risk from 
pricing strategy – the risk  
of an inappropriate pricing 
strategy could lead to 
business 	 being 	 written 	 at	
uneconomic rates and result 
in 	 lower 	 than 	 expected	
profitability . 	 This 	 could 	 be	
driven by internal pricing 
changes or changes  
in the rating environment 
within 	 the 	 mark et.
If the Group’s general pricing 
strategy is not managed 
correctly , 	 it 	 could 	 result 	 in	 
an unintended change in the 
Group’ s 	 risk 	 profile,	 mark et	
share and loss ratio.
The Group continues to monitor developments through 
regular sensitivity testing of the key variables affecting 
loss 	 performance, 	 including 	 loss 	 r atios, 	 risk 	 mix, 	 pricing,	
quote 	 con v ersion, 	 renew al 	 retention 	 r a tios, 	 claims	
costs, 	 claims 	 f requency 	 and 	 the 	 a dequacy 	 of 	 reserv es.
Action regarding these risks is taken in an integrated 
approach 	 between 	 the 	 ex ecutiv e 	 team, 	 underwriting,	
claims and risk management.
There is strong and regular monitoring in place to 
understand and react to the changing market rating 
en vironment, 	 ensuring 	 that 	 we 	 are 	 well 	 placed 	 to	 
benefit	 f rom 	 an y 	 mo v ements.
Underwriting risk from 
claims costs – the risk that  
a material increase in claims 
costs could negatively  
af fect 	 the 	 Group’ s 	 financial 	
performance. This includes 
risks arising from adverse 
claims 	 litigation 	 outcomes,	
increases in frequency of 
PPOs and potential changes 
to the Ogden discount rate.
An unplanned deterioration  
in 	 the 	 loss 	 r atio , 	 arising	 
f r o m 	 i nflation	 in 	 claims	 
costs beyond planned  
and achievable increases  
in premiums.
Loss ratio risk is managed through a robust claims 
management process and regular monitoring and 
sensitivity testing of the key variables affecting loss 
perf ormance, 	 including 	 risk 	 mix, 	 pricing 	 relativ e 	 to 	 the	
mark et, 	 quote 	 con v ersion 	 and 	 renew al 	 retention 	 r a tios,	
claims 	 costs, 	 claims 	 f requency 	 and 	 the 	 a dequacy	 
of reserves.
Reserving risk – the risk  
that 	 insufficient	 funds 	 ha v e	
been set aside to settle and 
handle historic claim amounts 
as they fall due.
Adverse development  
in prior year reserves  
resulting in deterioration  
of 	 financial	 perf ormance.
We have a prudent approach to reserving risk – 
the Group’s actuarial function analyses and projects 
historical claims development data and uses a number 
of actuarial techniques to test and forecast claims 
pro visions. 	 In 	 a ddition, 	 the 	 Group 	 a lso 	 pro vides 	 data	
to 	 independent 	 external 	 actuaries 	 who 	 assess 	 the	
adequacy of the Group’s claims provisions.
Apart 	 from 	 historica l 	 analysis, 	 the 	 Group 	 also 	 tak es	 
into 	 account 	 changes 	 in 	 risk 	 profile	 and 	 underwriting	
policy 	 conditions, 	 changes 	 in 	 legislation 	 or 	 regulation	
and changes in other external factors (including 
assumptions on PPOs) and potential changes  
to the Ogden discount rate.
Financial Risk
Financial risk – the risk  
that 	 inaccur a te 	 financial 	
estimates or judgements  
could misrepresent our 
financial	 position 	 (including	
capital) and change  
key strategic decisions.
The 	 prepar ation 	 of 	 financial 	
information requires 
management to make 
judgements, 	 estimates 	 a nd	
assumptions. Actual results 
may differ from these 
e s t i m a t e s , 	 which 	 could 	 aff ect	
key business decisions.
The 	 Group 	 reviews 	 financial	 estimates 	 and 	 underlying	
assumptions 	 on 	 a n 	 ongoing 	 basis, 	 taking 	 into 	 account	
changes 	 in 	 underwriting 	 conditions, 	 changes 	 in	
legislation 	 or 	 regulation, 	 and 	 mark et 	 mo v ements.
Ultimately , 	 the 	 o v ersight 	 of 	 the 	 Group’ s 	 material	
financial	 estimates 	 and 	 judgements 	 resides 	 with	 
the Audit Committee.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Risk management and principal risks continued
Market Risk
Risk Impact Mitigation and management
Market risk from 
investment activity –  
the risk that a negative 
financial	 impact 	 a rises 	 from	
holdings 	 in 	 interest 	 r ate,	
currency 	 and 	 equit y 	 products,	
all 	 of 	 which 	 are 	 exposed	 
to 	 gener al 	 a nd 	 specific 	 
market movements.
Cha nges 	 in 	 UK 	 interest 	 r ates	
or investment markets have 
an impact on the return on 
the market valuation of the 
Group’s investment portfolio.
Our investment strategy does not expose the Group  
to material currency risk or the risks arising from active 
trading of derivatives. Market risk is managed through 
regular 	 monitoring, 	 including 	 the 	 driv ers 	 of 	 in v estment	
return 	 and 	 v alue 	 at 	 risk 	 measures, 	 counterpart y	
exposures and interest rate sensitivities.
Default risk from 
investment counterparty –  
the risk that an investment 
counterpa rt y 	 will 	 not 	 be 	 able	
to 	 pa y 	 a mounts 	 in 	 f ull 	 when	
due 	 in 	 a ccordance 	 with	 
the 	 term 	 of 	 the 	 contr act,	
causing the Group to incur  
a 	 financial	 loss.
Defaults from investment 
counterparties affect both  
the 	 income 	 from, 	 and 	 mark et	
v a lua tion 	 of , 	 the 	 Group’ s	
investment portfolio.
The Group manages the level of investment counterparty 
credit risk it accepts by placing limits on its exposure  
to a single counterparty or correlated counterparties. 
Such 	 risks 	 are 	 subject 	 to 	 regular 	 review 	 b y 	 the	
Investment Committee.
Credit Risk
Credit risk from 
reinsurance counterparty –  
the largest counterparty  
credit 	 risk 	 we 	 are 	 exposed	 
to relates to reinsurers.  
This risk arises if they are  
not able to pay amounts in 
f ull 	 when 	 due 	 in 	 a ccordance	 
with 	 the 	 terms 	 of 	 the	
contr act, 	 ca using 	 the 	 Group	
to 	 incur 	 a 	 financial	 loss.
Reinsurance counterparty 
defaults reduce the protection 
provided through our prudent 
reinsurance structure.  
This 	 will 	 ha v e 	 a 	 direct 	 impact	
on the reinsurance asset  
and earnings in the year  
of 	 default. 	 In 	 a ddition, 	 the	
reduction in the level of 
reinsurance due to the default 
may increase the volatility in 
earnings in subsequent years.
The 	 creditworthiness 	 of 	 reinsurers 	 is 	 managed 	 on	 
an 	 annual 	 basis 	 b y 	 reviewing 	 their 	 financial	 strength	
prior 	 to 	 finalisation	 of 	 an y 	 contr act.
In 	 a ddition, 	 management 	 assesses 	 the 	 creditworthiness	
of 	 historic 	 reinsur ance 	 protection 	 b y 	 reviewing 	 credit	
grades provided by rating agencies and other publicly 
a v ailable 	 information, 	 as 	 well 	 as 	 the 	 concentr ation	 
risk 	 within 	 diff erent 	 reinsurers/reinsur a nce 	 groups.
An analysis of reinsurers by Standard & Poor’s  
a n d 	 A M 	 B e s t 	 r atings 	 is 	 produced 	 a nd 	 reviewed	 
on a quarterly basis.
Conduct Risk
Conduct risk – the risk  
w e 	 conduct 	 our 	 activities,	
c u l t u r a l l y 	 and 	 oper ationally ,	 
in a manner that  
is disadvantageous  
to our clients and cause  
them detriment.
Potentially resulting in 
reputational issues and 
regulatory 	 fine/censure.
Our culture and tone from the top ensures the interests 
of our customers and their fair treatment are paramount.
W e 	 ha v e 	 a 	 strong 	 go v ernance 	 f r amework 	 and 	 our	
Conduct 	 Risk 	 a nd 	 Customer 	 Committee 	 reviews 	 all	
aspects of our customer service.
B oa rd 	 o v ersight 	 is 	 ensured 	 b y 	 upw ard 	 reporting 	 of 	 a 	 suite	
of customer and conduct risk appetite statements  
and measures.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk – the risk  
that 	 the 	 Group , 	 although	
solv ent, 	 does 	 not 	 ha v e	
a v ailable 	 suf ficient	 financial 	
resources to enable it to meet 
its obligations as they fall  
due or can only secure them 
at excessive cost.
A reduction in liquidity  
could have an impact on our 
abilit y 	 to 	 meet 	 our 	 financial 	
commitments as they fall due 
or restrict our ability to pay 
dividends to shareholders.
The Group continues to monitor its liquidity risk by 
considering 	 its 	 oper ating 	 cash 	 flows,	 stressed 	 f or	
catastrophe 	 scenarios, 	 dividend 	 pa y outs, 	 liquidit y	 
strains and investment strategy to mitigate this risk. 
The Group also considers the matching of the 
in v estment 	 portf olio 	 with 	 its 	 insur ance 	 liabilities	 
to mitigate and manage this risk.
Oversight of the Group’s investment strategy and  
the associated liquidity risk is undertaken by the 
Investment Committee.
Legal and Regulatory Risk
Regulatory or legal 
intervention or changes –  
the risk that legal or 
regulatory reforms could  
have a negative impact  
on 	 the 	 Group’ s 	 financial 	
performance or position.
There are a number of 
ongoing and future regulatory 
reviews 	 of 	 the 	 gener al	
insurance retail sector . These 
reviews 	 could 	 ha v e 	 an 	 impact	
on the revenue streams that 
we 	 currently 	 ha v e 	 in 	 place	 
and future revenue streams.
The Group continues to monitor legal and regulatory 
dev elopments 	 in 	 the 	 UK 	 and 	 Europe, 	 through 	 our 	 close	
rela tionship 	 with 	 our 	 regulators 	 (the 	 FCA 	 and 	 PRA)	 
and 	 other 	 of ficial	 bodies 	 and 	 the 	 use 	 of 	 proactiv e 	 risk	
management tools and processes to mitigate our 
exposure to regulatory risk.
esure Group Annual Report 2015
26 Operational Risk
Risk Impact Mitigation and management
Financial crime – the risk that 
there is a significant increase  
in losses through crime.
Increased exposure to actual 
or attempted financial crime 
activity could result in 
financial loss, reputational 
impact or regulatory 
intervention.
A range of preventative, monitoring and detective 
controls are in place to combat such fraudulent 
activity at the key points of entry – policy inception 
and claims.
The monitoring and mitigation of financial crime  
is managed by the Group’s financial crime team 
supported by the rest of the business.
Information security – the risk 
of compromise to the integrity, 
confidentiality or availability  
of customer or staff personal 
information, or of commercially 
sensitive information including  
the risk from cyber attacks such 
as Distributed Denial of Service 
(DDoS) attacks.
This could have a detrimental 
impact on our customers or 
staff, on the reputation of the 
Group, or on our profitability 
and investor confidence. 
There is also the potential 
for regulatory intervention 
or fines resulting from such 
a compromise.
The Group has robust systems in place to mitigate 
such risks, including perimeter firewalls and 
intrusion detection systems, anti-virus protection, 
laptop encryption, logical and physical access 
restrictions, rigorous vetting of new and existing 
staff and a clear desk policy. The Group carries out 
training and these controls are rigorously enforced.
Systems failure – the risk that 
the current systems fail to deliver 
the expected performance.
The failure or degradation  
of our key platforms 
(including websites from 
which the majority of new 
business is sourced), 
compromise of corporate data 
or , in particular , the personal 
data with which we are 
entrusted and material 
performance failures by key 
infrastructure suppliers.
The Group has systems monitoring and incident 
management processes in place to mitigate this risk.
A key element to the prevention of this risk is a robust 
change management programme, which is subject 
to rigorous project management disciplines from 
programme development through to deployment.
The Group has a reportable events process  
that reports and manages any systems failure, 
which is reported to the Board Risk Committee.
Price comparison websites –  
the Group, both directly  
and through its subsidiary 
Gocompare.com, is dependent  
on the UK price comparison 
market for new business and 
growth. This is a highly 
competitive, but concentrated, 
market in which the dynamics 
could change materially.  
This could impact both 
Gocompare.com and the car  
and home insurance market.
The impact of this could  
be a material reduction  
in new customers to esure  
or a reduction in conversion 
volumes on Gocompare.com. 
This could be caused by 
disruption in the market by 
competition, new technology, 
changes to consumer 
behaviour or regulation.
As part of the business strategy the insurance 
business continues to retain a high proportion  
of renewal business and further developed its 
offerings to these customers.
Gocompare.com continues to develop the range  
of products and services it offers to customers. 
This section together with the reports set out on pages 1 to 27 of the Annual Report constitute the Strategic Report.

The Board of Directors
The 	 B oard 	 currently 	 comprises 	 eight 	 members: 	 The 	 Chairman,	
two 	 Ex ecutiv e 	 D irectors 	 and 	 fiv e	 Non-Ex ecutiv e 	 D irectors.
The 	 Chairman, 	 P eter 	 W ood, 	 ha s 	 serv ed 	 in 	 this 	 role 	 since	 
2000 	 and, 	 on 	 appointment, 	 w as 	 not 	 independent. 	 Of 	 the 	 fiv e 	
Non-Ex ecutiv e 	 D irectors:
• Shirley 	 Garrood, 	 Maria 	 D olores 	 D anca usa, 	 Ma rtin 	 Pik e	 
and 	 Angela 	 Seymour - Ja ckson 	 are 	 considered 	 b y 	 the 	 B oard	 
to 	 be 	 independent 	 f or 	 the 	 purposes 	 of 	 the 	 UK 	 Corpor a te	
Governance Code
• Peter Ward has served on the Board for more than nine 
y ears 	 f rom 	 the 	 date 	 of 	 his 	 first	 election, 	 but 	 is 	 considered	 
by the Board to be independent for the purposes of the  
UK 	 Corpor ate 	 Go v ernance 	 Code, 	 notwithstanding 	 the	 
length of his service.
In reaching this conclusion regarding the independence  
of 	 P eter 	 W ard, 	 the 	 B oa rd 	 has:
• considered 	 the 	 requirements 	 of 	 the 	 UK 	 Corpor ate	
Governance Code and the nature of the relationships  
and 	 circumstances 	 outlined 	 abo v e 	 which 	 are 	 relev ant	 
to the Board’s determination of independence
• evaluated the historic contribution of this Director to the 
Group 	 in 	 scrutinising 	 the 	 perf ormance 	 of 	 management,	
monitoring the reporting of performance and constructively 
challenging and assisting the development of the Group’s 
proposals on strategy.
In addition to the assessment of independence pursuant  
to 	 the 	 UK 	 Corpor ate 	 Go v ernance 	 Code, 	 the 	 B oa rd 	 also	
believes that the ongoing involvement of Peter Ward as a  
Non-Ex ecutiv e 	 D irector 	 is 	 in 	 the 	 best 	 interests 	 of 	 the 	 Group	
and 	 shareholders, 	 bearing 	 in 	 mind 	 his 	 extensiv e 	 experience	
and 	 deta iled 	 knowledge 	 of 	 the 	 business.
The 	 Group 	 therefore 	 considers 	 that 	 it 	 complies 	 with 	 the	
relev ant 	 requirements 	 of 	 the 	 UK 	 Corpor a te 	 Go v ernance	 
Code in relation to the balance of Executive and independent 
Non-Ex ecutiv e 	 D irectors 	 on 	 the 	 B oard 	 and 	 with 	 the

pages 	 30 	 to 	 31. 	 F ollowing 	 a 	 f ormal 	 perf orma nce 	 ev aluation,	
the Board has concluded that each Director’s performance 
continues to be effective and that the Directors continue to 
demonstr ate 	 commitment 	 to 	 the 	 role 	 and, 	 a ccordingly , 	 the	
Board recommends that shareholders approve the resolutions 
to be proposed at the 2016 Annual General Meeting relating 
to 	 the 	 re-election 	 or 	 election 	 of 	 the 	 D irectors.

In 	 undertaking 	 its 	 responsibilities, 	 the 	 Committee 	 concentr ated	 
on 	 fiv e	 main 	 areas.
1 Financial reporting
With 	 support 	 and 	 input 	 f rom 	 the 	 external 	 auditor , 	 the 	 Committee	
has 	 challenged 	 and 	 reviewed 	 the 	 fina ncia l	 reporting 	 for 	 the	
Group , 	 and 	 assessed 	 whether 	 suitable 	 accounting 	 policies 	 ha v e	
been 	 adopted, 	 whether 	 management 	 has 	 made 	 a p p r o p r i a t e	
estimates 	 and 	 judgements 	 and 	 whether 	 disclosures 	 in 	 this 	 Annual

Corporate Governance continued
esure Group Annual Report 2015
36 The Group’s control environment underpins the integrity  
of 	 the 	 financial	 statements. 	 The 	 Committee 	 has 	 considered	
reports 	 from 	 the 	 Chief 	 Risk 	 Officer ,	 Internal 	 A udit 	 function 	 and	
external auditor to satisfy itself that the control environment 
supporting 	 the 	 financial	 statements 	 is 	 properly 	 designed	 
and operating effectively.
Significant	 financial	 judgements 	 a nd	 
financial	 reporting 	 f or 	 2015
As 	 part 	 of 	 its 	 work 	 in 	 the 	 y ear , 	 the 	 A udit 	 Committee, 	 on 	 beha lf	
of 	 the 	 B oard, 	 has 	 reviewed 	 the 	 Annual 	 R eport 	 and 	 Financial	
Statements, 	 the 	 Interim 	 R eport 	 and 	 Financial 	 Statements,	 
and 	 the 	 Group’ s 	 significant	 annual 	 regulatory 	 returns.
In 	 doing 	 this, 	 the 	 A udit 	 Committee 	 has 	 considered 	 v a rious	
issues 	 and 	 discussed 	 how 	 these 	 are 	 a ddressed:
Claims outstanding
After 	 discussion 	 with 	 management 	 a nd 	 the 	 external 	 auditor ,	
the 	 Committee 	 determined 	 that 	 the 	 most 	 significant 	
judgement 	 relating 	 to 	 the 	 Group’ s 	 financial	 statements 	 is 	 the	
estimation 	 of 	 claims 	 outstanding, 	 which 	 comprise 	 pro visions	
for the cost of settling all claims incurred but not settled  
at 	 the 	 balance 	 sheet 	 date, 	 whether 	 reported 	 or 	 not, 	 and	
including related reinsurance recoveries and claims handling 
expenses. 	 The 	 Group’ s 	 policy 	 is 	 to 	 hold 	 suf ficient	 pro visions	 
to 	 meet 	 all 	 liabilities 	 a s 	 they 	 f all 	 due, 	 inclusiv e 	 of 	 a 	 margin,	 
by reference to the Board approved risk appetite.
Whilst 	 considering 	 this 	 issue, 	 the 	 Committee 	 receiv ed 	 reports	
and presentations from the internal and external actuary 
(Willis 	 T owers 	 W atson), 	 with 	 the 	 results 	 of 	 the 	 external 	 actuary	
being considered as part of the second line of defence.
The 	 Committee 	 a lso 	 meets 	 with 	 the 	 Chief 	 Actuary 	 at 	 least	
once 	 a 	 y ea r 	 without 	 management 	 present. 	 T wo 	 such	
meetings 	 were 	 held 	 in 	 2015.
The 	 Committee 	 cha llenged 	 and 	 debated 	 the 	 process, 	 k ey	
judgements and assumptions supporting the internal actuary’s 
best 	 estimate 	 projection, 	 including 	 a 	 r a nge 	 of 	 sensitivities	 
and possible alternative scenarios and explanations for any 
significant	 differences 	 compa red 	 with 	 the 	 projections	
undertaken by the external actuary.
The Committee noted the inherent uncertainties associated 
with 	 reserving 	 f or 	 certain 	 t ypes 	 of 	 claim. 	 F actors 	 such 	 as	
changes 	 in 	 the 	 legal 	 en vironment, 	 results 	 of 	 litigation,	
propensit y 	 of 	 personal 	 injury 	 claims, 	 cha nges 	 in 	 medica l	 
and 	 care 	 costs, 	 and 	 costs 	 of 	 v ehicle 	 and 	 home 	 repairs 	 ca n	 
all 	 substantially 	 af fect 	 o v er all 	 costs 	 and 	 expenses 	 of 	 claims,	 
and cause a material divergence from the basis and 
assumptions 	 on 	 which 	 the 	 reserv es 	 were 	 calculated.	 
In 	 a ddition, 	 the 	 Committee 	 ga v e 	 specific	 consider ation	 
to the Group’s approach to reserving for claims subject  
to periodic payment orders (“PPOs”) and the reserves 
associated 	 with 	 the 	 a dv erse 	 weather 	 ev ents 	 in 	 la te 	 2015	 
and 	 are 	 sa tisfied	 that 	 the 	 reserv es 	 are 	 appropriate.
Ma nagement 	 confirmed	 to 	 the 	 Committee 	 that 	 they 	 remain	
satisfied	 that 	 claims 	 outstanding 	 included 	 in 	 the 	 financial 	
statements provide an appropriate margin over projected 
ultimate claims costs.
The Committee also received and debated reports from  
both 	 the 	 externa l 	 and 	 internal 	 auditors 	 including 	 a 	 follow -up	
on 	 the 	 prior 	 y ear’ s 	 claims 	 reserv es 	 review 	 which 	 pro vided	
additional 	 challenge 	 and 	 assur ance 	 around 	 the 	 work	
undertak en 	 b y 	 both 	 the 	 internal 	 a nd 	 external 	 actuary ,	
including 	 an 	 assessment 	 of 	 their 	 competence, 	 capabilities	 
and 	 objectivit y 	 and 	 the 	 go v ernance 	 around 	 the 	 end-to-end	
reserving process.
The 	 externa l 	 auditor 	 explained 	 to 	 the 	 Committee 	 the 	 work	 
it 	 had 	 conducted 	 during 	 the 	 y ear , 	 including 	 how 	 its 	 audit	
procedures 	 were 	 f ocused 	 on 	 those 	 areas 	 of 	 cla ims 	 outstanding	
that involve the most judgement. On the basis of its audit 
work, 	 the 	 external 	 auditor 	 reported 	 no 	 inconsistencies	 
or 	 material 	 misstatements 	 in 	 the 	 context 	 of 	 the 	 financial 	
statements, 	 and 	 in 	 the 	 Committee’ s 	 view 	 this 	 supports	 
the appropriateness of the Group’s reserving methodology 
and valuation.
After 	 further 	 discussion 	 a nd 	 debate, 	 the 	 Committee 	 agreed	
that 	 the 	 internal 	 and 	 externa l 	 reserv e 	 projections 	 were	 
equally appropriate and supportable projections and that  
the 	 differences 	 between 	 them 	 were 	 reasonable 	 in 	 the 	 context	
of the overall size of the reserves.
Having considered and challenged the results of the internal 
reserving 	 review 	 compa red 	 with 	 the 	 independent 	 external	
review 	 and 	 reports 	 from 	 both 	 the 	 internal 	 and 	 external 	 auditor ,	
the Committee concluded that the Group’s outstanding claims 
reserves are appropriate and include a reasonable margin 
above the internal actuary’s best estimate.
Other matters
The 	 Committee 	 a lso 	 considered 	 a 	 number 	 of 	 less 	 significant 	
issues, 	 including 	 the 	 acquisition 	 accounting, 	 disclosure 	 a nd	
regulatory reporting relating to the Group’s acquisition of 
Gocompare.com 	 Holdings 	 Limited, 	 changes 	 to 	 the 	 Group’ s	
capita l 	 management 	 disclosures 	 which 	 will 	 be 	 required	
f ollowing 	 Solv ency 	 II 	 implementation 	 on 	 1 	 January 	 2016 	 and	
new 	 accounting 	 standa rds 	 and 	 interpretations 	 ef fectiv e	 
in 	 the 	 y ea r , 	 including 	 the 	 adoption 	 of 	 IFRIC 	 21.
The Group has in place arrangements to ensure that the 
Annual 	 R eport, 	 tak en 	 as 	 a 	 whole, 	 is 	 f air , 	 balanced 	 and	
understa ndable 	 and 	 pro vides 	 shareholders 	 with 	 the 	 information	
necessary 	 to 	 a ssess 	 the 	 Group’ s 	 position 	 and 	 perf ormance,	
business model and strategy. The Committee examined the 
2015 	 Annual 	 R eport 	 and 	 w as 	 specifically	 task ed 	 b y 	 the 	 B oa rd	
to 	 review 	 the 	 viabilit y 	 statement 	 and 	 to 	 advise 	 on 	 whether	 
the 	 report 	 is 	 f air , 	 balanced 	 and 	 understandable.
The Committee questioned and provided comments to 
those 	 charged 	 with 	 go v ernance 	 and 	 o v ersight 	 of 	 the 	 dr afting	
and 	 production 	 of 	 the 	 Annual 	 R eport, 	 including 	 the 	 Chief	
Ex ecutiv e 	 Officer ,	 Chief 	 Fina nce 	 Officer	 and 	 Chief 	 Risk 	 Officer .	
The Committee focused on the overall tone and messages 
con v ey ed 	 b y 	 the 	 report 	 a nd 	 consistency 	 with 	 internal 	 reports	
and information presented to the Committee throughout 
the year .
F ollowing 	 full 	 consider ation 	 of 	 all 	 a v ailable 	 information, 	 including	
discussion 	 and 	 debate 	 with 	 both 	 ma nagement 	 and 	 the 	 external	
auditor , 	 the 	 Committee 	 concluded 	 that 	 it 	 could 	 recommend	 
to 	 the 	 B oard 	 that 	 the 	 2015 	 Annual 	 R eport 	 a nd 	 Financial	
Statements 	 are 	 f air , 	 balanced 	 a nd 	 understandable.
2 Internal controls and key risks 
Throughout 	 the 	 y ea r , 	 the 	 A udit 	 Committee 	 receiv ed 	 reports	
f rom 	 the 	 Chief 	 Risk 	 Officer	 a nd 	 Internal 	 A udit. 	 The 	 Interna l	
A udit 	 f unction 	 is 	 fulfilled	 b y 	 a 	 third-part y 	 organisation,	
Ma zars 	 LLP , 	 which 	 has 	 f ulfilled	 this 	 f unction 	 since 	 2010.	
The Committee challenged the executive team on the content 
and reliability of those reports and the Committee has been 
satisfied	 that 	 appropriate 	 arr angements, 	 actions 	 or 	 mitigating	
controls are in place in response to Internal Audit and  
the 	 Chief 	 Risk 	 Officer ’ s 	 findings.	 No 	 significant	 fa ilings	 
or 	 wea knesses 	 were 	 identified.

information received in relation to the customer journey.
Internal 	 A udit 	 also 	 f ollowed 	 up 	 and 	 reported 	 to 	 the 	 Committee	
on outstanding actions from previous internal audits.
3 Effectiveness of Internal Audit
The 	 A udit 	 Committee 	 supports 	 the 	 B oard 	 in 	 f ulfilling 	 
its 	 responsibilities 	 to 	 review 	 the 	 a ctivities, 	 resources,	
organisational structure and the operational effectiveness  
of 	 the 	 internal 	 a udit 	 activities. 	 F ollowing 	 discussion 	 with 	 the	
Committee 	 Chairman, 	 Ma zars 	 LLP 	 presents 	 its 	 interna l 	 audit	
plans for approval to the Committee at the start of each

4 Effectiveness and independence  
of the external auditor
The Audit Committee oversees the Group’s relationship  
with 	 the 	 external 	 auditor 	 and 	 f orma lly 	 reviews 	 the	
relationship , 	 policies 	 a nd 	 procedures 	 to 	 ensure 	 independence.	
The 	 Group’ s 	 policy 	 on 	 the 	 pro vision 	 of 	 non- a udit 	 services	 
is 	 reviewed 	 regula rly 	 to 	 ensure 	 tha t 	 the 	 independence 	 and	
objectivity of our external auditor is maintained. It sets out  
t h e 	 c a t e g o r i e s 	 of 	 non- a udit 	 services 	 which 	 the 	 externa l	 
auditor 	 will 	 and 	 will 	 not 	 be 	 allowed 	 to 	 pro vide 	 to 	 the 	 Group .	
The policy states that our external auditor may only be used 
for 	 non- audit 	 work 	 where 	 specific	 services 	 ha v e 	 been 	 a ppro v ed	
b y 	 the 	 policy . 	 Howev er , 	 there 	 ma y 	 be 	 occasions 	 when 	 the	
externa l 	 auditor 	 is 	 best 	 placed 	 to 	 undertak e 	 other 	 a ccounting,	
advisory 	 and 	 consultancy 	 work 	 on 	 behalf 	 of 	 the 	 Group .
The 	 Group’ s 	 policy 	 on 	 non- a udit 	 work 	 w as 	 upda ted 	 on	 
30 	 September 	 2015 	 and 	 can 	 be 	 f ound 	 on 	 the 	 Group’ s 	 website	 
at 	 http://www . 	 esuregroup .com/corpor a te-inf orma tion/
corpor ate-go v ernance.
The 	 Committee 	 receiv es 	 reports 	 twice 	 a 	 y ear 	 deta iling	 
the fees paid to the external auditor for the provision  
of 	 non- a udit 	 services. 	 Non- audit 	 f ees 	 paid 	 to 	 the 	 external	
auditor 	 in 	 2015 	 were 	 £119,000, 	 including 	 £67,000 	 f or 	 advice	
and 	 tax 	 compliance 	 services 	 a nd 	 £37,000 	 rela ting 	 to 	 the	
interim 	 review .
F or 	 the 	 purposes 	 of 	 ev a lua ting 	 the 	 independence 	 of 	 the	
external 	 auditor , 	 the 	 Committee 	 cla ssifies	 the 	 interim 	 review	
f ee 	 as 	 an 	 external 	 audit 	 f ee. 	 Ex cluding 	 the 	 interim 	 review 	 f ees,	
non- a udit 	 fees 	 paid 	 to 	 KPMG 	 were 	 28% 	 of 	 external 	 audit 	 fees	
in 	 the 	 y ea r . 	 Non- audit 	 f ees 	 were 	 principally 	 related 	 to 	 tax 	 a dvice	
and 	 compliance 	 services. 	 A 	 f ull 	 breakdown 	 of 	 non- a udit 	 fees	
paid 	 during 	 the 	 y ear 	 is 	 disclosed 	 within 	 the 	 notes 	 to 	 the	
financial	 statements 	 on 	 page 	 83.
The 	 Committee 	 decided 	 tha t 	 no 	 conflicts	 of 	 interest 	 were 	 f ound	
to 	 exist 	 between 	 the 	 work 	 perf ormed 	 f or 	 the 	 purpose 	 of 	 an	
external 	 audit 	 and 	 non- a udit 	 services 	 pro vided 	 b y 	 KPMG.
The 	 Committee 	 welcomes 	 KPMG’ s 	 policy 	 of 	 audit 	 partner	
rotation 	 ev ery 	 fiv e	 y ears, 	 which 	 f acilitates 	 independence	 
and 	 objectivit y 	 within 	 the 	 externa l 	 audit 	 team. 	 The 	 current	
external 	 audit 	 engagement 	 partner 	 is 	 Philip 	 Smart, 	 who 	 w as	
appointed 	 to 	 lead 	 the 	 audit 	 in 	 2015 	 f ollowing 	 the 	 rotation 	 of	
the 	 previous 	 a udit 	 partner 	 af ter 	 completing 	 five 	 y ears 	 on 	 the	
engagement. 	 Philip 	 Smart 	 is 	 supported 	 b y 	 Timoth y 	 B utchart,	
as 	 A udit 	 D irector , 	 who 	 is 	 also 	 new 	 to 	 our 	 audit 	 this 	 y ear .
The 	 Committee 	 is 	 satisfied	 with 	 the 	 perf ormance 	 and	
effectiveness of KPMG and has concluded that KPMG continues  
to display the necessary attributes of independence  
and objectivity.
The 	 Committee 	 considers 	 the 	 requirements 	 of 	 the 	 UK 	 Corpor a te	
Governance Code and the appropriateness of tendering the 
external audit contract as part of normal business practice. 
B ased 	 on 	 its 	 ongoing 	 assessment, 	 f or 	 example 	 through 	 the	
qualit y 	 of 	 the 	 external 	 auditor’ s 	 report 	 to 	 the 	 Committee,	 
the 	 audit 	 partner’ s 	 inter action 	 with 	 the 	 Committee 	 and 	 the	
rotation 	 of 	 the 	 engagement 	 partner , 	 and 	 the 	 findings	 of	 
the 	 AQR 	 review 	 on 	 our 	 2013 	 A udit, 	 the 	 Committee 	 remains	
satisfied	 with 	 the 	 efficiency	 and 	 ef fectiv eness 	 of 	 the 	 audit.	 
The Committee therefore has not considered it necessary to 
require the audit to be put out to tender this year . Although 
the 	 tr ansitional 	 rules 	 under 	 the 	 EU 	 legislation 	 giv e 	 the 	 Group	
the 	 option 	 to 	 dela y 	 the 	 tender 	 process 	 until 	 2023, 	 it 	 is 	 the	
Group’s intention to put the External Audit Services Contract 
out to tender at the end of the current audit engagement 
partner’s rotation in 2019.
The 	 Committee 	 meets 	 at 	 lea st 	 once 	 a 	 y ear 	 with 	 the 	 Group’ s	
internal 	 a nd 	 external 	 auditors 	 without 	 management 	 present	
and this year held three such meetings.
5 Audit Committee effectiveness 
D uring 	 the 	 y ea r , 	 the 	 Committee 	 undertook 	 an 	 external	
ev a lua tion 	 of 	 its 	 ef fectiv eness 	 and 	 the 	 results 	 were 	 discussed	
at 	 the 	 B oa rd 	 meeting 	 in 	 F ebruary 	 2016, 	 concluding 	 that	 
the 	 Committee 	 w as 	 ef fectiv e 	 and 	 f unctioning 	 well.
Conclusion
As 	 a 	 result 	 of 	 its 	 work 	 during 	 the 	 y ear , 	 the 	 Committee 	 has	
concluded 	 that 	 it 	 has 	 acted 	 in 	 accorda nce 	 with 	 its 	 terms	 
of 	 ref erence. 	 The 	 Chairman 	 of 	 the 	 Committee 	 will 	 be 	 at 	 the	
Annual 	 Gener al 	 Meeting 	 to 	 answer 	 an y 	 questions 	 about	 
the activities of the Committee from shareholders.

On 	 behalf 	 of 	 the 	 R emuner ation 	 Committee, 	 I 	 am 	 delighted

who 	 stepped 	 down 	 f rom 	 the 	 role 	 in 	 A ugust, 	 f or 	 his 	 ha rd 	 work

This 	 report 	 has 	 been 	 prepared 	 in 	 accordance 	 with 	 Schedule 	 8

Changes during 2015
The 	 CEO 	 and 	 CFO 	 receiv ed 	 salary 	 increa ses 	 in 	 July 	 2015

in the investor community that targets should be disclosed as 
f ully 	 as 	 possible 	 a nd 	 at 	 the 	 ea rliest 	 opportunit y , 	 and 	 we 	 are

Remuneration Policy for 2016 onwards
The 	 existing 	 policy 	 w as 	 appro v ed 	 in 	 Ma y 	 2014, 	 which 	 w as	 
the 	 Group’ s 	 first	 f ull 	 y ear 	 as 	 a 	 FT SE-listed 	 compan y . 	 Giv en 	 the	
Group’ s 	 dev elopment 	 since 	 then, 	 a nd 	 the 	 gener al 	 trend 	 tow a rds	
more 	 deferr al 	 of 	 a w ards, 	 the 	 Committee 	 f elt 	 a 	 detailed 	 review	
of 	 the 	 existing 	 policy 	 w as 	 needed 	 to 	 ensure 	 its 	 continued	
appropriateness. 	 In 	 view 	 of 	 the 	 B oa rd’ s 	 ambition 	 to 	 achiev e	
significantly	 increa sed 	 compan y 	 v alue 	 in 	 the 	 medium 	 term,	
our 	 review 	 concluded 	 that 	 sev er a l 	 changes 	 were 	 needed 	 to	
better 	 align 	 ex ecutiv e 	 remuner ation 	 with 	 the 	 Group’ s 	 str ategy .	
In 	 particular , 	 the 	 changes 	 are 	 designed 	 to 	 reinf orce 	 our 	 f ocus	
on 	 substantial 	 and 	 sustainable 	 share 	 price 	 growth 	 and 	 our	
long-term 	 view 	 to 	 ensure 	 the 	 ex ecutiv es 	 are 	 motiv ated 	 to	
achieve our ambitious objectives. The changes are set out  
in 	 detail 	 in 	 this 	 report 	 but, 	 in 	 summary , 	 are 	 as 	 f ollows:
• An increase in the quantum of the annual bonus opportunity 
combined 	 with 	 the 	 introduction 	 of 	 a 	 deferr al 	 element 	 to 	 the	
annual 	 bonus, 	 to 	 align 	 better 	 with 	 ev olving 	 mark et 	 pr actice,	
impro v e 	 long-term 	 alignment 	 a nd 	 discour age 	 unnecessary	
risk -taking
• Creation 	 of 	 a 	 new 	 Str ategic 	 Leadership 	 Plan, 	 to 	 replace	 
the 	 existing 	 P erf ormance 	 Sha re 	 Plan. 	 The 	 new 	 plan 	 aims	 
to 	 incentivise 	 deliv ery 	 of 	 ex ceptional 	 growth 	 in 	 sha reholder	
v alue 	 through 	 higher 	 potential 	 a w ard 	 opportunit y 	 lev els	 
but 	 with 	 significantly	 more 	 stretching 	 targets
• 2016 	 a w ards 	 will 	 be 	 based 	 on 	 absolute 	 T SR 	 (75%) 	 and	
relative TSR (25%) measured over three years; these 
measures 	 are 	 more 	 tr ansparent 	 and 	 align 	 with 	 sha reholder	
interests. 	 The 	 measures 	 will 	 be 	 k ept 	 under 	 review 	 a nd 	 other	
financial	 measures 	 ma y 	 be 	 introduced 	 in 	 subsequent 	 y ears

long-term 	 a w ards, 	 to 	 strengthen 	 long-term 	 f ocus 	 and 	 retention
• Expa nded 	 malus 	 a nd 	 cla wback 	 pro visions, 	 to 	 bring 	 our	
approach 	 more 	 in 	 line 	 with 	 current 	 guidance 	 and 	 ensure	 
t he 	 Committee 	 has 	 the 	 abilit y 	 to 	 reduce 	 or 	 cla wback 	 a w ards	
in 	 appropriate 	 circumstances 	 (which 	 are 	 listed 	 in 	 detail 	 in	
the 	 D irectors’ 	 R emuner ation 	 P olicy 	 on 	 the 	 f ollowing 	 pages)
• Increased 	 shareholding 	 requirement, 	 to 	 increase	
alignment 	 with 	 sha reholders’ 	 interests
As 	 part 	 of 	 this 	 review , 	 we 	 were 	 k een 	 to 	 ensure 	 tha t 	 the 	 new	
arrangements reinforced a strong alignment of objectives 
a c r o s s 	 the 	 wider 	 senior 	 leadership 	 team. 	 Therefore,	
e m p l o y e e s 	 w h o 	 are 	 other 	 k ey 	 influencers	 a nd 	 senior 	 leaders	
will 	 also 	 participate 	 in 	 the 	 new 	 remuner a tion 	 package	
structure. 	 The 	 Committee 	 has 	 work ed 	 with 	 the 	 Group’ s 	 Human	
Resources team to identify and agree participation and 
opportunity levels for this population.
We carried out a shareholder consultation exercise in 
January 	 2016 	 to 	 test 	 the 	 new 	 policy 	 with 	 major 	 sha reholders	
prior 	 to 	 finalising	 the 	 proposals. 	 The 	 Committee 	 and 	 I 	 were	
grateful to our investors for taking the time to share their 
views 	 with 	 us 	 and 	 their 	 feedback 	 has 	 been 	 ca refully 	 considered.	
In 	 particular 	 we 	 noted 	 the 	 emphasis 	 on 	 disclosure 	 of 	 targets	
and 	 we 	 ha v e 	 tak en 	 steps 	 to 	 impro v e 	 this.
Other key activities undertaken by  
the Committee in the year
The 	 Committee 	 met 	 fiv e	 times 	 in 	 the 	 y ear . 	 Other 	 than 	 the	
review 	 of 	 the 	 R emuner ation 	 P olicy 	 and 	 surrounding 	 activities,	
the 	 Committee 	 also 	 carried 	 out 	 the 	 following: 	 appro v al 	 of 	 the	
2014 	 D irectors’ 	 R emuner ation 	 R eport; 	 reviewing 	 performance	
outcomes 	 for 	 a w ards 	 v esting 	 in 	 2015 	 under 	 the 	 annual 	 and	
long-term 	 plans, 	 setting 	 targets 	 f or 	 a w ards 	 made 	 in 	 the 	 y ear ,	
reviewing 	 an 	 independent 	 report 	 on 	 remuner ation 	 risk 	 from	 
the 	 Chief 	 Risk 	 Officer ,	 remuner ation 	 benchmarking 	 f or 	 the	
Ex ecutiv e 	 D irectors, 	 and 	 reviewing 	 the 	 ex ecutiv e 	 remuner ation	
arrangements in the context of regulatory developments.
The 	 Committee 	 a lso 	 undertook 	 a 	 review 	 of 	 remuner ation	
advisors 	 and 	 appointed 	 D eloitte 	 LLP 	 (“D eloitte”) 	 with 	 ef fect	
f rom 	 27 	 July 	 2015.
I trust this report gives a helpful summary of our Remuneration 
P olicy 	 and 	 its 	 application 	 and 	 that 	 we 	 can 	 look 	 f orw ard 	 to 	 y our

44 Directors’  
Remuneration Policy
This 	 section 	 presents 	 the 	 new	
Directors’ Remuneration Policy  
(the “Policy”) for 2016 and beyond. 
The 	 P olicy 	 will 	 be 	 put 	 to 	 a 	 binding	
v ote 	 at 	 the 	 2016 	 AGM 	 a nd 	 will	
become 	 effectiv e 	 on 	 12 	 Ma y 	 2016,	
subject to approval from 
shareholders.
In 	 a ddition, 	 at 	 the 	 AGM 	 we 	 will 	 be	
seeking shareholder approval to 
implement 	 a 	 new 	 long-term 	 plan	
(the “Strategic Leadership Plan”) 
and 	 a 	 D eferred 	 B onus 	 Plan 	 to 	 allow	
the shares to be made available  
in 	 accorda nce 	 with 	 the 	 new 	 P olicy .
Remuneration principles
The Group seeks to attract and retain the best talent for the 
benefit	 of 	 the 	 business 	 and 	 to 	 align 	 the 	 interests 	 of 	 Ex ecutiv e	
D irectors, 	 senior 	 management 	 and 	 emplo y ees 	 with 	 the	
long-term 	 interests 	 of 	 shareholders 	 and 	 other 	 stak eholders.
T o 	 that 	 end, 	 the 	 Group’ s 	 remuner ation 	 policies 	 aim 	 to 	 pro vide	
appropriate 	 rew a rd 	 f or 	 good 	 performance 	 without 	 creating	
incentiv es 	 that 	 will 	 encour age 	 ex cessiv e 	 risk 	 taking. 	 In 	 setting	
the 	 P olicy , 	 the 	 Committee 	 has 	 regard 	 to 	 the 	 pro visions 	 within	
the 	 FCA ’ s 	 R emuner ation 	 Code 	 (ev en 	 though 	 the 	 Group 	 is	 
not 	 required 	 to 	 comply 	 with 	 that 	 code) 	 and 	 to 	 the 	 anticipa ted	
requirements 	 of 	 Solv ency 	 II. 	 In 	 particular , 	 the 	 Committee	
considers 	 ca ref ully 	 the 	 link 	 between 	 remuner ation 	 and 	 risk	
and 	 there 	 is 	 cross-membership 	 of 	 the 	 Risk 	 Committee	 
and the Remuneration Committee. 
Principal changes to the Policy
F ollowing 	 a 	 detailed 	 review , 	 sev er a l 	 changes 	 ha v e 	 been	 
made to the Policy this year . The previous remuneration policy 
came 	 into 	 ef fect 	 in 	 Ma y 	 2014 	 and 	 w as 	 the 	 first	 policy 	 put	 
to shareholders under the current regulations since esure’s 
listing on the Main Market. Since 2014 the strategy has  
been 	 dev eloped 	 which 	 includes 	 the 	 expansion 	 of 	 f ootprint	 
in Motor and Home and the acquisition of the other 50% of 
Gocompare.com 	 which 	 has 	 enabled 	 str ategic 	 control 	 of 	 that	
business. Given the change in the size and scope of the 
business, 	 a nd 	 the 	 opportunities 	 f or 	 f uture 	 growth 	 brought	
about 	 b y 	 these 	 activities, 	 the 	 Committee 	 a greed 	 tha t 	 the 	 P olicy	
should be updated both to ensure that Executive Directors  
are motivated to drive the Group’s ambitious objectives and  
to 	 align 	 with 	 latest 	 best 	 remuner ation 	 pr actices 	 seen 	 in 	 the	
Financial 	 Services 	 industry .
The 	 principal 	 changes 	 are 	 as 	 f ollows:
• Increase in quantum and introduction of a deferral  
element to the annual bonus. The policy maximum for 
the 	 Chief 	 Ex ecutiv e 	 Officer	 remains 	 unchanged, 	 while 	 the	
Chief 	 Finance 	 Of ficer’ s	 maximum 	 opportunit y 	 has 	 been	
increa sed 	 f rom 	 100% 	 to 	 125% 	 to 	 align 	 with 	 the 	 Chief	
Ex ecutiv e 	 Officer .	 The 	 A nnua l 	 R eport 	 on 	 R emuner ation	
pro vides 	 deta ils 	 of 	 a w ard 	 lev els 	 under 	 the 	 P olicy 	 for 	 2016
• Creation 	 of 	 a 	 new 	 Str ategic 	 Leadership 	 Plan 	 (SLP) 	 with	
higher 	 quantum 	 and 	 more 	 stretching 	 targets, 	 to 	 replace	 
the existing Performance Share Plan (PSP). The increased 
quantum level is described in the Annual Report  
on Remuneration
• Introduction 	 of 	 a 	 two- y ear 	 holding 	 period 	 post - v esting	 
f or 	 a w ards 	 under 	 the 	 S LP
• Expa nded 	 malus 	 a nd 	 cla wback 	 pro visions 	 on 	 the 	 S LP	 
and the deferred bonus
• Increased shareholding requirement
The Committee reserves the right to make minor 
amendments 	 to 	 the 	 P olicy 	 without 	 shareholder 	 appro v al 	 f or	
administrative reasons or to obtain or maintain favourable 
tax, 	 ex change 	 control 	 or 	 regulatory 	 treatment 	 f or 	 a 	 D irector 	 or	
a Group member .
esure 	 has 	 also 	 reviewed 	 its 	 disclosure 	 policy 	 to 	 impro v e	
compliance 	 with 	 current 	 shareholder 	 expectations. 	 As 	 a 	 result,	
increa sed 	 disclosure 	 will 	 be 	 pro vided 	 in 	 the 	 A nnual 	 R eport	 
on Remuneration in relation to payments under the annual 
bonus 	 f rom 	 2015 	 on w ards.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee carried out a shareholder consultation  
on 	 the 	 proposed 	 new 	 P olicy 	 in 	 early 	 2016. 	 Sha reholders 	 were	
largely 	 supportiv e 	 and 	 their 	 feedback 	 w as 	 caref ully 	 considered	
when 	 finalising	 the 	 deta ils 	 of 	 the 	 P olicy . 	 The 	 Committee 	 will	
also consider any shareholder feedback received in relation  
to the AGM at the next scheduled meeting after the AGM  
and any other feedback received at any other time as part  
of 	 the 	 review 	 of 	 Ex ecutiv e 	 D irectors’ 	 remuner ation 	 and 	 when	
implementing the Policy.
Consideration of employment conditions  
elsewhere in the Group
The 	 Committee 	 regula rly 	 reviews 	 remuner ation 	 trends	 
across 	 the 	 Group , 	 including 	 the 	 differential 	 between 	 the 	 total	
remuner ation 	 at 	 the 	 highest 	 and 	 lowest 	 lev els 	 of 	 emplo y ees	
within 	 the 	 Group , 	 a nd 	 these 	 were 	 tak en 	 into 	 account 	 when	
setting 	 the 	 P olicy . 	 Howev er , 	 there 	 has 	 been 	 no 	 f ormal	
consulta tion 	 with 	 emplo y ees 	 in 	 determining 	 the 	 P olicy .

Notes to the Policy Table
Performance conditions
TSR has been chosen as the most appropriate metric for  
SLP 	 a w ards 	 made 	 in 	 2016 	 as 	 it 	 is 	 strongly 	 a ligned 	 with 	 the	
Group’s ambitious targets for delivering shareholder value. 
Stretching targets have been set for absolute TSR performance 
and these are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
The remainder of the TSR element is measured against  
the 	 FT SE 	 250 	 Index 	 (ex cluding 	 in v estment 	 trusts 	 and 	 the	
Company) and therefore provides a good measure of relative 
stock 	 mark et 	 perf orma nce, 	 with 	 management 	 only 	 being	
rew arded 	 for 	 the 	 deliv ery 	 of 	 ex ceptional 	 relativ e 	 lev els	 
of return. A blend of these measures is considered to be  
a complementary mix of absolute and relative performance 
and 	 f ocuses 	 on 	 superior 	 stock 	 ma rk et 	 returns, 	 in 	 line 	 with	
the 	 Compan y’ s 	 f uture 	 str ategy . 	 The 	 Committee, 	 in 	 selecting	
perf ormance 	 mea sures 	 and 	 setting 	 targets, 	 ensures 	 that	
there 	 is 	 a 	 strong 	 link 	 between 	 the 	 str ategies 	 adopted 	 f or 	 the	
business 	 and 	 the 	 targets 	 set 	 f or 	 each 	 SLP 	 a w ard 	 and 	 annual	
bonus 	 cy cle. 	 P erf ormance 	 targets 	 will 	 be 	 set 	 annually 	 prior	 
to 	 a w ards 	 being 	 made 	 with 	 regard 	 to 	 the 	 business 	 str a tegy	
and economic and market environment at that time.
Share-ba sed 	 a w ards
Share-ba sed 	 a w ards 	 under 	 the 	 S LP , 	 D B P 	 and 	 PSP 	 ma y:
a)	 be 	 made 	 in 	 the 	 f orm 	 of 	 conditiona l 	 share 	 a w a rds	 
of 	 nil-cost 	 options 	 or 	 equiv alent 	 instruments;
b) be settled in cash at the Committee’s discretion;

incorpor ate 	 the 	 right 	 to 	 receiv e 	 the 	 v alue 	 of 	 an y 	 a w ards	
that 	 would 	 ha v e 	 been 	 paid 	 on 	 the 	 shares 	 that 	 v est 	 under	
an 	 a w ard 	 on 	 such 	 basis 	 and 	 o v er 	 such 	 period 	 (ending 	 no	
later 	 than 	 the 	 date 	 the 	 individual 	 first	 becomes 	 entitled	 
to have underlying shares delivered to him) as the 
Committee may determine;
d) have their performance conditions amended or substituted 
if 	 an 	 ev ent 	 occurs 	 which 	 causes 	 the 	 Committee 	 to 	 consider	
an 	 amended 	 or 	 substituted 	 condition 	 would 	 be 	 more	
appropriate 	 and 	 not 	 materially 	 less 	 difficult	 to 	 satisf y; 	 and
e) be adjusted in the event of a variation of the Company’s 
share 	 capital 	 or 	 an y 	 demerger , 	 delisting, 	 special 	 dividend	 
or 	 an y 	 other 	 ev ent 	 which 	 ma y 	 in 	 the 	 Committee’ s 	 opinion	
affect the current or future value of the Company’s shares.
Ma lus 	 and 	 cla wback 	 pro visions
Ma lus 	 (the 	 right 	 to 	 reduce 	 the 	 v alue 	 of 	 un v ested 	 a w ards)	 
will 	 apply 	 to 	 un v ested 	 a w ards 	 under 	 the 	 D B P , 	 PSP 	 and 	 SLP .	
Cla wback 	 will 	 apply 	 to 	 v ested 	 a w ards 	 under 	 the 	 D B P , 	 S LP 	 and	
PSP 	 and 	 the 	 part 	 of 	 the 	 annual 	 bonus 	 which 	 is 	 paid 	 in 	 ca sh.	
These provisions may be invoked at the Committee’s discretion 
at 	 an y 	 time 	 prior 	 to 	 a 	 tak eo v er 	 of 	 the 	 Compan y 	 and 	 within	
three 	 y ears 	 of 	 the 	 v esting 	 of 	 PSP 	 a w ards 	 and 	 the 	 pa yment 	 of	
c ash 	 bonuses 	 and 	 six 	 y ears 	 of 	 the 	 gr ant 	 of 	 D BP 	 and 	 SLP 	 a w ards.
The Committee has the discretion to invoke these provisions 
in 	 the 	 f ollowing 	 circumstances:
• where 	 there 	 is 	 a 	 material 	 misstatement 	 of 	 an y 	 Group	
member’ s 	 financial	 results, 	 or 	 an 	 error 	 in 	 assessing	
perf ormance 	 conditions 	 applica ble 	 to 	 PSP 	 or 	 SLP 	 a w ards	 
or 	 calculating 	 the 	 bonus 	 to 	 which 	 a 	 D B P 	 a w ard 	 rela tes	 
is discovered;
• where 	 the 	 Committee 	 becomes 	 a w are 	 of 	 an y 	 misconduct	 
on the part of the individual; and
• f or 	 D B P 	 and 	 SLP 	 a w ards 	 only , 	 where 	 a 	 material 	 f ailure	 
of 	 risk 	 management 	 b y 	 a 	 Group 	 member 	 is 	 identified, 	 
or in the event of serious reputational damage to a Group 
member during the period commencing at the start of the 
perf ormance 	 period 	 for 	 SLP 	 a w ards 	 and 	 the 	 gr ant 	 date 	 f or

gr ant 	 date 	 of 	 the 	 a w ard.
Implementation of the Policy in 2016
A 	 description 	 of 	 how 	 the 	 Committee 	 intends 	 to 	 implement 	 the	
Policy in 2016 is set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration 
on page 56.
Alignment 	 with 	 remuner a tion 	 elsewhere 	 in 	 the 	 Compan y
Where 	 appropriate, 	 the 	 Committee 	 aims 	 f or 	 a s 	 much	
consistency 	 as 	 possible 	 between 	 the 	 P olicy 	 f or 	 Ex ecutiv e	
Directors and the remuneration policy for employees across 
the 	 Group 	 a s 	 a 	 whole. 	 F or 	 example, 	 all 	 emplo y ees 	 (including	
Ex ecutiv e 	 D irectors) 	 participate 	 in 	 similar 	 pension 	 and 	 benefits 	
arr angements, 	 and 	 all 	 participa te 	 in 	 an 	 annual 	 bonus 	 plan	 
or 	 profit	 sharing 	 plan. 	 S enior 	 emplo y ees 	 at 	 Group 	 Ex ecutiv e	
and 	 Oper ationa l 	 Ex ecutiv e 	 lev el 	 participate 	 in 	 the 	 SLP , 	 which	 
is considered appropriate as senior executives are more able 
to 	 influence	 the 	 long-term 	 str a tegic 	 (as 	 opposed 	 to 	 oper ational)	
success 	 of 	 the 	 Group , 	 as 	 evidenced 	 b y 	 long-term 	 T SR	
performance. The Company encourages and helps facilitate 
share 	 ownership 	 b y 	 all 	 emplo y ees 	 b y 	 off ering 	 participa tion	 
in 	 the 	 Compan y’ s 	 Sa v e 	 As 	 Y ou 	 Earn 	 Plan.
Illustrations of application of the Policy
The 	 f ollowing 	 chart 	 pro vides 	 an 	 indica tion 	 of 	 the 	 remuner ation	
that each Executive Director might receive in accordance  
with 	 the 	 P olicy 	 for 	 2016 	 in 	 respect 	 of 	 minimum 	 (fix ed 	 pa y),	
on-target 	 and 	 maximum 	 perf orma nce.

• F or 	 illustr ativ e 	 purposes, 	 on-target 	 perf orma nce 	 under	 
the 	 annual 	 bonus 	 at 	 50% 	 of 	 maximum 	 and 	 SLP 	 is 	 shown	 
at 35% of maximum
• Consistent 	 with 	 the 	 P olicy 	 to 	 be 	 applied 	 in 	 2016, 	 the	
maximum 	 bonus 	 opportunit y 	 is 	 shown 	 as 	 125% 	 of 	 salary

taking 	 into 	 account 	 mark et 	 pr actice, 	 corpor ate 	 go v ernance	
considerations and the particular candidate at that time.
Service contracts and policy on payment for loss of office
The Company’s policy is that service contracts do not have  
a 	 specific	 dur ation 	 but 	 ma y 	 be 	 terminated 	 with 	 12 	 months’	
notice from the Company or the Executive Director .
Under 	 their 	 letters 	 of 	 appointment, 	 Non-Ex ecutiv e 	 D irectors’	
appointment is terminable by either party on three months’ 
written 	 notice 	 ex cept 	 where 	 the 	 D irector 	 is 	 not 	 rea ppointed	 
b y 	 shareholders, 	 in 	 which 	 case 	 termination 	 is 	 with 	 immediate	
eff ect. 	 The 	 appointment 	 letters 	 for 	 the 	 Non-Ex ecutiv e 	 D irectors	
pro vide 	 that 	 no 	 compensation 	 is 	 pa y able 	 on 	 termina tion,	 
other than for accrued fees and expenses.
The Directors’ service contracts and letters of appointment  
are 	 a v ailable 	 for 	 inspection 	 a t 	 the 	 Group’ s 	 registered 	 office.
The obligations of the Group in respect of remuneration and 
pa yments 	 for 	 loss 	 of 	 office	 when 	 a 	 D irector 	 lea v es 	 the 	 Group	
are set out on the next page.
Under 	 their 	 service 	 contr acts, 	 the 	 Ex ecutiv e 	 D irectors 	 are	
entitled 	 to 	 salary 	 (reviewed 	 a nnually), 	 pension 	 contributions	
and 	 benefits.	 The 	 Chairman 	 is 	 entitled 	 to 	 salary 	 (reviewed	
annually), 	 priv a te 	 health 	 co v er 	 and 	 use 	 of 	 a 	 driv er 	 (f or 	 business	
and a portion of personal travel). The Company reserves  
the 	 right 	 to 	 settle 	 an y 	 tax 	 liabilit y 	 on 	 these 	 benefits	 on 	 the	
Cha irman’ s 	 behalf . 	 These 	 benefits	 ma y 	 be 	 paid 	 during 	 the	
Director’s notice period (although the Director is required  
to seek alternative employment in this time).
The service agreements of the Chairman and the Executive 
Directors can be terminated by not less than 12 months’ notice 
by either party. The Company may put the Chairman and  
the Executive Directors on gardening leave during their notice 
p e r i o d , 	 and 	 can 	 elect 	 to 	 terminate 	 emplo yment 	 b y 	 making	 
a payment in lieu of notice equivalent to up to 12 months’ 
salary. This payment may be made as either a lump sum on 
termination 	 or 	 with 	 an 	 amount 	 equiv alent 	 to 	 up 	 to 	 six 	 months’	
salary payable in a lump sum on termination and six months’ 
salary payable in monthly instalments from the seventh month 
to 	 the 	 twelf th 	 month, 	 subject 	 to 	 offset 	 against 	 an y 	 earnings	
elsewhere 	 during 	 tha t 	 six -month 	 period 	 in 	 an y 	 new 	 role.
In 	 a ddition, 	 statutory 	 entitlements 	 or 	 sums 	 to 	 settle	 
or 	 compromise 	 claims 	 in 	 connection 	 with 	 a 	 termination	 
would 	 be 	 paid 	 as 	 necessary .

Approach to recruitment remuneration
The 	 Committee 	 will 	 aim 	 to 	 set 	 a 	 new 	 Ex ecutiv e 	 D irector’ s	
remuner ation 	 package 	 in 	 line 	 with 	 the 	 P olicy 	 appro v ed 	 b y	
shareholders. 	 New 	 Ex ecutiv e 	 D irectors 	 will 	 participate 	 in 	 the	
annual bonus and the Strategic Leadership Plan on the same 
basis as existing Directors.
In arriving at a total package and in considering quantum  
f or 	 each 	 element 	 of 	 the 	 package, 	 the 	 Committee 	 will 	 tak e	 
into 	 account 	 the 	 siz e 	 a nd 	 scope 	 of 	 the 	 role, 	 the 	 skills 	 a nd	
experience 	 of 	 a 	 candida te, 	 the 	 mark et 	 r a te 	 f or 	 a 	 candida te	 
of 	 that 	 experience, 	 as 	 well 	 as 	 the 	 importance 	 of 	 securing	 
the 	 pref erred 	 candida te. 	 F or 	 internationa l 	 candida tes,	 
this may mean that consideration might be given to typical 
remuneration practices in the country of their previous 
emplo y er . 	 In 	 respect 	 of 	 an 	 individual’ s 	 recruitment, 	 a nnua l	
bonus 	 potentia l 	 will 	 not 	 ex ceed 	 125% 	 of 	 salary 	 a nd 	 SLP	
a w ards 	 will 	 not 	 ex ceed 	 300% 	 of 	 salary .
Special consideration may be given in the event that  
long-term 	 incentiv e 	 a w a rds 	 accrued 	 at 	 a 	 previous 	 emplo y er	
are due to be forfeited on the candidate’s leaving that 
c o m p a n y , 	 in 	 which 	 case 	 the 	 Committee 	 retains 	 the 	 discretion	
to 	 gr ant 	 further 	 a w ards 	 with 	 v esting 	 on 	 a 	 compar able	 
basis 	 to 	 the 	 lik ely 	 v esting 	 of 	 the 	 previous 	 emplo y er’ s 	 a w ard.

greater 	 disclosure 	 will 	 be 	 pro vided 	 in 	 this 	 report 	 around

The 	 B oard 	 still 	 considers 	 the 	 2015 	 financial	 targets 	 to 	 be	
commercially 	 sensitiv e, 	 giv en 	 the 	 close 	 link 	 between 	 performance	
targets 	 and 	 long-term 	 str ategy . 	 In 	 addition, 	 the 	 Committee	
believ es 	 disclosing 	 targets 	 would 	 put 	 esure 	 at 	 a 	 competitiv e

In 	 the 	 recent 	 shareholder 	 consulta tion 	 on 	 the 	 new 	 R emuner ation

The 	 a nnual 	 bonus 	 f or 	 2015 	 w as 	 based 	 75% 	 on 	 a 	 financial

Performance against financial targets
The 	 financia l	 measure 	 is 	 a ssessed 	 on 	 the 	 Group’ s 	 tr ading	
profit	 with 	 reference 	 to 	 a 	 sliding 	 scale. 	 T argets 	 f or 	 2015

Performance against personal and customer objectives
The personal measures focus on the delivery of esure’s 
strategic priorities and developing organisational capability  
and enhancing succession plans. The customer measures 
focus on embedding a culture that places customers at the 
heart of esure’s business and is based on achievement against 
a 	 wide 	 r ange 	 of 	 measures 	 which 	 are 	 assessed 	 monthly 	 and	
cover the broad range of customer outcomes.
The scale for the personal and customer measures ranges 
f rom 	 not 	 achiev ed 	 to 	 fully 	 achiev ed. 	 F ollowing 	 an 	 independent	 
review 	 b y 	 the 	 Chief 	 Risk 	 Officer	 of 	 the 	 lev el 	 of 	 performance	
achiev ed, 	 the 	 Committee 	 deemed 	 that 	 the 	 CEO 	 had 	 achiev ed	
92% 	 of 	 his 	 objectiv es, 	 which 	 included 	 Group 	 succession	
planning, 	 str ategic 	 growth 	 opportunities 	 and 	 data

The 	 v esting 	 of 	 the 	 a w ards 	 is 	 subject 	 to 	 the 	 satisfa ction 	 of 	 perf ormance 	 conditions 	 set 	 b y 	 the 	 Committee 	 as 	 set 	 out 	 below .

The Remuneration Committee has discretion to scale back 
annual 	 bonus 	 pa yments 	 in 	 the 	 ev ent 	 of , 	 inter 	 alia, 	 risk 	 or	
regulatory compliance issues and also in the event that the 
lev el 	 of 	 bonus 	 represents, 	 in 	 the 	 Committee’ s 	 view , 	 an 	 ex cessiv e	
proportion 	 of 	 the 	 Group’ s 	 o v er all 	 profitability . 	 There 	 were 	 no	
ev ents 	 in 	 2015 	 which 	 led 	 the 	 Committee 	 to 	 determine 	 that	 
a 	 scale 	 back 	 of 	 the 	 annual 	 bonus 	 pa yment 	 w as 	 appropriate.	 
In 	 a ddition, 	 the 	 Committee 	 did 	 not 	 consider 	 that 	 the 	 lev el	 
of bonus represented an excessive proportion of the Group’s 
o v er a ll 	 profitability 	 such 	 that 	 it 	 should 	 be 	 sca led 	 back.
A w ards 	 in 	 2015 	 were 	 not 	 subject 	 to 	 deferr al 	 a rr a ngements	
and 	 all 	 bonuses 	 were 	 receiv ed 	 in 	 ca sh. 	 From 	 2016, 	 a 	 deferr al

The 	 a nnual 	 bonus 	 f or 	 2014 	 w as 	 based 	 75% 	 on 	 a 	 financial

This report presents a narrative report for the 2015 Greenhouse

Group’ s 	 UK 	 oper ations.
Methodology: 	 The 	 f ootprint 	 is 	 calculated 	 in 	 a ccordance 	 with	
the GHG Protocol and Carbon Trust (“CT”) guidance on 
calculating organisational footprints. Activity data has been 
converted into carbon emissions using published emissions 
factors. The data used has been provided by the Group and 
sense 	 check ed 	 (but 	 not 	 f ormally 	 v erified)	 b y 	 Utilit ywise 	 PL C.
Emissions sources: The footprint includes the Scope 1  
(fossil fuel and refrigerant leakage) and Scope 2 (electricity) 
emissions 	 associated 	 with 	 the 	 of fices	 in 	 which 	 the 	 Group 	 is	
based. 	 F or 	 the 	 purposes 	 of 	 the 	 report 	 only , 	 Scope 	 1 	 (direct)	
and Scope 2 (indirect) emissions sources are required.
Organisational boundary: The footprint includes data for 
the 	 four 	 offices	 in 	 which 	 the 	 Group 	 emplo ys 	 staff 	 (R eigate,	
Ma nchester , 	 Glasgow 	 and 	 Newport) 	 as 	 well 	 as 	 two 	 domestic	
apartments. Note that this does not include outsourced

Risk management and internal control
The Board is ultimately responsible for the effectiveness of 
the Group’s system of risk management and internal control. 
To ensure that this is achieved and that the risk management 
and internal controls are embedded in the running of the 
business, 	 the 	 Group 	 oper ates 	 a 	 three 	 lines 	 of 	 defence	
structure 	 which 	 is 	 regularly 	 reported 	 on 	 to 	 the 	 A udit 	 and 	 Risk	
Committees. 	 This 	 f r amework 	 mitigates 	 the 	 risk 	 of 	 f ailure 	 to	
achiev e 	 business 	 objectiv es, 	 unforeseen 	 losses 	 and 	 material	
financial	 misstatement.
There 	 are 	 a 	 number 	 of 	 controls 	 in 	 place 	 within 	 this 	 f r amework	
to ensure that the Group has robust procedures for preparing 
consolidated 	 accounts 	 and 	 f or 	 fina ncial	 reporting.
The 	 Risk 	 Committee 	 and 	 the 	 A udit 	 Committee, 	 respectiv ely ,	
regularly 	 review 	 the 	 eff ectiv eness 	 of 	 the 	 Group’ s 	 risk	
management and internal control systems. Their monitoring 
focuses on material risks and controls and is based principally 
on 	 reporting 	 upw ards 	 within 	 the 	 fr amework 	 f rom 	 business	
ma nagement, 	 risk 	 management 	 a nd 	 the 	 Internal 	 A udit 	 f unction	
so 	 that 	 the 	 Committees 	 ma y 	 consider 	 whether 	 significant 	
wea knesses 	 exist. 	 D uring 	 the 	 course 	 of 	 the 	 reviews, 	 the	
Committees 	 ha v e 	 not 	 identified	 or 	 been 	 advised 	 of 	 a n y 	 failings	
or 	 wea knesses 	 that 	 they 	 ha v e 	 determined 	 to 	 be 	 significant.
T o support Group policies and to facilitate the raising of concerns 
about 	 possible 	 improprieties 	 in 	 matters 	 of 	 financial	 reporting	
or 	 an y 	 other 	 matters, 	 the 	 Group 	 pro vides 	 a 	 confidential 	
telephone 	 hotline, 	 so 	 that 	 staf f 	 or 	 third 	 parties 	 ma y 	 report	
anonymously any perceived inaccurate or unethical  
working 	 pr actices.
The Audit and Risk Committees endeavour to ensure that  
the 	 Group 	 has 	 in 	 place 	 appropriate 	 and 	 ef fectiv e 	 controls,	
checks, 	 systems, 	 a nd 	 risk 	 management 	 techniques.
Internal Audit
The Group’s Internal Audit function is fully outsourced.
The activities and effectiveness of Internal Audit are 
monitored 	 and 	 reviewed 	 b y 	 the 	 A udit 	 Committee. 	 The 	 A udit	
Committee is responsible for ensuring that adequate access to 
information and resource is given to the Lead Internal Auditor 
and for approving the appointment and removal of the Lead 
Internal Auditor . The Lead Internal Auditor reports directly to 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee. Internal Audit reports 
are presented to the Audit Committee on the effectiveness  
of the Group’s systems of internal controls and the adequacy 
of these systems to manage business risk and to safeguard 
the Group’s assets and resources. Internal Audit uses the 
Group’s risk registers to plan and inform its annual audit 
progr amme 	 around 	 the 	 most 	 significant	 risks 	 to 	 the 	 business	
to ensure that controls are in place and are designed and 
oper ating 	 ef fectiv ely . 	 The 	 A udit 	 Committee 	 reviews 	 and	
approves the Annual Internal Audit Plan.
This 	 section 	 together 	 with 	 the 	 reports 	 set 	 out 	 on 	 pages 	 28	 
to 62 are approved by order of the Board.

62 Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in respect  
of the Annual Report and the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and parent company financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
parent company financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law they are required to prepare the Group 
financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted  
by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare 
the parent company financial statements in accordance  
with UK Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 Reduced 
Disclosure Framework.
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
parent company and of their profit or loss for that period.  
In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent
• For the Group financial statements, state whether they 
have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU
• For the parent company financial statements, state 
whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed  
and explained in the parent company financial statements
• Prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and the parent company will continue in business
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the parent company  
and enable them to ensure that its financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open  
to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent 
and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility Statement of the Directors  
in respect of the annual financial report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• The financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit  
or loss of the Company and the undertakings included  
in the consolidation taken as a whole
• The Strategic Report and Directors’ Report include a fair review 
of the development and performance of the business and 
the position of the issuer and the undertakings included in 
the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face
We consider the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as  
a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy.

for the year ended 31 December 2015 set out on pages 67  
to 114. In our opinion:
• the 	 financial	 statements 	 giv e 	 a 	 true 	 and 	 f air 	 view 	 of 	 the	
state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs  
as 	 at 	 31 	 D ecember 	 2015 	 and 	 of 	 the 	 Group’ s 	 profit	 for	 
the year then ended;

R eporting 	 S tandards 	 as 	 adopted 	 b y 	 the 	 European 	 Union;
• the 	 parent 	 compa n y 	 financial	 statements 	 ha v e 	 been	
properly 	 prepared 	 in 	 accorda nce 	 with 	 UK 	 Accounting

2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In 	 a rriving 	 at 	 our 	 audit 	 opinion 	 abo v e 	 on 	 the 	 financial 	
statements the risks of material misstatement that had  
the 	 greatest 	 ef fect 	 on 	 our 	 audit 	 were 	 as 	 f ollows:
Claims outstanding £614.2m (2014: £597.3m) and  
claims outstanding recoverable from reinsurers £209.3m 
(2014: £194.4m).
R ef er 	 to 	 page 	 36 	 (A udit 	 Committee 	 R eport), 	 page 	 76	
(accounting 	 policy) 	 and 	 pages 	 97 	 to 	 101 	 (financial	 disclosures).
The risks
As part of its business model the Group incurs insurance  
c l a i m s 	 a nd 	 there 	 is 	 t ypically 	 a 	 time 	 lag 	 between 	 a 	 claim	 
being 	 incurred 	 a nd 	 being 	 settled. 	 As 	 a 	 result, 	 the 	 Group 	 has	
significant	 claims 	 outstanding 	 at 	 an y 	 point 	 in 	 time, 	 including	
the 	 y ear -end, 	 and 	 there 	 is 	 inherent 	 uncertaint y 	 as 	 to 	 the	 
lev el 	 at 	 which 	 these 	 claims 	 outsta nding 	 will 	 be 	 settled.	 
At 31 December 2015 the Group had claims outstanding 
representing 	 56% 	 (2014: 	 57%) 	 of 	 total 	 liabilities, 	 and 	 claims	
outstanding recoverable from reinsurers representing 14% 
(2014: 15%) of total assets.
Gross claims outstanding:
The valuation of claims outstanding is one of the key 
judgemental 	 a reas 	 upon 	 which 	 our 	 audit 	 is 	 concentr ated,	 
due to the level of subjectivity inherent in the estimation  
of 	 the 	 ef fect 	 of 	 uncertain 	 or 	 unknown 	 f uture 	 ev ents 	 a nd	 
the resulting potential exposure to large losses. This includes 
losses arising from periodic payment orders (‘PPOs’) for motor 
insurance (a structured settlement in the form of a regular 
series of payments over the remainder of a claimant’s life  
and 	 which 	 inherently 	 has 	 consider able 	 uncertaint y 	 associa ted	
with 	 it 	 in 	 respect 	 of 	 longevit y 	 and 	 cost 	 infla tion,	 see 	 page 	 97)	
and 	 extreme 	 weather 	 condition 	 losses 	 f or 	 home 	 insur ance.	
The determination of claims outstanding is complex. This balance 
consists 	 of 	 specific	 cla ims 	 reserv es 	 f or 	 reported 	 claims 	 in	
addition to an estimate for claims incurred but not reported 
(“IBNR”) as some claims can take some time to emerge or 
develop. Actuarial techniques are required to determine the 
actuarial best estimate and thus deduce the IBNR by deducting 
claims already reported. The completeness and accuracy  
of the data underlying the actuarial projections is a key area 
of 	 focus 	 as 	 well.
The 	 D irectors 	 a pply 	 their 	 judgement, 	 supported 	 b y 	 quantitativ e	
and 	 qualita tiv e 	 analysis 	 to 	 inform 	 their 	 views, 	 to 	 set 	 the 	 cla ims	
outstanding reserves at a level that they consider to be 
appropriate by including a margin over the actuarial best 
estimate, 	 in 	 order 	 to 	 tak e 	 account 	 of 	 current 	 uncertainties	
around 	 f actors 	 that 	 ma y 	 influence	 the 	 ev entual 	 settlement	 
of the claims. 
Claims outstanding recoverable from reinsurers:
The valuation of claims outstanding recoverable from reinsurers 
is 	 dependent 	 on, 	 but 	 not 	 directly 	 correlated 	 to , 	 the 	 v a luation	
of 	 the 	 underlying 	 claims 	 outstanding. 	 In 	 particular , 	 there 	 is	
judgement involved in ascertaining the level of reinsurance 
IB NR 	 held, 	 which 	 depends 	 on 	 the 	 specific	 terms 	 of 	 the	
reinsur ance 	 contr acts 	 in 	 place. 	 Additiona lly , 	 reinsur ance	
reco v eries 	 are 	 also 	 subject 	 to 	 credit 	 risk 	 associa ted 	 with	
reinsurer credit default. Credit risk is particularly relevant  
f or 	 the 	 reco v eries 	 associated 	 with 	 the 	 cla ims 	 outstanding	 
that have a long duration.
Our response
Gross claims outstanding:
• Our audit procedures included testing governance 
arrangements and key controls around the internal reserving 
process, 	 including 	 controls 	 o v er 	 the 	 setting 	 of 	 reserv es 	 f or	
reported claims and controls over the completeness and 
accuracy of the data underlying the actuarial projections 
used to set the reserve for IBNR.
• W e 	 ev aluated 	 the 	 competence, 	 ca pabilities 	 and 	 objectivit y	 
of 	 the 	 internal 	 a nd 	 external 	 actuaries 	 used 	 b y 	 the 	 Group ,	
based 	 on 	 discussions 	 with 	 them, 	 our 	 knowledge 	 of 	 the	
actuaries’ 	 qualifications	 and 	 the 	 professiona l 	 standa rds	 
that 	 their 	 work 	 is 	 subject 	 to , 	 and 	 b y 	 pro viding 	 cha llenge	 
to 	 their 	 a nalysis 	 through 	 the 	 procedures 	 described 	 below .
• W e 	 used 	 our 	 own 	 a ctua rial 	 specialists 	 to 	 assist 	 us 	 in 	 our	
challenge of the reserving methodology and the key 
assumptions used (including the discount rate and longevity 
assumptions 	 used 	 f or 	 PPOs 	 as 	 well 	 as 	 consider ations 	 of 	 the	
potential 	 impact 	 of 	 la rge 	 weather 	 losses 	 during 	 the 	 period).	
W e 	 ha v e 	 assessed 	 these 	 assumptions 	 f or 	 reasonableness,	
through analytical procedures including claims development 
trends 	 o v er 	 time, 	 as 	 well 	 as 	 consistency 	 with 	 prior 	 periods.	
We considered the movement in reserves relating to claims 
incurred in prior years to assess the reasonableness of 
Directors’ past assumptions and the methodology used  
to estimate claims outstanding. Where there have been 
changes 	 in 	 the 	 methodology 	 or 	 k ey 	 assumptions 	 we 	 ha v e	
assessed 	 whether 	 these 	 are 	 reasonable 	 based 	 on 	 changes	
in 	 the 	 industry 	 a nd 	 the 	 Group’ s 	 historical 	 cla ims 	 experience,	
and 	 ha v e 	 considered 	 whether 	 all 	 changes 	 we 	 would 	 expect	
to see have been made. We have also considered the 
rea sonableness 	 of 	 the 	 differences 	 in 	 methodologies,	
assumptions 	 and 	 projections 	 between 	 the 	 internal 	 and

approaches and comparing the impact of these differences 
on the outputs in the context of materiality for the Group 
financial	 statements.
• W e 	 benchmark ed 	 the 	 Group’ s 	 methodology , 	 k ey	
assumptions and projected results (such as the ultimate 
loss ratios) against our expectations given our cumulative 
knowledge 	 of 	 the 	 sector .
• In respect of the margin that the Directors have set over 
the 	 internal 	 a ctua rial 	 best 	 estimate, 	 we 	 considered 	 the	
consistency of the margin applied against developments  
in the level of uncertainty over the claims. This also included 
critical assessment of the quantitative and qualitative 
consider ations 	 made 	 b y 	 the 	 D irectors 	 when 	 selecting	 
the 	 specific	 lev el 	 of 	 margin 	 to 	 be 	 held 	 for 	 the 	 period 	 as	
well 	 as 	 consider ation 	 of 	 industry 	 related 	 benchmarks.
• We have also considered the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures over the degree of estimation uncertainty  
and the sensitivity of recognised amounts to changes  
in 	 assumptions, 	 and 	 assessed 	 whether 	 the 	 disclosures	
comply 	 with 	 relev ant 	 accounting 	 standa rds.
Claims outstanding recoverable from reinsurers:
• We evaluated and tested key controls around reinsurers’ 
share 	 of 	 claims 	 outstanding, 	 including 	 the 	 go v ernance	
process in determining reinsurance IBNR and reinsurance 
credit controls.
• W e 	 used 	 our 	 own 	 actuarial 	 specialists 	 to 	 assist 	 in 	 ev aluating	
the appropriateness of reinsurance recoveries on IBNR  
by considering the historical ratios of ‘paid and reported 
claims, 	 net 	 of 	 reinsur ance 	 reco v eries’ 	 to 	 ‘ paid	 
and 	 reported 	 claims, 	 gross 	 of 	 reinsur ance 	 reco v eries’ .	
• We assessed the methodology applied to calculate the 
allow ance 	 f or 	 reinsur ance 	 bad 	 debt, 	 b y 	 ref erence 	 to	
common 	 approaches 	 within 	 the 	 mark et 	 and 	 consistency

to reinsurance over reported claims through analysing 
aged debt and reinsurance counterparty credit ratings.
3. Our application of materiality and an overview  
of the scope of our audit
The 	 materialit y 	 f or 	 the 	 Group 	 financial	 statements 	 as 	 a 	 whole	
w as 	 set 	 at 	 £6.6m 	 (2014: 	 £7.2m), 	 determined 	 with 	 ref erence	
to 	 a 	 benchmark 	 of 	 Group 	 total 	 income 	 (2014: 	 profit	 before	
tax) 	 of 	 which 	 it 	 represents 	 appro ximately 	 1%. 	 This 	 y ea r 	 we	
revisited 	 our 	 approach 	 to 	 materialit y 	 and 	 it 	 w as 	 determined	
that 	 the 	 materialit y 	 benchmark 	 of 	 Group 	 total 	 income 	 w as	 
a 	 more 	 appropriate 	 measure 	 tha n 	 profit	 before 	 tax. 	 Our 	 view	
is that total income provides a more stable measure year  
on 	 y ear 	 a gainst 	 which 	 to 	 scope 	 our 	 audit 	 and 	 is 	 an 	 appropriate	
representation of the size of the business. 
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected 
identified	 missta tements 	 ex ceeding 	 £0.3m 	 (2015: 	 £0.4m),	
in 	 addition 	 to 	 other 	 identified	 misstatements 	 that 	 w arr anted	
reporting on qualitative grounds.
The 	 audit 	 of 	 the 	 whole 	 Group 	 including 	 its 	 components 	 w as	
undertaken by the Group audit team and covered 100%  
of 	 total 	 Group 	 rev enue, 	 Group 	 profit	 before 	 tax 	 a nd 	 tota l	
Group assets.
4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by  
the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to  
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance  
with 	 the 	 Companies 	 Act 	 2006; 	 a nd

D irectors’ 	 R eport 	 for 	 the 	 financial	 y ear 	 f or 	 which 	 the	
financial	 statements 	 are 	 prepared 	 is 	 consistent 	 with	 
the 	 financial	 statements.

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. As detailed in the Strategic Report

resources to continue in operational existence for at least the next 12 months. 
These consolidated financial statements have been presented in Sterling and rounded to the nearest hundred thousand. 
Throughout these consolidated financial statements any amo u n t s 	 w h i c h 	 a r e 	 l e s s 	 t ha n 	 £ 0 . 0 5 m 	 a r e 	 s h o w n 	 b y 	 0 . 0 , 	 w h e r e a s

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial assets and 
land and buildings that are measured at fair value at the reporting date. The principal accounting policies adopted are set  
out 	 bel o w. 	
Changes to accounting policies 
The	 Gro u p	 has 	 ado p ted	 the	 fo llo wing	 interpretatio n	 during	 the	 pe r i o d , 	 with	 a	 date	 of 	 initial	 applicatio n	 o f 	 1	 J a nuar y 	 20 15 :

 The interpretation clarifies that a government (or governmental agency) levy is not recognised until the obligating event 
specif ied	 in	 legislatio n/r e gulatio n 	 o ccur s, 	 ev en	 if 	 ther e 	 is	no realistic opportunity to avoid the obligation. The Group has 
aligned the timing of its recognition of provisions for levies to	 that	 required	 by 	 the	 IFRIC	 inte rp ret atio n.	 W hi lst	 th is	 is

performed on materiality grounds.

Investment income and instalment interest  
Investment income comprises interest and dividend income and net gains (both realised and unrealised) on financial assets 
c l a s s i f i e d 	 a t 	 f a i r 	 v a l u e 	 t h r o u g h 	 p r o f i t 	 o r 	 l o s s , 	 i n c l u d i n g 	 d e r i vati ve	 fi nanci a l 	 i n st ruments.	 D i vi dends	 are 	 recogni s ed	 when	 the	
right	 to 	 receiv e	 pay m ent	 is	 established.	 Fo r	 listed	 securities ,	 this	 is	 the	 date	 the	 secur i ty 	 is	 listed	 as	 e x -div ide n d.	
Interest income (including interest received from policyholde rs 	 who 	 pay 	 b y 	 i n s t al ment)	 on	 assets	 cl assi fi ed	 as	 l o ans	 an d	
receivables is recognised in the income statement as it accrues and is calculated using the effective interest rate method.  
The effective interest rate method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or liability and of allocating 
the interest income or interest expense over the expected life of the asset or liability. The effective interest rate is the rate
that	 ex actly 	 dis c o unts	 estimate d	 future 	 cash	 flo w s	 to	 the	 instrument's initial carrying amount. Calculation of the effective 
interest rate takes into account fees payable or receivable that are an integral part of the in strument's	 yi el d,	 premi u ms	 or 	
di scounts	 on	 ac qui s i t i o n	 or	 i ssu e,	 earl y	 redemp ti on	 fees	 and 	 transaction costs. All contractual terms of a financial instrument
are	 consi d e r ed	 when	 esti mati ng	 future 	 cash	 fl ows.	 	
Investment income also includes rental income. Rental income represents income arising from operating leases and  
is	 r e co gnised	 on	 a	 str a ight-line	 basis	 ov er	 the	 lease	 ter m.	 	
Government grants 
G o v er nm e n t 	 g r a n t s 	 a r e 	 r ec o g n i s e d 	 w h e r e 	 t h e r e 	 i s 	 r ea s o n a b l e 	 assur a nce	 that	 the	 gr ant	 will	 be received and all attached 
co nditio ns	 will	 be	 co mplied	 with.	 W h en	 the	 gr ant	 r e lates	 to 	 an	 ex pense	 item,	 it	 is	recognised as other income (as fees for 
additional services) over the period necessary to match the grant on a systematic basis to the costs that it is intended to 
co mpensate.	 Where	 the	 grant	 relates	 to 	 an	 asset,	 it	 is	 reco gnised as deferred income and released to the income statement  
in equal amounts over the expected useful life of the related asset. 
Claims and expenses recognition  
Gross claims incurred and claims handling expenses 
Gross	 claims	 include	 all	 claims	 incurred	 du ring	 the	 year,	 whethe r	 rep o rted 	 o r 	 n o t,	 l e ss	 recove ri es,	 together	 wi t h 	 rel a ted	 	
internal and external handling costs that are directly related to 	 the	 processing	 and	 settlement	 of	 claims,	 and	 any	 adjustment	 	
to claims outstanding from previous years.  
Reinsurance claims 
Reinsurance claims recognised and measured in a manner consiste nt	 wi th	 the	 rel a ted	 i n suran c e	 contracts	 i ssued	 by 	 the	 Gr o u p	
and the specific terms of the reinsurance contract. 
Finance	 costs	
Finance	 costs	 comprise	 of	 interest	 paid	 which is recognised in the income statement as it accrues and is calculated by using  
the effective interest rate method. Accrued interest is included 	 w i t h i n 	 t h e 	 c a r r y i n g 	 v a l u e 	 o f 	 t he 	 i n t e r es t 	 b e a r i n g 	 f i n a n c i a l 	 l iability. 
Taxation 
Current tax 
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
The	 tax 	 rates	 and	 tax	 laws	 use d 	 to 	 c o mpute	 the	 amo unt	 are	 those enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. 
Current tax assets and liabilities also include adjustments in respect of tax expected to be payable or recoverable in respect 
of previous periods.  
Current tax relating to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income is recognised in equity or other 
comprehensive income and not in the income statement. 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet liability meth o d ,	 pr ov iding	 fo r 	 temporar y	 diff er ences	 ar ising	 between	the
car r y ing	 amo u nt	 o f 	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 f o r 	 acc o unting	 pur p o s es,	and the amounts used for taxation purposes. It is calculated
at	 the	 tax	 r a tes 	 that	 ar e 	 ex pect ed	 to 	 apply	 in	 t he	 per i o d 	 when 	 the	 liability 	 is	 settled	 o r 	 the	 asset	 is	 r e co v e r e d,	 using	 tax 	 r ates 
enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is 	 pr o b able	 that	 futur e	 tax a ble	 pr o f it s	 w ill	 be 	 available	 against
which	 the	 asset	 can	 be 	 utilised. 	
Deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination (e.g. fair value 
adjustments	 for	 bran ds	 and	 cus t omer	 relations hips)	 in	 which	 case the deferred tax is included as part of the assets and 
liabilities	 assum e d	 fo r 	 the 	 pur p o ses	 o f 	 calculating	 goo d will.	 Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside the income 
statement	 is	 als o 	 recognised	 ou tside	 the	 income	 statement,	 either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity  
as appropriate. 
Def er r ed	 tax 	 assets	 and	 def e r r ed	 tax	 liabi litie s 	 a r e 	 o f f s et,	 if 	 a	legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets
against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.

Impairment of goodwill  
Goodwill	 arising	 on	 a	 business	 combination	 is tested annually for impairment. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying

impairment loss is not reversed. 
Go o d will	 attr ibuted	 to 	 an	 inv e stment	 in	a joint venture accounted under the equity method is not tested for impairment 
separately. The entire carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment only if there is objective evidence of 
impairment. A recognised impairment loss may be reversed if conditions subsequently improve. 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets acquired are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.

through the income statement. Impairment may be reversed if conditions subsequently improve and credited through the 
income statement.

increases of the same asset that have been credited to a revaluation surplus are recorded directly in other comprehensive 
income as a reduction in the revaluation surplus; other decreases are charged to the income statement.  
Financial	 assets 	 	
Classification
Financial	 assets 	 f a lling	 within	 t h e	 sco pe	 o f 	 IAS	 39 	 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement are 
designated/classified as “at fair value through profit or loss” ,	 “ l oans	 and 	 recei v abl e s”,	 “a vai l a bl e-for-sal e ”	 or	 “hel d	 fo r	 tr ading”. 
The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. The Group does not classify any financial
assets as held to maturity financial assets. 
The Group's financial assets include cash and	 cash	 equivalents,	 other	 de btors 	 and	quoted and unquoted financial investments 
including derivatives. Insurance receivables are also presented as financial assets.  
Initial recognition of financial assets  
The Group designates on initial recognition its financial assets held for investment purposes at fair value through the profit or
lo ss	 (“FVTPL”)	 with	 the	 ex ceptio n	 of	 de riv a ti v e s , 	 w h i c h 	 a r e 	 c l a s s i f i e d 	 a s 	 h e l d 	 f o r 	 t r ading,	 and	 an	 unquo ted	 f i nancial	 i nv estment

investments is provided internally to the Group's Directors and key managers on a fair value basis.  
The Group's financial assets are initially recognised at fair valu e,	 plus	 an y 	 dir e ctly	 attr ibutab l e	 transaction	 costs,	 with	 the
ex ceptio n	 of 	 f i nancial	 assets	 at	 FVTPL	 fo r	 whic h	 dir e ctly 	 attr ibutable transaction costs are expensed as incurred. If the Group
determines that the fair value of a financ ial	 ass e t	 o n 	 initial	 r e c o gnitio n	 diff er s	 f r o m	 its	 t r ansac t io n	 pr ice,	 but	 t h e	 f a ir	 v a lue
measurement is not evidenced by a valuation technique that uses 	 onl y 	 d a ta	 f r om	 o b serv abl e 	 markets,	 then	 thi s 	 di fference	 	
is deferred and is subsequently recognised as investment income only to the extent that there is a change in factor (including

Purchases and sales of financial assets are accounted for at the trade date. 
Subsequent measurement
Financial	 assets	 at	 FVTPL 	 are 	 stated	 at	 fa ir	 v a lue,	 with	 any 	 r e s u ltant	 gain	 or 	 loss recognised through profit or loss.

Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost less accumulated impairment losses using the effective interest  
rate method. 
Impairment of financial assets

are	 impaired	 where	 there	 is	 e v idence	 that	one or more events occurring after the initial recognition of the asset may lead to  
a	 reducti o n 	 i n 	 the	 esti mated	 future	 cash	 fl ows	 ari s i n g	 f r om	 the 	 asset. Impairment losses on financial assets classified as loans
and receivables are calculated as the diff e r e n c e 	 b e t w e e n 	 t h e 	 c a r r y i n g 	 v a l u e 	 a n d 	 t h e 	present value of estimated future cash

recognised through the income statement. 
Available-for-sale financial assets

to 	 settle	 o n 	 a	 net	 basis,	 o r 	 to 	 realise	 the	 assets	 and	 settle	the liabilities simultaneously. Income and expenses are not offset
in the income statement unless required or permitted by any accounting standard or interpretation. 
Reinsurance 
The Group cedes insurance risk in the normal course of business for the purpose of limiting its potential losses from accepting
insurance risk. Reinsurance assets represent amounts expected to be recovered from reinsurers in respect of claims incurred 
under the related insurance contracts and are estimated in a m a n n e r 	 co n s i s t e n t 	 w it h 	 t h e 	 o utstanding claims provision  
or settled claims under the related insurance contracts.  
R e i n surance	 assets	 are	 re vi ew ed	 f o r	 i m pai r me nt	 at	 each	 repo rti n g 	 d a t e 	 o r 	 m o r e 	 f r e q u e n t l y 	 w h e n 	 a n 	 i n d i c a t i o n 	 o f 	 i m p a i r m e n t

cost	 less	 accumulated	 impairment	 losses,	 using the effective interest rate method. The carrying value of insurance receivables 
is	 reviewed	 for	 i m pairment	 whenever	 events or circumstances indicate that the ca rr yi ng	 am o unt	 may	 not 	 be 	 reco verabl e,	 	
with	 the	 impair ment	 lo ss	 r e co rded	 in	 the	 income	 statement.

Deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) 
Acquisition costs comprise all commission and other direct and indirect acquisition costs arising from the conclusion  
of insurance contracts. Deferred acquisition costs represent the proportion of acquisition costs incurred that corresponds  
to	 the	 unearne d	 premiums	 pr o v ision	 at	 the	 re porting	 date,	 a n d	are deferred to the extent that these costs are recoverable  
out of future premiums. All other acquisition cost s	 are	 recogni s ed	 as	 an 	 expe nse	 when	 incurred.	
Subsequent	 to 	 i n itial	 r e co gnitio n,	 DAC	 assets	 ar e	 amor tised	over	 th e	 pe riod	 in 	 whic h	 the	 relat e d	 re venues	 are	 earne d.

Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents	 includes	 cash	 in	 hand,	 deposits	 hel d 	 at	 call	 wi th	 banks,	 and	 o the r	 sho r t-term	 depo sits	 with	 	
original maturities of three months or less that are held to mee t 	 sh ort-term	 ca sh	 co mmi t ments	 rather 	 t han	 f o r	 i n vestmen t	 	
or other purposes. 
Insurance contract liabilities  
Provision for unearned premiums  
The provision for unearned premiums represents the portion of premiums received or receivable that relates to risks that  
have not yet expired at the reporting date. The provision is re cognised	 when	 the	 contracts	 are entered into and premiums  
are	 cha r ged,	 an d	 is	 released 	 as 	 earned 	 premium in the income statement over the term 	 of	 the	 contract	 in	 accordance	 with	 	
the pattern of insurance service provided under the contract.

estimated cost of future claims and deferred acquisition costs exceeds the provision for unearned premiums. This calculation 
uses	 current	 es ti mates	 of	 futur e 	 contractual 	 ca sh	 fl ows	 after 	 t aking account of the investment return expected to arise on 
assets relating to the relevant technical provision. If these es timates	 sho w 	 that	 the	 carry i ng	 amo unt	 o f 	 the	 u nearned	 premium	
is	 inadequate,	 the	 def i ciency 	 is	 r e co gnised	 in	 the	 inco me	statement and a corresponding provision for unexpired risk is 
recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position. 
Outstanding claims provision 
The provision for claims outstanding comprises provisions for the estimated cost of settling all claims incurred but not  
settled at the balance sheet date includin g 	 r e l a t e d 	 c l a i m s 	 h a n d l i n g 	 e x p e n s e s , 	 w h e t h e r 	reported or not. Anticipated reinsurance

Financial	 liabilit i e s

financial liabilities. 
Initial recognition  
All financial liabilities are measured initially 	 at	 fair 	 value	 less,	 in	 the	 case	 of 	o t her 	 f i nancial	 liabilities,	 dir e ctly 	 attr ibutable
transaction costs. 
Subsequent measurement
Af ter 	 initial	 r e cognitio n,	 o t her 	 f i nancial	 liabilitie s	 ar e	 subse q uently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method. Gains and losses are recognised in the income 	 statement	 when	 the	 liabilities	 ar e	 der eco gnised.	 	
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any fees or costs that are an	 i n tegral 	 part 	 of 	 ef fecti v e	 i n terest	 rate,	
transaction costs and all other premiums and discounts. The amortisation is included in finance costs in the income statement. 
Derecognition of financial liabilities 
A	 f i nancial	 liability 	 is	 der ec o gnised	 when	 the	 o b ligatio n	 under 	 t he	 liability 	 is	 dischar ged,	 cancel led	 o r 	 ex pir es. 	 W hen	 an	 e x isting
financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially differe nt	 ter ms , 	 o r 	 the	 ter ms	 of 	 an	 ex isting	
liability 	 ar e	 substantially 	 mo dif i ed,	 such	 an	 e x change 	 or 	 mo di f ication is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and
the	 r e co gnitio n	 o f 	 a	 new	 liability ,	 and	 the	 diff e r ence	 in	 the	 r e s pective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement.
Derivatives 
Derivatives are measured at fair value both initially and subsequent to initial recognition. All changes in fair value are 
recognised in the income statement. Derivatives are presented as 	 a s s e t s 	 w h e n 	 t h e 	 f a i r 	 v a l u e s 	 a r e 	 p o s i t i v e	 a n d 	 a s 	 l i a bi li t i e s

Hedge accounting 
The Group does not currently designate any derivatives as hedging instruments. 
Share capital 
Shares	 are	 clas sified	 as	 equity	 when	 there is no contractual obligation to transfer cash or other assets to holders of the  
financial instruments. 
Provisions 
Provisions	 are	 recognised	 when 	 the	 Grou p	 has a present obligation (legal or constructive )	 as	 a	 resul t 	 o f 	 a 	 pa st	 event,	 and	 i t

estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the Group expects some or all of the expenditure required to 
settl e 	 a	 pro v i s i o n	 to	 b e 	 rei m bur s ed,	 the 	 rei m bursement	 i s 	 rec o gni s ed	 as	 a 	 sep a r ate	 asset	 but	 o nl y 	 when 	 the	 r e i m bu rsement	 	
is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the income statement net of any reimbursement.  
If	 the	 e ffect	 of	 t h e	 ti me	 val u e	 o f 	 money 	 i s 	 mat e ri al ,	 pro v i s i o ns 	 are 	 di scounted 	 usi n g	 a	 cu rrent 	 pre-tax 	 rate 	 that	 refl ects,

passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. 
Employee benefits – pensions 
The Group contributes to a defined contribution scheme for its employees. The contributions payable to this scheme  
are charged to the income statement in th e	 acco unting	 per i o d 	 to 	 which	 they	 relate.

Insurance contract liabilities and reinsurance assets 
Estimates have to be made both for the expected ultimate cost of claims reported at the reporting date and for the expected

ultimate claims cost can be established wi th	 c e rtai nty	 f o r 	 so me	 types	 o f 	 cl ai ms.	
The ultimate cost of outstanding claims is estimated by carrying out standard actuar ial	 pr oj e ctio n s	 in	 line	 with	 the	 Institute

19 Financial assets and liabilities (continued) 
19. 3	 Financial	 ri sk	 managemen t 	 objectives 	
The Group is exposed to a range of financial risks through its f i nancial	 assets,	 f i nancial	 liab iliti es,	 r einsur a nce	 assets	 and	
po licy h o l der	 liabilities.	 In	 par t icular ,	 the	 k e y	 f i nancial	 r i sk 	 is that the proceeds from financial assets are not sufficient to fund  
the obligations arising from insurance policies as they fall due. The most important components of this financial risk are  
market	 ri sk 	 (i ncl u di ng	 i n terest	 r a te	 ri sk,	 equi ty 	 pri c e	 ri sk 	 and 	 currency	 ri sk),	 c r e di t 	 ri sk 	 and	 l i qui di t y	 ri sk.	 	
(a) Market risk 
These risks arise from open positions in in t e r e s t 	 r a t e , 	 c u r r e n c y 	 a n d 	 e q u i t y 	 p r o d u c t s , 	 a l l 	 o f 	 w h i c h 	 a r e 	 e x p o s e d 	 t o 	 g e n e r a l 	 a n d 	
specific market movements. The market risks that the Group primarily faces due to the nature of its investments and liabilities
are interest rate risk and equity price risk.  
The Group manages market risk by virtue of its risk manage m e n t 	 f r a m e w o r k , 	 i n c o r p o r a t i n g 	 t h e 	 G r o u p ’ s 	 r i s k 	 a p p e t i t e 	 a n d 	
setting an appropriate investment strategy. 
The majority of investments held are listed and traded on th e	 UK	 and	 other	 re cognis ed	 stock	 exc hanges.	 The 	 Gr ou p	 has	 	
a 	 d e f i n e d 	 i n v e s t m e n t 	 s t r a t e g y 	 a n d 	 m a r k e t 	 r i s k 	 p o l i c y 	 w h i c h 	 s e t s 	 limits	 o n 	 the	 Gr o u p’ s	 ex po sur e 	 by	 setting,	 wher e	 applicable,

managers.	 The	 day-to-da y 	 ma nagement	 of	investments is delegated to the investment fund managers and monitored by  
the Investment Committee.
Investment	 Committe e	 meetin gs,	 chaired	 by	 a	 Non-Executive	 Dire ctor,	 are 	 held	 at	 least	 quart erly.	 At	 these	 meetings,	 	
Non-Executive	 Directors,	 Exec utive	 Directors and senior managers meet to discuss i n v e s t m e n t 	 p e r f o r m a n c e , 	 c o m p o s i t i o n 	 	
and strategy across the Group’s portfolio. More frequent meetings are held by the Executive Directors and senior managers  
to	 moni tor 	 i n ve stment	 perform ance,	 and	 to 	 de termi n e	 whether an Investment Committee should be called outside the  
normal cycle of meetings. 
(i) Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk arises primarily from investments in fixed interest securities. The Investment Committee balances the  
portfolio of investments to manage the exposure to interest rate 	 risk .	 In 	 additi o n,	 to 	 the	 e x tent	 that	 claims	 inflatio n	 is	 	
co r r e lated	 t o 	 int e r e st	 r a tes,	 liabilities	 to 	 po licy h o l der s	 ar e	 exposed	 to 	 inter e st	 rate	 r i sk . 	
The Group monitors interest rate risk on a monthly basis by calculating the mean duration of key elements of the investment 
portfolio and of the liabilities to policyholders under insurance contracts. The mean duration is an indicator of the sensitivity  
of the assets and liabilities to changes in current interest rates. The mean duration of the technical liabilities is determined by 
means	 o f	 pr oje c ting	 exp ected	 cash	 flows 	 using standard actuarial claims projection techniques. Asset allocation decisions made 
by the Investment Committee give due consideration to the duration and profile of liabilities to avoid any significant mismatch
in the asset and liability profiles. In order to preserve capital and to reduce the risk of an investment loss due to interest rate 
movements,	 i t 	 i s 	 acceptabl e 	 f o r 	 the	 durati on 	 o f 	 the	 asset	 po rtf o lio 	 to 	 be	 short er,	 but	 no t 	 lo nger	 than	 the	 av e r age	 duratio n 	 	
of the liabilities. The Group’s investment managers also have the ability to use Government bond futures as a mechanism  
to	 ensure	 p o rt f o l i o 	 dur a ti on	 re mai n s	 wi thi n 	 stri ct	 l i m i t s.	
The	 sensitiv ity 	 analy sis	 f o r 	 inte r e st	 r a te	 r i sk 	 illustr a tes	 ho w	 changes in the fair value or futu re	 cash	 f l ows	 of 	 the	 f i nancial

excha nge	 which 	 are 	 de signated 	 as	 finan cia l 	 assets	 at	 F V TPL.	 E x posures 	 to	 i n di vi dual companies and to equity shares in

(iii) Currency risk 
The Group has exposure to currency risk in respect of certain investments denominated in currencies other than Sterling.  
At	 the	 repo rting	 date	 the	 mo st	 significant	 curre ncies	 to 	 wh ich	 the	 Gr o u p	 is	 ex po sed	 ar e	 Euro s	 and	 US	 Do llar s	 (USD).

(c) Liquidity risk 
Liquidity 	 risk 	 is 	 the	 risk 	 that	 th e	 Gro up, 	 altho u gh	 so lv ent,	 either does not have available sufficient financial resources to enable 
it	 to 	 meet	 its	 o b ligatio ns	 as	 the y 	 fall	 due,	 or 	 can	 secur e 	 them only at excessive cost. The primary liquidity risk of the Group
is the obligation to pay claims to policyholders as they fall due. Liquidity risk is minimal due to the liquid nature of the Group's 
inv estments	 and	 the	 natur e 	 o f 	 the	 business,	 which	 is	 such	 that	 m a t e r i a l 	 l i a b i l it i e s 	 ar e 	 d r i v e n 	 b y 	 c l a i m s 	 c o s t s , 	 w h i c h 	 h a v e 	 a 	
significant lead time from notification to payment. 
In	 o r der	 to 	 mitigate	 liquidity 	 r i s k ,	 the	 matur i ty 	 o f 	 the	 technical liabilities is determined by means of projecting expected cash 
f l o w s	 using	 standar d 	 actuar ial	 claims	 pr o jection techniques. Asset allocation decisions made by the Investment Committee give 
due consideration to the maturity and profile of liabilities to ensure that the maturity of assets is equal to or shorter than the
maturity of liabilities.

In	 accordance	 with	 IFRS	 13 	Fair Value Measurement, financial instruments reported at fair value and revalued properties  
have been categorised into a fair va l u e 	 m e a s u r e m e n t 	 h i e r a r c h y 	 a s 	 f o l l o w s : 	
Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities – (Level 1) 
Inputs to Level 1 fair values are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets. An active market is

or indirectly (derived from prices) – (Level 2).

Insurance risk arises from the inherent uncertainties as to t h e 	 o c c u r r e n c e , 	 a m o u n t 	 a n d 	 t i m i n g 	 o f 	 i n s u r e d 	 e v e n t s . 	 T h e s e 	 	
wo uld	 include	 si gnif icant	 weather 	 r elated	 ev ent s 	 and	 per s o nal 	 injury claims. The Board is responsible for setting the overall 
underwriting	 strategy 	 an d	 de fining	 the	 risk 	 appetite,	 with	 monitoring delegated to the Pricing Committee. The Group uses 
excess of loss reinsurance contracts to mitiga t e 	 i n surance	 ri sk ,	 essenti a l l y 	 by	 reduci ng	 exp o s u re	 to	 l a rge	 i n di vi dual 	 cl ai ms	 	
or aggregated losses from single events.

Claims management risk 
The Group employs a variety of strategies to ensure the correct claims are paid in a timely manner and reserve provisions 
made on a case by case basis to reflect the Group's future liabilities. 
These include: 
 well	 resourced 	 and	 ex pertly	 t r a i ned	 staff 	 benef i t	 from	 image 	 a n d	 wo rk fl ow	 tec hnol o gy 	 to	 c o ntrol 	 p aper 	 fl ow 	 a n d	 pr ocedures

in a dedicated technical unit. 
Reinsurance 
The Group purchases reinsurance as a risk transfer mechanism to mitigate risks that are outside the Group's appetite for 
individual claim or event exposure and to reduce the volatility caused by large individual and accumulation losses. By doing  
so the Group protects its capital and the und e r wr iting	 r e sult	 of	 each	 line	 of 	 business.

accumulation losses arising from natural and other catastrophe events for Home. Motor reinsurance treaties are in place

The	 Grou p's	 reinsurance	 programmes	 are	 re viewed	 on 	 an	 annual	basis and capital modelling is used to identify the most 
appro p r i ate	 st ructur e	 and	 r i sk 	 r etentio n	 pr of il e,	 ta k i ng	 i nt o	 account the Group's business objective of minimising volatility  
and the prevailing cost and availability of reinsurance in the market. 
Counterparty credit risk is a key consid e r a t i o n 	 w h e n 	 t h e 	 G r ou p 	 e n t e r s 	 i n t o 	 r e i nsurance treaties. See note 19.3 (b)  
for more detail.  
Reserving risk 
Reserving risk is defined as the uncertainty regarding either the current level of reserves or the payment distribution over  
their lifetime. The Group analyses and projects historical claims development data and uses a number of actuarial techniques  
to 	 bo th 	 test	 and	 forecast	 claims	 pro v isio ns.	 In 	 additio n,	 the	 Gr oup	 als o 	 p r ovid es	 data 	 to 	 exter n al	 ac tuaries	 w h o	 ass ess	 the	
adequacy of the Group's claims provisions. 
Apart from historical analyses the Group also takes into account changes in risk pr of ile	 and	 under wr iting	 policy 	 co nditio ns,	
changes in legislation or regulation and changes in other external factors. 
The ultimate costs and expenses of the cl ai ms	 fo r	 whi c h	 these 	 reserves 	 are 	 h e l d 	 are	 su bject	 to	 a	 numbe r	 o f 	 materi al 	
uncertainties.	 As	 time	 passes	 between	 the	 repo rting	 of	 a	 clai m	 an d	 the	 final	 settlemen t	 of	 th e	 claim,	 circum stances	 can	 change	
that may require established reserves to be	 a d justed	 ei ther	 up wards 	 or 	 do w n w ards. 	 Factors	 such	 as	 change s	 in	 the	 legal	
env i r o nment,	 results	 o f 	 litigatio n,	 pro p ensity 	 o f 	 per so n al 	 inj u r y 	 claims,	 chan ges	 in	 medical	 and	 care 	 costs,	 and	 costs	 of	 ve hicle
and home repairs can all substantially impact overall costs and expenses	 of	 claims,	 and	 cause	a material divergence from  
the	 bases	 and	 assumptions	 on	 which	 the	 reserves	 were 	 calculated.	 	
Claims subject to periodic payment orders (PPOs) are an area of uncertainty relating to the claims provision at 31 December 
2 0 1 5 . 	 For	 known	 PPOs	 and	 clai ms	 which	 have	 been	 identified	 as	 p o t e n t i al 	 P P O 	 a w a r d s , 	 c as h 	 f l o w 	 p r o j e c t i o n s 	 a r e 	 c ar r i e d 	 o u t 	 	
in order to estimate an ultimate cost on a gross and net of reinsurance basis. The cash fl ow 	 projections	 are 	 undertaken	 	
on a discounted basis. The total net claims provision recognised for PPOs and potential PPOs in the consolidated statement  
of financial position represents less than 5% of net claims outstanding at 31 December 2015. In the context of the Group's 
approach to the mitigation and manageme nt	 of 	 underw r i t i n g	 ri sk,	 i t s	 rei n sura nce	 pro g ramme	 (i ncl u di ng	 i t s	 appro a ch	 to 	
mitigating counterparty cred i t 	 r i s k ) 	 a n d 	 t h e 	 G r o u p ' s 	 p r u d e n t 	 a p p r o ac h 	 t o 	 r e s e r v i n g 	 f o r 	 p o t e n t i al 	 P P O s , 	 t h e 	 r i s k 	 o f 	 a n 	 a d v e r s e 	
development of the Group's reserves for PPO claims is not considered to be significant.

Reserving risk (continued) 
In	 addi ti on,	 the 	 Mi ni stry	 o f 	 J u st i c e	 has	 been	 re vi ewi n g	 the	 di sc ount	 rate	 used 	 i n 	 the	 cal c ul ati o n	 of 	 damage 	 a w ards 	 i n 	 bo di l y 	
injury and fatal claims for some time. At the date these financ ial	 statements	 were	 approved,	 t he discount rate used in these 
calculations remained at 2.5% and individual case reserves have been established by applying this discount rate.  
In the context of the Group's reinsurance programme and its approach to the mitigation 	 of	 rei n surance	 count erpart y	 c re di t 	 ri sk,
a reduction in the discount rate is unlikely to result in a material deterioration of the Group's financial performance. Were an
adjustment to be made to total reserves to reflect an assumed r e ductio n	 o f 	 o n e	 per centage	 po int,	 the	 impact	 o f 	 this	 allo wance	
wo uld	 be 	 to 	 inc r ease	 the	 net	 cl aims	 pr ov isio n	 reco gnised	 in	 the consolidated statement of financial position by less than £2.0m
at 31 December 2015. 
The	 Gr o u p' s	 po l i cy 	 is	 to 	 ho ld	 suf f i cient	 pro v isions,	 including	 th ose	 to	 c o ver 	 cl a i ms	 whi c h	 have	 been	 i n curre d	 but	 not	 repo rted	
(“IBNR”) to meet all liabilities as they fall due. Apart from that 	 par t 	 of 	 the	 pr ov isio ns	 r e lating	 to 	 PPO s,	 claims	 pro v isio ns	 are not 
discounted. The Directors remain satisfied that the outstanding claims reserves included in these financial statements provide 
an appropriate margin over projected ultimate claims costs.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
MILESTONES
THIS YEAR MARKED THE 10TH
ANNIVERSARY OF OUR LISTING ON THE
LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE. I AM 
DELIGHTED TO REPORT THAT ONCE AGAIN
WE HAVE DELIVERED ANOTHER STRONG
SET OF RESULTS PROVING THE 
SUCCESS OF OUR STRATEGY AND THE 
STRENGTH OF OUR BRAND.
The past decade has been an exciting time in the 
Company’s history. We have transformed the business
from a modest 54 store outfit with 301 staff to a
European operation with over 321 stores and 1,722 
employees in the UK and Holland.
Total Shareholder return since listing has been excellent,
£100 invested in 1997 would have grown to £2,822, 
outperforming the FTSE250 by over 800%. In the past 10
years we have returned over £200 million to shareholders
by way of dividends and share buybacks.
Financial Results
Total Group revenue increased 15.4% to £207.9 million
(2006: £180.2 million) with like-for-like revenue for the
period up 4.7% on last year, which we have achieved
despite the continuing challenging retail market.
Operating profit for the period was £44.3 million (2006:
£38.9 million) giving a profit before tax of £37.8 million

(2006: £39.1 million), impacted by a higher interest charge
as a result of the refinancing for the share buy back.
Basic earnings per share increased to 15.09 pence (2006:
12.80 pence).
Dividend
In line with our progressive dividend policy, the Board is
recommending a final dividend of 6.95 pence per share.
This, once approved by shareholders at the Annual
General Meeting, is payable on 31 January 2008 to all
shareholders on the register as at 4 January 2008. This
brings the total dividend to 10.70 pence per share an
increase of 2.9% on 2006.
Board Changes
In March this year we announced the appointment of
Robert Parker as Finance Director, succeeding Andrew
Liggett who left the Company in April. On behalf of the
entire Board, I extend a warm welcome to Rob.

We also announced in September that Nick Ounstead, who
has been Chief Executive Officer for the last five years,
would be taking on a new executive Board role of
Business Development Director with responsibility for
buying, Holland and Group business development. I would
like to thank Nick for his leadership and contribution to
Topps throughout his tenure as Chief Executive.
Matt Williams succeeded Nick as Chief Executive Officer
from 1st November 2007. Matt joined Topps in 1998 in 
the property department. He was promoted to Chief
Operating Officer in 2004 and joined the Board in 2006.
Matt is already demonstrating his ability and drive and I
am confident that with this first class executive team we
have the best management in place to take the business
forward.
People 
Exceptional customer service is the core of our business
and critical to our continued success. It is our people and
not our products that achieve this.
I would like to extend the Board’s thanks and gratitude to
everyone in the Company for their constant efforts in
helping us to realise value for our shareholders.
Outlook
As the business continues to grow in size, revenue and
market share we maintain our investment in the future of
the business and our people. 
The business is in excellent shape and in very capable
hands and I am confident that we will continue to achieve 
sustainable growth and deliver value for our shareholders
in 2008 and beyond.

OUR 
CORE BRANDS
THE GROUP TRADES
UNDER THREE CORE
BRAND NAMES:
TOPPS TILES
Operating from 246 stores nationwide,
Topps Tiles still maintain their No. 1 
position as the UK’s largest supplier of
Ceramic Wall & Floor tiles – Natural Stone
– Laminate & Real Wood for Domestic and
commercial use.
Since 1963 it’s been at the forefront of the Company’s policy to
offer the very best customer service that is honest, helpful and 
knowledgeable but NEVER pushy, this is backed up by offering
value for money with a host of unique consumer benefits like
the Topps free ‘How to’ DVD, a 45 day return & buy back service,
a lifetime guarantee on all BAL adhesives & grouts, and many
more.
With the Company’s continuous drive and focus on customer
service, we are confident that the business will maintain its 
competitive position.
TOPPS 
HOLLAND
Trading since 2002 
Topps Floorstore with its 20 stores across Holland
is the leading specialist of wood flooring in Holland. 
We continue to develop the business and with 
an increasing focus on the ceramic tile offer we
believe the brand will go from strength to strength.
We believe that there is an opportunity for in
excess of 60 stores.
TILE CLEARING
HOUSE
Tile Clearing house has become a
brand of its own operating from 55
stores in the UK, which to date
makes it the second largest tile
Group in the UK behind Topps Tiles. 
This brand is aimed at a slightly different consumer 
sector which in the main are jobbing builders, small 
contractors and bulk purchases, with the addition of end
of line and discontinued products, but offering greater
stock levels of these products. The Tile Clearing house
brand is in prominent positions in towns where Topps
Tiles are sited. TOPPS TILES PLC

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
WE HAVE AGAIN THIS YEAR 
DEMONSTRATED THE STRENGTH OF OUR
STRATEGY AND OUR ORGANIC GROWTH.
OUR MARKET LEADING POSITION,
EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND
COMMITTED STAFF HAVE ALL 
CONTRIBUTED TO ANOTHER SOLID YEAR
DESPITE A TOUGH HOME IMPROVEMENT
MARKET.
Tile Clearing House (“TCH”)
Tile Clearing House, our “cash and carry” offering has had
a strong trading period. We have opened a net 9 new TCH
outlets and the format continues to prove popular with
both trade customers and jobbing builders. We now have
a total of 55 stores in the UK. New locations include
Dartford, Southend, Plymouth and Lincoln. 
Holland
Against the backdrop of a stable market, we have seen
good growth in sales and profits in our Dutch business.
We opened a further five stores taking the total to 20.
Our marketing activity has been at a local level to date.
However, as we experienced with the UK market, as we
begin to reach a size that brings scalable benefits we
anticipate increasing our advertising and marketing to a
national audience. We continue to improve the mix of
sales with 25% now coming from tiles and the remainder
from wood flooring, accessories and adhesives. Plans for
the current year include the opening of a minimum of a 
further five new stores.
UK Store Development and Expansion
We are pleased to have again achieved our store opening
target of 30 net new stores in the period, giving us an
overall total of 301 trading outlets throughout the UK. We
have modified the target going forward to a minimum of
20 net new stores reflecting a wider focus on improving
and renewing the estate.  
Topps Tiles
We have opened 25 stores in new locations, rebranded 2
from the TCH format, refitted 10 outlets and closed or
relocated a further 6 giving us a total of 246 Topps
stores. New locations include Crewe, Sheffield, Gloucester,
Aylesbury, Scarborough, Brixton and Byfleet.
We continue to develop our store portfolio and have now
rolled out our new format across a total of 65 stores. The
new enhanced display formats are proving popular with
both customers and staff. We introduced a number of new
ranges with a particular focus on natural products due to
their increasing popularity. 
Our aim is simple – to deliver sustainable
growth and returns to shareholders and 
central to that aim are our customers. We
strive to enhance our customers’ buying
experience by constantly improving stores
and ranges and offering the best in customer
service. TOPPS TILES PLC
Annual Report & Financial Statements 2007

Marketing, advertising and sponsorship
Over the last year we have maintained our national and
regional marketing and advertising campaigns with
Carlton Weather and our sponsorship of the UK Style
channel.
This year we also signed a sponsorship deal with Leicester
City Football Club to coincide with the kick-off of the new
football season in August. Although a commercial deal we
very much see this as an extension to our community
youth football initiative. Topps Tiles is Britain’s biggest
supporter of community youth football and we currently
sponsor around 300 local teams nationwide. 
Staff development and customer service
Recruiting and retaining ambitious people at Topps is a
core part of our strategy. We place significant emphasis
on the training and development of our employees. We
have continued to develop our e-learning training system
in store with a number of new courses. 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT continued
Group revenue was £207.9m, an increase of
15.4% on last year with like-for-like revenue
for the period up 4.7%. Group operating profit
was £44.3 million, an increase of 14.1% 
compared with last year.
We differentiate our business from the competition in a
number of ways. All of our stores carry a wide range and
supply of stock, we offer a loan-a-tile service, a free “How
to” DVD, a tile cutting service and a buy-back service
allowing customers to “sell back” undamaged tiles within
45 days of purchase. These services coupled with friendly
and knowledgeable staff offering technical advice led to
97.6% of customers surveyed expressing levels of 
satisfaction as ‘good to excellent’ (2006: 99.1%).
Corporate responsibility
Topps believes in conducting its business in a manner
which achieves sustainable growth whilst incorporating
and demonstrating social responsibility. Our policy is 
published on our website at www.toppstiles.co.uk and
more detail on our achievements can be found later in
this report.
The Board takes regular account of social, environmental
and ethical matters in the business of the Group and
believes in being responsible in the way that it conducts
its operations.  TOPPS TILES PLC

a requirement for a broader product offering and also a
trend towards refurbishing traditional rooms more 
regularly.
Alongside these consumer trends household numbers
continue to grow faster than the UK population, which is
anticipated to rise by 12% over the next 25 years (source:
ONS). This is in contrast to the increasing number of
households, which is expected to grow by almost 23% in
the next 20 years, from 20.9m in 2003 to 25.7m in 2026,
3 million of these are expected to be built by 2020.
(source: Government forecasts).
We therefore believe Topps is well placed to benefit from
these consumer and housing trends driving the growth in
the tile market. 
Current Trading and Outlook              
In the first 7 weeks of the new financial period Group
overall revenue increased by 8.4% and like for like sales
by 1.1%.
In the UK revenue increased 8.1% and like for like sales by
1.0%. In Holland overall sales increased 18.1% with like for
like sales up 2.5%.
We have had a challenging but positive start to the new
financial period and there remains an underlying growth
trend in the retail tile market. Whilst we believe the
prospects for the future growth of Topps Tiles remain
broadly positive we must not underestimate the potential
impact that this year’s turmoil in financial markets will
ultimately have on consumers.  
Matthew Williams
Chief Executive Officer
Topps is pleased to be a constituent member of the
FTSE4Good UK Index.
The Market
We are the leading tile retailer in the UK with an estimated
market share of in excess of 22% and we have continued
to grow market share over the last financial year.
The Home Improvement retail sector continues to see
overall expansion and the UK tile market is forecast to
grow by volume by over 15% between 2007 and 2011
(source: MBD).
There is significant potential for growth in our 
marketplace with the UK still having one of the lowest
usages per head of ceramic tiles in Europe, at a level
around one third of that of other Northern European
countries (source: MBD). Consumers are becoming more
demanding and buying trends are showing the desire to
tile rooms beyond the traditional kitchen and bathroom,

Nature, Objectives and Strategies of the Business
Topps Tiles is a specialist tile & wood flooring retailer with
operations in the UK and Holland.
In the UK, we are the country’s largest retailer of our kind
with 301 stores and a 22% market share. We operate two
retail brands, Topps Tiles and Tile Clearing House. Topps is
the UK’s leading branded tile retailer with 246 stores
offering wall and floor tiles, natural stone, laminate, solid
wood flooring and a comprehensive range of associated
products such as underfloor heating, adhesives and
grouts. Tile Clearing House is the biggest clearance tile
retailer in the UK with 55 stores nationwide focussing on
a mini warehouse type format and a “when it’s gone it’s
gone” style customer offer.
We have a growing European operation in Holland with 20
stores trading with a similar style customer offer to the
Topps UK stores.
The Topps’ strategy, which has been in place for a number
of years, has served the business extremely well - to be a
specialist tile retailer operating from prominent, low
rental locations offering customers a wide range of 
quality products with fantastic service at attractive prices.
From this comes the four cornerstones of our competitive
advantage – customer service, store locations, store 
layout and stock availability. This has enabled us to 
deliver 10 years of successful financial results, build an
economically attractive and resilient business and become
the market leading brand in the UK.
BUSINESS REVIEW
IN THE UK, WE ARE THE COUNTRY’S LARGEST 
RETAILER OF OUR KIND WITH 301 STORES AND A 22% 
MARKET SHARE.
301
Stores trading across the UK.
22%+
Group share of the UK tile market. Key Operational objectives for the UK and Holland:
+ Continue our expansion of stores in the UK towards our
stated objective of over 400 stores across both brands.
+ Consolidate our position as the national brand for tiles 
and wood flooring.
+ Improve the economic returns in our Dutch operation 
towards the levels we generate in the UK – principally 
by improving sales density and product mix to improve 
gross margins and continue our expansion to a 
minimum of 60 stores.
+ Continue to develop our in store customer offer to 
ensure that we are always ahead of our competitors.
+ To continuously review our store estate ensuring the 
appropriate number of new openings, refits and 
closures are commensurate with availability and 
economic environment.
Financial objectives:
+ Financial reporting is a cornerstone of any successful 
business and it is imperative that we deliver the right 
information to the right people at the right time. We 
include management, employees, investors and other 
stakeholders in this process and strive to be as
transparent and honest in our reporting as possible.
+ We plan to grow dividends for shareholders broadly in 
line with earnings, subject to the investment needs of 
the business and an acceptable level of dividend cover. 
+ We will seek to maintain an appropriate capital 
structure, financing our operations through a 
combination of retained profits and bank borrowings.
+ Treasury management is now a key part of our financial
objectives and we will continue to manage our day to 
day cash reserves as effectively as possible and 
minimise the overall Group interest charge.
+ Reviewing all of our suppliers and ensuring that we are 
receiving good value for money is an important aspect 
of any financial agenda. We will continue with this 
process and will commence a three year rolling review 
of all non stock suppliers where benchmarking and 
tendering processes will be actively employed.

Gross margin
Overall gross margin was 62.8% compared with 62.6%
last year. At the interim stage of this period gross margin
was 62.6%. In the second half of the period we have 
generated a gross margin of 63.0%. 
Operating expenses
Total operating costs have increased from £73.9 million to
£86.2 million, an increase of 16.7%.
Costs as a percentage of sales were 41.4% compared to
41.0% last year.
Operating Profit
Operating profit for the period was £44.3 million 
compared to £38.9m in the same period last year, an
increase of 14.1%. This represented a 21.3% return on
sales (2006: 21.6%).
Other gains and losses
Other gains & losses include the impact of property 
disposals. Property disposals accounted for £0.3m (2006:
£0.3m) driven by a sale of a long leasehold on our
Aberdeen store. 
Financing
The net interest charge for the year was £6.8m (2006:
£0.1m). This charge has increased as a result of the 
£116m loan that was obtained in 2006 to finance the
share buyback programme. The charge for the year also
includes a fair value adjustment of £0.5m relating to the
interst rate hedging we have in place. The interest rate
derivatives have been re-valued per the requirements of
IAS39 “Financial Instruments; Recognition and
Measurement”.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) continued
In addition, the Directors receive information on non
financial metrics including:
  Customer satisfaction (page 6)
  Utilisation of own fleet (page 17)
Risks and Uncertainties
Risks to the business include its relationship with key 
suppliers, the potential threat of competitors, the risk that
key information technology or EPOS systems could fail;
the loss of key personnel, the risk of a prolonged 
economic recession and the development of substitute
products. 
The Directors routinely monitor all these risks and 
uncertainties and appropriate actions are taken to 
mitigate the risks and/or their potential outcomes. During
the coming year a series of detailed reviews will be 
performed across the business which will ensure we have
up to date and robust contingency plans in place for all
areas.

Revenue
Revenue for the period ended 29 September 2007
increased by 15.4% to £207.9 million (2006: £180.2

Whilst interest rates have increased through the year
which has increased the interest charge in the P&L, in
January we put in place interest rate derivatives, this has
provided us with helpful economic protection during the
year, however, the requirements of IAS39 have led to an
additional charge this year resulting from a high degree
of volatility in the financial markets over the final quarter
of the year.  
Earnings per Share
Basic and diluted earnings per share grew by 17.9% to
15.09p and 15.02p respectively.
Dividend and dividend policy
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 6.95 pence
per share, which will give a total dividend for the period of
10.70 pence compared to 10.40 pence last year, an
increase of 2.9%.
We have a maintained a progressive dividend policy.
Stock
Stock at the period end represents 146 days turnover
compared with 146 days for the same period last year.  
Capital Structure and Treasury
Cash reserves at the period end were £15.8 million (2006:
£16.5 million) with borrowings at £111.0 million (2006: £116
million).  
This gives the Group a net debt position of £95.2 million
compared to £99.5 million as at 1 October 2006.
In August 2006 the Company borrowed £116m to fund a 3
for 4 share buyback programme. Through the financial
year we have been able to maintain an appropriate level
of cash reserves in the business. 
BUSINESS REVIEW continued

(2006: £37 .9m).
Profit before tax
Reported profit before tax decreased by 3.2% to £37.8
million (2006: £39.1 million). This reduction is driven by
the additional interest charge described above. The net
result of the share buyback has generated a significant
increase in the EPS return (see below).
Group profit before tax margin was 18.2% down from
21.7% last year.
Interest and tax
The effective rate of Corporation Tax was 32.0% 
compared with 28.8% last year. The underlying tax rate,
excluding adjustments in respect of previous periods is
30.8%.
Net interest cover was 7.7 times based on earnings before
interest, tax and depreciation, excluding the impact of
IAS39 in finance charges.
Balance Sheet
Capital Expenditure
Capital expenditure in the period amounted to £9.7 
million. This includes the cost of acquiring 2 freehold sites
for £1.7 million and development of a store site for £0.3
million, short leasehold additions totalled £0.1 million.
We have fitted out 50 stores and undertaken preparatory
work on a further 4 stores and refits at a cost of £6.8 
million.
We continue to update and expand our IT systems within
the business and this coupled with some motor vehicle
renewals accounted for £0.7 million.
At the period end the Group owned 12 freehold sites
including 2 warehouse and distribution facilities with a
total net book value of £17.7 million. The highly cash generative nature of our business means
that the Group has always been able to fund its new store
expansion programme from its own resources and to 
purchase freehold sites as suitable opportunities arise
and we expect this to continue.
Cashflow
Net cash generated by operating activities was £49.8 
million, £11.9million higher than last year reflecting the
higher trading profit and improved working capital 
management.

The Annual General Meeting for the period to 29
September 2007 will be held on 8th January 2008 at

CORPORATE AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (CSR)
THE TEAM AT TOPPS TILES IS VERY PROUD OF THE
WORK THAT WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN ON CORPORATE
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. THIS IS NOT A NEW AREA FOR THE
BUSINESS AS WE HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO WORK 
RESPONSIBLY WITH ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS FOR A
NUMBER OF YEARS.
Our responsibilities cover many areas, and in 2004 we
established a working party chaired by a main Board
Director to review our policies and look for opportunities
for improvement. The areas we have given most focus to
are:
  Community Relations
  Environment
  Workplace & Employees
  Supply Chain
The Group is currently a constituent of the FTSE4 Good
Index of socially responsible UK quoted companies. 
The FTSE4 Good Index is designed to measure the 
performance of companies that meet globally recognised
corporate responsibility standards and to facilitate 
investment in those companies where CSR issues are an
influencing factor in the investors decision making
process. We aim to comply with the criteria set by the
operators of this Index and are actively engaged in 
further developments of CSR policies to ensure ongoing
compliance.
Community Relations
Community Relations is an area the business has 
supported over a long period of time.
Topps is one of the biggest supporters of youth football in
the UK, providing new kits and equipment to junior teams
local to our stores. Whenever we open a new store we
make a point of selecting a local team to support. This is 
a simple and effective way of reaching out to the local 
community wherever we decide to trade. This makes us
one of the biggest supporters of youth football in the UK
and we currently support over 300 teams. We are very
proud of this association.
In addition, this year, we have extended this policy by
becoming the shirt sponsors of Leicester City Football
Club. Whilst this is a commercial deal, it is a valuable
piece of community relations and re-affirms our 
commitment to our head office and distribution centre,
based on the outskirts of Leicester.

sponsor in the UK. TOPPS TILES PLC

waste & transport. We regularly review our progress in
these areas and introduce more environmentally 
responsible practices where possible.
Property – energy is a major driver of cost for the 
business and also forms a significant part of our 
environmental impact. Energy efficient lighting helps to
reduce the impact. We also plan to implement automated
meter reading in a portion of our stores in the coming
year. This data will enable us to become even more 
efficient in our stores by helping us to identify where 
savings could be made.
Waste – waste management is an important area for our
business and we recycle as much as possible. Stores
return paper, plastic & cardboard to the central warehouse
for recycling.
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
Community Relations continued
In addition, we are also a long term supporter of the 
charity Asthma UK and have been raising money for
seven years. Asthma UK is dedicated to improving the
health and wellbeing of 5.2 million people in the UK
whose lives are affected by this condition. Asthma UK was
the natural choice of charity for Topps to adopt, as our
products help to reduce the levels of house dust mites
which are one of the triggers of asthma attacks.
2007 has been another successful year of charity
fundraising at Topps. During the year we have raised over
£100,000, £60,000 coming from our annual charity 
auction which we host with our key suppliers. This now
brings the total raised to date to over £600,000.
Environment
There are three primary areas where our business 
potentially impacts the environment. These are property, 
Passionate Leicester City supporter
Christopher McMullen (10) saw his
dream come true when Topps
arranged for him to meet his heroes.
Chris, who suffers from chronic 
asthma, is a striker for Braunstone
Acorns U11s, sponsored by Topps. His
visit to Leicester’s training ground
was a special "thank you" for raising
nearly £2,000 for Asthma UK. He is
pictured with DJ Campbell (left) and
Ian Hume.
£100,000
Raised during the year for Asthma UK. Our offices recycle all used paper and we continue to
move our reporting away from being paper based and
issue increasing numbers of reports in electronic format.
Transport – the group uses a combination of owned and
third party transport for delivering product to stores. We
operate a modern and efficient fleet of vehicles. All new
lorries comply with the Euro 4 emissions regulations and
come ready equipped with driver efficiency monitoring
systems. This technology enables us to plan the most 
efficient routes and also monitor our drivers’ 
performance. We utilise out own fleet for 83% of our
products distributed (2006: 70%). 
Workplace & Employees
We have a duty to our employees to provide them with a
safe and comfortable working environment. We operate a
Health & Safety Committee which meets on a regular
basis and is chaired by a Board Director and we maintain
regular dialogues with staff and our in house Health &
Safety Team. This team carries out regular assessments
of the workplace and employee sentiment to ensure that
we provide an optimal working environment.   
Communication with our employees is vital and to ensure
that we communicate as effectively as possible we 
produce an in-house magazine six times a year which
updates all employees on what is happening across the
business. Our employee suggestion scheme which is 
overseen by our Business Development Director, Nick
Ounstead, is also an important part of communication
with our employees. This helps to improve the business
across a number of areas.
We have an active policy of internal promotion, where
possible, and encourage our staff to apply for internal
vacancies and promotions. To support this we conduct
regular dialogues with employees on job and career 
development.
We are committed to being an equal opportunities
employer and have policies in place which are clearly
communicated to all of our staff.
Supply Chain
We source our goods for resale from around the world
including tiles, natural stone, wooden flooring and 
adhesives.
Labour standards, factory conditions and human rights
are issues we take seriously. To address any possible 
concerns our buyers conduct regular supplier visits and
factory tours and also include a clause in all contracts
with suppliers which stipulate our requirements.
We work closely with all our suppliers to source products
and distribution routes which will have a positive impact
on environmental performance and sustainability. We
have also developed a policy on timber products and have
adopted the principles and criteria of the Forest
Stewardship Council as our benchmark.
Our full CSR policy and targets can be found on our 
website at www.toppstiles.co.uk in the investor section
under corporate responsibility.

"Asthma UK is delighted to be supported by Topps Tiles employees and customers. This year our fundraising target reached £600,000
which was a great achievement and will go a long way to helping the 5.2 million people with asthma in the UK today. The money Topps
Tiles has raised has supported a number of projects over the years including information packs for schools, providing asthma training
resources at various Primary Care Trusts and setting up children’s asthma clinics. We look forward to working with Topps Tiles for
many more years and launching more innovative and exciting fundraising ideas to help us reach £1million!"

Disabled employees
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the 
applicant concerned. In the event of members of staff becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their
employment with the Group continues and that appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of the Group that the
training, career development and promotion of disabled persons should, as far as possible, be identical with that of other
employees.
Employee consultation
The Group places considerable value on the involvement of its employees and has continued to keep them informed on

through formal and informal meetings and the Company magazine. Employee representatives are consulted regularly on a
wide range of matters affecting their current and future interests.
Financial risk management, objectives and policies
The Group is exposed to certain financial risks, namely interest rate risk, currency risk and credit risk. Information 
regarding such financial risk is detailed in notes 16, 17 and 19. The Group’s risk management policies and procedures are
also discussed in the Business Review.
Share option schemes
The Directors recognise the importance of motivating employees and believe that one of the most effective incentives is
increased employee participation in the Company through share ownership. This has been achieved through the 
introduction of a number of employee sharesave, share bonus, approved and unapproved share option schemes, since the
flotation in 1997.
The total of options held by employees, excluding Directors, is 1,306,491. The Directors will continue to incentivise 
employees through additional employee share option schemes in the forthcoming financial period. 24

DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
For the 52 week period ended 29 September 2007  
Information given to auditors
Each of the Directors at the date of approval of this report confirms that:
  So far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
  The Directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a Director to make themselves aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of s234ZA of the Companies Act.
Auditors
A resolution to re-appoint Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company’s auditor will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual
General Meeting.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. The Directors are required by
the IAS Regulation to prepare the Group financial statements under IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The Group
financial statements are also required by law to be properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.  
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that IFRS financial statements present fairly for each financial year the 
Company’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects
of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, 
liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the preparation
and presentation of financial statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance
with all applicable IFRSs. However, Directors are also required to:
  properly select and apply accounting policies;
  present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; and 
  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance.
The Directors have elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). The parent Company
financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company. In preparing
these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
  make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
  state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the parent Company financial statements comply
with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on
the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
On behalf of the Board

Annual Report & Financial Statements 2007
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS
In June 1998 the Hampel Committee and the London Stock Exchange published the Combined Code on corporate 
governance. This combines the Cadbury Code on corporate governance, the Greenbury Code on Directors’ remuneration
and new requirements arising from the findings of the Hampel Committee.
Statement of compliance with the Code of Best Practice
The Company has complied throughout the period with the Provisions of the Code of Best Practice set out in section 1 of
the Combined Code except for provision A6.1, as the Board does not currently undertake formal appraisal of it’s own 
performance and that of it’s committees, but is currently in the process of implementing such a procedure. The Company
complies with all other provisions of the code.
Code Provision C.3.1 requires the members of the audit committee to be named in the report and financial statements.
Mr. W.A. McIntosh (Chairman), Mr. V.H. Watson and Mr. J.M. Jack have served on the committee throughout the period.
The Board of Directors comprises seven members, of whom three are independent Non-Executive Directors and three are
Executive Directors, led by the Company’s Non-Executive Chairman, Mr B. J. F. Bester. The Senior Independent Non-
Executive Director is Mr W.A. McIntosh, who also chairs the Audit Committee. Brief biographical details of all Directors are
given on pages 18 and 19. The Board meets at least twelve times a year. Certain defined issues are reserved for the Board 
including approval of financial statements and circulars, Annual budgets, strategy, Directors’ appointments, service 
agreements and remuneration, internal control and risk management, corporate governance, key external and internal
appointments and pensions and employee incentives.
In advance of Board meetings Directors are supplied with up-to-date information about the trading performance of each
operating location, the Group’s overall financial position and its achievement against prior year, budgets and forecasts. 
Where required, a Director may seek independent professional advice at the expense of the Company, all Directors have
access to the Company Secretary and they may also address specific issues to the Senior Independent Non-Executive
Director. 
In accordance with the articles of association, all Directors are subject to re-election every third year. Directors are 
elected at the first AGM after appointment, therefore, Rob Parker will be subject to election at the forthcoming AGM. All
Non-Executive Directors have written letters of appointment. These letters of appointment stipulate three-year renewable
terms of office. In line with the Code all Non-Executive Directors who have served for nine years will be subject to annual
re-election. As such, Victor Watson and Alan McIntosh will be subject to re-election at the forthcoming AGM. Although
their length of service exceeds nine years the Board regards them to be independent and considers their broad based
commercial experience and extensive business specific knowledge to be extremely beneficial. However the Board is 
continually reviewing this situation.
The Board considers that Messrs W.A. McIntosh, V. H. Watson and The Rt Hon J. M. Jack are all independent for the 
purposes of the 2003 Code. The terms and conditions for the appointment of Non-Executive Directors are available for
inspection on request.
The Board also operates three committees. These are the Nomination Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the
Audit Committee. All of these committees meet regularly and have formal written terms of reference which are available
for inspection on request.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS continued
Statement about applying the Principles of Good Governance
The Company has applied the Principles of Good Governance set out in section 1 of the Combined Code by complying with
the Code of Best Practice as reported above. Further explanation of how the Principles have been applied in connection
with Directors’ remuneration is set out in the Remuneration Report.
Audit Committee
The audit committee consists entirely of independent Non-Executive Directors. The current chairman is Alan McIntosh
who is regarded as having recent and relevant financial experience, the other members are Victor Watson and Michael
Jack.  
The audit committee considers the nature and scope of the audit process (both internal and external) and its 
effectiveness. The committee reviews and approves the internal audit programme, meets with the external auditors and
considers the annual and interim financial statements before submission to the Board. The committee reviews the
arrangements by which staff may, in confidence, raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial
reporting or other matters. The committee also reviews the Group’s system of internal control and reports its findings
twice yearly to the Board. The committee meets with the external auditors at least twice a year.
As stated above, part of the role of the audit committee is to review the independence of the Company’s auditors. The
Company’s external auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP have provided non-audit services to the Company in the form of tax
advice. The audit committee is aware that providing audit and non-audit advice could give rise to a potential conflict of
interest. The audit committee has concluded that the auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP, are independent.
Nomination Committee
The nominations committee is chaired by Victor Watson. The other members are currently Alan McIntosh, Michael Jack
and Barry Bester. The formal terms of reference for this committee require it to make recommendations to the Board for
appointments of Directors and other senior executive staff. 
Appointments to the Board are made on merit, against objective criteria, taking into account the skills and experience
required. Where appropriate, external search consultants are enlisted.
Dialogue with institutional shareholders
The Directors seek to build on a mutual understanding of objectives between the Company and its institutional 
shareholders by making annual presentations and communicating regularly throughout the year. The Company also posts
financial information on its website www.toppstiles.co.uk.
Maintenance of a sound system of internal control
The Board has applied Principle C.2 of the Combined Code by establishing a continuous process for identifying, evaluating
and managing the significant risks the Group faces. The Board regularly reviews the process, which has been put in place
from the start of the period to the date of the approval of this report and which is in accordance with Internal Control:
Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code published in September 1999. The Board is responsible for the Group’s 
system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against
material misstatement or loss.
In compliance with Provision C.2.1 of the Combined Code, the Board continuously reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s
system of internal control. The Board’s monitoring covers all controls, including financial, operational and compliance 
controls and risk management. It is based principally on reviewing reports from management to consider whether 
significant risks are identified, evaluated, managed and controlled and whether any significant weaknesses are promptly
remedied and indicate a need for more extensive monitoring. The Board has also performed a specific assessment for the
purposes of this annual report. This assessment considers all significant aspects of internal control arising during the
period covered by the report including the work of internal audit. The audit committee assists the Board in discharging its
review responsibilities. 27

REMUNERATION REPORT
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 which introduced
new statutory requirements for the disclosure of Directors’ remuneration in respect of periods ending on or after 31
December 2002. The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority
and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors’ remuneration. As
required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the
Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Company’s members on the “auditable part” of the Directors’ 
remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Regulations). The report has therefore been divided into
separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee, which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations
of the Combined Code. The members of the committee are Mr McIntosh, Mr Watson and The RT. Hon. Mr Jack who are all
independent Non-Executive Directors, with the committee chaired by Mr McIntosh.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interests arising from
cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business. The Committee makes recommendations to the
Board. No Director plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
Remuneration policy
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the high calibre
needed to maintain the Group’s position as a market leader and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders. The
performance measurement of the executive Directors and key members of senior management and the determination of
their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the Committee. The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is
determined by the Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association.
There are three main elements of the remuneration package for executive Directors:
  basic annual salary (including Directors’ fees) and benefits;
  annual bonus payments;
  pension arrangements.
Basic salary
An executive Director’s basic salary is determined by the Committee prior to the beginning of each year and when an 
individual changes position or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group as a whole
and relies on objective research which gives up-to-date information on a comparator group of companies. Basic salaries
were reviewed in September 2007 with increases taking effect from 1 November 2007. Executive Director’s contracts of
service which include details of remuneration will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
In addition to basic salary, the executive Directors receive certain benefits-in-kind, principally a car and private medical
insurance.
Annual bonus payments
A discretionary annual cash bonus scheme represents the short term incentive element of the overall remuneration 
package for Mr Bester, Mr Williams, Mr. Parker and Mr. Ounstead. The remuneration committee establishes the objectives
that must be met in the financial period if a cash bonus is to be paid. The maximum bonus achievable in the period was
100% of basic salary based on Group performance against budgeted operating profit. For the period ending 29 September
2007 there will be a total of £776,000 (excluding NI) paid at the end of November 2007. The annual bonus scheme for the 
period to September 2008 is also 100% of basic salary based upon the achievement of budgeted Group operating profit.
Pension arrangements
Mr. Bester, Mr. Ounstead and Mr. Liggett received contributions into their own personal pension schemes as disclosed in
the table on page 29. 28

Directors’ contracts
Executive Directors
It is the Company’s policy that Executive Directors enter into a contract with a 12 month term providing for a maximum of
six months notice.
Mr Williams, Mr. Parker and Mr Ounstead’s contracts are in the process of being renewed, there is no material change
expected to their notice periods.
Non-Executive Directors
All Non-Executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within
the limits set by the Articles of Association and based on independent surveys of fees paid to Non-Executive Directors of
similar companies. The basic fee paid to each Non-executive Director in the period was £25,000. It is the Company’s 
policy that Non-Executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of six months
notice. Non-Executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Company’s share option schemes and are not eligible to
join the Company’s pension scheme.
The details of the Non-Executive Directors’ contracts are summarised in the table below:

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT - 
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
To the members of Topps Tiles Plc
We have audited the Group financial statements of Topps Tiles plc for the 52 week period ended 29 September 2007
which comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense, the 
consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated cash flow statement, and the related notes 1 to 29. These Group financial
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the
Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the parent Company financial statements of Topps Tiles plc for the 52 week period ended
29 September 2007. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are
required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Group 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted
by the European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory 
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, whether the Group
financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS
Regulation and whether the part of the Directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the 
information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the Group financial statements. The information given in the
Directors’ Report includes that specific information presented in the Business Review that is cross referred from the
Enhanced Business Review section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we require for
our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Director’s remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of
the 2003 Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report
if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and 
controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control
procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report as described in the contents section and consider whether
it is consistent with the audited Group financial statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’ Report,
the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s statement, the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report, the
Business Review and the Corporate Governance Statement. We consider the implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Group financial statements. Our responsibilities
do not extend to any further information outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
Group financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an 
assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the preparation of the Group financial
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed. 31
TOPPS TILES PLC
Annual Report & Financial Statements 2007

or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of infor-
mation in the Group financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.

For the 52 week period ended 29 September 2007
1 General Information

registered office is given on page 20. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in 
the business review on pages 8 to 13.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in 
note 2j.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not
been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective:
Standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective
IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures; and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures
IFRS 8 Operating Segments
IAS 1   Amendment ‘Capital Disclosures’
IAS 23   Amendment ‘Borrowing Costs’
IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease
IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies
IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2
IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives
IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment
IFRIC 11 Group and Treasury Share Transactions
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no 
material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for additional disclosures on capital and financial 
instruments when the relevant standards come into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
2 Accounting policies
a) Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). 
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS’s adopted by the European Union and 
therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS regulation. The financial statements 
have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments. The principal 
accounting policies adopted are set out below.
b) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by 
the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to the Saturday nearest to the 30 September each year. Control is achieved 
where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee so as to obtain 
benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control 
passed. 36

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
For the 52 week period ended 29 September 2007
2 Accounting policies continued
c) Financial period
The accounting period ends on the Saturday which falls closest to 30 September, resulting in financial periods of 
either 52 or 53 weeks.
Throughout the financial statements, Directors’ report and financial review, references to 2007 mean at 29 
September 2007 or the 52 weeks then ended; references to 2006 mean at 30 September 2006 or the 52 weeks then 
ended.
d) Business Combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at
the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the 
business combination. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions 
for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of
the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities recognised.
e) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair 
value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognised 
as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill which is 
recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the 
income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to 
benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested 
for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is 
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the 
unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for good
will is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP 
amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill of £15,080,000 written off to reserves under 
UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on 
disposal.
f) Revenue Recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable 
for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when title has passed. Sales returns are provided for based on past experience.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate 
applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the 
financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount. Dividend income from investments is recognised when the 
shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established. 37

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
For the 52 week period ended 29 September 2007
2 Accounting policies continued
g) Property, plant & equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, less estimated residual value, over their estimated useful 
lives, on the following bases:
Freehold buildings - 2% per annum on cost on a straight-line basis
Short leasehold land and buildings - over the period of the lease, up to 25 years
Fixtures and fittings - over 10 years or at 25% per annum on reducing balance basis as 
appropriate
Motor vehicles - 25% per annum on reducing balance
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Residual value is calculated on prices prevailing at the date of acquisition.
h) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value and relates solely to finished goods for resale.  
Cost comprises purchase price of materials and an attributable proportion of distribution overheads based on normal 
levels of activity and is valued at standard cost. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further 
costs expected to be incurred to completion and costs to be incurred – marketing, selling and distribution. Provision 
is made for those items of inventory where the net realisable value is estimated to be lower than cost.
i) Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in 
the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years 
and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated 
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, 
and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all 
taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are 
not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither 
the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, and 
interests in jointly controlled entities, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the 
asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged
or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the 
Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 38

j) Foreign currency
Transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of
exchange prevailing on the dates of transactions At each period end, monetary assets and liabilities that are 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on that date. Non-monetary items carried 
at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the 
fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are
not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are 
included in the income statement for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary 
items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arising on the 
retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. For such 
non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign 
operation are translated at exchange rates prevailing at period end dates. Income and expense items are translated at
the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during the period, in which 
case the exchange rates at the dates of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising are classified as equity 
and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such differences are recognised as income or expense in the 
period in which the operation is disposed of.
k) Leases
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not 
made on such a basis. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to sign an operating lease are similarly spread 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
l) Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
m)Retirement Benefit costs
For defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the income statement in respect of pension costs is the 
contributions payable in the year. Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually 
paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
n) Finance costs
Finance costs of debt are recognised in the income statement over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the 
carrying amount. Finance costs which are directly attributable to the construction of tangible fixed assets are 
capitalised as part of the cost of those assets. The commencement of capitalisation begins when both finance costs 
and expenditures for the asset are being incurred and activities that are necessary to get the asset ready for use are 
in progress. Capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities that are necessary to get the asset ready for 
use are complete.
o) Derivative financial instruments
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and 
interest rates.
The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts to manage these exposures.  
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, on the use of 
financial derivatives. 39

o) Derivative financial instruments continued
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when
their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried
at fair value, with gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the income statement as they arise. 
p) Bank Borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance 
charges are accounted for on an accrual basis in the Income Statement using the effective interest rate method and 
are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they
arise.
q) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that 
the Group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the
effect is material.
r) Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments. In accordance with the transitional 
provisions, IFRS 2 will be applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 
1 October 2005.
The Group issues equity settled share based payments to certain employees. Equity settled share based payments are
measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the share based payment is
expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually 
vest. Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes model. 
The Group provides employees with the ability to purchase the Group’s ordinary shares at 80% of the current market
value through the operation of it’s share save scheme. The Group records an expense, based on its estimate of the 
20% discount related to shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the vesting period.
s) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid 
investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes
in value.
t) Trade Payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the 
effective interest rate method.
u) Financial Liabilities and Equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after 
deducting all of it’s liabilities. 40

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be 
impaired.
The recoverable amounts are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use 
calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct 
costs during the period. Management estimates discount rates based on the groups weighted average cost of capital. 
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past
practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for
the next five years and extrapolates cash flows for the following five years based on an estimated growth rate of 
2 per cent. This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.

We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Topps Tiles plc for the year ended 29 September 2007
and on the information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act
1985.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are

accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the parent 
Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report
to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK
and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view and
whether the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act
1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the Directors’ Report is consistent with the parent Company financial
statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific information presented in the Business
Review that is cross referred from the Enhanced Business Review section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding 
Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report as described in the contents section and consider whether
it is consistent with the audited parent Company financial statements. The other information comprises only the
Directors’ Report, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Statement and the Business Review. We consider the
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the parent
Company financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any further information outside the Annual Report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
parent Company financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by
the Directors in the preparation of the parent Company financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent Company financial statements
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we
also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent Company financial statements.

In our opinion:
  the parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 29 September 2007;

Association of the Company in substitution for and to the exclusion of all the existing Articles of Association.
NOTES
1 This notice has been sent to all Ordinary Shareholders who are entitled to attend or be represented at the meeting.  
As at the close of business on the date of this notice, the Company’s issued share capital comprised 170,818,106 
ordinary shares of 3.33 pence each. Each ordinary share carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of the 
Company.
2 2. Members are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of their rights to attend and to speak and vote on 
their behalf at the meeting. Members may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the Annual General Meeting 
provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that 
shareholder.
3 A proxy need not be a shareholder of the Company but must attend the meeting  to represent you. A Form of Proxy is
enclosed and instructions for use are shown on the form. You can only appoint a proxy using the procedures set out 
in these notes and the notes to the proxy form. The fact that shareholders may have completed forms of proxy will 
not prevent them from attending and voting in person should they afterwards decide to do so. Details of how to 
appoint the Chairman of the meeting or another person as your proxy using the proxy form are set out in the notes 
to the proxy form. If you wish your proxy to speak on your behalf at the meeting you will need to appoint your own 
choice of proxy (not the Chairman) and give your instructions directly to them. 
4 To be valid, a Form of Proxy and any power or authority under which it is signed, must be lodged with the Company’s 
Registrars, Capita Registrars, Proxy Department, PO Box 25, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4BR, no later than 48 hours 
before the time appointed for the holding of the Annual General Meeting.
5 You may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different 
shares. You may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. 
6 A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or 
against the resolution. If no voting indication is given, your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her 
discretion. Your proxy will vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is 
put before the meeting. The notes to the proxy form explain how to direct your proxy how to vote on each resolution 
or withhold their vote. 64

Annual Report & Financial Statements 2007
7 In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the 
appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the 
names of the joint holders appear in the Company's register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-
named being the most senior).
8 CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service 
may do so for the Annual General Meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof by utilising the procedures described in 
the CREST Manual. CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who 
have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who 
will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.  In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST
to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST” Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in 
accordance with Euroclear’s specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as 
described in the CREST Manual. The message must be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID : 
RA10) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in the notice of meeting. For this purpose, the 
time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST 
Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner 
prescribed by CREST. After this time, any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be 
communicated to the appointee through other means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear 
does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and 
limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the 
CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or 
has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) 
such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any 
particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service 
providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the 
CREST system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of 
the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
9 The following documents are available for inspection by members at the registered office of the Company (except 
Bank Holidays) during the normal business hours and at the place of the meeting not less than 15 minutes prior to 
and during the meeting:
(a) the register of Directors’ interests required to be kept under Section 809 of the Companies Act 2006;
(b) copies of the Directors’ service contracts; and
(c) the proposed articles of association of the Company.

EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE 
NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING of the Company will be held at the Company’s premises at Thorpe Way, Grove Park,
Enderby, Leicestershire LE19 1SU on 8 January 2008 at 10.30a.m.
Three of the resolutions are to be taken at this year’s Annual General Meeting as special business. By way of explanation
of these and certain other resolutions:
Ordinary Business
Resolution 2
Final dividend
A final dividend of 6.95 pence per Ordinary Share is recommended by the Directors for payment to shareholders on the
register of members of the Company at the close of business on 4 January 2008. Subject to approval by the Ordinary
Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, the dividend will be paid on 31 January 2008. An interim dividend of 3.75
pence per Ordinary Share was paid on 30 June 2007. This gives a total dividend level of 10.70 pence per Ordinary Share
for the 52 week period to 29 September 2007.
Resolutions 3, 4, 5 and 6
Re-election of Directors
B. Bester, A. McIntosh and V.H. Watson are the Directors retiring by rotation this year and they offer themselves for re-
election and R. Parker offers himself for re-election as a new appointment to the Board. All members of the Board of
Directors submit themselves for re-election at least every three years with the exception of VH Watson and A. McIntosh,
who because of their length of service are retiring and offering themselves for re-election annually. Brief biographical
details about the Directors standing for re-election appear on pages 18 and 19 of the Annual Report and Financial
Statements. 
Special Business
Resolutions 9 and 10
Appointment of authority to issue shares and the disapplication of statutory rights of pre-emption
Resolution 9
The right of the Directors to allot further shares in the capital of the Company requires in most cases the prior 
authorisation of the shareholders in general meeting under Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 (“the Act”), Resolution
9 will be put to members as special business to authorise the Directors to allot Ordinary Shares with a nominal value of
£1,708,180 out of the Company’s unissued share capital representing approximately 33.3% of the Company’s current
issued share capital (excluding shares held in treasury). The Company currently holds Nil Ordinary Shares in treasury.
The Directors have no current intention of exercising the authority to allot further shares. The authority shall expire
immediately following the Annual General Meeting next following the resolution or, if earlier, 15 months following the 
resolution being passed.
Resolution 10 
This proposed resolution seeks to obtain power under Section 95 of the Act to enable the Directors to allot, for cash,
shares with an aggregate nominal value of £256,227 equal to approximately 5% of the Company’s current issued share
capital without being required first to offer such securities to existing shareholders. The Company will thereby be given
greater flexibility when considering future opportunities but the interests of existing shareholders will be protected as,
except in the case of a rights issue or the allotment of shares under the Company’s share option schemes, the Directors
have no present intention to allot any part of the unissued share capital of the Company or, without the prior approval of
the Company in general meeting, to make any issue which would effectively alter the control of the Company or the
nature of its business. This authority will expire immediately following the Annual General Meeting next following the 
resolution or, if earlier, 15 months following the resolution being passed.
Resolution 11
Authority to purchase Ordinary Shares
At the Annual General Meeting, Ordinary Shareholders are being invited under Resolution 11 to grant authority to the
Company to make market purchases of its Ordinary Shares. It is proposed such authority shall expire on the conclusion of
the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2009 or twelve months from the date of this resolution, if earlier.
This authority will be limited to the purchase of not more than 14.9% of the Ordinary Shares currently in issue. This 
represents the maximum amount of Ordinary Share capital in issue which is permitted before tender or partial offer to all
shareholders is require to be made to perform any share buy-back. The maximum price payable under this authority will
be 105% of the average of the middle market quotations of an Ordinary Share for the five business days before the 
relevant purchase and the minimum price will be 3p per Ordinary Share.
In considering whether or not to purchase Ordinary Shares under the market purchase authority, the Directors will take
into account cash resources, the effect on gearing and other investment opportunities before exercising the authority. In
addition, the Company will only exercise the authority to make such a purchase in the market when the Directors consider
it is in the best interests of the shareholders generally to do so and it should result in an increase in Earnings per
Ordinary Share. 
As at 27 November 2007, there were options to subscribe for 1,306,491 equity shares outstanding under various schemes
representing approximately 0.77% of the current issued share capital of the Company. If the authority sought by
Resolution 9 was exercised in full, the number of outstanding options would represent approximately 0.79% of the issued
share capital following the repurchase of shares. 66

Resolution 12
Amendments to articles of association
It is proposed that the Company adopts an amended set of articles of association, which take account of initial changes
brought about as at the date of this meeting as a result of the partial implementation of the Companies Act 2006 (the
"2006 Act"). The proposed articles of association are available on the Company's website
(http://www.toppstiles.co.uk/3/frame-0financial.html) and at the Company's registered office and will be available at the
AGM venue on the day of the AGM. It is expected that subsequent amendments will be required at subsequent AGMs to
deal with the further changes which will be brought about at a later date by the implementation of the remainder of the
2006 Act, which is expected to take place over the next 2 years. The new set of articles of association contains certain
differences from the current articles of association of the Company. The paragraphs below explain the key changes:
Article 63 - Notice of general meetings
The provisions in the Articles dealing with the convening of general meetings and the length of notice required to 
convene general meetings are being brought into line with the provisions of the 2006 Act. An extraordinary general 
meeting to consider a special resolution can now be convened on 14 days notice. Previously, 21 days notice was required.
This will give the Company a greater degree of flexibility in relation to taking decisions.
Article 86 - Proxies 
Under the 2006 Act proxies are entitled to vote on a show of hands whereas under the current Articles proxies are only
entitled to vote on a poll. Multiple proxies may be appointed provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights
attached to a different share held by the shareholder.   
Article 84 – Corporate representatives
The 2006 Act also allows for the appointment of multiple corporate representatives, rather than a single representative
which was provided for under the Companies Act 1985. However, these multiple representatives must exercise their power
in the same way failing which they are treated as not having exercised the power at all.
Article 159 – Publication of audit concerns
The 2006 Act provides a new right for members of a quoted company to raise questions about the work of the auditors.
Shareholders are now permitted to require the company to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter 
relating to the audit of the company's accounts or the circumstances connected with the auditor ceasing to hold office
that they propose to bring up at the next meeting where the report and accounts are being laid before shareholders. The
company is required to publish the statement if it receives requests from shareholders who hold either 5% of the voting
rights or are at least 100 in number and hold shares on which there has been paid up an average sum per shareholder of
at least £100.
Articles 174 to 175 - Electronic and web communications
Provisions of the 2006 Act which came into force in January 2007 enable companies to communicate with members by
electronic and/or website communications. The proposed amendments to the Articles allow communications to members
in electronic form and, in addition, they also permit the Company to take advantage of the provisions relating to website
communications. Before the Company can communicate with a member by means of website communication, the relevant
member must be asked individually by the Company to agree that the Company may send or supply documents or 
information to him by means of a website, and the Company must either have received a positive response or have
received no response within the period of 28 days beginning with the date on which the request was sent. The Company
will notify the member (either in writing, or by other permitted means) when a relevant document or information is placed
on the website and a member can always request a hard copy version of the document or information.
Article 189 - Directors’ indemnities
The 2006 Act has in some areas widened the scope of the powers of a company to indemnify Directors and to fund
expenditure incurred in connection with certain actions against Directors. In particular, a company that is a trustee of an
occupational pension scheme can now indemnify a Director against liability incurred in connection with the company’s
activities as trustee of the scheme. In addition, the existing exemption allowing a company to provide money for the 
purpose of funding a Director’s defence in court proceedings now expressly covers regulatory proceedings and applies to
associated companies. The Article itself does not grant any indemnity to the Directors. It merely sets out a framework
within which the Company may operate to indemnify its Directors.
Article 190 – Authorisation of loans to Directors
The Companies Act 1985 contained restrictions on loans and related dealings between a company and its directors (and
their connected persons) subject to the specified exceptions. Under the 2006 Act the general prohibitions on loans to
directors have been abolished and replaced with a requirement of shareholder approval for all companies. Provisions have
also been introduced to ensure that public companies, and any private company associated with a public company, may
only make quasi-loans to directors, loans or quasi-loans to connected persons or enter into credit transactions with 
Directors or connected persons, if shareholder approval is obtained.    
The Directors believe that the adoption of all the resolutions set out in the Notice of Meeting is in the best interests of
the Company and its shareholders as a whole. Accordingly, the Directors unanimously recommend that you vote in
favour of the resolutions, as each Director intends to do, in respect of his own beneficial holdings.  67

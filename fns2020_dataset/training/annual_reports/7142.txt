Financial Overview
For the 12 months to 31 December 2013, the Group made a pre-tax profit of £0.6m 
(2012: loss from continuing operations of £0.5m). This turn around to profit was as 
a result of improved gross margins, tighter cost control and lower interest charges. 
However, lower levels of activity in the educational sector resulted in Group revenues 
from continuing operations for the year reducing by 3% to £89.6m (2012: £92.5m).
 
Financial Position
As at 31 December 2013, the Group had net debt of £0.3m (2012: £2.4m). Shareholders’ 
funds increased to £20.5m (2012: £18.0m) resulting in gearing of less than 5% at the 
year end. During the year, as previously announced, we sold Fontana House for a total 
consideration of £1.1m. Fontana House is situated at Letchworth and is occupied by the 
Showcard Print business which we sold in April 2012. The proceeds from the sale of this 
property have further enabled us to reduce debt.
We were delighted to be able to invest £0.7m during the year in a new laser cutting 
machine for the factory which has enabled us to achieve significant productivity 
improvements.
Since 31 December 2009, the Group has reduced its finance facilities from £35m 
to £5.5m. Its bank facility, which has been finalised since the year end, is, with further 
agreed reductions, committed until April 2016.
 
Dividends
No dividend is proposed for this year. When the Group’s profitability has further 
improved, the Board will consider the resumption of dividend payments.

Future Strategy
We continue to focus on growing the Interiors business around four main sectors. 
Retail customers now account for 20% of our revenues; the improving sentiment 
in retail has allowed us to diversify our revenue streams and, encouragingly, gain some 
new customers which should bode well for the future. Financial services (mainly banks) 
accounted for 43% of our revenue in 2013 and this continues to be a significant area of 
business for us. Education, which has historically been a significant part of the Interiors 
business, has been subdued over the last year and accounted for 37% of our revenue in 
2013, but there are encouraging signs as evidenced by recently announced government 
spending plans. Finally, we are starting to build a presence in the healthcare market.
We are continuing to grow our overseas retail business and we expect that revenues from 
outside the UK, which amounted to 5% of 2013 revenue, will shortly exceed 10% of our income. 
We continue to concentrate on driving efficiencies through the business and enhancing 
our margins. We intend to support all of this through further investment and will continue 
to offer a full range of services including design, procurement and installation. 
The Board
I am pleased that Andrew Burgess agreed in November 2013 to join the Board as a 
non-executive director. Andrew is our largest shareholder and is committed to the future 
success of the business. He brings with him extensive commercial experience which will 
assist the Company as we look to take it to the next stage of its development.
I would also like to take this opportunity to formally record the Board’s thanks to all of 
our colleagues for their contributions to the improving health of the business. The last 
few years have not been easy and it is gratifying for all of us to be able to report these 
more positive results.
Outlook for 2014
The UK economy is showing signs of recovery and growth and I believe we are now 
well positioned to take advantage of this. Although we are a Scottish based business 
and many of our employees live in Scotland, we have a UK wide customer base and a 
number of overseas customers. It is hoped that the economic recovery (and with it, our 
growth prospects) that is currently taking place across the UK will not be destabilised 
by the outcome of the Referendum on Scottish Independence.
The retail sector in the UK is improving and there are positive signs of renewed consumer 
confidence; this is reflected in our new business wins. Recent announcements of increased 
government spending on education are also encouraging, the results of which will be seen 
in the business in 2015.
The Board is pleased with progress made in both debt reduction and the move into profit 
in 2013 and we look to the future with confidence.

Interiors
Primark
Zoetermeer, Holland
Operating profit before exceptional costs increased 
from £0.7m in 2012 to £2.1m in 2013, despite a slight 
reduction in revenue from £85.3m to £82.2m. During 
the year, activity in the educational sector reduced as 
projects completed and new funding for developers 
was put in place. Growth in revenue from financial sector 
customers partially offset this and remained strong in 
both branch and office refits, together with rebranding 
programmes. Activity in the retail sector was steady 
and a number of new customer relationships have been 
secured which will allow further scope for growth in the 
future. These included the completion of projects for a 
major UK supermarket chain as well as a retailer primarily 
operating from out of town sites. Both of these represent 
new areas of activity for the business. Overseas revenue 
continues to grow and during the year a contract to 
support all of the Far East activities of a major UK based 
retailer was won. An order to supply equipment sourced 
from China to a large Australian retailer has recently 
been secured, which provides a further increase in our 
footprint and capabilities in the Asia Pacific region.

The increased contribution from the division was a result of improved operational performance 
and efficiencies. The second half of the year benefitted from the investment in the new laser 
cutting machine which was operational from July onwards. This investment amounted to 
£0.7m and was supported by Scottish Enterprise. The first phase of investment in new drawing 
office software was also made in the period and this will improve efficiency as well as provide 
additional benefits to customers.
We intend to maintain the level of investment in the business and are currently finalising 
plans to replace the Group’s main IT systems, which date from the 1990’s and no longer work 
efficiently given the scale of change which has taken place in the Group’s activities since they 
were first installed.
Educational Supplies
Revenue from the educational supplies businesses, Teacherboards and Stage Systems, 
remained steady at £8.7m (2012: £8.8m) despite the run down in activity in this sector, 
which particularly affected Stage Systems. At Teacherboards, Direct to School sales remained 
steady and there was growth in the volume of web based sales, which is expected to become 
an increasing market for this business. Both businesses continue to work closely with the 
Interiors business and will benefit when its pipeline of major project opportunities converts 
to orders in the future. 21

Management and Staff
During the year, the apprenticeship programme, the Havelock Academy, was successfully 
launched and 12 young people have joined the Group in both factory and office training 
schemes. We are continuing with this programme and, in addition, for the first time for a 
number of years, will be launching a graduate recruitment programme to fill vacancies in   
more highly skilled roles.
current Trading and p rospects
We expect a further reduction in the amount of work in the Educational sector in 2014. 
This position will reverse in future years as programmes which have already been announced 
are finalised and orders are placed for their delivery. The level of quotation activity is currently 
very high as a consequence.
With a number of new customers secured in new areas of the retail sector and new wins in 
the financial sector, we view the future with optimism. In the current year, we will secure the 
full benefits from the capital investments made in 2013. We are also finalising plans for further 
investments, all of which offer attractive pay back periods.
Overall, I am encouraged by the trading performance to date and expect to make further 
progress and continue to improve operational efficiency.

Results for the year and financial position
The Group made a pre-tax profit of £0.6m (2012 -  
continuing businesses: loss of £0.5m). This is the first 
pre-tax profit made by the currently constituted Group 
for some  years. Revenues were slightly reduced at 
£89.6m (2012 - continuing businesses: £92.5m). 
There were no exceptional costs or income.
As a result of this return to profit and a further 
reduction in the pension fund deficit, the Group’s 
net assets increased from £18.0m to £20.5m.

Havelock europa plc 
Annu Al RepoR t 2013
Taxation
The Group has not paid any corporation tax on the profits made in the year due to losses 
being brought forward. The reduction in the corporation tax rate has meant that the losses 
brought forward, and carried on the balance sheet as a deferred tax asset, are now worth 
less and the income statement tax charge reflects this.
Cash flow
The Group’s cash flow from operating activities increased and, with continued tight control 
of working capital, resulted in an inflow of £2.7m from operations (2012: outflow of £1.2m). 
Capital expenditure totalled £1.2m and was financed principally through the sale of surplus 
assets, appropriate new finance leases and grant funding.
Net debt and bank facilities
Net debt at 31 December was once again substantially reduced to £0.3m (2012: £2.4m).   
The Group has the support of the following facilities:
– A committed revolving credit facility which is available until 30 April 2016. The amount   
 is currently £5.0m and this reduces by £0.5m on 30 June and 30 September each year.
– Term loans and finance leases supporting specific capital investments which amounted   
 to £0.5m at 31 December 2013. 
Over the last four years, the Group has reduced its facilities from £35m at which they stood 
at 31 December 2009. This has been a major objective of the Group’s strategy and it is 
pleasing to be able to report such a successful outcome.

Going concern accounting basis
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position, are set out in the Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s 
Review on pages 9 and 17. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity 
position are set out in the financial statements.
During the year, the Group operated under a bank facility which included a term loan, 
a revolving credit facility, HP finance and an overdraft facility. The overdraft and revolving 
credit facilities have been amended and have now been consolidated into a revolving 
credit facility which is committed until April 2016. As set out in Note 1 (Basis of Preparation), 
the Group expects to be able to comply with the conditions of the Group’s bank facilities 
based on its forecasts.
The directors, therefore, have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group 
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
annual report and accounts.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Group’s loan facilities contain covenants as to facility to EBITDA, EBIT to interest and cash 
performance. These covenants are tested quarterly and failure to meet these constitutes an 
event of default under the facility agreement, giving the Bank the right to require immediate 
repayment of all amounts loaned. As set out in note 1, the Group’s financial forecasts show 
that these covenants can be met. However, any material disruption to operational and financial 
performance could result in a shortfall against the standard of performance required. The Group 
addresses this risk by detailed monitoring of financial performance and the expected outcome 
for each measurement period.
The Group’s businesses have a strong seasonal element, with a peak of activity in the middle 
and second half of the year. This could result in peak output requirements exceeding the 
available capacity. The Group manages this risk by detailed and regular capacity planning 
reviews, with additional shifts and early production being planned.
Although the Group’s headquarters and manufacturing facility are located in Scotland, 
a significant proportion of its revenue is generated in the rest of the UK and in the EU. 
Consequently, political and constitutional uncertainty in regard to currency and Scotland’s 
relationship with the EU are matters of concern and the business is undertaking analysis 
to identify potential impacts and mitigating actions. 29
Havelock europa plc 
Annu Al RepoR t 2013
The Group operates in highly competitive markets and deals with major customers who 
increasingly employ procurement strategies designed to ensure that all purchases, and not 
just those of stock items, are acquired at the lowest possible cost. The business is addressing 
this risk by seeking production cost savings including, where appropriate, procurement from 
lower cost overseas suppliers.
The Group is involved as a supplier to major construction projects which can be subject 
to time delays and slippage caused by both commercial and weather-related issues. 
The business addresses this risk by building allowance for slippage into its production 
forecasts and budgets.
The Group undertakes work as a sub-contractor under industry standard written contracts. 
The risks involved in working under such contracts are controlled by the employment of 
qualified and knowledgeable contract managers and quantity surveyors.
The largest element of working capital employed by the Group is trade receivables and 
accrued income. These are subject to credit risk and, as a consequence, the Group employs 
credit insurance to cover the risk on most of its commercial debtors. However, in addition 
to debt owed by the public sector and local government, the Group bears the credit risk 
on a proportion of receivables where its credit insurers are unwilling to provide cover. The 
Group’s procedures require that material uninsured credit limits are approved by the Board. 
The Group also monitors the credit status of its major customers.

pension scheme
In the year, the deficit on the Group’s final salary pension fund reduced to £1.3m from £4.6m 
despite adverse movements in the assumptions on bond yields and inflation which impacted 
the discount rates used to calculate the present value of the scheme’s liabilities. A strong 
investment performance as a result of the fund’s relatively high equity exposure more than 
offset these. As a consequence, the Fund’s Trustees and the Board are considering whether 
there is an opportunity to alter the allocation of assets to reduce risk. The closure of the 
scheme to further accrual and the rebasing of all benefits to be based on inflation measured 
by the Consumer Prices Index in previous years means that the opportunities to further control 
the movement of liabilities are currently limited unless conditions in the markets for buying 
out pension liabilities improve.

Corporate Social Responsibility Review
It is the Group’s objective to conduct its business in 
a manner that is based on the highest standards of 
ethics and integrity and in a manner which minimises the 
impact of its operations on society and the environment. 
Compliance with regulations is merely the baseline from 
which the Group starts - the Group aspires to excellence. 
To this end, the Group has developed its policies, 
management focus and partnerships with key stakeholders 
to ensure a culture of progressive improvements in the key 
areas of the environment, health & safety, business ethics, 
employees and community.
The Board takes account of the significance of 
environmental, social and governance matters to the 
Group as part of the regular risk assessment process.
The environment
The Group’s approach to minimising the impact of its operations on the environment is 
articulated in the Group Environmental Policy. Our primary aim is to enhance sustainability 
and to reduce the Group’s carbon footprint through focus on the key areas of greenhouse 
gas emissions, waste reduction and energy reduction.
Delivery of the Group’s environmental programme is assured through accreditation 
to environmental management standard ISO14001.
Sustainability
Protecting the earth’s resources for the benefit of future generations is seen as a key part of the 
Group’s social responsibility. The Group therefore strives to ensure that all key raw materials are 
procured from sustainable or recycled sources. The use of sustainable and recyclable materials is 
an explicit part of the design risk assessment process incorporated into all product development. 
The Group’s commitment to the environment permeates through the supply chain. Sustainability 
is a key criterion in vendor selection and appointment. The Group achieved certification by the 
Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification 
(PEFC) in 2009. Both organisations promote responsible forestry throughout the world.

Health and safety
Health and safety is given the highest priority within the Group. The Group’s policy on health and safety and how this 
is to be achieved and monitored is set out in the Group Health and Safety Framework. This includes 12 standards for 
the management of health and safety, with which all Group businesses must comply and which serve as the basis for 
continuous improvement plans for health and safety.
The Group Chief Executive is designated as the director responsible for health and safety. All businesses are required 
to maintain a health and safety committee and to hold monthly meetings involving members of the committee and 
senior managers. The Group Chief Executive and Managing Directors hold annual formal safety reviews, with appropriate 
consultation and follow up procedures for corrective action.
It is intended that employees should work in an environment where there are adequate resources and advice to ensure 
a safe working environment, safe systems of work and information and training to improve the safety of employees. 
Each business employs a Health and Safety representative to ensure that there are effective monitoring systems in place 
to identify and eliminate health and safety risks.
The Board regards health and safety as a key priority and receives a monthly report from the Chief Executive on health 
and safety throughout the Group, with information on major and minor accidents, working days lost, remedial action 
taken and any other health and safety matters. The key measure of Group safety performance is the rate of HSE reportable 
accidents per 100,000 hours worked.
Business ethics
It is Group policy to procure goods and services in an ethical and transparent manner in accordance with the Group’s 
Purchasing Ethics Statement. This statement provides that suppliers’ confidential information will not be disclosed, that 
suppliers should be treated fairly at all stages of the procurement process and that corruption will not be tolerated.
Suppliers are expected to show high standards of business ethics in their trading with the Group and in their own activities. 
Suppliers are required to act responsibly towards their own employees, to avoid forced or child labour, to protect the 
environment and to display the highest standards of health and safety. Suppliers are assessed on their conformance to 
these standards and, in the event of non-conformance, the Group either works with the supplier to ensure conformance 
or gives notice of its intention to cease trading with the supplier.
Further guidance to employees on the ethical conduct of business is provided in the Group Staff Handbook and the Group 
Commercial Policy. These cover issues such as equal opportunities, whistle-blowing, corporate hospitality and gifts, access 
to personal data, and client entertainment.
Employees
The Group provides equal opportunity for employment, training, career development and promotion regardless of sex, 
age, race, religion, ethnic origin or sexual orientation. The Group encourages the employment of disabled people whenever 
suitable vacancies are available, and will make appropriate arrangements to provide reasonable adjustments should a 
member of staff become disabled during the course of their employment.
The Group runs an educational support programme, as well as an internal training programme, which encourages staff 
to study for formal qualifications to enhance their career and skills in their role. We believe that training and development, 
both internal and external, are invaluable in attracting and developing the best people for the Group.
We have developed a comprehensive Group communication programme, which has been rolled out throughout the 
business. This programme includes a staff consultation forum, an intranet and regular briefings. This enables us to 
communicate with all of our staff in whichever way they find most effective.
c ommunity
The Group makes donations to charities, particularly those involving children, in the local communities in which its various 
businesses are situated. The Group also encourages employees to support local charities and provides financial and other 
support to any such initiatives.
A Charitable Fund Raising Committee has been established to co-ordinate fund raising activities and agree which 
organisations should benefit from funds raised through specific fund raising activities and the staff ‘Saving from 
Source’ scheme. 34

in any contract of significance with the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The directors’ interests 
in the shares of the Company are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration section on page 44. 37

Employees
The average number of employees and details of employment costs are set out in note 5 to the 
financial statements.
The Group gives full and fair consideration to applications for employment made by disabled 
persons, continues where possible the employment of persons who become disabled while 
they are with the Group, and ensures suitable training, career development and opportunities 
for the promotion of disabled persons employed by it. The Group is committed to the 
“Positive about Disabled” scheme.
The directors are committed to effective communication with employees at all levels through 
regular meetings, notice-board bulletins and circulars. The directors inform all employees of 
the Group’s performance and of the financial and economic factors affecting that performance 
on a six-monthly basis.
The Group operates executive and savings-related share option schemes.
Health and Safety
The directors recognise the importance of ensuring that employees and others are not exposed 
to risks to their health and safety. Health and safety at work is a core value in the Group and the 
directors strive to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the legislation in this area. The 
directors are committed to the provision of appropriate instruction, training, refresher training 
and supervision in order to maintain and improve the competence levels of all employees 
at the Group’s offices, factories and plants in health and safety matters. Rigorous standards 
of health and safety at work are also imposed on the Group’s external sites. Each year, the 
directors endorse the Group Health and Safety at Work Policy, which is reviewed regularly to 
incorporate changes in legislation. The director with overall responsibility for health and safety 
at work is Eric Prescott, Group Chief Executive.
Payment to suppliers
It is the Group’s policy to agree terms and conditions for its business transactions with 
suppliers. Although the Group does not follow any code or standard on payment practice, 
payment is made on the agreed terms, subject to the terms and conditions being met by 
the suppliers. At the year-end, the amount owed to suppliers by the Group was equivalent 
to 32 days of purchases from suppliers (2012: 52 days). The corresponding figure for the 
Company was 31 days (2012: 52 days).
Material contracts with suppliers
The Group employs a wide variety of suppliers across the business units. There are no 
contracts with individual suppliers which are material to the continuation of the Group’s 
business activities.
Financial risk management
The Group’s policy is to minimise the use of complex financial instruments. Within this  
framework, specific consideration is given to managing foreign currency risk through forward 
contracts where there is significant potential exposure. Consideration is also given to managing 
interest rate risk through relevant interest rate caps and options. 38

auditor
KPMG Audit Plc has informed the Company that they have initiated a process to streamline 
their two registered audit firms (KPMG Audit Plc and KPMG LLP). As such, KPMG Audit Plc 
has notified the Company that they are not seeking re-appointment. Consequently, the Audit 
Committee has recommended, and the Board has approved, the resolution to appoint KPMG 
LLP as Auditor of the Company and its subsidiaries, and to authorise the Directors to fix their 
remuneration, which will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
Disclosure of information to auditor
The directors who held office at the date of approval of this Directors’ Report confirm that, 
so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s 
auditor is unaware.

Authority to allot shares and disapplication of pre-emption rights
Resolution 6 is proposed to renew the authority granted to the directors at the Annual General 
Meeting of the Company held on 27 June 2013 to allot the unissued shares in the capital of the 
Company up to a nominal amount of £1,284,402, being 12,844,016 shares of 10p each. This 
represents 33.3% of the issued share capital at the date of this notice. At present, the directors 
intend exercising such authority only in order to issue shares under the terms of the Company’s 
share option schemes.
Section 561 of the Companies Act 2006 imposes restrictions on the issue of equity securities 
(as defined in the Companies Act 2006, which include the Company’s ordinary shares) which 
are, or are to be, paid up wholly in cash and not first offered to existing shareholders.
Resolution 7 is proposed to renew the authority granted to the directors at the Annual 
General Meeting held on 27 June 2013 to allot for cash ordinary shares up to a nominal value 
not exceeding £192,660 (being 1,926,602 shares of 10p each, which represents 5% of the 
issued share capital of the Company) without first offering such shares to existing ordinary 
shareholders. This resolution also empowers the directors to deal with fractional entitlements 
and any overseas legal issues arising on a rights issue. Resolution 7 is conditional upon 
Resolution 6 being passed and is a Special Resolution.
The authority under Resolutions 6 and 7 extends only until the date of the Annual General 
Meeting for 2015 or 30 June 2015, whichever comes first.
Authority to purchase own shares
Resolution 8 is proposed to renew the authority for the Company granted at the Annual 
General Meeting on 27 June 2013 to purchase its own shares and specifies the maximum 
number of shares of 10p each which may be acquired (3,853,205 being approximately 10% 
of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at the date of this report) and the maximum 
(the higher of 105% of the 5 day average middle market price and the last independent trade 
or bid) and minimum (the nominal value) prices at which shares may be bought. The directors 
intend to exercise this power only if, in light of market conditions prevailing at the time, 
they believe that the effect of such purchases will be to increase earnings per share and they 
will also have regard to whether, at the time, this represents the best use of the Company’s 
resources and is in the best interests of the shareholders generally. Any shares purchased 
in this way will either be cancelled and the number of shares in issue reduced accordingly, 
or else held in treasury. In total there are options outstanding over 266,582 ordinary shares; 
they represent 0.7% of the current issued share capital and would represent 0.8% of the issued 
share capital if the full buy back authority was used and the shares so acquired cancelled. 
The proposed authority, if granted, will expire at the earlier of the next Annual General Meeting 
of the Company or 18 months from the date of passing of the resolution.

The Board of the Company is committed to appropriate 
standards of corporate governance as an important part of 
managing the Company and its subsidiaries for the long-term 
benefit of shareholders. The Company’s policies of governance are 
monitored to ensure that they are appropriate to the Company’s 
nature, status, size and circumstances, and are explained below.
Internal control
The Board of Directors is responsible for the Company’s system of internal control; sets appropriate policies on internal 
control; seeks regular assurances that enable it to satisfy itself that the system is functioning effectively; and ensures that the 
system of internal control is effective in managing risks in the manner which it has approved. The system of internal control 
has been in place throughout the year and continues to be in place at the date of this statement. However, such a system 
of internal control is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can 
provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material mis-statement or loss. The directors have continued to 
review the effectiveness of the Group’s system of financial and non-financial controls, including operational and compliance 
controls, risk management and the Group’s high-level internal control arrangements. These reviews have included reports 
from the out-sourced Internal Audit function. Reports have also been received from the external auditor on matters identified 
in the course of its statutory audit work, although the external auditor considers internal control only to the extent necessary 
to form an opinion on the truth and fairness of the financial statements.
risk management
The Group views the careful management of business risk as a key management activity. The Board believes that these 
business risks, which may be strategic, operational, reputational, financial or environmental, should be understood and 
visible. The business context determines in each situation the level of acceptable risk and the controls that are applied to it.
Each business within the Group maintains a risk register which is regularly reviewed and updated as part of the management 
process. This takes account of the impact and likelihood of specific risks affecting that business unit and arrives at a score for 
“gross” risk, in addition to mitigating actions designed to reduce the potential effect of an identified risk to an acceptable 
level. The regular review includes an assessment of progress made in carrying out the mitigating actions and provides a 
basis for planning further action.
The individual business unit risk registers are reviewed at Group level where a separate risk register is maintained which 
includes all risks from business units which are material in the context of the Group as opposed to the individual units 
themselves. The Board reviews the assessment of risk on a half yearly basis. The principal risks and uncertainties to which 
the Group is subject are set out as part of the Finance Director’s Review on page 23.
Takeover directive
The Articles of Association of the Company set out the rules for the appointment and replacement of directors. Directors 
may be appointed by the Board, in which case the director is subject to retirement at the next Annual General Meeting. 
No person other than a retiring director may be appointed at any general meeting unless recommended by the directors 
or prior notice has been given to the Company Secretary.
Each director must retire and be proposed for reappointment at every third Annual General Meeting. Any director may 
be removed by Ordinary Resolution.
The powers of the directors to issue shares are governed by resolutions 6 and 7 proposed at the Annual General Meeting 
under sections 551 and 570/573 of the Companies Act 2006. The Company has the power to buy back its own shares. 
A resolution to renew this power will be put to the Annual General Meeting.
The Company’s bank facilities with Bank of Scotland plc include a provision for those facilities to end in the event that a 
shareholder or group acting in concert who were not shareholders at 28 April 2010 acquires more than 50% of the share 
capital or if a shareholder acquires the ability to control the composition of the Board. There are no other significant 
agreements with change of control or similar clauses.
Corporate Governance 44
Havelock europa plc 
Annu Al RepoR t 2013
The remuneration policy is set by the Board and is described 
below. Individual remuneration packages are determined by 
the Remuneration Committee within the framework of this policy. 
Directors who were members of the Remuneration Committee 
during the year were Alastair Kerr (Chairman), David MacLellan, 
Richard Sweetman and Andrew Burgess (since 18 November 2013). 
The Remuneration Committee has access to independent advice 
where it considers it appropriate.
Remuneration policy
The objective of the executive remuneration policy is to align individual reward and incentives directly with the 
performance of the Group and hence with the interests of shareholders and improving total shareholder return. It is 
the aim of the Committee to reward directors competitively using the broad principle that their remuneration should 
be based around the remuneration levels paid to senior managers in comparable public companies. The remuneration 
for executive directors is linked to performance through the provision of performance-related annual bonuses, long term 
incentives and share options. The Remuneration Committee also takes account of the pay and employment conditions 
of other employees of the Group when setting the terms and conditions of the executive directors’ remuneration and 
employment conditions. The remuneration for non-executive directors reflects the responsibilities, commitment and 
time required to carry out their role.
Service contracts 
The Company has service contracts with its executive directors. It is Company policy that such contracts should contain 
notice periods of not more than 12 months. Service contracts do not include any provision for compensation for loss of 
office other than the notice periods as set out below. There are no provisions providing for compensation in the event 
of a takeover bid. Service contracts are not for fixed periods of time. 
Details of the directors’ service agreements with the Company are as follows:

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in respect 
of the Annual Report and the Financial Statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the group and parent company financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. 
As required by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange, they are required to prepare the group financial statements 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company 
financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing 
each of the group and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:
–  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
–  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
–  state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and 
–  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate 
 to presume that the group and the parent company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility 
for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud 
and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on 
the company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility Statement in respect of the Annual Report
On behalf of the directors of the company we confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
–  The financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and 
 fair  view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included 
 in the consolidation as a whole.
–  The Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position 
 of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description 
 of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 48, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit, 
and express an opinion on, the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at 
www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate.
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion: 
– the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent 
 company’s affairs as at 31 December 2013 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended; 
– the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; 
– the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
 as adopted by the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; 
– the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
– adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate 
 for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
– the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
– certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
– we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Havelock europa plc 
Annu Al RepoR t 2013
Havelock Europa PLC is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
Statement of compliance
Both the parent company financial statements and the group financial statements (“financial statements”) have been prepared and 
approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRS”). 
On publishing the parent company financial statements here together with the group financial statements, the Company is taking 
advantage of the exemption in section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related 
notes that form a part of these approved financial statements.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain fixed assets stated at deemed cost, whilst intangible 
assets are stated at amortised fair value and the assets of the pension scheme are stated at their fair value while the liabilities of the 
pension scheme are stated using the projected unit method.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Adopted IFRSs requires the directors to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. The estimates 
and judgements are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, 
the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent 
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In particular, information about significant areas of estimation 
uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amount recognised 
in the financial statements is contained in the following notes:
Note 10 – measurement of the recoverable amounts of cash-generating units
Note 19 – measurement of defined benefit pension obligations
Note 19 – measurement of share-based payments
Note 20 – valuation of financial instruments
Note 12 – recoverability of deferred tax assets
As at 31 December 2013, the net debt position was £0.3 million with headroom of £5.4 million on committed facilities at that point. 
Cash flow forecasts have been prepared for the period through to 31 December 2015, including sensitivity analyses, taking account of 
the risks and uncertainties facing the Group as detailed in the Finance Director’s Review on page 28. Since the year end, the Group has, 
as detailed on page 25, agreed a revolving credit facility of £5m. The Group’s bankers remain supportive and the Group continues to 
operate within its facility requirements and is forecast to be covenant compliant during the relevant forecast period, albeit there are 
periods when the headroom is small and therefore the Group has identified mitigating steps to be taken during those periods. 
While the directors cannot envisage all possible circumstances that may impact the Group in the future, the directors believe that, taking 
account of the forecasts, sensitised forecasts, future plans and committed funding levels, the Group has sufficient resources to remain 
compliant with the relevant covenants and conditions attached to the Group’s banking facilities and to meet all debts as they fall due 
for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, after making reasonable enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group can continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future and therefore continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
Further information regarding the Company’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position, is set out in the Chief Executive’s Review.
The following standards have been adopted by the Group for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2013 and have 
had an impact on the previously reported results of the Group:
Amendment to IAS 1, Financial statement presentation regarding other comprehensive income
The main change resulting from these amendments is a requirement for entities to group items presented in ‘other comprehensive 
income’ on the basis of whether they are potentially reclassifiable to profit or loss subsequently. The statement of comprehensive 
income has been re-presented accordingly for all periods shown.

1. Accounting policies (continued)
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement 
IFRS 13 measurement and disclosure requirements are applicable to financial statements commencing 1 January 2013. As a result of this 
the Group has included additional disclosures in its financial statements in relation to financial instruments.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits Revised has been adopted since 1 January 2013. The most relevant impact of this revised standard is that for 
the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme, net interest income or expense is calculated using the discount rate used to measure the 
defined benefit obligation. The amendments have no impact on the reported net assets, but impact previously reported administrative 
expenses, financing costs and actuarial losses for the year ended 31 Dec 2012, as shown below:
The IAS 19 adjustments disclosed in the interim report for the period to 30 June 2013 were based on the estimates then available. 
The adjustments disclosed above are based on figures provided by the actuary of the pension scheme.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise Havelock Europa PLC and its subsidiaries. The financial statements of subsidiaries are 
prepared to the same reporting date using accounting policies consistent with those of the parent company. Intra-group transactions and 
balances, including any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in full. 
The Company accounts include information about the parent company only.
Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly (but normally 
through voting rights granted through the Company’s shareholdings), to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity to obtain 
benefits from its activities. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that 
control commences until the date that control ceases.
Foreign currency translation
Transactions and balances 
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate 
ruling at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at 
the rates prevailing at the dates when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at historical 
cost in a foreign currency (e.g. property, plant and equipment purchased in a foreign currency) are translated using the exchange rate 
prevailing at the date of the transaction. Exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the consolidated income 
statement for the period.

Annu Al RepoR t 2013
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and net of any accumulated impairment 
losses. Certain items of property, plant and equipment that had been revalued under UK GAAP on or prior to 1 January 2004, the date 
of transition to Adopted IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, regarded as being the fair value at the date of transition.
Land is not depreciated. For all other property, plant and equipment, depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to allocate cost 
less residual values of the assets over their estimated useful lives on the following bases:
–  Freehold and long leasehold buildings  50 years 
– Plant and equipment  3 – 10 years
– Fixtures and fittings  10 years 
–  Motor vehicles  4 years
Assets held under finance leases/HP contracts are capitalised and depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis 
as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. In respect of acquisitions that have occurred since 
1 January 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net assets acquired. 
In respect of acquisitions before this date, goodwill is included based on its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded 
under UK GAAP . For acquisitions after 1 January 2010, any transaction costs arising on business combinations are reflected within the 
consolidated income statement. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value and any subsequent remeasurements are reflected 
within the consolidated income statement. Any pre-existing relationships arising with entities acquired are identified and reflected 
separately within the consolidated income statement if settled on the business combination.
Goodwill is stated at cost or deemed cost less any accumulated impairment losses (see below). Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating 
units and is tested annually for impairment.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable goodwill is included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal.
Negative goodwill arising from a business combination is recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.
Other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and net of any accumulated impairment 
losses. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is the fair value at acquisition date. The cost of separately acquired 
intangible assets, including computer software, comprises the purchase cost and any directly attributable costs of preparing the asset for 
use. Amortisation of other intangible assets is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis when the asset is 
available for use so as to allocate the carrying amounts of the intangible assets over their estimated useful lives as follows:
–  Computer software  3 – 5 years 
–  Brands  10 years
–  Customer relationships  4 years 
–  Contracted customer relationships  4 years 
–  Order backlogs  0.5 years 
–  Non-compete clauses  2.5 years 
–  Design rights  10 years
Impairment of assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-current assets and all financial assets, other than deferred tax, are reviewed at each balance 
sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. Additionally, goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount 
is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating 
units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying 
amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis. Notes to the Financial Statements
60
Havelock europa plc 
Annu Al RepoR t 2013
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change 
in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying 
amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment 
loss had been recognised.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value using weighted average cost. Cost comprises directly attributable 
purchase and conversion costs and an allocation of production overheads based on normal operating capacity. Net realisable value 
is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, which is available for immediate withdrawal or on short-term deposit, and cash 
in hand. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included 
as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Dividends
Final equity dividends to the shareholders of Havelock Europa PLC are recognised as a liability in the period that they are approved 
by shareholders. Interim equity dividends are recognised when they are paid.
Financial instruments
Investments in subsidiaries 
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any provisions for impairment.
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are stated at cost less an allowance for irrecoverable amounts.
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are stated at cost.
Interest-bearing borrowings 
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at the fair value of the consideration received, net of attributable transaction 
costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost 
and redemption value being recognised in the consolidated income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective 
rate of interest method.
Net financing costs 
Financing costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Employee benefits
The Group and the Company operate both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
Defined benefit scheme 
The Group’s and the Company’s liability in respect of its defined benefit pension scheme is the present value of the defined benefit obligation 
less the fair value of the scheme assets at the balance sheet date. The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent qualified 
actuaries using the projected unit credit method and is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates 
on high quality corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Group’s and the Company’s obligations.
The expected return on scheme assets, net of administration expenses, and the interest on pension scheme liabilities, are recognised 
in the consolidated income statement. Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in full in the year in which they occur in the statement of 
comprehensive income.
Changes to the value of the defined benefit obligation arising from a benefit change are accounted for as a past service cost or credit 
which is recognised within the income statement when the benefit change is committed to. Changes to the value of the defined benefit 
obligation which arise from a change in the financial assumption used to measure scheme liabilities are regarded as actuarial gains or 
losses and recognised within the statement of comprehensive income.

Havelock europa plc 
Annu Al RepoR t 2013
Defined contribution plans 
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement 
as incurred.
Share-based payment transactions 
The Company operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans and Save-As-You-Earn (SAYE) schemes. 
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense in the consolidated income statement, with a corresponding 
increase in shareholders’ equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees 
become unconditionally entitled to the share incentives on a straight-line basis. The fair value of the share incentives granted is 
measured using appropriate valuation models, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the share incentives were 
granted. At each reporting date, the Group re-estimates the number of share incentives that are expected to vest based on non-market 
conditions. Any adjustment is recognised in the consolidated income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to shareholders’ 
equity, over the remaining vesting period.
The Havelock Europa Employee Share Trust holds shares in Havelock Europa PLC, which are presented in the consolidated and parent 
financial statements as a deduction from revenue reserves.
r evenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable net of trade discounts, cash discounts and volume 
rebates and excluding value added tax. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the consolidated income statement when 
the Group has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods and services to the customer, the revenue can 
be measured reliably, and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group. Revenue 
from goods shipped subject to installation is recognised when the customer accepts delivery and installation is complete. No revenue 
is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due, associated costs or the possible return 
of goods and continuing involvement with the goods such that the risks and rewards of ownership remain with the Group.
Significant contracts within the scope of IAS 11 which are for the construction of bespoke and significant projects are treated as 
construction contracts in accordance with IAS 11. Where the outcome of a contract can be measured reliably, contract revenue and costs 
are recognised over the period of the contract by reference to the value of work done at the balance sheet date with reference to third 
party certification where available. Where the outcome of a contract cannot be reliably estimated, contract costs are recognised as an 
expense when incurred and revenue is only recognised to the extent of the contract costs incurred that it is probable will be recoverable. 
In both cases, any expected contract loss is recognised immediately.
Exceptional items
The Group has disclosed additional information in respect of exceptional items on the face of the consolidated income statement in order 
to aid understanding of the Group’s financial performance. An item is treated as exceptional if it is considered that by virtue of its nature, 
scale or incidence it is of such significance that separate disclosure is required for the financial statements to be properly understood.
l eases/Hp contracts
Finance leases/HP contracts 
Leases are classified as finance leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Group. Finance 
leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum 
lease payments. The corresponding liability to the finance lessor is included in the balance sheet as a lease obligation. HP contracts are 
treated in the same manner.
Lease/HP payments are apportioned between the liability and the finance charge to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on 
the remaining balance of the finance lease liability.
Operating leases 
Leases other than finance leases are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the 
consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Segment reporting 
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur 
expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components, and for which discrete 
financial information is available. An operating segment’s operating results are reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker 
(which is deemed to be the Board) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance.
Segment results that are reported to the Board include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated 
on a reasonable basis. Segment reporting for the Group includes revenue, operating profit before restructuring costs and assets for each 
of the operating segments. No reporting of liabilities is recorded at a segment level and this measure is not reported to the Board. Notes to the Financial Statements

Taxation
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the consolidated income statement, unless the tax relates to items recognised directly 
in shareholders’ equity, in which case the tax is recognised directly in shareholders’ equity through the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.
Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the reporting period, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to the tax payable in respect of prior years.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax arising from initial recognition of an asset or liability, other than as a result of a business 
combination, that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, is not recognised. Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are 
expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled based on tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset 
can be utilised.
Non-current assets held for sale
A non-current asset or group of assets containing a non-current asset (a disposal group) is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will 
be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use, it is available for sale and sale is highly probable within one year.
On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets and disposal groups are measured at the lower of previous carrying amount 
and fair value less costs to sell, with any adjustments taken to profit or loss. The same applies to gains and losses on subsequent 
remeasurement. 
earnings per share 
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or 
loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS 
is determined by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding, 
adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
IFRS not yet applied
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations (that have not yet been endorsed by the EU) are not yet 
effective for the year ended 31 December 2013 and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. These are as follow:
 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements (effective for the year ending 31 December 2014): It provides a single model to be applied  
 in the control analysis for all investees, including entities that currently are SPEs in the scope of SIC-12. 
 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements (effective for the year ending 31 December 2014): This standard replaces the existing accounting for  
 subsidiaries and joint ventures (now joint arrangements), and makes limited amendments in relation to associates. IFRS 11 removes  
 the choice of equity or proportionate accounting for JCEs (as was under IAS 31). 
 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities (effective for the year ending 31 December 2014): this standard contains the disclosure  
 requirements for entities that have interests  in subsidiaries, joint arrangements (i.e. joint operations or joint ventures), associates and/or  
 unconsolidated structured entities. 
None of these standards are expected to materially impact the Group in its current form.

Cash flows beyond the three-year period covered by the operating profit projections have been extrapolated in perpetuity using 
a 2.25 per cent growth rate to allow for inflation. Zero real growth of revenue and margins has been assumed which management 
considers applies equally to all cash generating units. A pre-tax discount rate of 10 per cent has been used in discounting the 
projected cash flows which management considers applies equally to all units. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken using a range 
of discount rates none of which indicated an impairment of goodwill in the current period.

pension schemes – Group and c ompany
The Company operates a pension scheme providing benefits for its employees on two bases: a defined contribution section, where benefits 
are based on accumulated contribution balances, and a defined benefit section, where benefits are based on final pensionable pay. The 
scheme’s assets are held separately from those of the Group in a trustee-administered fund. The disclosures below relate to the defined 
benefit section of the scheme only.
During 2010, further accrual of defined benefits ceased and, with effect from 1 January 2011, the relevant employees all transferred to the 
defined contribution section of the scheme. Also during 2011, the Trustees decided that all benefits which are subject to increase in line with 
inflation should in future be increased in line with the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) rather than the Retail Prices Index (RPI) in relation to pensions 
in payment and agreed that, in accordance with the provisions of the trust deed, for deferred pensioners, all benefits which are subject to 
increases in line with inflation should also be increased in line with CPI rather than RPI .

The Scheme holds annuities with Aviva and Legal and General to cover some of the pensions in payment.
Effect of the Scheme on future cashflows
The Company is required to agree a Schedule of Contributions with the Trustees of the Scheme following a valuation which must be 
carried out at least once every three years. The next valuation of the Scheme is due as at 31 October 2015. In the event that the valuation 
reveals a larger deficit than expected, the Company may be required to increase contributions above those set out in the existing 
Schedule of Contributions. Conversely, if the position is better than expected, contributions may be reduced.
The Company expects to pay contributions of £817,000 to the Defined Benefits Section of the Scheme in the year to 31 December 2014.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 19 years.
Defined contribution schemes
Contributions to schemes on a defined contribution basis in respect of other employees were £570,000 (2012: £634,000).
The Group also contributed on a defined contribution basis in respect of two directors (2012: two) and contributions of £69,000 
(2012: £69,000) have been charged to the income statement in respect of the year.
Share-based payments – Group and c ompany
current schemes
The Group operates an Executive Share Option Scheme for senior executives and a Save-As-You-Earn share option scheme that is open 
to all employees and full-time directors. All awards of share options are settled by physical delivery of shares. The Group also operates 
a Long Term Incentive Plan for executive directors and senior managers.
Executive Share Option Scheme 2005
For awards made under the executive scheme introduced in 2005, awards have been issued subject to one of the following 
performance conditions:
1)  25% of the award will vest if growth in earnings per share in the three year performance period, stated in the award, exceeds the   
 growth in RPI or the consumer price index (CPI) by 2 percentage points per annum and 100% will vest if growth exceeds RPI or CPI 
 by 7 percentage points per annum, with proportionate vesting for performance between these limits. In the case of other employees,   
 but not directors or senior managers, the upper threshold is reduced to 5 percentage points per annum in the case of awards with 
 a  value of less than a year’s salary. The terms of each award specify whether the comparison is with RPI or CPI.
2)  The award will vest dependant on the share price of Havelock over the period of the option.
The contractual life of all options granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme is 10 years. No options were granted during the year.
Sharesave Schemes 2005 and 2008
Under the Sharesave Schemes 2005, eligible employees can save up to £60 per month over a three or five year period and use the savings 
to exercise an option granted at the outset at a 20 per cent discount to the then prevailing share price. The contractual life of the options 
under the three year and five year schemes is three-and-a-half and five-and-a-half years respectively.

Long Term Incentive Plan 2006
Awards made under the long term incentive schemes are subject to achieving certain performance targets over a three year period. 
The targets were chosen to align the performance of the individuals with the performance of the Group and the targets apply to all 
employees entitled to participate in the schemes. For awards made under the Long Term Incentive Plan 2006 during 2013, there are 
two performance conditions:
a)  the EPS test, under which 12.5% of the award will vest if growth in earnings per share above 2.55p, over the three year performance   
 period, exceeds the growth in RPI by 12.5 percentage points and 50% will vest if growth exceeds RPI by 200 percentage points, 
 with  proportionate vesting for performance between these limits, or
b)  the RoCE test, under which 12.5% of the award will vest if return on capital employed (RoCE) exceeds 5% per annum over the 
 three  year performance period, and 50% will vest if RoCE exceeds 9% per annum, with proportionate vesting between these limits.
There is an overriding requirement that Total Shareholder Return, in the performance period, is greater than 28% before any part of the 
award vests.
Awards made during 2012 are subject to the same performance conditions with a base earnings per share value of 2.4p and a Total 
Shareholder Return threshold of 20%.
Grants under Executive Share Option Scheme 2005
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted is measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted. 
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model for options granted 
in 2005 and prior. Options granted since 2005 have been valued using either a Binomial Valuation model for those options with earnings 
per share performance conditions or a Monte-Carlo simulation model for those with total shareholder return performance conditions. 
The contractual life of the options is 10 years and expectations of early exercise have been incorporated into the model.
The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility. Share options are granted under a service condition. Such conditions are not 
taken into account in the grant date fair value measurement of the services received.
There were no grants under the scheme during the current or prior year.
Long Term Incentive Plan 2006
The fair value of services received in return for share awards granted is measured by reference to the fair value of the share awards 
granted. In addition to grants to directors shown on page 47, conditional awards of 380,000 shares (2012: 330,000 shares) were 
granted to senior executives.

20. Financial instruments
Overview
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
– credit risk
– liquidity risk
– market risk
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes 
for measuring and managing risk, and the Group’s management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout 
these financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework.
The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and procedures 
and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers.
Trade receivables
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
Customers are expected to make payment within 30, 60 or 90 days of the date of invoice, all invoices being raised in the month of 
supply of the relevant goods. Each business has a dedicated credit controller who is responsible for ensuring that debtors are followed 
up rigorously. Additionally, the Group has a policy of insuring certain debtors.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other 
receivables. The general allowance is determined based on historical experience of the Group’s credit control function, including 
payment statistics for similar financial assets.
Other receivables
Other receivables consist mainly of amounts due from the Company’s pension scheme in respect of pensions paid by the Company 
on behalf of the scheme.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to managing 
liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and 
stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
At the year end, the Group maintained the following lines of credit:
– £3.93 million revolving credit facility
– £1.25 million overdraft facility
– £0.15 million term loan
– £0.37 million finance lease facility
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates, will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings 
of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable 
parameters, while optimising the return.
The Group’s approach is to consider minimising this risk through hedge arrangements designed to manage a proportion of the Group’s 
overall exposure. At present, no hedge arrangements are in place as the Board has decided it is in the Group’s best interest to retain the 
benefit of low cash interest payments whilst it continues to reduce debt. Notes to the Financial Statements

The impairment loss at 31 December 2013 of £333,000 (2012: £359,000) - Company £323,000 (2012: £343,000) is a provision for 
receivables due from customers.
The allowance account in respect of trade receivables is used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery 
of the amount owing is possible; at that point, the amount is considered irrecoverable and is written off directly against the financial asset.

Estimation of fair values
The following summarises the methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the 
above table.
Trade and other receivables/payables
For receivables/payables with a remaining life of less than one year, or that are receivable or payable on demand, the carrying amount 
is deemed to reflect the fair value.
Receipts from customers and payments to suppliers on undisputed invoices are within allowable credit terms.
Cash and cash equivalents
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
Bank loans
Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows at current interest rates.
Obligations under finance leases/HP contracts
The carrying amount of these liabilities approximates their fair value. Notes to the Financial Statements

Havelock europa plc 
Annu Al RepoR t 2013
Fair value hierarchy
IFRS 7 requires all financial instruments carried at fair value to be analysed under the following levels:
Level 1:  quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2:  inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset 
 or liability,  either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices);
Level 3:  inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
All financial instruments carried at fair value are Level 2.

The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share 
at meetings of the Company. All shares rank equally with regards to the Company’s residual assets. These rights extend to the shares 
in the Company that are held by the Group.
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base and an appropriate level of borrowings so as to maintain investor, creditor 
and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The Board of Directors monitors the return on capital.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the 
advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.

The merger reserve contains the premium arising on the shares issued as consideration for acquisitions that qualify for merger relief

Notice of Meeting 99
Havelock europa plc 
Annu Al RepoR t 2013
Notes:
1.  A member entitled to attend and vote at the above meeting may appoint one or more persons as his/her proxy to attend, speak and vote  
 instead of him/her at the meeting. If multiple proxies are appointed they must not be appointed in respect of the same shares. A proxy need  
 not be a member of the Company. A form of proxy is enclosed with this Notice. Completion and return of the form of proxy will not prevent  
 a member from attending the meeting and voting in person if he/she so wishes. A member may instruct their proxy to abstain from voting  
 on any resolution to be considered at the meeting by marking the “vote withheld” option when appointing their proxy. It should be noted  
 that an abstention is not a vote in law and will not be counted in the calculation of the proportion of votes “for” or “against” the resolution. 
 A member present in person or by proxy shall have one vote on a show of hands and on a poll every member present in person or by proxy  
 shall have one vote for every ordinary share of which he is the holder.
2.  In order to be valid, forms of proxy for the meeting and the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is executed or a  
 notarially certified copy of such power or authority must be received, not later than 48 hours before the time fixed for the meeting, at the  
 office of the Company’s Registrars: Capita Registrars, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU.
3.  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for this  
 meeting by following the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and  
 those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s),  
 who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
4.  In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST Proxy  
 Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK and Ireland Limited’s specifications and must contain the  
 information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the  
 appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be   
 transmitted so as to be received by the Company’s agent Capita Registrars Limited (CREST Participant ID:RA10) no later than 48 hours  
 before the time appointed for the meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the   
 timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the Company’s agent is able to retrieve the message by  
 enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time, any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST  
 should be communicated to the proxy through other means. CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service  
 provider(s) should note that Euroclear does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system  
 timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member  
 concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service  
 provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a  
 message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable,  
 their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical  
 limitations of the CREST system and timings.
5.  The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated  
 Securities Regulations 2001.
6.  As at 16 April 2014 (being the last business day prior to the publication of this Notice), the Company’s issued share capital amounted 
 to 38,532,050 ordinary shares carrying one vote each. Therefore, the total voting rights in the Company as at 16 April 2014 were 
 38,532,050 votes.
7.  The directors’ service contracts and the letters of appointment of the non-executive directors will be available for inspection during normal  
 business hours on any weekday (Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays excepted) from the date of this Notice until the close of the  
 Annual General Meeting at the registered office of the Company and at the offices of Dickson Minto WS, Broadgate House, 20 Primrose  
 Street, London EC2A 2EW and on the date of the Annual General Meeting at Mossway, Dalgety Bay, Fife from 10am until the conclusion 
 of the meeting.
8.  Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, the Company specifies that only those shareholders   
 registered in the register of members of the Company as at 6 pm on 29 May 2014 (or in the event that the meeting is adjourned, only those  
 shareholders registered in the register of members of the Company as at 48 hours before the time of the meeting) shall be entitled to attend  
 or vote at the above meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their name at that time. Changes to entries on the register  
 of members after 6pm on 29 May 2014, or in the event that the meeting is adjourned to a later time, on the register of members 48 hours  
 before the time of any adjourned meeting, shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
10.  Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives. Members can appoint more than one corporate  
 representative only where each corporate representative is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. Members cannot  
 appoint more than one corporate representative to exercise the rights attached to the same share(s).
11.  Information regarding the Annual General Meeting, and a copy of this notice of Annual General Meeting, is available on 
 www.havelockeuropa.com. Members may not use any electronic address provided in this notice or in any related documents 
 (including the accompanying proxy form) to communicate with the Company for any purpose other than those expressly stated.
12.  Any person holding 3% or more of the total voting rights of the Company and who appoints a person other than the Chairman of the 
 Annual General Meeting as his proxy will need to ensure that both he, and his proxy, comply with their respective disclosure obligations  
 under the UK Disclosure and Transparency Rules.

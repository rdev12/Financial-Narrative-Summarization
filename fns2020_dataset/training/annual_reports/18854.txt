At a glance – our performance
From the Chief Executive, Tom Reed:
“Since the appointment of the new Board on 28 January 2016, 
we have visited all the main assets of the Group and identified 
significant scope for operational improvements and cost 
savings across JKX. 
Areas of legacy risk exist primarily related to production 
tax litigation in Ukraine which we are confident that we can 
continue to manage.
During 2015 and in 2016, significant non-recurring 
administrative costs have been, or will be paid, by the 
Company as a result of past events and the Board is exploring 
all options to mitigate these.
We are encouraged by the physical characteristics of our 
reservoirs in Russia and Ukraine, the quality of the staff 
across JKX, the opportunity for operational and capital 
spending improvements, and remain committed to improving 
value per share to all shareholders. 
There are many challenges facing the Company, and the new 
Board is committed to a new and transparent approach and to 
actively engage all shareholders and other stakeholders of the 
Company in order to turn it around.”

of approximately $180 million in Rental Fees, plus damages 
to the business. The arbitration hearing is expected to take 
place in July 2016, which will include witness statements from 
certain members of the old Board and will result in additional 
legal costs for JKX.
In Ukraine, the Company’s subsidiary, Poltava Petroleum 
Company (‘PPC’), continues to experience a combination of 
aggressive production tax demands for periods up to the 
end of 2015 and also challenges to its compliance with the 
terms of its production licences (see Notes 2 and 27 to the 
financial statements). We have met with representatives of the 
Ukrainian Government in recent weeks to attempt to find  
a solution to all our production tax and licencing issues  
in-country and we are confident that an acceptable solution 
can be found. I will update shareholders when we have clarity 
on these issues.
Russia
The fall in international oil prices and continued sanctions are 
having a negative impact on Russia’s domestic economy. 
A combination of continuing low gas prices, which are set by 
the Russian Government, and the devaluation of the Russian 
Rouble in 2015 from RR56:$1 to RR72:$1 adversely affected 
the Group’s profit and cash generated from its Russian project 
in US Dollar terms. 
The combination of the recent Russian Rouble devaluation and 
only a minimal gas tariff increase in the near term has had 
a negative effect on our plans to expand our current licence 
portfolio there.
Hungary and Slovakia
Despite the recent fall in international oil prices, our 
exploration and appraisal prospects in Hungary and Slovakia 
remain attractive. Both economies are relatively stable and 
the Board is currently reviewing the investment options for 
these licences in 2016.
Cash 
The Group’s cash balance at the year end of $25.9 million has 
been significantly reduced in the first two months of 2016 by the 
$12.3 million redemption payment due under the terms of the 
convertible bond and the $2.2 million of severance costs and 
additional remuneration which the previous board approved 
and paid prior to the General Meeting on 28 January 2016. 
Cash balances will be further reduced in the coming  
months due to $3 million of legal costs incurred by Eclairs 
and Glengary, following the finding against the Company by 
the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in respect of the 
imposed shareholder restrictions. In addition, the Company 
will also have to pay its own legal costs for the continuation of 
any international arbitration proceedings (as already  
noted above).
Debt
In accordance with the terms of the Company’s $40 million 
Convertible Bond, $7.2 million of bond payments were 
made during 2015 and in February 2016 the Company made 
scheduled early redemption repayments to bondholders of 
$12.3 million. 
If all bondholders exercise their option to early redemption  
in February 2017, as they are entitled to under the terms of the 
bonds, the Company will owe bondholders a further  
$30.1 million at that time. 
Board
Following the replacement of the entire Board on 28 January 
2016, the composition of the Board has not complied with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code in respect of the number of 
independent Non Executive Directors. 
The Company has engaged an independent consultant to 
conduct due diligence on a short-list of candidates and is now 
in the final phase of appointing two new independent  
Non Executive Directors. As soon as this has been completed 
we will be re-establishing board committees to oversee audit, 
remuneration and nominations, to ensure that JKX has the 
first class corporate governance that it needs. As a temporary 
measure, and to ensure appropriate review and process in the 
release of this report, an Interim Audit Committee consisting 
of myself and Russell Hoare, your new Chief Financial Officer, 
was appointed.
Outlook
There remain risks noted above in respect of the $30.1 million 
bond payment which may become due in February 2017, the 
contingent liabilities in respect of Ukrainian production taxes, 
the Ukrainian production licence compliance issues and the 
continued low oil and gas prices, which, if realised, may impact 
the going concern status of the Company. These risks are fully 
addressed in Note 2 to the financial statements. However the 
Directors believe that there is a reasonable basis to mitigate 
the effects of such eventualities through negotiation with 
the Ukrainian Government, further operational and cash 
management measures and other restructuring or refinancing 
options, which are currently being assessed.
During our short period in office we have conducted an initial 
review of the Group’s assets, and the Board believes that JKX 
assets and staff provide a good platform to consolidate and 
improve on its existing oil and gas opportunities in central and 
eastern Europe.
It is true that the Board inherited many difficult challenges, 
but this is why we believed that change was so desperately 
needed. We remain committed to a transparent approach that 
actively engages all shareholders and other stakeholders of 
the Company and you will have already seen the first of what 
will be regular operational updates. We are confident that we 
will be able to turn JKX around.
Finally, I wish to thank all our shareholders and staff for their 
support of the Company and the new Board in this period of 
change. I look forward to working with all stakeholders to 
restore the value of the Company over the coming months.

Chairman
Chairman’s statement
A fresh perspective
I am pleased to present this report on behalf of the new Board 
of Directors that was appointed by shareholders on 28 January 
2016, charged with bringing a new vision and approach to 
restore shareholder value at JKX. This change in the Board 
resulted from proposals made by one of the Company’s 
largest shareholders, who saw that the Company needed a 
new direction and requisitioned a General Meeting to allow 
all shareholders to vote on this idea. It is a rare example of 
genuinely successful shareholder activism in the long history 
of the London Stock Exchange.
At the time of writing I am nearing completion of my second 
month as Chairman of your Company and so this report details 
activities that occurred before any of the new Board took 
office. None of the Directors who were in office in 2015 are  
now with JKX. When combined with the fact that 2015 was 
a year of continuing low international oil and gas prices 
combined with volatility and uncertainty in the regions in which 
JKX operates, the factors behind your Company’s results 
were beyond our control. However I can make two promises: 
from this point forward your new Board will be completely 
transparent in how we communicate to shareholders 
regarding the challenges we face in such an environment and 
the steps we are taking to restore the Company’s fortunes; and 
we will be resolutely committed to increasing efficiency and 
reducing needless costs.
Performance in 2015
The low oil and gas prices and the lack of capital investment 
led to the Company’s production, profits and operating cash 
flow falling significantly in 2015. Despite this, the Company has 
remained cash generative from its operations. 
The disappointing financial performance and decline in 
production was exacerbated by the suspension of all but 
essential capital investment across the Group, the delays in 
bringing well-27 in Russia back on line, and the intense focus 
of the Company on various legal proceedings.  
Ukraine
In Ukraine, the introduction of the 55% rate of production 
tax, foreign exchange controls and government-imposed 
restrictions on the sale of gas during the three months to 
28 February 2015 led to cash constraints and no capital 
investment programme during 2015.
The investment climate has improved following the reduction 
of gas production tax rates to 29% for 2016 and the lifting of 
restrictions on the sale of gas in February 2015. However the 
Ukrainian economy remains fragile and foreign exchange 
controls remain in place, making the repatriation of cash 
extremely difficult. 
You will no doubt recall that in 2014, the Company commenced 
arbitration proceedings against Ukraine on the basis of 
overpayment of production taxes (‘Rental Fees’), as explained 
more fully in Note 27 to the financial statements. During 2015 
an international arbitration tribunal issued an Interim Award 
requiring the Government of Ukraine to limit the collection 
of Rental Fees on gas produced by PPC to a rate of 28%. 
This Interim Award remains in effect until final judgement is 
rendered on the main case, which relates to the overpayment

$8/Mcf) or 59% stated as a gross margin. Our netback on oil in 
2015 was $17.56/bbl (based on an oil sales price of $40/bbl),  
a gross margin of 44%.
Our competitive advantage 
First to move
JKX invested in Ukraine over 20 years ago to help meet the 
demand gap and was rewarded with licences covering some 
of the best oil and gas fields in Ukraine. JKX has significant 
experience of doing business in this region.
Sustainable low cost production, cash generative operations
The Company commenced commercial production of oil and 
gas in Ukraine in 1995. It has over 450 experienced local staff 
working there and six producing oil and gas fields.
Our six producing fields and two Gas Processing Facilities 
(‘GPFs’) are located in the Poltava region of Ukraine. 
JKX’s business assets in Ukraine
Novo-Nikolaevskoye Complex

Our Novo-Nikolaevskoye Complex reserves comprise five 
distinct fields producing in to one GPF. In addition we have a 
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (‘LPG’) facility which converts some 
of our gas into LPG for sale into the expanding Ukrainian 
market.
Elizavetovskoye field   
5
Our Elizavetovskoye field and GPF, which are 45km from our 
Novo-Nikolaevskoye Complex, began commercial production 
in 2014. The field currently produces from three wells.
Our investment
We have invested over $550m in Ukrainian oil and gas 
development projects over the past 22 years. We have 
produced and sold gas, oil and condensate locally for the past 
21 years.
Ukrainian reserves

Market overview – Ukraine
Why are we here?
A huge demand for energy   
1
There is a huge demand for energy in Ukraine and a lack of 
local supply. Historically there has been a lack of investment 
in the development of oil and gas reserves in Ukraine and as 
a result there are good opportunities to develop additional 
reserves in Ukraine by applying the latest exploration and 
production technology. 
Ukraine is the fourth largest consumer in Europe with annual 
gas consumption of 42 Bcm/year. Domestic production is 
steady at 20 Bcm/year. As such, a significant gas demand gap 
will remain in Ukraine for the foreseeable future.
Gas pricing and realisations   
2
Ukraine imports its gas from Russia and Europe. The pricing 
of Russian gas has always been based on an oil-based 
formula. The pricing of gas from Europe is based on gas-
to-gas price competition at European hubs. The dynamic of 
these two pricing philosophies differ significantly and there 
are times when the hub based prices are significantly cheaper 
than the formulaic prices.
This is the arbitrage opportunity for Ukraine and 15 Bcm/year 
of gas can be accessed this way if the commercial incentives 
prevail.
The fundamental base gas price of the Ukraine market 
however will always be at least the oil indexed price or the hub 
price of Slovakia plus the additional cost of reverse flow. As a 
local producer we should always be able to get better netback 
prices than any supplier who has to cover all of these shipping 
costs (circa $20/Mcm).
A default price of European Hub plus $20/Mcm is a good floor 
price for JKX.
Netback analysis   
3
On 2 August 2014, the Ukrainian government increased gas 
production taxes to 55% (from 28%) and oil production taxes 
to 45% (from 39%) initially for 3 months but subsequently 
extended this through to 31 December 2015. From 1 January 
2016 the gas production tax has reduced to 29%.
The netback on our gas sold in Ukraine in 2015 was 
approximately $4.77/Mcf (based on a gas sales price of

Gas market changes in 2015
The balance of gas (20 Bcm/year) is imported and until 2015, 
virtually all of these imports have either been from Russia or from 
other ex-Soviet countries (particularly Turkmenistan) through 
Europe.
In 2015, the market has changed significantly due to the initiation 
of so called “reverse flow” capability from Europe. This entails  
the movement of gas from west to east across the existing border 
crossings between Ukraine and Hungary, Poland and most 
importantly Slovakia.
The last of these (Velke-Kapucharny) has been the major transit 
point for westward-moving Russian gas to Europe for over 40 years.
Redundant capacity in the complex of pipelines and compressors 
at this transit hub have been refurbished and upgraded to allow  
for the movement of gas in the opposite direction to the 
predominant flow.
This new-found technical capacity allows Ukraine to purchase gas 
from Europe and, rather than being completely dependent on 
Russia for imports, Ukraine can now assess competing bids for 
gas imports from Gazprom on the one side and European Energy 
Utilities on the other.
The macro gas world of Ukraine has changed forever.
This change broadens the supply pool in terms of the number of 
companies competing in the market which should in time result in 
more competition. Financial statements

Why are we here?
A huge demand for gas   
1
 
Industrial output in Russia declined through 2015 and there 
has been a proportionate reduction in domestic gas demand. 
However, the south of Russia is defying the general trend and 
in the Krasnodar region, where our Koshekhablskoye gas field 
is located, there has been a sustained increase in industrial 
gas demand in recent years. 
Annual industrial consumption of gas in the Krasnodar and 
Adygea regions is more than four times gas production.
Part of the reason for this is the population growth (and 
hence energy demands) of Sochi – initially as an Olympic 
venue, but more latterly as an expanding city and a favoured 
tourist destination. Gas is used locally in cement production, 
steel construction, glass manufacturing, heating and air 
conditioning – all of which is now abundant in Sochi.
Lack of local supply   
1
In southern Russia, gas demands are partially met by 
transporting gas long distances (at high cost) from production 
centres in the north of Russia. 
In Russia, historical Gazprom gas fields are now all in decline. 
To replace lost production, most investment into gas fields 
is in the development of the Yamal peninsula gas fields 
which are more than 4,000km north of our gas reserves at 
Koshekhablskoye, Adygea in southern Russia.
Forecast gas demand   
2
Due to a rapid industrialisation in southern Russia in the past  
five years, by 2020 gas demands there are expected to double.
Our competitive advantage   
3
First to move 
In 2007, we purchased the licence to rehabilitate and develop 
the Koshekhablskoye gas field in order to participate 
in the rapidly growing independent gas market. The 
Koshekhablskoye gas field is located in the Republic of 
Adygea, southern Russia, where gas resource is scarce, and 
there are high transportation costs from Russia’s main gas 
production area in the far north, some 4,000km away.
Gas realisations   
4
The average increase in Russian gas prices since 2007 has 
been 18%. There was an official 7% increase in the regulated 
maximum industrial gas price in 2015.
Netback analysis   
5
The gas production tax rate in southern Russia is 9%, which 
is approximately one third of the rate in Ukraine (29%). The 
netback on our gas sold in Russia in 2015 was approximately 
$0.70/Mcf (based on a gas sales price of $1.68/Mcf) – a gross 
margin of 41%.

Once we have identified what’s possible, we will work 
quickly to find the combination of talent, technology, and 
engineering that’s right for our fields. The team at PPC is 
talented and motivated; the staff are fully committed to 
establishing themselves as the clear technical, operational 
and development leader in Ukraine.
Russia
In Russia, we will maximise the cash generation from the 
asset, while reviewing strategic options, including additional 
development and monetisation options. We are conducting 
this exercise while challenging ourselves and the local service 
industry to target international norms for deep, HTHP gas well 
construction and completion in southern Russia. Our historic 
well workover costs are many times higher than similar wells 
in North America and we will understand why that is the 
case and what we can do about it before spending significant 
additional capital in the field.
Rest	of 	World
In Hungary and Slovakia, we will rebuild the Field Development 
Plan using best global practices and then adapt that goal 
for local execution. Attracting world-class services and 
reasonably priced capital requires scale, which is what we will 
have in mind while reviewing strategic opportunities in eastern 
Europe as well.
Finally, I wish to thank our staff for their dedication and 
support of the new Board and I look forward to updating 
all shareholders in more detail in the coming weeks on our 
strategy to restore shareholder value at JKX.
 
Tom Reed
Chief Executive Officer
In 2015, we have recognised an impairment charge of $51.1m 
on the carrying value of our oil and gas assets; $49.6m of 
which relates to our Novo-Nikolaevskoye Complex of fields 
in Ukraine. The charge arises mainly due to the impact of 
lower international oil and gas prices on our asset valuations 
and also due to the increase in the discount rate used for 
our Ukrainian projects, reflecting heightened economic 
uncertainty there. 
We have identified several potential liabilities relating to 
production taxes in Ukraine for certain periods since 2007, 
which we believe could have been more clearly communicated 
to shareholders. Including amounts arising in the second half 
of 2015, these potential liabilities total $41m and are being 
actively contested by the company, as described in more detail 
in Note 27 to the financial statements.
Due to a recent judgement against our Ukrainian 
subsidiary, Poltava Petroleum Company (‘PPC’), in the High 
Administrative Court of Ukraine in respect of one of these 
cases, a $10.9m provision has been recognised to reflect our 
estimate of the potential liability. The Board believes that these 
claims are without merit under Ukrainian law and we will 
continue to contest them vigorously. 
An exceptional charge of $3.0m has also been recognised 
for the legal costs of our two major shareholders, Eclairs 
and Glengary, which the Company will have to pay as a result 
of the finding against the Company by the Supreme Court 
of the United Kingdom that the restrictions placed on these 
shareholders in 2013 were invalid.
Outlook
As long as the current board and I are managing your 
company, we will stick to a few basic management and 
communication principles:
A. Transparent reporting of financial performance, as well as 
challenges and major risks to our business. We will treat 
the market as our partner, ‘Mr. Market’. We will tell our 
partner what we are thinking as well as our IFRS reporting, 
and let the share price take care of itself over time.
B. Rational capital allocation based on predicted economic 
return. No investments which are dependent on multiple 
expansion, market perception, or an unknown future buyer 
for positive return.
C. We will manage our operations and field development 
based on ‘what’s possible’ in the world of petroleum 
engineering, physics, and execution. Not based on what 
happened last year or what the drilling equipment that 
we acquired years ago can do. By targeting maximum 
engineering performance, and dealing with the local and 
technical shortcomings as they arise, we create a world-
class performance organisation.
Ukraine
In Ukraine, our immediate focus is to re-evaluate the Field 
Development Plan with global best practices in mind and 
particularly those practices that have successfully driven the 
unconventional oil and gas revolution in North America, where 
production gains were made in geology more challenging than 
our own.  
Chief Executive’s statement
Tom Reed  Chief Executive Officer
A fresh perspective
Late in 2015, JKX became the target of shareholder activism 
on the London Stock Exchange. We saw what appeared 
to be a company stuck in a rut rather than having a clear 
strategy to resolve the myriad external challenges it faced 
in today’s political and market environment. The Board that 
shareholders appointed on 28 January 2016 will actively 
address these challenges and return your company’s focus to 
oil and gas development. 
The new Board and I plan to make JKX an example of 
successful shareholder activism on the London Stock 
Exchange. We are true believers in shareholder rights and 
believe shareholder voices must be heard. 
Over the last 10 years, your company has invested in excess of 
$925 million in oil and gas field developments and generated 
cumulative operating cash flows of approximately $1.1 billion, 
with $12.8 million generated in 2015. 
This has been achieved without drilling a new well in Russia 
and without utilising latest generation drilling and completion 
techniques at our Ukrainian fields. This implies exciting 
geological potential for both. Hungary has also become more 
strategic to the Group in 2015 with the addition of six new 
production licenses.
Performance
We were not participants in the Company’s performance in 
2015, but we are responsible for reporting the financial results 
to you. As such, we will stick to some simple facts. 
Average oil and gas production for the year decreased by 
9% to 8,996 boepd (2014: 9,919 boepd), primarily due to the 
suspension of all non-essential capital investment in Ukraine, 
and no production from well-27 in Russia until December, due 
to repairs.
Group revenue for the year was 39% lower at $88.5m  
(2014: $146.2m) as a result of lower oil, gas and condensate 
prices in Ukraine and Russia, which followed international 
pricing trends, exacerbated by the decline in production.  
Operating loss before exceptional charges was $10.7m  
(2014: profit $11.6m) and loss for the year was $81.5m  
(2014: $79.5m).
Ukraine
In Ukraine, we exited 2015 with production at 4,210 boepd  
and averaged 4,325 boepd for the year, down 10% from 2014. 
No wells were drilled as capital expenditure was suspended, 
however the natural decline in production was slowed by 
workover and well-intervention operations.
Russia	
At our Koshekahblskoye field in southern Russia, we exited 
2015 at 7,271 boepd, and averaged 4,671 boped for the year, 
down 9% from 2014 due to well-27 not contributing for most of 
the year.
The two-year project to restore production to well-27 was 
completed in December 2015, improving the 2015 exit 
production as a result. To date, insurance recoveries related to 
these restoration costs have been approximately $6.1m.
Russian operations are today stable and we will assess the 
economics of further development opportunities in Russia in 
comparison to the rest of the company’s portfolio of capital 
investment opportunities.
Rest	of 	World
Hungary and Slovakia saw expansion of acreage under licence 
in 2015. JKX now has a 100% interest in six production licences 
in Hungary covering an area of 200 sq km, and a 25% interest  
in four exploration licences in Slovakia covering 1,376 sq km.  
We will assess the economics of further development 
opportunities in Hungary and Slovakia in comparison to the rest 
of the company’s portfolio of capital investment opportunities.
Reporting and exceptional charges
Within the rules of International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRS’), we will try to give the most open explanation of risks 
and potential liabilities as we can, and report performance, 
failures and major risks as they arise. We will also tell you 
what we can about our plans to overcome the Company’s many 
challenges. 
Through our regular frank and open communications we 
hope to rebuild investor confidence and trust in JKX with both 
current and future shareholders. Financial statements

In 2014 at the Elizavetovskoye field in Ukraine, we drilled 
three new wells, doubled the gas processing capacity at the 
new GPF and converted our exploration licence into a 20 year 
production licence.
Stakeholder	 management
The gas markets in which we can sell our gas in Ukraine 
and Russia are broadly regulated by Government. The price 
at which we can sell our gas in Russia is controlled by the 
Government. 
We attempt to maximise stability and predictability within 
these markets by selling our gas under long term contracts 
to reputable customers. For example, in Russia, all of our gas 
production is sold to a local trading company through a gas 
sales contract which remains in place. Due to the disruption 
in the Ukrainian gas market in 2015 our long term gas sales 
agreement with Shell was terminated however we continue to 
look to secure stable long-term industrial customers for our 
gas production there.
Sustainable	 low	 cost	 production
Our low cost operating model using local employment and 
expertise has been learnt from 22 years of operating in 
Ukraine. This experience and knowledge is transferable 
across central and eastern Europe.
Progress in 2015
Group production decreased by 9% to 8,996 boepd (4,671 boepd 
in Russia; 4,325 boepd in Ukraine). 
Production costs reduced by 14% at $7.45/boe mainly as a 
result of Hryvnia and Rouble devaluations; gas realisations 
also reduced to $4.20/Mcf.
Revenues declined significantly primarily due to a sharp fall in 
oil and gas realisations and lower production volumes.
Why is profitable production growth important?
Profitable production growth from our fields will increase our 
revenue, profits and shareholder value. Our future production 
profile underpins the value of the Group.
99% and 81% of our total production in Russia and Ukraine, 
respectively, is gas. 
Our oil and gas production is limited by the performance of our 
oil and gas reservoirs. Our gas production is also limited by 
the processing capacity of the three Gas Processing Facilities 
(‘GPFs’) at our Koshekhablskoye field in Russia, and the Novo-
Nikolaevskoye Complex and Elizavetovskoye fields in Ukraine.
How we go about it
We produce our oil, gas and condensate from fields in 
Ukraine and southern Russia, where demand for oil and gas 
significantly exceeds the local supply. 
We sell all the oil, gas, and condensate that we produce, 
locally. In Ukraine, some of our gas and condensate production 
is converted into LPG and sold into the expanding Ukrainian 
LPG market. This increases overall revenues from the gas 
produced. 
First	 to	 move	
JKX invested in the oil and gas industry in the region in 
1994. We own and control 100% of all our producing fields, 
therefore we have the flexibility to regularly reprioritise field 
developments to grow Group production in the most  
effective way.
Significant	 regional	 experience	 and	 subsurface	 expertise	
Our highly skilled local Russian and Ukrainian technical 
teams are experts in local laws and regulations, who ensure 
that we can quickly obtain the permits required to continue 
with planned field developments. Having this expertise in-
house ensures efficient day-to-day drilling, development and 
construction operations at minimum cost.

The Board is reviewing all development projects and 
enhancement opportunities. 
Gas realisations are anticipated to remain at current levels 
in Ukraine through 2016, with Rouble-denominated gas 
realisations in Russia expected to remain flat and to decrease 
in US$-terms, if the Rouble devalues.
Risks 
Ukraine	
Investment plans in Ukraine to increase production may be 
impacted if there is any further government intervention in 
the gas market or increases to gas production tax. Production 
growth requires the economic parameters for investment in 
Ukraine being maintained.
Russia	
In Russia, tubing replacements at our wells are complex and 
the chances of success are reduced due to the depth of the 
wells and the high temperatures and high pressures at which 
they operate. 
Future development work may only be commercial with  
higher local gas prices and a strengthening of the Rouble 
against the US$.
The Russian gas prices are controlled by the government and 
therefore may not increase in line with current expectations. 
In addition, the Rouble could weaken against the US$ and both 
of these factors could reduce the value of future projects in 
Russia and their net returns.
Ukraine
Development drilling in Ukraine was suspended in 2015 
because of the government’s intervention in the gas sales 
market including the introduction of punitive rates of 
production tax, foreign exchange controls and government-
imposed restrictions on the sale of gas. Consequently, further 
development of the Elizavetovskoye field was on hold in 2015, 
although workover operations have continued in our mature 
Ukrainian fields.
In Ukraine, production decreased by 10% to 4,325 boepd, gas 
realisations reduced to $7.65/Mcf, as did production costs at 
$7.45/boepd.
The three wells at our Elizavetovskoye field, contributed 
production of 1,715 boepd (10.1 MMcfd of gas and 29 bopd).
Production at our mature fields in the Novo-Nikolaevskoye 
Complex reduced 20% to 2,611 boepd.
Russia	
In Russia, tubing failures in two of the five production wells at 
the Koshekhablskoye field continued to constrain production 
in 2015 to approximately 30 MMcfd from the remaining three 
wells (see page 37). One of these wells, well-27 was restored 
to production in December 2015 following repairs and 
recompletion.
Production in 2015 reduced 9% to 4,671 boepd and our local 
gas price improved 7% on 1 July 2015. 
The Russian authorities issued their approval of the upgrade 
project for expansion of our Russian GPF capacity to 60 MMcfd 
in 2015, which permitted the project to be completed. The 
nominal processing capacity of the GPF is close to 60 MMcfd 
(approximately 10,000 boepd).
Outlook for 2016 and beyond
Production in 2016 is expected to increase following the 
restoration of well-27 in Russia, in December 2015, the cost of 
which was mostly covered by insurance proceeds. 
A new Board was appointed at JKX on 28 January 2016  
(see page 6). After visting the Group’s main assets within  
30 days of its appointment, the new Board is encouraged by  
the physical characteristics of the reservoirs in both Russia  
and Ukraine.

Outlook for 2016 and beyond 
Future reserves replacement in Ukraine requires capital 
investment and the Board that was appointed on 28 January 
2016 is reviewing the investment programme in Ukraine and 
Russia for 2016. 
Risks 
The calculations to measure oil and gas reserves require an 
estimate of expected future oil and gas prices. If a prolonged 
period of low oil and gas prices is forecast, the commercial 
returns from development projects reduce, which in turn can 
reduce the reserves assessments. 
The oil price is mainly influenced by international markets. 
In Russia the governments control the gas sales price and 
in both Ukraine and Russia governments control other key 
economic parameters for investment there. It is therefore 
difficult to predict whether any of these parameters affect JKX 
in the foreseeable future which may impact the commercial 
rates of return for investments into oil and gas projects.
Russia	
Wells at the Russian gas field are deep, complex and 
expensive, and will require significant technical analysis in 
advance to de-risk the project.
Reserves reassessment
66.1 MMboe 29.7 MMboe 
During the year our estimation of remaining 2P reserves decreased 
by 6.2 Bcf of gas (total 1.0 MMboe). Our reserves were independently 
reviewed by DeGolyer & MacNaughton at 31 December 2014 and 
updated internally to 31 December 2015.
During the year our estimation of remaining 2P reserves increased 
by 9.6 Bcf of gas and 0.8 MMbbl of oil (total 2.4 MMboe). Our reserves 
were independently reviewed by DeGolyer & MacNaughton at  
31 December 2014 and updated internally to 31 December 2015.

Our UK-based technical team focus on refining the Group’s 
short, medium and long term plans to maximise value from 
existing reserves and to increase the reserves in our licence 
areas. 
This requires applying the latest Western technologies to 
interpret the subsurface data and production results. We 
use this to regularly reschedule our drilling targets and field 
development plans to maximise our cash flows and chances of 
success. 
In addition the UK team oversees the day-to-day technical 
challenges that arise at our fields and support the Group’s 
business development activities with technical due diligence 
when new opportunities arise. 
We regularly use independent engineering firms to estimate 
our reserves and resources which provide a certain level of 
assurance over our own assessments.
We share technical knowledge and resources between our 
projects in Ukraine and Russia.
Progress in 2015
Our 2P reserves have been assessed at 95.7 MMboe (Russia 
66.1 MMboe; Ukraine 29.7 MMboe). Our reserves replacement 
ratio was 42%.
In Ukraine, our potential to increase reserves has been 
extremely limited in 2015 due to the suspension of 
development drilling at the beginning of the year as a result of 
the government’s introduction of punitive rates of production 
tax, foreign exchange controls and restrictions on the sale 
of gas (see page 32). The rate of gas production tax has now 
reduced to 29% from 1 January 2016, and there has been no 
further direct government intervention in the gas sales market 
since it expired in February 2015. 
Why is oil and gas reserves growth important?
Production from our oil and gas reserves in Ukraine and 
southern Russia will continue to generate cash to fund future 
development and exploration in the region. 
The reserves replacement ratio measures the amount of new 
oil and gas reserves that we have discovered during the year 
compared with what we have produced from existing reserves.
Our ability to replenish and grow our reserves base is a good 
indicator of the success of our exploration and appraisal 
programme and ensures sustainable production.
How we go about it
To ensure we can continue to grow our oil and gas reserves we 
maintain a balance of investment in:
• exploration
• appraisal and 
• development projects.
Visionary	 marketplace	 analysis	 and	 subsurface	 expertise
Exploration includes acquiring new oil and gas exploration 
and production licences when they arise in the region and 
continuing with our exploration programme across our 
existing portfolio of licences. We continue to screen a lot of 
potential opportunities in central and eastern Europe that fit 
with the Company’s strategy.
We continue to focus on geographies and geologies that we 
understand in central and eastern Europe. 
Significant	 regional	 experience	 and	 local	 expertise
Our three technical teams in London, Poltava (Ukraine) and 
Maikop (southern Russia) all have important roles to achieve 
the highest quality results from subsurface.

Stakeholder	 management	 –	 community
We aim to invest in, and improve, the communities in which we 
operate. We do this by providing local taxes, local employment 
and stability, which are highly valued by employees, local 
communities and governments. 
Stakeholder	 management	 –	 environment	
We operate an Environmental Management System (‘EMS’) 
accredited to ISO 14001 to reduce our impact on the 
environment. Our EMS requires ongoing training to staff and 
promoting a thorough understanding of our environmental 
policy to our business partners and suppliers. 
Progress in 2015
During 2015 our performance against our health and safety 
targets resulted in: 
• an All Injury Frequency Rate (‘AIFR’)
1
 of 0.15, the target set 
was 0.40; 
• Zero Lost Time Injuries (‘LTI’)
2
, the target set was 0.25. 
We measure our environmental performance using 
Environment Incident Frequency Rate (‘EIFR’)
3
. 
In 2015 our EIFR was 0.3 which exceeded our target set of 0.7. 
Outlook for 2016 and beyond 
We expect to maintain our strong Health and Safety culture 
throughout the Group and exceed our industry AIFR and LTI 
performance targets. Our internal AIFR and LTI performance 
targets for 2016 are both set at 0.35, well below the industry 
benchmarks.
Our internal EIFR performance target has been set at 0.6  
for 2016. 
Why is operating safely and responsibly important?
At the year end, our Russian and Ukrainian operations 
employed 249 and 493 personnel, respectively. Our London 
office has 22 staff. This puts people as a top priority for the 
Board.
We work in environments that are challenging and hazardous 
by nature. As well as operating efficiently, it is vital that we 
also operate safely and responsibly. Our behaviour impacts 
our employees, our shareholders, the wider community and 
the environment. 
Our performance in the society in which we operate, and the 
environment, are a critical part of measuring our overall 
performance.
How we go about it
Stakeholder	 management	 –	 staff
We aim to attract and retain the best people, supporting them 
with appropriate HSECQ systems and supporting the local 
communities in which we operate. We attract the best people 
by offering attractive remuneration packages and working 
environments, by providing daily challenges, and opportunities 
for personal development. 
We have over 700 staff in Ukraine and Russia of which more 
than 98% are local people. This provides us with a deeper 
understanding of local cultures which we respect and work 
with to get the best from our staff. 
Ensuring the welfare and human rights of our employees is 
an important consideration in our day-to-day activity, both in 
the UK and internationally. We use the United Nations rights 
frameworks as guiding principles throughout our Code of 
Conduct, our employment practices and our relationships with 
suppliers, wherever we do business.

payments to governments for the year ended 31 December 
2015, for activities related to exploration, development and 
extraction of oil and gas resources.
We disclose below payments made to governments of the 
Group’s subsidiaries involved in extractive activities. The term 
‘government’ includes a department, agency or entity that is 
controlled by the government authority.
Reporting	 currency
Where payments have been made in currencies other than  
the reporting currency (US$), the exchange rate existing at the 
time the payment is made has been used.
Payment	 types	 disclosed	 at	 project	 level
Payments are disclosed on the project basis where 
practicable.
They are presented on a cash basis, net of any interest and 
penalties on late tax payments or on underpaid tax.
There were no payments in kind made to a Government during 
the year.
The following payment types are disclosed for legal entities 
involved in extractive activities for the year ended 31 December 
2015: 
Corporate	 income	 taxes	
Payments to governments based on taxable profits under 
legislated income tax rules.
Production	 taxes
Payments to governments in relation to revenue or production 
generated under licence agreements. In the Consolidated 
Income Statement (page 112), production taxes are presented 
as production based taxes, not income tax.
Fees
Payments to governments in the form of fees include: tax on 
gas consumed for its own use, licence fees, area fees.
Excluded	 amounts
Taxes levied on consumtion such as value added taxes, 
personal income taxes, sales taxes, property and 
environmental taxes have not been included in this report.
We will continue to invest in local training and skills 
development and appropriate community development 
projects and will maintain a regular dialogue with local 
stakeholders and authorities regarding our future plans.
We will maintain our OHSAS 18001 Health & Safety 
accreditation, our ISO 14001 Environmental accreditation and 
our ISO 9001 Quality Management accreditation.
Risks
Development and monetisation of our oil and gas reserves, 
exposes us to a wide range of significant health, safety, 
security and environmental risks.
On a daily basis, there is a risk of the loss of containment of 
hydrocarbons and other hazardous material, as well as the 
risk of fires, explosions or other incidents.

2-67
The $32.6m decrease in cost of sales (before exceptional 
charges), to $76.8m (2014: $109.4m), is mainly due to 
decreases in:
• Russian operating costs of $3.4m (a decrease of 22.4% 
from 2014)
• Ukrainian operating costs of $2.3m (a decrease of 18.7% 
from 2014) 
• Ukrainian oil and gas inventory movements and product 
purchases of $1.5m
• a reduction in the depreciation, depletion and amortisation 
(‘DD&A’) charge of$6.3m 
• production based taxes of $19.3m, predominantly related to 
Ukraine 
• offset by an increase in Rest of World costs of $0.2m.
The decrease in Russian operating costs of $3.4m is largely 
due to lower field support activities and related costs, and 
lower property tax payments due to the reduced value of the 
Russian assets used for property tax purposes. Additionally, 
the Rouble devaluation from an average of RR38.6/$ to an 
average of RR62.0/$ reduced the US Dollar reported cost base 
for Russia throughout the year. 
Ukrainian operating costs decreased by $2.3m, mainly due to 
suspended drilling activity, reduction in staff and the effects 
of Hryvnia devaluation from an average of UAH12.0/$ to an 
average of UAH22.3/$. 
Ukrainian sales from inventory and product purchases 
decreased by $1.5m to a gain of $0.4m (2013: charge $1.1m), 
as a result of production meeting sales demand throughout 
the year, thus reducing the need to purchase additional gas to 
meet sales commitments. 
The DD&A charge reduced by $6.3m, largely as a result of 
lower production. The Group’s depletion rate reduced to  
$7.94/boe (2014: $8.93/boe) following lower asset carrying 
values resulting from impairments recognised in Ukraine and 
Russia in 2014. 
Gas sales volumes in Russia were 8.6% lower at 4,301 boepd 
(2014: 4,706 boepd). Average gas realisations dropped by 35.4% 
from $2.60/Mcf to $1.68/Mcf mainly due to the devaluation of 
the Russian Rouble from an average of RR38.6/$ in 2014 to an 
average of RR62.0/$ in 2015. The effects of the Rouble 
devaluation partially offset the 7.5% increase in Rouble-
denominated gas realisations in Russia from 1 July 2015. 
The combination of lower realisations in Russia and Ukraine 
resulted in an overall average reduction in gas realisations of 
26.8% to $4.20/Mcf (2014: $5.74/Mcf). 
Oil sales
Oil sales volumes were 22.3% lower at 777 boepd (2014:  
1,000 boepd) as a result of the lack of capital investment in 
2015 and the expected decline in production volumes from the 
mature Novo-Nikolaevskoye group of fields in Ukraine. More 
recently commenced production from the Elizavetovskoye field 
development in Ukraine is predominantly gas.   
Average Group oil realisations were 45.2% lower at  
$49.75/bbl (2014: $90.79/bbl), in line with the significant drop in 
international oil prices. 
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (‘LPG’) sales
The $4.9m decline in LPG revenues was due to lower 
production volumes combined with a reduction in the domestic 
market price of 45.1% to $442.6/tonne (2014: $807/tonne), 
resulting from increased competition through both imports 
and other domestically produced supplies. 
Loss from operations 
The loss from operations was $75.6m which included 
exceptional charges of $64.9m.
Loss from operations before these exceptional charges 
was $10.7m (2014: profit $11.6m) which was the result of 
the $57.7m decrease in revenues being only partially offset 
by a decrease in cost of sales of $32.6m, a decrease in 
administrative expenses of $2.0m and a decrease in loss on 
foreign exchange of $0.8m.

Financial review
Russell Hoare  Chief Financial Officer
Echoing the sentiments of your new Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer, I would like to add that it is an honour to have 
been appointed by shareholders at the General Meeting on 
28 January 2016 and I look forward to working with the new 
Board and the rest of the Company’s employees to enhance 
performance and restore value to JKX. 
Results for the year
The Company’s financial performance for 2015 has been 
severely impacted by the deteriorating economic conditions 
and geopolitical situation in Ukraine compounded by the 
decline in oil and gas prices and the deterioration of local 
currencies where the Group operates.
The Group recorded a loss for the year of $81.5m (2014: loss 
$79.5m) after exceptional charges of $64.9m which comprised:
• a non-cash impairment charge of $51.1m (2014: $69.1m) for 
the Group’s oil and gas assets; 
• a provision of $10.9m recognised as a result of a recent 
judgement against our Ukrainian subsidiary in respect of 
one of the rental fees cases (see Note 27 to the consolidated 
financial statements) and 
• a provision for legal costs of $3.0m (including interest) 
(2014: nil) to be reimbursed as a result of the judgement 
of the Supreme Court which allowed an appeal by Eclairs 
Group Limited (‘Eclairs’) and Glengary Overseas Limited 
(‘Glengary’) and their nominees against the Court of 
Appeal’s judgment that the voting restrictions placed on 
them on 31 May 2013 by the Company were valid.  
In 2014, an exceptional charge of $3.5m as a result of one-
off costs incurred in Russia to kill well-27 was recognised in 
addition to non-cash impairment of $69.1m. 
Loss for the year before exceptional charges was $25.8m 
(2014: loss $22.0m).
Revenue   
1
Group revenues in 2015 from Ukraine and Russia were down 
39% and 41% respectively (see table) versus the previous year, 
a fall of $57.7m in total. 
Gas sales
Gas sales volumes in Ukraine were 8.9% lower at 3,171 boepd 
(2014: 3,481 boepd) as a result of reduced gas production to 
3,503 boepd (2014: 3,854 boepd), an inability to sell normal 
levels of gas in January and February 2015 (due to restrictions 
imposed by the Ukrainian Government), and the suspension 
of all drilling activity in Ukraine until the investment climate 
improves (a company policy which is currently under review).  
Whilst the gas price increased by 62% from an average of 
4,271 UAH per Mcm in 2014 to 6,924 UAH per Mcm in 2015,  
US Dollar gas realisations in Ukraine declined 23.0% from  
$9.93/Mcf to $7.65/Mcf due the devaluation of the Hryvnia 
from an average of UAH12.0/$ during 2014 to an average of 
UAH22.3/$ during 2015. Before introduction of a new law 
on the Ukrainian gas market on 1 October 2015, the state 
regulator made periodic adjustments for Hryvnia/$ exchange 
rate fluctuations which impacted gas realisations. From  
1 October 2015, these periodic adjustments ceased and gas 
prices have followed market trends.

exceptional items).  
Exceptional charges 
Exceptional charges of $64.9m in the year consist of:
• a $51.1m impairment charge against our oil and gas assets;
• a provision of $10.9m to cover potential liabilities of 
production based taxes following the recent court hearing 
in Ukraine, and 
• $3.0m charge relating to reimbursement of legal costs 
to Eclairs and Glengary as a result of the Supreme Court 
decision.
The impairment charge for the year of $51.1m comprises:
• $49.6m in respect of Novo-Nikolaevskoye Complex in 
Ukraine (see Note 5 (d) to the consolidated financial 
statements) mainly as a result of the sharp decline in 
international oil and gas prices and an increase in the 
discount rate applicable to JKX’s Ukrainian projects;
• $1.5m in respect of our Hungarian oil and gas assets due to 
the sharp decline in international oil and gas prices and the 
reduction in assessed contingent resources (see Note 5 (f) 
to the consolidated financial statements).
Earnings per share
Basic loss per share before exceptional items were 14.97 cents 
(2014: loss 12.76 cents) in line with the pre-exceptional loss. 
Basic loss per share after exceptional items was 47.32 cents 
(2014: loss 46.21 cents) reflecting the Group loss after 
exceptional items net of their related tax effects of $55.7m 
(2014: $57.6m).
Taxation 
The total tax credit for the year was $1.2m (2014: $25.8m 
charge) comprising a current tax charge of $4.8m (2014: 
$9.5m) in respect of Ukraine, a deferred tax charge before 
exceptional items of $3.1m (2014: $31.2m) and a deferred tax 
credit of $9.2m in respect of exceptional items (2014: $15.0m).
The fall in current tax charge to $4.8m reflects lower 
profitability in Ukraine. In Ukraine, the corporate tax rate for 
2015 was 18% and remains at this level for 2016. 
The total deferred tax credit of $6.1m (2014: $16.3m charge) 
comprises:
• a $2.1m credit reflecting the recognition of deferred tax 
assets in respect of Russian tax losses carried forward to 
future periods; and
• a net $4.0m credit (2014: $15.0m) relating to an impairment 
and the provision for historic production based taxes in 
Ukraine and other tax timing differences on our oil and gas 
assets in Russia and Ukraine.
Loss for the year after tax
The result for the year, after exceptional charges of $55.7m 
(net of deferred tax effects), was a loss of $81.5m (2014: loss 
of $79.5m). On a pre-exceptional basis, loss for the year was 
$25.8m (2014: $22.0m).
On a pre-exceptional basis, the $3.8m change is the combined 
result of:
• a $57.7m decrease in revenues (as noted above);

Production taxes
Excluding the $10.9m exceptional charge for Ukrainian 
production based taxes from 2010 (see below), other 
production based taxes for the Group decreased by $19.3m  
(or 42.4%) to $26.2m (2014: $45.5m), mainly as a result of 
lower gas production tax rates applied due to the Interim 
Award of the Arbitration Case (see ‘Other Taxation – Ukraine’), 
lower production in Ukraine and the devaluation of the Hryvnia 
(see “Other Taxation – Ukraine” section for details).
Average gas production tax in Ukraine decreased from  
$124.4/Mcm to $83.4/Mcm and average oil production tax 
decreased from $34.9/bbl to $21.6/bbl. 
In Russia, average gas production tax decreased from  
$11.4/Mcm to $5.3/Mcm in 2015 due to implementation of a 
new Mineral Extraction Tax regime from 1 July 2014  
(see ‘Other Taxation – Russia’).
The various factors listed above contributed to the Group’s 
effective gas production tax decrease from $12.57/boe to 
$8.00/boe.
Other taxation – Ukraine
On 1 April 2014, the Ukrainian government increased 
production tax rates for gas from 25% to 28%. This rate was 
then applied to the actual average import price for gas as 
communicated by the Ministry of Economic Development 
and Trade of Ukraine. The oil tax rate at this time remained 
constant at 39%.
On 1 August 2014, the Ukrainian government passed 
emergency budget legislation to increase the gas production 
tax rate from 28% to 55% of the maximum gas price published 
monthly by the Ministry of Economy. Oil tax rates also 
increased from 39% to 45% from 1 August 2014. 
In December 2015 the Ukrainian Government passed 
legislation to reduce the gas production tax in Ukraine from 
55% to 29% with effect from 1 January 2016. 
As part of the JKX’s international arbitration against Ukraine 
in respect of overpaid production taxes (see Note 27 to the 
consolidated financial statements), the Group applied for 
interim measures under the bilateral investment treaties 
that exist between Ukraine and the United Kingdom and the 
Netherlands, respectively, to reduce the rate of production 
tax applicable to our Ukrainian subsidiary, Poltava Petroleum 
Company (‘PPC’). On 23 July 2015, an international arbitration 
tribunal issued an Interim Award requiring the Government of 
Ukraine to limit the collection of rental fees on gas produced 
by PPC, to a rate of 28%. The Interim Award, which is binding 
on Ukraine as a matter of international law, will remain in 
effect until the final ruling which will be issued following the 
arbitration hearing which is expected to take place in July 2016.  
Other taxation – Russia
A new mineral extraction tax (‘MET’) formula was 
implemented from 1 July 2014. The gas and condensate 
MET rate applicable in 2015 was 305 Roubles/Mcm (2014: 
409 Roubles/Mcm). The formula is based on gas prices, 
gas production as a share of total hydrocarbon output and 
complexity of gas reservoirs (depletion rates, depth of the 
producing horizons and geographical location of producing 
fields). Our Russian subsidiary, Yuzhgazenergie LLC (‘YGE’), 
is entitled to a 50% discount based on the depth of gas 
reservoirs.
In addition to production taxes, YGE is subject to a 2.2% 
property tax which is based on the net book value of its 
Russian assets as calculated for property tax purposes. 
This amounted to $1.5m in 2015 (2014: $2.5m). This amount 
is included in other cost of sales in the consolidated income 
statement.
Administrative expenses and foreign exchange
The Group’s administrative costs decreased by $2.0m to 
$17.5m (2014: $19.5m) during the year largely due to: 
• a decrease in group staff costs of $2.2m and other costs of 
$2.1m mainly as a result of significant devaluation of local 
currencies (Hryvnia and Rouble) against the US Dollar; 
• offset by a $2.3m increase in legal and professional fees 
incurred as a result of the international arbitration (see 
Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements). 
Foreign exchange losses were recognised at $4.9m  
(2014: $5.7m loss) due to the Rouble and Hryvnia devaluations 
previously noted. Included in foreign exchange loss is the 
cost of $1.5m associated with the conversion and repatriation 
of dividends of $10.0m from Ukraine to the UK. During 2014 
the National Bank of Ukraine (‘NBU’) issued a decree which 
imposed currency convertibility and repatriation restrictions, 
initially until 1 December 2014, later extended to 2 March 2015, 
3 June 2015, 3 September 2015, 4 March 2016 and subsequently 
to 8 June 2016. The currency controls severely restrict the 
group’s ability to make cash transfers out of Ukraine. JKX 
received an award from the Tribunal ordering Ukraine to 
convert and repatriate dividends to the UK however the NBU 
declined to process the application.
Net finance charges
Finance costs have increased by $3.3m to $6.5m (2014:$3.2m) 
comprising convertible bond interest of $6.5m. In 2014 interest 
of $3.0m was capitalised in respect of borrowings used to 
construct property, plant and equipment which was completed 
in 2014. 
The $1.9m charge (2014: $9.1m credit) for the fair value 
movement on the derivative liability represents the change in fair 
value of the conversion option associated with the convertible 
bond. The bonds have a conversion option which becomes more 
valuable to the bond holder as the Company’s share price nears 
or exceeds the fixed conversion strike price (76.29 pence). As 
the Company’s share price has increased from 12.00 pence at 
31 December 2014 to 27.25 pence at 31 December 2015 and the 
probability of the conversion option has increased, a charge has 
been recognised that represents the increase in fair value of the 
potential liability of the Company to settle any conversion options 
that may be exercised in future periods.   
Finance income comprising income from bank deposits 
increased by $0.2m to $1.3m (2014: $1.1m). Financial statements

Group production
In 2015, group production was adversely affected by Ukrainian 
government imposed restrictions on gas sales to industrial 
customers through to 28 February, which also disrupted the 
Ukrainian gas sales market in the months thereafter, and 
production constrained in the Koshekhablskoye field in Russia 
with wells 27 and 5 off-line for tubing replacement. Production 
increased from Q3 through to Q4 with sales restrictions lifted 
in Ukraine, a successful rigless intervention campaign and 
well-27 commencing production, as planned, late in 2015.

Group average production for 2015 was 8,996 boepd, 
comprising 48.7 MMcfd of gas and 872 bpd of oil and 
condensate, a 9% decrease on the average from 2014. Oil and 
gas production from our facility in Hungary remains suspended 
whilst development plans are reviewed and a farm-in partner 
is sought to participate in the further development of the 
Hajdunanas field.
Cash flows 
Cash generated from operations was lower at $12.8m (2014: 
$58.4m). This is a result of a $14.7m increase in the loss from 
operations, despite decreases of $6.8m and $18.0m in non-
cash DD&A and impairment charges, respectively, an increase 
in other non-cash charges of $0.5m combined with $6.6m 
increase in cash outflow from changes in working capital 
(although this is largely a timing difference and compares with 
a working capital inflow of $15.6m in 2014).
Interest paid during the year comprised $3.0m (2013: $3.3m), 
mainly relating to financing charges on the convertible bond. 
Income tax paid in the year decreased to $0.7m (2014: $7.6m), 
due to lower profits earned by the Ukrainian subsidiary and the 
utilisation of prepaid tax in Ukraine at the end of last year. 
Net cash generated from operating activities was lower at 
$9.1m (2014: $47.5m) as a result of the $45.6m reduction 
in cash from operations offset by a reduction of $6.9m in 
Ukrainian corporation tax payments and a $0.3m decrease in 
interest payments.
Net cash used in investing activities has significantly 
decreased to $1.9m (2014: $41.9m) mainly due to the reduced 
capital investment programme in both Russia and Ukraine. 
Investment in property plant and equipment, the largest 
component in investing activity cash flow, was $34.4m lower 
than the prior year at $5.6m (2014: $40.0m).
Cash inflow from held-to-maturity investments of $2.7m 
(2014: outflow $2.7m) comprises proceeds from Ukrainian 
government US$ treasury bills which matured in January and 
February 2015. 
Net cash outflow from financing activities in the year mainly 
relates to redemption of bonds with a principal amount of 
$4.0m in addition to an early redemption premium of $0.2m on 
19 February 2015 and a $1.5m repayment of the Credit Agricole 
working capital facility at PPC, which expired during the year.
No dividends were paid to shareholders in the year (2014: nil).
Cash 
Cash at the end of the year (excluding restricted cash) was 
$25.9m (2014: $25.4m). The increase is as a result of an overall 
increase in cash and cash equivalents generated in the year 
of $1.6m (2014: $7.0m increase) driven by the reduced capital 
expenditure program, offset by the negative effects of foreign 
exchange on cash balances of $1.1m (2014: decrease $7.3m).   
Liquidity
The Group employs a number of financial instruments to 
manage the liquidity associated with the Group’s operations. 
These include cash and cash equivalents, together with 
receivables and payables that arise directly from our 
operations.
Separate from these, the main financial instrument of 
the Group is the $40 million guaranteed unsubordinated 
convertible bond which was placed in Q1 2013 with institutional 
investors which matures in 2018. The bonds have an annual 
coupon of 8 per cent per annum payable semi-annually in 
arrears. The bonds terms and conditions contain an annual 
put option each February until maturity. Bonds with a 
principal amount of $10m were redeemed on 19 February 
2016 in addition to an early redemption premium of $0.9m, in 
accordance with the terms and conditions of the bond. This 
followed redemption of $4m in February 2015, together with an 
early redemption premium of $0.2 million. Further information 
on the terms and conditions of the bonds is included in Notes 
13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements. 
Dividends 
No dividends have been paid or proposed during the year, and 
the Board will not be recommending the payment of a dividend 
at the forthcoming AGM.
Outlook
As detailed in Note 2 to the financial statements, there remains 
a number of material uncertainties that may cast significant 
doubt about the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. 
The financial position of the Company continues to suffer from 
the adverse economic conditions in Russia and Ukraine and the 
generally low oil and gas prices affecting similar companies 
around the world. The 2015 results have also been adversely 
affected by weakening local currencies.
The new Board, which was appointed on 28 January 2016 is 
assessing all possible avenues to optimise operations and 
financial returns and reduce costs wherever this can be done 
without risking the long-term viability of our assets or our health 
and safety obligations. We will identify non-core costs that can 
be reduced, operating efficiencies that can be implemented and 
focus our capital on revenue-generating assets.
In Ukraine, the restrictions on exchanging and repatriating 
dividends, the difficulties in attracting foreign investment and 
credit, the threats to a stable and transparent gas market and 
specific pressures on independent oil and gas producers will 
all continue to make decisions for investment difficult for JKX 
and other companies in the sector. However, the Company is 
firmly committed to Ukraine having been present there for 
more than 20 years with a highly experienced and committed 
workforce and we will endeavour to increase the cash 
generation capabilities of our resources in the country.  
The returns on our Russian assets have been severely reduced 
due to the adverse economic conditions and the low gas tariffs. 
During 2015 the investment plans for Russia were halted and 
the new Board is considering whether to continue with this 
strategy. The operations, however, will be cash-flow positive 
in 2016 and we will utilise these cash resources for allocation 
throughout the Group.
This focus on reducing costs and implementing a robust 
capital allocation policy will ensure maximised cash flows 
from our assets and improvements to the Company’s 
profitability and liquidity. I look forward to working with all the 
Group’s employees to deliver on these promises.

Drilling	 and	 development	 activity
There was no drilling activity on the Elizavetovskoye field 
during the year. However there are plans in place for additional 
development drilling on both the Elizavetovskoye and West 
Mashivske fields should the investment climate improve. The 
Skytop rig is stacked at the proposed E-305 drilling location.
Production	 facilities	
The Elizavetovskoye production facility was upgraded at the 
end of 2014 to expand capacity and meet the recently revised 
hydrocarbon dew point specifications in the export pipeline. 
The K-3000 compressor was commissioned in early 2015 and 
is being used to ensure maximum possible input to the export 
line.
Zaplavskoye exploration licence activity
Work is continuing on the evaluation of the Visean V25/26 
sandstone traps and the Devonian sandstone and Visean 
carbonate structural closures with the aim of working these 
up for future drilling should the economic climate change.
Koshekhablskoye licence
Production
Average production from the Koshekhablskoye field in 2015 
was 4,670 boepd comprising 27.7 MMcfd of gas and 48 bpd 
of condensate, a 8.6% decrease on the average for 2014. The 
production figures remain lower than plant capacity due to the 
suspension of production from well-27 and well-05. Well-27 
came back on line in December 2015.
Workover	 and	 well	 stimulation	 activity
Production from crestal well-20 in the period ranges from 
14-18 MMcfd subject to three routine acid treatments using 
coiled tubing during the year. The north flank well-25 has been 
producing 8-12 MMcfd, with two routine acid treatments.  
The deep east-flank well-15 cycles between 0.9 MMcfd and  
1.5 MMcfd, with fluid build-up being cleared periodically.
The well-27 tubing replacement was completed, as planned, 
in Q4 2015. Production has been restored and acid treatments 
are planned for 2016. 
Production	 facilities	
Average production over the period of 27.7 MMcfd allowed the 
Gas Processing Facility (‘GPF’) to operate comfortably within 
its current design capacity of 40 MMcfd. 
The plant was shut down for ten days in September 2015 to 
complete the modifications required to increase the plant 
capacity to 60 MMcfd. This involved changes to a number of 
the vessels, replacement of some valves and pipework and 
improvements to the operating procedures. 
Licence	 obligations
The obligation to re-enter and sidetrack well-09 to re-drill the 
full Callovian reservoir sequence and, if successful, test the 
Callovian V unit, has been deferred until 2019.

Average production from the Novo-Nikolaevskoye group of 
fields for 2015 was 2,611 boepd comprising 10.9 MMcfd of gas 
and 794 bpd of oil and condensate, a 20% decrease on the 
average for 2014. 
Development	 drilling	 and	 other	 well	 activity
2015 saw no improvement in the investment climate in Ukraine 
and a decision was taken to cease all capital investment in the 
country, other than production optimization operations. 
The Skytop N-75 rig is stacked in Ukraine on the 
Elizavetovskoye field pending new work. The TW-100 
workover rig continued operations through 2015 with four 
abandonments and three workovers.
• Well recompletions in the period comprised re-running 
the completion in well IG-140 to facilitate entry of coil 
tubing to the horizontal section; resetting the completion 
in well IG-106 to permit additional perforations to be made; 
abandoning the horizontal section of M-169 and adding 
perforations at the top of the Devonian. 
• Z-04 in the Zaplavskoye license, IG-79 and IG-140 in the 
Ignatovskoye license and M-31 in the Molchanvoskoye 
license were plugged and abandoned. Plans were in place 
to abandon R-12Z in the Rudenkovskoye field, however, 
the well was put on test prior to abandonment and had 
significant production. Consequently, the well has not been 
abandoned and will become a batch producer.
• Wireline operations have focussed on the clearance of  
wax and salt build up in the production tubing of a number 
of wells. A sustained programme in the period, particularly 
during the winter months, has ensured that oil production 
in particular has exceeded expectations. Additional 
wireline intervention included perforations in M-153 in 
Molchanovskoye and IG-138, IG-106, IG-137bis, IG-105 and 
IG-123 in Ignatovskoye. 
• IG-140, IG-138 and IG-124Z on the Ignatovskoye field were 
acidized to increase production. 
• A seismic rock physics, inversion and reservoir 
characterization study has started on the Novo Nikolavskoye 
group fields. The work is aiming to characterize the fluid 
types within the sands identified on seismic. The results aim 
to de-risk additional drilling locations. 
Production	 facilities	
Operations at the main production facility and the LPG plant 
continued smoothly throughout the year with routine work 
continuing on plant optimisation, re-routing flowlines to 
reduce back pressure, and wax clearance of flowlines to 
enhance production from the available well stock. The annual 
plant shut down was completed during May 2015.
Elizavetovskoye Production Licence
Production	 Licence	 extension
A westward licence extension to the Elizavetovskoye production 
licence to include the West Mashivske prospect was awarded in 
the second quarter of 2015. The licence is valid until 2034 and 
the additional area of 33.9 square kilometres brings the total 
area of the licence up to 104.7 square kilometres.
Production
Average production from the Elizavetovskoye field in 2015 
was 1,715 boepd comprising 10.1 MMcfd of gas and 29 bpd 
of condensate, a 13.5% increase on the average in 2014. The 
relatively dry Elizavetovskoye wells E-301 and E-302 were 
used as swing producers throughout Q1 2015 to adjust gas 
export volumes to the market demand.

Licences
JKX now operates six production licences (Mining Plots) 
covering a total of 200 sq km in North Eastern Hungary. 
This follows the exploration licence exchange which HHE 
completed in 2014. JKX operates these areas with 100% equity.
Hajdunanas	 field
Production from the Hajdunanas and Gorbehaza fields was 
suspended in 2013 by the operator at that time. JKX has since 
taken 100% interest in the fields and is currently reviewing 
plans to sidetrack the watered out Hn-2 well and continues 
to seek a farm-in partner to participate in the further 
development of the field.
Exploration	 and	 appraisal	 –	 Hernad	 licences
The Hernad I & II Exploration Licences expired in April 2015 
and JKX (100%) submitted six mining plot applications to 
cover known hydrocarbon accumulations in the licences. 
By year end JKX had received approval for five of the Mining 
Plots; Tiszavasvari IV, Hajdunanas IV (extension), Hajdunanas 
V, Emod V and Jaszkiser II. The sixth Mining plot, Pely I was 
approved on 4 January 2016.
These mining plots will enable JKX to carry out appraisal and 
development activity over a 35 year period.
JKX is currently seeking a farm-in partner, or partners, to 
participate in this activity.
Turkeve	 IV	 Mining	 Plot
JKX holds a 50% beneficial interest in part of the Turkeve IV 
Mining Plot that includes the productive area around the  
Ny-7 well. However, the high CO
2
 content has prevented direct 
access to the pipeline network and the operator is developing 
a mechanism to lower the CO
2
 content to an acceptable level. 
Operational review
Slovakia
Exploration
JKX holds a 25% equity interest in the Svidnik, Medzilaborce, 
Snina and Pakostov exploration licences in the Carpathian fold 
belt in north east Slovakia. The Pakostov Licence was acquired 
in 2016, as protection acreage following encouraging prospect 
mapping, and covers 128 sq km. The total area of the four 
licences is 1,376 sq km. 
Several prospects were matured by the Operator, 
DiscoveryGeo, and the Joint Venture approved a three well 
exploration programme in November. Location construction 
work started in December at all three wellsites (Smilno, 
Poruba and Kriva Ol’ka). The first well, Smilno-1, is expected 
to spud in the first quarter of 2016 and the other two wells will 
be drilled as part of the same drilling programme. Financial statements

Our framework of internal controls is supported by a culture 
that promotes good risk management processes led by the 
Board. 
Responsibilities 
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
control and risk management systems and for reviewing their 
effectiveness. 
Risk management process 
A risk management process, which involves the Risk 
Committee, has been in place throughout 2015 and up to the 
date of approval of this Annual Report. 
The process is designed to manage rather than eliminate the 
risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only 
provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
Risk Committee   
1
 
The Risk Committee assists the Executive Directors in the 
operation and implementation of the risk management 
process, and provides a source of assurance to the Audit 
Committee that the process is operating effectively. This 
approach aims to actively manage risk in a transparent and 
accountable way.
The Risk Committee meets at least three times a year and 
reports into each Audit Committee meeting.
Risk assessment 
The Board monitors the risk profile of the Group using four 
risk categories: 
1.	 External
2.	 Financial
3.	 Strategic
4.	 Operational
The Board acknowledges that it will be subject to residual 
risk in pursuit of achieving its strategic priorities even after 
mitigating actions. 
Risk management framework
The key elements of the risk management process are as 
follows:
Risk	 identification – risks faced by the Group are identified by 
senior management and risk owners, who periodically review 
the risks to ensure that the risk management processes and 
controls in their area are appropriate and effective, and that 
new risks are identified.
Risk	 assessment – the consequence and likelihood of each 
risk materialising is assessed. Risk registers are used 
to document the risks identified, the level of severity of 
its impact, and probability of occurrence, ownership and 
mitigation measures for each risk. 
Principal risks and how we manage them
Risk	 Committee	 work	 in	 2015 Risk	 Committee	 work	 in	 2016
Risk Committee
1
At the Group level, work continued with the Audit Committee to review 
the overall process of business risk management and to validate the 
risk register, with particular focus on improving reporting and 
involvement in the Group’s from Risk Committees at both our 
operating subsidiaries in Ukraine and Russia. 
At our operations in Russia and Ukraine:
• local training was provided to the Risk Committees to develop the 
upward communication of specific risks and mitigation plans, and 
the visibility between the risks associated with delivering the 
Board’s strategic priorities and our activities on the ground;
• Risk Velocity was introduced to the Risk Committees as a factor in 
grading the identified risks; and
• representatives from our Ukrainian and Russian Risk Committees 
attended each of the Group Risk Committee meetings to expand on 
the risks identified locally and their related mitigation plans.
The group level risks assessment process continued throughout the 
first quarter of 2016 but with the appointment of new executive 
directors on January 28th, 2016, the process of assessing such risks 
involved a far deeper analysis than normal due to the need for the new 
executive directors to fully understand the risk profile of the 
business. This report on the Principal risks facing the business has 
been drafted following input from this most recent assessment 
process.
JKX contingent resources 
Except for minor revisions to Hernad, changes have been 
made to the contingent resources since 2014 year end. These 
contingent resources are those volumes of hydrocarbons 
which are potentially recoverable from known accumulations 
but which are not currently considered to be commercially 
recoverable. The categories of 1C, 2C or 3C are used to reflect 
the range of uncertainty. These contingent resources are 
tabulated below.

JKX prospective resources 
D&M evaluated JKX’s exploration potential at the end of 2014 
and categorised the potential resources of the undrilled 
prospects in the Company’s portfolio. There are no changes 
to the D&M work in Ukraine, however, an additional prospect, 
SW V25 Amplitude, can be added as D&M’s work was 
completed prior to the Zaplavskoye license extension thus 
excluding this prospect. JKX has also identified a further 
opportunity to the north east of the Molchanovskoye license, 
NE Mol V25 Stratigraphic Sand. The three wells planned in 
Slovakia are also now included in the Prospective Resources 
category. Undrilled prospects inevitably carry an element 
of technical risk and it is usual to summarise them under 
unrisked potential and risked potential resources. It should 
be noted that less well defined leads and prospects with little 
expectation of being drilled are excluded from such a list.

Risk assessment table
A Risk Velocity measure is built in to the assessment of the 
impact of each risk. Risk Velocity is the time to impact and is 
an estimate of the time frame within which a risk may occur.
Risks are then logged with reference to consequence rating, 
multiplied by the likelihood plus velocity rating, as shown in 
the diagram below.
The Board has completed a robust assessment of the most 
significant risks and uncertainties, which could impact the 
business model, long-term performance, solvency or liquidity, 
and the results are summarised below. Also presented is 
an assessment of the probability of each risk occurring, 
its potential impact should it occur, the Key Performance 
Indicators (‘KPIs’) and strategic priorities most affected 
as each risk increases, how each risk is being managed or 
mitigated and whether the overall business risk has increased 
or decreased since the last annual report.
The principal risks set out on pages 44 to 52 are not set out 
in any order of priority, they are likely to change and do not 
comprise all the risks and uncertainties that the Group faces.

Geopolitical – Ukraine
Description: 81% of the Group’s revenues and most of its profits and cash flow from 
operations are derived from its activities in Ukraine. 
Recent civil conflict, political instability and ongoing military action in parts of Ukraine 
have negatively impacted the economy and relations with the Russian Federation resulting 
in Ukraine’s sovereign risk rating downgrade by all credit agencies in 2015.
Escalating geopolitical tensions have had an adverse effect on the Ukrainian financial 
market. The ability of companies and financial institutions with assets in Ukraine to obtain 
funding from the international capital markets has been hampered as a result of 
decreased appetite for Ukrainian credit exposure. Any continuing or escalating military 
action in eastern Ukraine could have a further adverse effect on the economy. In addition, 
Ukraine will probably need additional external financial support through 2016 (see also 
Liquidity Risk page 48).
Impact: If the country does not peacefully resolve the current conflict as well as secure 
additional financing, there is a risk it may default on its obligations and/or introduce new 
decrees to increase government funds from independent companies in Ukraine. Changes 
in law or the regulatory environment and the possibility of immediate implementation 
could have a sudden material adverse effect on the Group’s operations and financial 
position, which would reduce the Group’s profits and cash flows.

The Board To date, our operations have not been directly impacted by the unrest in Ukraine or the 
military conflict in the east.
Ukrainian Government-imposed restrictions on selling its gas to industrial clients, the 
doubling of gas production tax and the foreign exchange controls led the Board to suspend 
the 2015 capital investment programme in Ukraine. The gas sales restrictions and punitive 
tax rates have now been removed. 
The Board frequently reviews announcements by national and local governments in 
Ukraine and Russia regarding their future plans to influence economic factors, in 
particular those plans that impact future oil and gas prices and related costs and taxes.
The Company also takes all reasonable measures to reduce and limit our commercial 
exposure in Russia and Ukraine through the use of careful selection of contracting parties, 
advanced payments and careful cash management.
The Board is currently assessing the investment program in Ukraine whilst bearing these 
geopolitical risks in mind.
Chairman’s 
statement 
P6
Geopolitical – Group
Description: Most of the Group’s operations and more than 97% of our oil and gas assets 
are located in Ukraine and Russia and the oil, gas and condensate that we produce is sold 
into their domestic markets. 
Both countries display emerging market characteristics where the right to production can 
be challenged by State and non-State parties. The business environment is such that a 
challenge may arise at any time in relation to the Group’s operations, licence history, 
compliance with licence commitments and/or local regulations. The Group endeavours to 
comply with all regulations via Group procedures and controls or, where this is not 
immediately feasible for practical or logistical considerations, seeks to enter into dialogue 
with the relevant Government bodies with a view to agreeing a reasonable time frame for 
achieving compliance or an alternative, mutually agreeable course of action (see Note 2 to 
the financial statements).
In addition, local legislation constantly evolves as the governments attempt to manage the 
economies and business practices regarding taxation, banking operations and foreign 
currency transactions.
Impact: The Group’s operations and financial position may be adversely affected by 
interruption, inspections and challenges from local authorities, which could lead to 
remediation work, time-consuming negotiations and suspension of production licences. 
The constantly evolving legislation can create uncertainty for local operations if guidance 
or interpretation is not clear.

The Board The Board and Management recognise the constant need for expert advice to ensure full 
compliance with local and international regulations and laws. 
Our strategy is to employ skilled local staff working in the countries of operation and 
provide them with on-going training.
In addition, the Group engages established legal, tax and accounting advisers to assist in 
compliance with statutory, employment and environmental regulation and laws, and to 
ensure its tax and duty obligations are properly assessed and paid when due.
A key priority for the Group is to maintain transparent working relationships with all key 
stakeholders in our significant assets in Ukraine and Russia and to improve the methods 
of regular dialogue and on-going communications locally.

Tax legislation
Description: The Group is exposed to changes in local tax laws, particularly in Ukraine. 
In Ukraine, PPC has at times sought clarification of their status regarding a number of 
production related taxes. PPC continues to defend itself in court against action initiated by 
the tax authorities regarding production related taxes for certain periods through to  
31 December 2010 (see Note 27 to the financial statements).
At the end of July 2014, the Ukrainian Government approved emergency fiscal measures 
which almost doubled subsoil taxes on the Company’s gas production through 2015.  
The Ukrainian Government has now enacted legislation, effective from 1 January 2016,  
to reduce the subsoil taxes on gas production to substantially the same levels that were in 
effect prior to the temporary increase. 
Governments in emerging markets sometimes bring in new tax laws which are effective 
immediately but are subject to varying interpretations and changes, which may be applied 
retrospectively.
Other risks include a weak judicial system that is susceptible to outside influence.
Impact: If Management’s interpretation of tax legislation does not coincide with that of the 
tax authorities, the tax authorities in the countries of operation may challenge 
transactions which could result in additional taxes, penalties and fines which could have a 
material adverse effect on the Group’s financial position and results of operations.

The Board continues to receive legal advice that the case against PPC regarding 
calculation and payment of various production related taxes to 31 December 2010 has little 
legal merit under Ukrainian law for legal and technical reasons and the three year statute 
of limitation. The Company continues to pursue international arbitration proceedings 
against Ukraine under the Energy Charter Treaty to recover $180m in Rental Fees that 
PPC has paid on production of oil and gas in Ukraine since 2011, in addition to damages to 
the business (see Note 27 to the financial statements).
The Group takes regular advice on tax matters from Ukraine tax experts to comply with all 
known requirements and to actively defend its legal position.
The Group maintains a transparent and open relationship with local, regional and national 
tax authorities in Ukraine and Russia.
The Group’s financial information does not include any adjustments to reflect the possible 
future effects on the recoverability, and classification of assets or the amounts or 
classifications of liabilities that may result from these tax uncertainties.
Financial 
review 
P30
Commodity prices
Description: JKX’s policy is not to hedge commodity price exposure on oil, gas, LPG or 
condensate and therefore is exposed to international oil and gas price movements and 
political developments in Russia and Ukraine. Change in prices will have a direct effect on 
the Group’s trading results. 
Oil prices declined significantly in 2015 and are predicted to remain lower for longer by 
many market commentators. The Company sells the oil it produces at prices determined 
by the global oil market. 
During 2015 Ukraine acquired the ability to purchase gas from Europe which has more 
closely aligned Ukrainian gas prices with those across Europe, which have almost halved 
since the beginning of 2015. In addition, Ukrainian Government has enacted legislation 
designed to deregulate the gas market in Ukraine, but the timeframe and guidance for the 
implementation of such legislation and its impact on the Group is unclear. Over time, these 
reforms are likely to have an effect on the internal gas market in Ukraine.
In Russia all our gas is sold in local industrial markets and the government control the gas 
prices at which we can sell our gas. In 2014 there was no official increase in the regulated 
maximum industrial price and on 1 July 2015 the regulated maximum industrial price was 
increased by 7.5%.
Impact: A period of low oil and/or gas prices has led to impairment of the Group’s oil and 
gas assets (see Note 5 to the financial statements) and may impact the Group’s ability to 
support its long-term capital investment programme (see Liquidity Risk below) and 
reduce shareholder returns including dividends and share price.
Previous oil and gas price increases have resulted in increased local taxes, cost inflation 
and more onerous terms for access and to produce resources. As a result, increased oil 
and gas prices may not improve the Group results.

JKX attempts to maximise stability and predictability of prices under long term contracts 
with reputable customers. This minimises exposure to abrupt price movements, ensuring 
sales are as closely matched as possible, in terms of timing and volume, to production. 
In Russia, all gas produced is sold to a local gas trading company through a gas sales 
contract which remains in place through 2016. The sales price was negotiated using 
current and expected future oil and gas prices and production volumes.
In 2015, most of the oil and gas production in Ukraine is sold by way of auctions, conducted 
with a frequency aimed to achieve as close as practicable the aforementioned matching 
principle. 
The Group does not usually enter into hedge agreements unless required for borrowing 
purposes as may occur from time to time. 
The Board continues to monitor announcements by governments in Ukraine and Russia 
regarding the gas price charged by Gazprom (Russia) to Ukraine and forecast European 
hub prices to assess the potential impact on the Ukrainian industrial gas price and its 
sustainability.
In Russia from 1 July 2015 the regulated maximum industrial price was increased by 7.5% 
as was the price at which we sell gas to our buyer.

Foreign exchange exposure
Description: The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk 
arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to Ukrainian Hryvnia and 
the Russian Rouble. 
The US Dollar is the currency which influences the majority of the Group’s revenues and 
capital costs. 
Although a proportion of costs are incurred in US Dollars, most operating costs are 
influenced by the local currencies of the countries where the Group operates, principally 
Ukrainian Hryvnia and Russian Rouble. 
During 2015, the Hryvnia and Rouble devalued by 34% and 23% respectively, against the 
US Dollar. 
As a result, the Group’s operating costs in US$ terms including the cost of production, 
operating and general admin costs decreased however the Group reported a foreign 
exchange loss of $4.9m in the income statement as a result of the devaluation of the 
Rouble and Hryvnia. 
The devaluation in the Rouble reduced the carrying value of the assets held in Russia 
resulting in the Group’s net assets decreasing by $26.3m.
Impact: Appreciation of the Ukrainian Hryvnia or depreciation of the Russian Rouble 
against the US Dollar or prolonged periods of exchange rate volatility may adversely affect 
the Group’s business results.

Foreign exchange risk arises in the Group from commercial transactions, financing 
arrangements and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and net 
investments in foreign operations. 
We attempt to match, as far as practicable, receipts and payments in the same currency 
and also follow a range of commercial policies to minimise exposures to foreign exchange 
gains and losses. These include minimising exposure to the Hryvnia denominated sales, 
which continue to account for more than 80% of Group revenues, and the Rouble-based 
operating and capital costs.
All our gas sales and most of our costs in Russia are denominated in Roubles which 
mitigates the Group’s exposure to any Rouble/US Dollar fluctuations, however the recent 
devaluation of the Rouble has reduced the value of Group revenues and costs which are 
reported in US$.
The Group’s normal policy is not to hedge foreign exchange risk but to continually monitor 
internal and external guidance on expected future currency exchange movements and 
manage the currency of the Group’s major cash flows and holdings to minimise our 
potential exposure. 
Financial 
review 
P30
Financial risks
Liquidity
Description: 81% of the Group’s revenues and most of its profits and cash flow from 
operations are derived from its activities in Ukraine.
Changes in commodity prices have a direct effect on the Group’s liquidity position  
(see Commodity Risk above). 
If the Bondholders exercise their put option in February 2017 pursuant to the $40 million 
Convertible Bonds (see Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements), the 
Company will have an obligation of $30.1 million which becomes payable at that time, or,  
if the Bond expires at its full term, an obligation of $31.1 million in February 2018.
During 2015 the Ukrainian Government: 
• implemented gas sales restrictions for the three month period to 28 February 2015 
resulting in the Group’s Ukrainian gas sales reducing to approximately 50% of 
production capacity 
• increased Ukrainian gas production tax from 28% to 55%.
• implemented currency control restrictions such that dividends could not be repatriated 
from our Ukrainian subsidiary (see Note 37 to the Group financial statements). 
As a result the Board suspended all capital investment in Ukraine during 2015.
Suspending investment in appraisal and development activities in Ukraine and shutting-in 
gas production in 2015 has had a significant adverse impact on the Group’s current and 
future oil and gas production, sales, profits, cash flow, liquidity and working capital 
balances, and has resulted in the delay and cancellation of capital projects. 
Future capital investments in exploration, appraisal and development activities then 
become more difficult to plan and finance as they are driven by the results of the Group’s 
current capital projects.
Impact: The risks relating to currency restrictions imposed by the Ukrainian Government 
are material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to meet its 
financial obligations as they fall due and continue as a going concern (see Note 2 to the 
financial statements). 
In addition, deviations in the timing and quantum of exploration and development 
expenditures can expose the Group to funding challenges.

The Board manages liquidity risk by attempting to maintain an adequate level of liquidity in 
the form of readily available cash or committed credit facilities at all times. 
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity on the basis of expected 
cash flow to ensure that any remedial action can be taken with as much lead time as 
possible.
In 2015 the Board made immediate strategic changes to streamline the organisation. Staff 
and cost reductions were made in all key operational and administrative areas. Through 
these reductions, the Group maintains a competitive cost base which enables it to continue 
in operation whilst generating operating cash flow during periods of low commodity prices.
In 2016, the Directors have continued to implement further operational and cash 
management measures across the Group to improve future cash flows and are assessing 
other restructuring and/or refinancing options in order to meet future Bond payments. 
Liquidity risk has reduced in 2016 following a reduction of gas production tax rates from 
55% to 29% from 1 January 2016 however the currency controls remain in place.
In 2015 JKX applied for and received an award from the Permanent Court of Arbitraion 
Tribunal ordering Ukraine to convert and repatriate PPC dividends to JKX which the NBU 
declined. The Group therefore purchased Hryvnia-based corporate bonds and immediately 
sold them to an international counterparty for US Dollars which increased the Group’s US 
Dollar balances in order to make payments due under the Convertible Bonds and other 
corporate overheads.
The Group finances current exploration and development activities with existing cash 
balances and operating cash flow generated from the production and sale of gas, oil, 
condensate and LPG. The Company’s options for additional debt financing are limited by 
our Ukrainian focus and our current shareholder base.
The timing and nature of almost all of the Group’s exploration and development activities 
are discretionary and therefore the Group prioritises these activities according to the 
available finance.
The Board is currently evaluating all the potential development projects in Ukraine and 
making decisions with full knowledge of the liquidity risks facing the Company.

Strategic risks
Over exposure to a single market 
Description: Our portfolio extends to 17 licences or licence interests in four different 
countries and the Group’s focus continues to be our projects in Russia and Ukraine.
We own 100% of all our oil and gas assets in Ukraine and Russia.
Our strategy is focused on the development of these two wholly-owned production bases 
and exploration portfolios.
The Group’s success in monetising its Ukrainian and Russian assets underpins the Group’s 
long term value.
Impact: All of the risks and rewards associated with the commercialisation of our 
Ukrainian and Russian licences are attributable to the Group alone and therefore the 
Group is vulnerable to the impact of any changes in the Russian and Ukrainian operating 
and economic environments.

The Board The Board produces an annual business plan supported by a rigorous budgeting 
procedure which is reviewed monthly against current information.
Periodically the Board updates the Group’s 3-Year Plan to ensure that the plan remains 
relevant and material risks, including asset concentration, and sensitivities have been 
considered.
Commercial production from our Russian gas plant has diversified our producing assets 
which spread the geographical risk away from the previously very high concentration 
which was solely in Ukraine. 
The Board continues to proactively seek and investigate value-enhancing production and 
exploration acquisitions and farm-outs/ins through our business development managers 
across central and eastern Europe.
A key priority of the Board is to implement regular, open and transparent communications 
with all stakeholders to ensure there is a clear understanding of the Group strategy, its 
risks and the potential rewards.

Operational risks
Reservoir performance 
Description: The hydrocarbon reservoirs that we operate in Ukraine and Russia generate 
the cash flow that underpins the Group’s growth. These reservoirs may not perform as 
expected, exposing the Group to lower profits and less cash to fund planned development. 
Production from our mature fields at the Novo-Nikolaevskoye Complex in Ukraine require 
a high level of maintenance and intervention to maintain production at recent levels.
In Russia, acidization of wells and other well maintenance procedures to increase 
stabilised production continued through the year however well integrity issues arose 
requiring two out of the five producing wells to be shut-in. One of the wells, well-05, 
remains shut-in.
Impact: Accurate reservoir performance forecasts from fields in Ukraine and Russia is 
critical in achieving the desired economic returns. These performance forecasts are also 
used to determine the availability and allocation of funds for investment into the 
exploration for, or development of, other oil and gas reserves and resources.

Chief 
Executive 
Officer
There is daily monitoring and reporting of the well performance at all our fields in Ukraine 
and Russia. Production data is analysed by our in-house technical expertise. This supports 
the well intervention planning and further field development.
Using specialist engineers, the tubing replacement at well-27 in Russia to resolve well 
integrity problems was completed in Q4 2015 to restore plateau production to levels 
previously achieved. 
Our subsurface specialists and industry-recognised personnel are part of the daily 
monitoring and reservoir management process of our fields in Ukraine and Russia. Our 
London-based in-house team of drilling, engineering and subsurface experts continue to 
be closely involved in the remediation work in Russia, well prioritisation on mature fields 
in Ukraine and our other field development plans. Our team is supported by skilled and 
experienced local technical teams, in addition to external consultants, when necessary; 
this interaction is key to mitigating our reservoir performance risk.

Environmental, asset integrity or safety incidents
Description: We are exposed to a wide range of significant health, safety, security and 
environmental risks influenced by the geographic range, operational diversity and 
technical complexity of our oil and gas exploration and production activities.
Impact: Technical failure, non-compliance with existing standards and procedures, 
accidents, natural disasters and other adverse conditions where we operate, which could 
lead to injury, loss of life, damage to the environment, loss of containment of hydrocarbons 
and other hazardous material, as well as the risk of fires and explosions. Failure to 
manage these risks effectively could result in loss of certain facilities, with the associated 
loss of production, or costs associated with mitigation, recovery, compensation and fines.
Poor performance in mitigating these risks could also result in damaging publicity for the 
Group.

the Group HSECQ manager. The Board participate in an annual review of the Group’s 
HSECQ performance and the planning of continuous improvement initiatives and 
objectives for the coming year.
The HSE Plan for 2016 has placed direct responsibility on line supervision to ensure that 
standards and procedures are adequate and being enforced.
Appropriate insurances are maintained to manage the Group’s financial exposure to any 
unexpected adverse events arising out of the normal operations.

Bribery and corruption
Description: The UK Bribery Act places onerous requirements on UK companies to 
demonstrate the effectiveness of their anti-bribery measures.
Impact: Failing to implement adequate systems to prevent bribery and corruption could 
result in prosecution of the Company and its officers.

The Board We prohibit bribery and corruption in any form by all employees and by those working for 
and/or connected with the business.
Our Group Compliance Manager is responsible for anti-bribery and corruption matters 
and, with the support of the Board, implements an Annual Compliance Plan.
The compliance programme includes components which recognise the requirements of 
the UK Bribery Act 2010 and which focus on training, monitoring, risk management and 
due diligence.
We annually refresh our Global Code of Conduct and Statement of Ethics which is compliant 
with the UK Bribery Act and its guidance and communicate this throughout the Group. 
Employees are expected to report actual, attempted or suspected bribery to their line 
managers or through our independently managed confidential reporting process, which is 
available to all employees as well as third parties. 
We will continue to regularly review the operation and impact of the Group’s policies and 
procedures to ensure a consistent application of the Global Code of Conduct in all business 
activities and throughout the supply chain processes.

Inadequate	 liquidity	 levels
The Company has an obligation of $30.1 million (consisting 
of $26 million principal, $1 million interest and a redemption 
premium of $3.1 million) which may become payable pursuant 
to its $40 million Convertible Bond in February 2017, if 
Bondholders exercise their put option at that time, or  
$31.1 million in February 2018 if the Bond expires at its 
full term (see Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial 
statements). 
The Company’s Ukrainian subsidiary, Poltava Petroleum 
Company (‘PPC’) has three contingent liabilities arising from 
separate court proceedings over the amount of production taxes 
(‘Rental Fees’) paid in Ukraine for certain periods since 2007, 
which in total amount to approximately $41 million (including 
interest and penalties, see Note 27 to the consolidated financial 
statements). The Board believes that these claims are without 
merit under Ukrainian law and will continue to contest them 
vigorously. 
In addition, the Company continues to pursue a final award 
under its arbitration claim against Ukraine, which is to be 
heard in July 2016, for the overpayment of US$180 million of 
Rental Fees plus damages to the business (see Note 27 to the 
consolidated financial statements).
Factors exist which are outside the control of management 
which can have a significant impact on the business:
Oil	 and	 gas	 prices	
The international oil and gas prices declined significantly 
through 2015 and remain low.
Ukrainian	 subsoil	 permits	
Following action initiated in late 2015, in January 2016, the 
State Geology and Mineral Resources Survey of Ukraine 
suspended four subsoil use permits owned by PPC, initially 
with effect from 1 February 2016, but then with an extension 
period until 1 March 2016. The authority gave a list of actions 
that were required in order to avoid suspension (including 
a change to the minimum production requirements under 
the licences) and would normally have given the operator 
sufficient time to remedy the failings. Instead PPC were given 
only one month to do so. Through further discussion with the 
relevant authority, PPC has been given more time to comply 
and hearings regarding the status of the licenses are planned 
for March 2016, at which the Board and PPC is confident of a 
positive outcome.
Confirmation of longer-term viability
The Board has considered these risks and the other principal 
risks faced by the business detailed on pages 44 to 53 of 
the Annual Report. The Directors are implementing further 
operational and cash management measures, and may be 
required to implement other restructuring and/or refinancing 
options, to settle amounts that may become payable in 
February 2017 or will become payable in February 2018 
pursuant to the $40m Convertible Bond. Assuming that 
these payments can be made, based on the Group’s cash 
flow forecasts, the Directors believe that the combination of 
its current cash balances, expected future production and 
resulting net cash flows from operations provide a reasonable 
expectation that the Company will continue to be viable and 
meet its liabilities over the assessment period.

JKX Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2015
Principal risks and how we manage them
Long term viability statement 
At the date of this report, a number of material uncertainties 
have been identied that may cast significant doubt about the 
Group’s and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
The combination of circumstances giving rise to these 
material uncertainties is discussed in Note 2 to the financial 
statements.
Notwithstanding these material uncertainties, the Directors 
have assessed the viability of the Group over a three-year 
period to 31 December 2018, taking account of the Group’s 
current position and the potential impact of the principal risks 
documented above.
A three-year period was selected as it is the period used for 
the Group’s strategic review.
Assessment of the Group’s prospects
A new Board was appointed on 28 January 2016 and has 
completed an initial review of the Group’s assets. The new 
Board believes that the Group’s assets and staff provide a 
good platform to consolidate and improve on its existing oil 
and gas opportunities in central and eastern Europe and will 
continue to focus in this region, in particular in Ukraine (see 
pages 12 and 13).
The Group has been operating in Ukraine for over 20 years 
and most of the Group’s profits and cash flows continue to 
be generated from its assets there. However there remain 
significant risks associated with operating in Ukraine and the 
near term economic outlook for the country remains uncertain 
(see “Geopolitical risk – Ukraine” above), which could 
adversely impact cash flows, profits and liquidity of the Group.
Assessment of viability
The new Board, who were appointed 7 weeks ago, continue to 
review its future strategy in light of their ongoing review of the 
Group’s operations. 
The Board closely monitors and manages its liquidity risk using 
cash flow forecasts which are regularly produced and applies 
sensitivities for different scenarios including, but not limited 
to, changes in oil and gas prices, changes to production and 
other tax rates in relation to the Group’s producing assets, 
increased operating and capital expenditure, changes in 
Rouble and Hryvnia exchange rates, and delays to additional 
future revenue. These sensitivities are applied both individually 
and in unison.
Downside sensitivities were modelled to test the impact of using 
a range of external forward oil and gas price curves including a 
period of low oil and gas prices through to the end of 2016. The 
testing incorporated the use of mitigating actions available to the 
business such as a reduction in capital expenditure and further 
reducing operating costs safely and responsibly.
Capital and operating costs were based on approved budgets 
and latest forecasts in the case of 2016 and current development 
plans in the case of 2017 through to December 2018. In addition, 
the Directors made enquiries into and considered the Ukrainian 
and Russian business environments and future expectations 
regarding country and currency risks that the Group may 
encounter, as disclosed in the risks above.
Principal risks facing the Group

replaced. HSECQ Managers are experienced, fully trained 
and familiar with the local culture, regulations and working 
practices.
In Ukraine, Russia, Slovakia and Hungary JKX has fully 
trained HSECQ teams which deliver a high standard of HSECQ 
management and reporting. Our teams report to the General 
Director of the local operating company and the Group HSECQ 
manager.
Our CSR objectives 
• Strategy: Integrating long-term economic, environmental 
and social aspects into JKX business strategies while 
maintaining technical excellence.

Corporate and social responsibility (‘CSR’) review
Our impact
The increasing concern of environmental and social impacts 
means that to achieve long term success, JKX measures its 
‘triple bottom line’ – profit, people and planet. CSR positively 
impacts these three elements and is therefore embedded 
within JKX’s business strategy. 
Our CSR process is board led
CSR is led by Tom Reed, the Chief Executive Officer. JKX’s 
Health, Safety, Environment, Community and Quality (‘HSECQ’) 
manager reports directly to the CEO and has responsibility 
for creating a framework and maintaining the HSECQ 
Management System for the management of the Group’s non-
financial impacts. 
The Board is provided with quarterly updates relating to the 
major CSR issues. 
A management review of all HSECQ systems is carried 
out every year. A full Board level review of progress was 
completed in December 2015 and plans for 2016 were agreed. 
The new Board of Directors will ensure these plans are 
carried out.
Our understanding
JKX is committed to understanding, monitoring and managing 
our social, environmental and economic impact to enable us to 
contribute to society. JKX’s safety culture is led from the top; 
it is embraced and practised by the Chief Executive Officer and 
throughout the organisation.
Our vision
JKX is committed to achieve zero harm to employees, 
environment, contractors, communities and property.
The Company has implemented the requirements of ISO 26000 
and have joined the Global Reporting Initiative on Sustainability 
Reporting, the international guidance on social responsibility. 
Our approach
JKX’s approach is to act responsibly and with integrity, 
conducting its global business as a responsible employer, 
corporate citizen and neighbour. JKX is committed to building 
a responsible, sustainable business by:
• Reducing the impact of unemployment 
• Addressing the skills shortage necessary for local business 
to compete in the future 
• Engaging in Continuous Professional Development 
• Addressing inequality in recruitment, pay and promotion
• Creating healthier, happier and more productive employees 
• Supporting charities and communities 
• Helping local people into work 
• Improving the Company’s impact on the environment 
• Acknowledging the International Labour Organisation 
Health & Safety principles
• Working better with local suppliers and other stakeholders 
• Developing a globally responsible mind-set throughout the

JKX drilling and workover employees and contractors have 
the necessary training and certification in well safety and well 
control, and all personnel have the authority to stop any job 
that they deem unsafe. 
Supervisors are selected for their expertise as well as for 
their familiarity with the regions where JKX operates. They

Our approach
JKX’s Health, Safety, Environment, Community and Quality 
(‘HSECQ’) philosophies are embodied in its Policy Statements, 
which are endorsed by the Board and made known to all 
employees and business partners. The statements represent 
the Company’s commitment to a safe and healthy, incident 
free, working environment and its responsibility to prevent 
damage to the environment, our employees and neighbours. 
JKX will never knowingly compromise its health, safety, 
environmental or quality standards to meet operational 
objectives. 
Health and safety statistics 
In 2015, JKX implemented and communicated its improved 
HSECQ policy at all operations worldwide. 
This policy represents a clear statement of core principles and 
the approach to health and safety management at all Group 
companies.
The priority is to ensure that all staff and contractors work 
in a safe environment, where effective systems of work are 
maintained and appropriate procedures and processes are 
followed.
Continuous improvement in health and safety  
1
Annual HSECQ targets are set for all levels within the 
organisation. During 2015 JKX achieved an AIFR of 0.15 per 
200,000 hours worked with 165days away from work recorded. 
This equates to an AIFR of 0.75 per million hours worked.
The industry benchmark set by the IOGP was an AIFR of  
1.6 per million hours worked. The reporting of incidents during 
2015 continued, demonstrating that all statistics are reported 
whether good or bad.
With more than 750 personnel during 2015 JKX reported  
56 incidents.
Our safety statistics for 2015   
2
Measurement and analysis of JKX’s safety statistics is carried 
out on a monthly basis with the results communicated to 
senior management of all group companies and the Board. 
There were no recorded lost time injuries (2014: 6). This year 
JKX sadly suffered a fatality during mud mixing operations.  
A Root Cause Analysis was carried out for this incident with 
the lessons learned distributed across the Group to ensure no 
such incident occurs again. 
Employees are included in structured training and behavioural 
programs which promote open discussion and employee 
surveys are conducted annually. JKX has a clear Safety 
Management System, which provides a comprehensive and 
systematic vision of its objectives. 
Each site has its own HSECQ Management System identifying 
all major hazards and risks to personnel specific to the unique 
nature of the country of operation. 
In occupational health, the drug and alcohol policy continues 
to be successful throughout the Group with no instances 
of breaches noted. The policy applies to all JKX staff and 
contractors and forbids the possession and/or use of defined 
prohibited substances which includes drugs and alcohol.  
The policy also clarifies testing and inspection procedures.
Drilling risks 
JKX recognises that the safety and efficiency of drilling and 
workover operations depends primarily on the performance 
of its employees and contractors. Local staff with decades 
of local experience are used on our drilling rigs who are

The JKX Environmental Management System is a 
comprehensive, systematic, planned and documented 
management process. It includes the organisational structure, 
planning and resources for developing, implementing and 
maintaining policy for environmental protection. JKX strives to 
reduce impact on the environment, conserve energy, recycle 
resources and eliminate environmental pollution, while 
placing a high priority on preserving the environment.
Our approach
JKX is proud to have maintained ISO 14001 Environmental 
Management accreditation in 2015. ISO 14001 is the 
principal management system standard which specifies the 
requirements for the formulation and maintenance of an 
Environmental Management System. 
Environmental management system 
Our impact
JKX complies with all relevant environmental requirements, 
including environmental laws and regulations and industry 
guidelines.
JKX enhances environmental awareness among employees 
by providing environmental training and promoting a thorough 
understanding of its environmental policy.
In 2015, JKX continued to make good progress and are pleased 
to continue the ongoing work with The Carbon Disclosure 
Project. JKX’s Environmental Report for 2015, prepared in 
conjunction with TruCost, has identified emission reduction 
measures for the 2016 campaign.
Environmental objectives Achievements Targets 2016
Reducing emissions.
In managing emissions 
throughout the exploration, and 
production process, JKX plan to 
improve monitoring and reduce 
emissions. In particular, 
“reduced emissions 
completions” (‘REC’) or “green 
completions” will be assessed at 
all stages
Continuously monitored:
• on-site fuel consumption measured more 
efficiently 
• Green House Gas (‘GHG’) emission levels 
recorded and analysed through latest 
software and reporting.
• purchased electricity records improved 
• purchased heating/cooling records improved 
• release/leakage of other chemicals causing 
greenhouse gas emissions recorded, 
reported and analysed 
• fugitive emissions assessed and recorded 
• fuel used for vehicles reduction by journey 
management 
• official travel of staff reduced
Continuous monitoring
Improved monitoring will be carried out before, 
during and after operations to detect contaminants 
in groundwater and potential leakages of into the 
atmosphere. Revised and updated emission 
reduction strategies for 2016 are likely to include: 
• current carbon footprint reduction methods 
identify opportunities for a reduction in CO 2 
emissions 
• identification of technical requirements for more 
efficient monitoring and recording 
• identification of administrative requirements 
• estimated emission reduction through any 
proposed interventions 
• estimated cost for the interventions 
• estimated savings from the intervention  
(e.g. through reduced energy use, reduced travel 
costs, and reduced offset costs) 
• responsibility for implementation 
• implementation schedule. 
• quantitative objectives and targets

Consistent Hazard Assessment Processes
In both Russia and Ukraine, JKX continued to carry out risk 
management studies using its proven Hazard and Operability 
(‘HAZOP’), Hazard Identification (‘HAZID’) and As Low as 
Reasonably Practical (‘ALARP’) methodologies.
JKX has developed an integrated assessment process for 
the safety assurance of development proposals which are 
potentially hazardous. These assessments combined with the 
essential features of the JKX safety management programme 
complete the safety circle.
Health and safety training 
Each location has a health and safety training budget which 
is established after the Training Needs Analysis has been 
completed, which includes training that is required under local 
law. Additional training is provided according to operational 
requirements.

Our	 achievements
During 2015 some advances were made in JKX’s Supply Chain 
Initiative, which will continue in 2016 with a more focused 
approach to procurement and supply. 
As required for JKX’s ISO 9001 certification, operating 
procedures, prequalification processes and Stakeholder 
Management Plans ensure that major suppliers, products and 
services are evaluated for their environmental compliance and 
commitment. 
Outlook
Plans to improve these procedures during 2016 include 
enhancing the JKX Code of Conduct to include more specific 
policies, procedures and guidelines for purchasing and 
contracting activities undertaken by Group companies.
The results of the employee survey show that there are 
possible improvements and these will be the focus in 2016.

Our other environmental initiatives
Global	 Reporting	 Initiative	 (‘GRI’)
The GRI Reporting Framework is intended to provide 
a generally accepted framework for reporting on an 
organisation’s economic, environmental, and social 
performance. The Framework consists of the Sustainability 
Reporting Guidelines, the Indicator Protocols, Technical 
Protocols, and the Sector Supplements. 
During the year JKX reported according to the GRI’s 
Sustainability Reporting Guidelines and will continue to report 
in 2016.
Supply chain management
At the heart of JKX’s sustainable supply chain is a policy of 
localising supply by fabricating, manufacturing and sourcing 
as much as possible as close to the point of use by using 
indigenous companies.

Environmental performance in 2015
In 2015, JKX was pleased to continue the ongoing work with 
The Carbon Disclosure Project and improved its reporting 
under the project with a score of 83% (2014: 71%).
Environmental Incident Frequency Rate (‘EIFR’)   
1
The EIFR Target for 2015 was not to exceed 0.70 Environmental 
incidents per 200,000 hours worked; 0.30 was achieved.
Greenhouse Gas (‘GHG’) emissions reporting 
All emissions sources owned, operated or controlled by the 
Group are included in our reporting. 
Our	 approach
JKX’s terminals at operational sites in Ukraine, Hungary and 
Russia are self-sufficient and can maintain operations without 
the need for grid electricity therefore improving the security of 
supply.
The Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology was used for 
compiling the GHG data.
GHG	 emissions	 by	 scope
The GHG Protocol categorises direct and indirect GHG 
emissions as follows:
• Scope 1: all direct GHG emissions.
• Scope 2: indirect GHG emissions from consumption of 
purchased electricity, heat or steam.
Mandatory	 GHG	 reporting	  
2
In accordance with GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance that was 
released in January 2015, disclosures below now state two 
Scope 2 emission totals – location-based and market-based. 
Market-based emission factors are not available for either of 
JKX’s Russia and Ukraine locations, only residual emission 
factors are used for offices in U.K., and location-based 
emission factors are used for locations in Russia and Ukraine. 
Calculations will be updated when residual factors at all JKX 
locations are available for public use. 
The table opposite discloses JKX’s Scope 1 and 2 GHG 
emissions and an emissions intensity ratio of tonnes CO

Corporate and social responsibility (‘CSR’) review
Our approach
By creating employment JKX makes a contribution to  
reducing poverty and promoting economic and social 
development. The Group provides career development, 
international opportunities, a non-discriminatory workplace 
and competitive remuneration within a decentralised 
culture. The decentralised model is underpinned by a robust 
governance framework and empowers local management to 
make key business decisions locally. 
Staff training and skills development is an essential 
component of our employment proposition and assists people 
to secure decent and productive jobs. 
Our achievements
JKX employs more than 750 staff in five different countries 
which puts people as a top priority. 
At year-end, Yuzhgazenergie LLC, the Russian subsidiary, 
employed 249 staff (2014: 257) at our Koshekhablskoye 
production facilities and the Maikop administrative office. The 
Ukrainian subsidiary, Poltava Petroleum Company, employed 
493 personnel (2014: 622) at the production site and at the 
Poltava office. 
The London office has 22 employees (2014: 25). 
Employment policies
The Company’s employment policies aim to attract the best 
people in the belief that a diverse and inclusive culture is a 
key factor in being a successful business. The Group remains 
committed to equality of opportunity in all of its employment 
practices. It selects employees for appointment, career 
development and promotion based solely on the skills and 
attributes which are relevant to the job and which are in 
accordance with the laws of the country concerned. 
Diversity and equality
Access to work opportunities is based on merit, equality, 
fairness and need, and no one is treated less favourably on 
the basis of their sex, racial or ethnic origin, colour, religion, 
disability, marital status, sexuality or age. 
This approach ensures that diversity and equality is reflected 
in all JKX’s policies, practices and procedures, where 
practicable.
JKX will not tolerate any form of discrimination – either direct 
or indirect. Acts of discrimination, prejudice, harassment and 
victimisation which occur within the workplace or within local 
communities is not tolerated. 
Employee engagement
JKX aims to communicate openly with all its employees. 
Operating across a number of different countries, cultures 
and environments, JKX operates a decentralised management 
structure, led by native General Directors and senior 
management, with employment policies designed for the 
needs of individual locations. 
Each Group company complies with certain key principles, 
including:
• providing safe and healthy working conditions for all 
employees
• creating an open, challenging, rewarding and participative 
environment which, through development and training, 
aims to maximise the talent, skills and abilities of all 
employees
• communicating to provide the fullest possible 
understanding of our goals, directions and performance of 
the business
• providing compensation and benefits which reflect good 
current local practices and which reward collective and 
individual abilities and personal performance
• providing a working environment, development 
opportunities and incentives to promote team effort and 
commitment to the performance of the Group
• referencing the International Labour Organisation to verify 
standards and best practice.
Employee feedback 
A health and safety employee satisfaction survey was carried 
out again in 2015 to obtain feedback from staff on JKX’s health 
and safety culture and success in applying group health and 
safety policy. The survey was in the form of a questionnaire 
which was translated and completed on an anonymous basis 
by a range of employees from different locations across the 
Group. 
The results of the employee survey show that there are 
perceived improvements in management commitment and 
consultation, compared with 2014. These areas will continue to 
be the focus in 2016.

Our performance
In 2015 JKX continued to make progress by reviewing the 
approach to stakeholder communications in Ukraine, Hungary, 
Slovakia and Russia. 
A mapping of stakeholders was carried out in 2015 using an 
Influence-Interest-Matrix to identify JKX’s key stakeholders. 
This is an area of key importance to JKX and plans are in 
place to further develop the skills of staff and employees to 
continually improve the stakeholder management capabilities.
Outlook
Internal and external stakeholder surveys were conducted 
in 2015 to understand if JKX is meeting stakeholder and 
customer expectations. The results of the surveys were 
discussed with senior management and reviewed as part of 
the JKX Annual Management Review.
ISO 9001 accreditation
JKX have the full Integrated Management System comprising 
ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001 and ISO 9001. PPC Construction and 
Engineering achieved accreditation to ISO 9001 on 27 January 
2015 after meeting the requirements of the standard as 
assessed by Bureau Veritas. YGE commenced their ISO 9001 
accreditation process in 2015.
Achieving ISO 9001 accreditation ensures that the quality 
management systems that JKX has adopted work to improve 
the efficiency of business and are not just a set of procedures.
JKX use an external assessor and an internal resource to 
carry out regular audits of the management system. The 
support of the Board and senior management has been the 
driver of this management system, so that all areas of the 
organisation are aware of the importance and benefits of the 
ISO accreditation process.
Outlook 
A new version of ISO 9001 is due in 2016, which will be a 
complete revision of the standard. JKX is planning to hold 
practical workshops to support the organisation to get 
acquainted with and implement the new standard. 
Investor engagement 
JKX seeks to enhance shareholder value through responsible 
and effective communication with shareholders. 
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for maintaining 
ongoing relations with the investor and shareholder 
community, acting as the primary point of contact for 
members of this community.
In 2015 the Board carried out various meetings with potential 
and existing investors and with the wider investment 
community through analyst presentations and other events.
JKX communicates the latest relevant company information and 
future investor events through its website at www.jkx.co.uk.
Corporate and social responsibility (‘CSR’) review
Our approach
JKX is committed to engaging with the community to share the 
benefits of its success at its operating plants. 
Our community engagement
The Company conducts various activities to forge good 
relations with local communities through participation in 
forums established by local authorities and residents’ 
associations, and by creating such forums. 
Cleaning up areas around plants and neighbouring areas 
is an activity that group companies are taking part in. The 
number of employees who participate in clean-up activities is 
increasing year by year. 
JKX contributes to improving local education by conducting 
plant tours, providing employment and work experience, and 
raises environmental awareness by actively participating in 
environmental events in regions where it operates. 
Assistance in our local communities
In practical terms, JKX’s community support frequently 
involves using the Company’s plant and machinery – as well as 
manpower – to provide much-needed assistance. 
Working with the local authorities, JKX deployed available 
vehicles including fire engines, cranes, trucks, excavators, 
road clearing equipment, personnel and safety equipment to 
assist local communities in a number of small isolated tasks 
which benefit the local community.
For example, in Sokolova Balka village, a village local to JKX’s 
operations in Poltava, Ukraine, PPC provided:
• equipment to level an area for installation of fencing and the 
sand and crushed rock needed for the installation
• roader services for village tasks 
• equipment to pump out sewage in a family house of 16. 
In Novi Sanzhary, another local village, PPC provided a crane 
for assistance with local operations.
Diversity and equality 
Access to work opportunities is based on merit, equality, 
fairness and need, and no one is treated less favourably on 
the basis of their sex, racial or ethnic origin, colour, religion, 
disability, marital status, sexuality or age. 
JKX’s approach is to ensure that diversity and equality is 
reflected in all its policies, practices and procedures, where 
practicable.
JKX does not tolerate any form of discrimination – either direct 
or indirect. 
Charitable donations and volunteering
Each operation has a limited budget for good causes and 
charitable donations locally. 
Locally, donations from the Group during 2015 amounted to: 
• Ukraine  UAH2,757,119 ($122,351) (2014: UAH4,376,868  
($245,457))
• Russia  RR7,590,519 ($117,891) (2014: RR4,379,785 
($105,809))
Subject to management approval, staff may be given additional 
time off in order to join in certain charity-related activities. 
Local charitable projects
The financial aid is allocated to qualifying organisations using 
a formal applications process. Applications for funding are 
made to our local companies specifying how funds will be 
used. A full list of charitable donations is available.
A sample of charity and community projects that are local to 
JKX operations and that JKX has supported during the year 
were:
Ukraine
• Purchase of coal-fired boilers and maintenance of the 
boiler houses for educational facilities in Novi Sanzhary 
village
• Reconstruction of museum premises and a school stadium 
in Novi Sanzhary village
• Construction materials and services for the reconstruction 
of a medical treatment room at the Poltava military hospital
• Purchase of windows for a kindergarten and school 
renovation works in Lelyukhivka village 
Russia
• Construction of a football field in Druzhba
• Roof repair works at a nursery school in Druzhba
• Repair works at a secondary school in Druzhba
• Repair works at a secondary school in Egerukhay village
• Svyato-Ilyinskiy Church Reconstruction in Dondukovskaya 
Our stakeholder engagement
JKX works closely with outside interest groups and maintains 
an open-door policy to better understand local issues so that 
problems are avoided. 
Business proposals are consulted on before making final 
decisions. These consultations with stakeholders feed into the 
business planning process to ensure that stakeholders’ needs 
are prioritised in JKX’s business plan.
A key priority for the new Board appointed on 28 January 
2016 is to maintain transparent working relationships with all 
key stakeholders in our assets in Ukraine and Russia, and to 
improve the method of regular local dialogue and on-going 
communications.

Board composition
Paul Ostling (67) 
Non Executive Chairman
Appointed–28 January 2016

major entities listed on the New York and London Stock 
Exchanges and holding senior management positions 
including Global Executive partner from 1995 to 2003 and 
Global Chief Operating Officer from 2003 to 2007. In 
addition, for 15 years, he was one of several partners 
leading the development and coordination of the firm’s 
operations throughout Russia, Ukraine, the CIS and Eastern 
Europe. From 2007 to 2012, Paul served as chairman of the 
audit committee of Mobile TeleSystems OJSC (NYSE). Other

proficient Russian speaker.
Dear shareholder
As I stated in my Chairman’s statement on page 6, on 28 January 
2016, four Board members resigned and at a General Meeting of 
the Company on the same day, shareholders voted to remove the 
remaining five Board members. 
At the same meeting, shareholders approved the appointment of five 
new Directors of JKX, whose biographies are provided here.
Due to the highly unusual circumstances of the entire Board being 
replaced on the same day, which included all the independent  
Non Executive Directors, since 28 January 2016 the composition of 
the Board has not complied with UK Corporate Governance Code 
(‘the Code’) in respect of the number of independent Non Executive 
Directors. Without independent Non Executive Directors, the 
Company has not been able to form the various committees (Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination), which are compliant with the Code.
We are currently in the final phase of appointing two new independent 
Non Executive Directors of JKX and, in the interim period, the Board 
has put some measures in place for the Board committees and its 
remuneration until the two new independent Board members are 
appointed. These measures are described further on pages 79 and 84.
For the purposes of approving the Annual Report for 2015, an interim 
Audit Committee consisting of myself, as Chairman, and Russell 
Hoare, as Chief Financial Officer, was formed, but will be replaced with 
an independent committee, in compliance with the Code, as soon as the 
new independent Board members are appointed.
One of the new Board’s key priorities is to improve the standards of 
corporate governance, transparency and stakeholder engagement 
across the Group, in the best interests of all shareholders and 
stakeholders.
Since the 28 January, the Group has been led by an experienced 
Board of directors consisting of a Non Executive Chairman, the Chief 
Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and two Non Executive 
Directors representing the interests of Proxima, JKX’s second largest 
shareholder with a holding of almost 20%. 
I look forward to updating you shortly on the new Board appointments, 
compliance with the Code and the Board’s improvements to 
governance and related matters.

Monthly	 Board	 reporting	
The Group provides the Board with consolidated monthly 
management reports 10 working days after the month end, 
except for the financial year-end when the reporting is delayed 
to accommodate the annual audit process. The reports outline 
all material operational, financial, commercial and strategic 
developments. 
The monthly financial reports consolidate all financial 
information from all parts of the Group and include actual 
performance against budget and forecast for oil and gas 
production, sales and costs. 
These reports provide the Board with the latest information on 
receivables, cash, cash flow forecast and the implications of 
key sensitivities including changes in production, commodity 
prices, production taxes and exchange rates. These monthly 
reports ensure that members remain properly briefed on the 
performance and financial position of the Group. 
Board	 meeting	 documents
Prior to each set of meetings the Executive Directors ensure 
that all the relevant papers and other information is delivered 
at least five days in advance of the meeting date so that all 
Directors have the necessary time to review in detail the latest 
information. 
Support	 for	 Directors
The Board has adopted a policy whereby Directors may, in the 
furtherance of their duties, seek independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense. During 2015, no Director 
sought independent legal advice pursuant to the policy.
Prior to the General Meeting on 28 January 2016 at which 
a new Board was appointed, the Board in place at that time 
incurred legal fees of $66,530 in respect of issues related to 
their severance payments and settlement agreements.
Each Director has the benefit of a deed of indemnity from the 
Company and its subsidiaries in respect of claims made and 
liabilities incurred, in either case arising out of the bona fide 
discharge by the director of his or her duties. The Company 
has also arranged appropriate insurance cover in respect 
of legal action against Directors of the Company and its 
subsidiaries.
Committees	 of	 the	 Board	 in	 2015	
During 2015 and up until the General Meeting on 28 January 
2016, the Board had three committees to assist the Board 
by focusing on specialist areas, which were ultimately 
accountable to it. These comprised:
• the Audit Committee;
• the Nominations Committee; and
• the Remuneration Committee.
The Board committees met independently and provided 
feedback to the main Board through their chairmen. 
The Board provides leadership to the Group. Key matters reserved 
for the consideration and the approval of the Board are: 
• setting and monitoring Group strategy;
• review of Group business plans, trading performance and costs;
• review and approval of the annual operating and capital 
expenditure budgets;
• approval of capital investment projects across the Group;
• examination of acquisition opportunities, divestment 
possibilities and significant financial and operational issues;
• remuneration policy (through the Remuneration Committee);
• appointments to the Board (through the Nominations 
Committee) and senior management, Committee membership 
and remuneration for Directors and senior management;
• review and approval of the Company’s financial statements 
(through the Audit Committee);
• setting any interim dividend and recommendation of the final 
dividend; and
• ensuring that the significant business risks are actively 
monitored and managed using robust control and risk 
management systems.
All other authorities are delegated by the Board, supported by 
appropriate controls, to the Chief Executive Officer on behalf of 
senior management.
Role of the Board

Corporate governance
Governance framework and principles  
1
 
The Company has a premium listing on the London Stock 
Exchange and is subject to the Listing Rules of the UK Listing 
Authority. The Board is committed to applying the principles of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’) and relevant 
institutional shareholder guidelines. This section explains in 
more detail how we have applied these provisions. 
JKX’s Group-wide policies and procedures provide a framework 
for governance and are underpinned by the Group’s Code of 
Conduct. Good governance is taken seriously throughout the 
JKX Group and the Board set the tone and take the lead to 
ensure that good practice flows throughout the Group. 
JKX Board replaced on 28 January 2016
The entire Board of JKX was replaced on 28 January 2016 
following a General Meeting of the Company. The resignation 
of all independent Non Executive Directors meant that, since 
that date, the composition of the Board has not complied with 
UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’) in respect of the 
number of independent Non Executive Directors. Without 
independent Non Executive Directors, the Company has not 
been able to form the various committees (Audit, Remuneration 
and Nomination) which are compliant with the Code. 
The Company is in the final phase of appointing two new 
independent Non Executive Directors, using an independent 
search firm, who will form the new Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination Committees, in accordance with the requirements 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Board effectiveness
Role	 of	 the	 Board  
2
The principal matters reserved for the Board are set out on 
page 73. Day-to-day operational decisions are managed by the 
Executive Directors.
How	 the	 Board	 functions
The Board has historically held six scheduled meetings each 
year, and arranges additional meetings if the need arises. 
During 2015, there was one unscheduled Board meeting 
(2014: two) and the Non Executive Directors met twice in 
private session, with an open agenda to discuss the current 
issues affecting the Group. The Board anticipates an increase 
in the number of scheduled meetings in 2016 as the newly 
appointed Board members build a new strategic direction for 
the Company.
In addition, the Board considers strategy in depth as well as 
reviewing the strategic objectives of the Company at each of its 
Board meetings.
The Chairman, in consultation with the Executive Directors, 
sets the agenda for Board meetings. All Directors receive 
comprehensive documentation prior to each meeting on the 
matters to be discussed.

The SID will be available for discussions with other Non 
Executive Directors who may have concerns which they believe 
have not been properly considered by the Board as a whole.  
If required, they will also act as an alternative point of contact 
for the Executive Directors in addition to the normal channels 
of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. 
A key responsibility of the SID is to ensure he is available 
to shareholders if they have concerns that have not been 
resolved by contact through the normal channels of Chairman, 
Chief Executive Officer or other Executive Directors, or where 
such contact is inappropriate.
2015	 Board	 evaluation	 process
A process of evaluating the performance of the Directors, 
the Board and its committees through one to one interviews 
conducted by the Chairman with all other Board members was 
planned for December 2015 but was cancelled following the 
requisition of the meeting to remove most of the JKX Board.  
A similar process will be implemented in December 2016.
External	 evaluation
As the Company is outside of the FTSE 350 there is no 
requirement for an externally-facilitated evaluation of the 
Board at least every three years. 
Following a change of the full Board on 28 January 2016 and 
the imminent appointment of two new independent  
Non Executive Directors, the Board will consider the relevance 
of an externally facilitated evaluation during 2017.
Development	 of	 the	 Board
All Directors are provided opportunities for further 
development and training updates. In addition to the regular 
updates on governance, legal and regulatory matters, the 
Board also receives detailed briefings from advisers and at 
their seminars on a variety of topics that are relevant to the 
Group and its strategy. The annual Board evaluation includes a 
review of governance where the Directors have an opportunity 
to assess their effectiveness and that of the Board as a whole.
Board activities
Attendance	 at	 meetings	 in	 2015		
4
In addition to six scheduled Board meetings, there was one 
unscheduled meeting convened at short notice (2014: two).
When a Director is unable to participate in a meeting either 
in person or remotely because of another engagement, they 
are provided with the briefing materials and the Chairman 
will solicit their views on key items of business ahead of time, 
in order for the views to be presented at the meeting and 
influence the debate. 
The number of meetings of the Board and its committees 
during 2015 and individual attendance by Director is shown 
below.
Senior management from across the Group, and advisers, 
attend some of the meetings for the discussion of specific 
items in greater depth. This is important to the Board as it 
further enhances the Board’s understanding of operations and 
the implementation of strategy. 
Board’s	 work	 during	 2015
The Board used a rolling agenda of strategy, finance, 
operations, commercial matters, corporate governance and 
compliance. All Directors have the authority to add any item to 
the Board agenda.

The roles and activities of each of these committees during 
2015 are noted on pages 76, 79 and 90.
Since the General Meeting on 28 January 2016, the Company 
established an interim Audit Committee comprising 
Paul Ostling and Russell Hoare which will carry out the 
requirements under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules 
7.1.3R, pending the establishment of a permanent Audit 
Committee.
Board	 composition,	 independence	 and	 commitment
Throughout 2015 and up until the General Meeting on  
28 January 2016, the Board of nine members comprised:
• a Non Executive Chairman,
• four Executive Directors and
• four Non Executive Directors.
There were no changes to the Board during 2015.
Since the removal/resignation of all of the Board on  
28 January 2016 (see above), the Board has comprised:
• a Non Executive Chairman, 
• two Executive Directors and 
• two Non Executive Directors representing the interests of 
Proxima, JKX’s second largest shareholder with a holding 
of almost 20%.
The Company is in the final phase of appointing two new 
independent Non Executive Directors. 
It is the Board’s view that the current Non Executive Directors 
have sufficient time to fulfil their commitments to the 
Company and no Executive Director holds a Non Executive 
Directorship, or Chairmanship, in a FTSE 100 company. 
Board	 skills,	 experience	 and	 responsibilities
The Directors have knowledge and experience of the oil and 
gas industry, including expertise in geology, engineering and 
financial matters, significant experience of working in central 
and eastern Europe, particularly Ukraine and Russia, and 
expertise in turn-around and restructuring situations within 
the region. The key biographical details, relevant experience 
and responsibilities of each Director are provided on pages 70 
and 71.
The Non Executive Directors that the Board is looking to 
appoint will bring the skills and expertise necessary to 
challenge effectively, independently and constructively the 
performance of the Executive Board and their strategy.
Board	 diversity
During 2015, the Board comprised eight men (89%) and one 
woman (11%). The Board currently comprises 5 men.
Gender is only one aspect of diversity, and there are many 
other attributes and experiences that can improve the Board’s 
ability to act effectively. Our policy is to search for the highest 
quality people with the most appropriate experience for the 
requirements of the business, be they men or women. 
The Board supports the longer term aspirations of Lord 
Davies’ report regarding gender diversity on appointment of 
directors to Boards and will maintain its practice of embracing 
diversity in all its forms, but has chosen not to set any 
measurable objectives. Details of our current gender diversity 
statistics are set out on page 26.
Senior	 Independent	 Director
During 2015, Dipesh Shah was the Senior Independent 
Director (‘SID’). 
Following the replacement of the entire Board on 28 January 
2016, which included the SID, the Board has been without a 
SID since then. A SID will be selected from one of the two new 
independent Non Executive Directors, when appointed.

The Executive Directors in office during 2015 undertook a 
review of the independence of each of the Non Executive 
Directors and Chairman. The review addressed the matters 
highlighted at Section B.1.1 of the Code, which could appear to 
affect a Director’s judgment. In undertaking the review, one 
specific matter addressed was that Lord Oxford has served 
on the Board for more than nine years. Following the review, 
the Executive Directors at that time did not consider that this 
matter in any way influenced the independent judgment of 
Lord Oxford. Accordingly, the Executive Directors in office 
during 2015 believed that each of the Non Executive Directors 
and Chairman to be independent in accordance with Section B 
1.1 of the Code both during the year under review. 
The contracts of all Directors who served in office during 2015 
were terminated on 28 January 2016.
The five new Board members have entered into interim 
arrangements which will be replaced by longer term 
arrangements once an independent Remuneration Committee 
has been nominated and can review and approve such 
arrangements. 
Internal	 control	 and	 risk	 management
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system 
of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The 
internal control systems are designed to meet the particular 
needs of the Group and to manage rather than eliminate the 
risk of failure to achieve business objectives. Such systems 
can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
For the year under review and up to the date of approval 
of the 2015 Annual Report, the Board has reviewed the 
effectiveness of the Company’s systems of internal control 
and risk management and has concluded that the Company’s 
procedures, policies and systems are appropriate and suitable 
to enable the Board to safeguard shareholders’ investment and 
the Company’s assets, and comply with Turnbull Guidance. 
In addition, the Board has carried out a robust assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Company, including those 
that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity. Details of the principal risks and how they 
are managed or mitigated is included on pages 42 to 53.
Further information on internal control and risk management 
is set out in the Audit Committee Report on page 79.
Budgetary	 process
Each year the Board reviews and approves the Group’s annual 
budget with key risk areas identified. The preparation of the 
annual Group budget is a multi-stage comprehensive process 
led by the Chief Financial Officer who works closely with 
local finance directors for operating subsidiaries in Russia 
and Ukraine and other senior management with specific 
responsibilities for our Hungarian, Slovakian and other 
operations.
Performance is monitored through the monthly reporting 
to the Board of variances from the budget. Relevant action 
is taken by the Board throughout the year based on updated 
forecasts which are prepared using current information on the 
key risk areas and sensitivities.
The budgetary process for 2016 has been deferred in order 
that the new Board is able to fully understand and contribute 
to the process rather than continuing with a budget that was 
approved by the previous Board.
Investment	 appraisal
For each capital intensive project there is a rigorous project 
analysis and risk and return appraisal completed using 
technical, financial, commercial, and operational specialists 
across the Group. The new Board is reviewing the approach 
to ensure the most effective allocation of capital across the 
group as part of a wider consideration of the Company’s 
strategy. 
Capital investment is regulated by the budgetary process, our 
automated authorisation for expenditure (‘AFE’) system and 
pre-defined authorisation levels. 
For expenditure beyond specified levels, detailed written 
proposals are submitted to the Board. 
Using our AFE system Group capital expenditures are 
reviewed monthly on a project-by-project basis by the Chief 
Financial Officer and overruns, actual or foreseen, are 
investigated, and approved by the Board where appropriate. 
Whistleblowing
The Board reviews the arrangements by which employees 
can raise any concerns they may have about workplace fraud 
or mismanagement with local management on a confidential 
basis. Whistleblowing incidents are taken very seriously by the 
Board. 
As part of the Board’s commitment to support our employees 
in the work place, we have a confidential process for reporting 
“Concerns at Work”. This is a confidential service for reporting 
delicate matters that sometimes arise in the work place.
In addition, this service forms part of the Company’s 
commitment to comply with best practice under the UK 
Bribery Act. As disclosed in our Anti-Bribery and Corruption 
policy, all individuals who work on behalf of the Group have 
a responsibility to help detect, prevent and report instances 
not only of bribery but also of any other suspicious activity or 
wrongdoing. 
Employees are expected to make complaints to their 
line managers or, if this is not appropriate, through our 
independently managed confidential reporting process, which 
is available to all employees as well as third parties. 
Complaints made under the confidential reporting service are 
sent to the Finance Director and are investigated in the first 
instance prior to a decision being taken about further steps. 
Feedback is provided to the person making the complaint, if 
necessary.
The Board is absolutely committed to ensuring that all 
employees have a safe, reliable, and confidential way of 
reporting any suspicious activity.
Corporate governance
At each of the six scheduled Board meetings during the year 
matters considered include:
• the Chief Executive’s report on strategic, HSECQ and 
performance matters;
• the Finance Director’s report which includes the latest 
available management accounts;
• the Technical Director’s operations and exploration update;
• the Commercial Director’s report on oil, gas and 
condensate prices, macroeconomic issues and business 
development activity; and
• where applicable, reports from the Nominations 
Committee, Audit Committee and Remuneration 
Committee.
In addition to the standing agenda items and annual Board 
responsibilities in respect of the Group’s reporting, other 
topics covered by the Board during the year included:
• the political and economic developments in Ukraine 
and Russia and managing the associated risks to our 
operations;
• responding to the three Ukrainian government decrees on 
doubling of gas production taxes, currency controls and gas 
sales restrictions, and managing the impact on the Group;
• managing the Group’s liquidity following the Ukrainian 
government decrees and significant disruption to the gas 
sales market in Ukraine; and
• the international arbitration proceedings against Ukraine 
under the Energy Charter Treaty and other relevant 
investment treaties seeking compensation for losses 
suffered due to Ukraine’s treaty violations.
Re-electing	 your	 Board
The Board contains a broad range of experience and skills 
from a variety of industries and advisory roles, which fully 
complement each other.
All of the current Board appointments were approved by 
shareholders at the General Meeting on 28 January 2016. 
As the Company is outside of the FTSE 350 there is no 
requirement for all Board members to be subject to annual  
re-election by shareholders. Directors will stand for  
re-election at the 2016 Annual General Meeting, in accordance 
with the Articles of Association. 
Full biographies of all the Directors can be found on pages 70 
and 71 and in the Notice of AGM.
Nomination	 Committee	
The role of the Nomination Committee is to review the 
structure, size, skills and composition of the Company Board 
and the Boards of companies owned by JKX Oil & Gas plc. The 
Committee also considers succession planning and suitable 
nominations for appointments to the Boards, and makes 
appropriate recommendations based on qualifications and 
experience. 
The Committee meets as often as it determines is appropriate 
and generally meets at least once a year and more frequently 
if required. The Committee did not meet during 2015 and no 
appointments were made to the Board (2014: none).
Membership	 and	 process	
The Nomination Committee comprised two Non Executive 
Directors. During 2015 the Committee comprised Lord Oxford 
and Nigel Moore (Chairman) who were removed from the 
Board on 28 January 2016. As noted above, when the two 
new independent Non Executive Directors are appointed a 
Nominations Committee can be constituted in accordance with 
the requirements of the Code.
The Chairman ensures that any new Directors are provided 
with a full induction on joining the Board. The letters of 
appointment of each Non Executive Director are available for 
inspection at the registered office of the Company.
Succession	 planning
The Board is responsible for succession planning for 
directorships and key management roles. This requires 
performance and talent assessment, to ensure that able 
successors for key roles are identified and then provided 
with suitable opportunities through career and personal 
development plans. It is crucial that we remunerate our most 
talented people fairly and properly, such that they are more 
likely to stay in our employment. 
The new Nomination Committee, when appointed, will 
consider succession planning.
Remuneration	 Committee
Details of the work of the Remuneration Committee is given in 
the Remuneration report on pages 84 to 99.
Compliance
Compliance	 with	 the	 UK	 Corporate	 Governance	 Code
The Board believes that during 2015 the Company was fully 
compliant with the provisions set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, with the following minor exceptions:
B.2.3. The terms of appointment of the Non Executive 
Directors were set out in their service contracts, which for 
Nigel Moore was dated 13 July 2012, for Lord Oxford was dated 
1 January 2002, for Dipesh Shah was dated 1 June 2008, for 
Alastair Ferguson was dated 1 November 2011 and for Richard 
Murray was dated 1 January 2013 and included a termination 
notice of three months by either party. However, the service 
contracts were for an indefinite term, not a finite term, subject 
to re-election on an as required basis. These contracts were 
terminated on 28 January 2016.
B.7.1. Non Executive Directors who have served longer than 
nine years should be subject to annual re-election. Lord 
Oxford had served on the Board for more than nine years and 
was re-elected a Director at the last AGM on 4 June 2014. 
In considering that the Company was in 2015, other than 
as noted above, in full compliance, the Board notes that 
excluding the Chairman, independent Non Executive Directors 
comprised 50% of the Board as the Board considered that the 
four other Non Executive Directors in place during 2015 were 
wholly independent.  Financial statements

Audit Committee Report
During 2015, the Committee comprised three independent  
Non Executive Directors who resigned on 28 January 2016.
JKX Board replaced on 28 January 2016
The entire Board of JKX was replaced on 28 January 2016 
following a General Meeting of the Company. The resignation 
of all independent Non Executive Directors meant that, since 
that date, the composition of the Board has not complied with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’) in respect of 
the number of independent Non Executive Directors. Without 
independent Non Executive Directors, the Company has not 
been able to form an Audit Committee which is compliant with 
the Code. 
The Company is in the process of conducting background 
checks and appointing two new independent Non Executive 
Directors which will enable a new Audit Committee to be 
formed.
For the purposes of approving the Annual Report for 2015, 
an interim Audit Committee consisting of Paul Ostling, as 
Chairman, and Russell Hoare, as Chief Financial Officer, was 
formed, but will be replaced with an independent committee, 
in compliance with the Code, as soon as the new independent 
Board members are appointed. Both Paul Ostling and Russell 
Hoare have relevant financial experience, as defined by the 
Code, and so were deemed most suited to form the Committee 
as an interim measure.
Composition of the Audit Committee
During 2015, the Audit Committee was chaired by Richard 
Murray, a Chartered Accountant and a former audit partner 
with Ernst & Young LLP. The Board in 2015 determined that 
Richard Murray has considerable recent and relevant financial 
experience through his previous and current roles. In addition, 
Richard maintained a regular pattern of attendance at relevant 
seminars and courses.
The Committee also included two other Independent  
Non Executive Directors, Dipesh Shah and Alastair Ferguson, 
providing it with an appropriate balance between those 
individuals with a financial or accounting background and 
those with wider experience of the oil and gas sector in which 
we operate. In practice, the Committee achieves its objectives 
by a process of regular interaction with management and the 
external auditors, as well as by reviewing the work of Internal 
Audit and the Risk Committee, and other advisory firms.
Together with the collective financial and commercial 
skills and experience of the other Committee members, 
the Committee had the appropriate experience to fulfil its 
responsibilities and oversee the activities of the Company’s 
auditors.

out in its written terms of reference, available on the Company’s 
website, which were last reviewed by the Board in July 2015. The 
principal objectives of the Audit Committee are:
• to monitor the integrity of the financial statements of the Group 
and regulatory announcements, and to review any significant 
financial reporting judgements; 
• to monitor the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal control, risk management and financial reporting 
processes;
• to provide the Board with an independent assessment of the 
Group’s accounting affairs and financial position;
• to provide the Board with assurance that the Annual Report and 
Accounts are presented in a manner that is fair, balanced and 
understandable, so as to enable shareholders to assess the 
Group’s performance, business model and strategy;
• to recommend the (re-)appointment of the external auditors to 
the Board and annually assess their independence, objectivity, 
effectiveness, quality, remuneration and terms of engagement, 
as well as ensuring that the policy with regard to their 
appointment for non-audit services is appropriately applied. 
Thereafter, the Committee provides a recommendation to the 
Board regarding the auditors appointment to be put to the 
shareholders in the forthcoming annual general meeting; and
• to monitor the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal audit 
function and the Risk Committee and to review any significant 
matters arising. 
Role of the Audit Committee
Corporate governance
Communication	 with	 shareholders
A key priority of the new Board that was appointed on  
28 January 2016 is significant and rapid improvements to the 
frequency and levels of communication with all shareholders. 
The new Board has made contact with the Group’s major 
shareholders since its appointment and is committed to a 
more open relationship involving regular communications 
in order that shareholders views on the Group can be 
understood.
A number of formal communication channels are used to 
account to shareholders for the performance of the Group, 
which include the Annual Report, AGMs and periodic reports 
to the London Stock Exchange. 
Presentations given at appropriate intervals to representatives 
of the investor community are available to all shareholders 
to download from the Group’s website (www.jkx.co.uk). 
Less formal processes include contacts with institutional 
shareholders for which the Board as a whole takes 
responsibility.
Extensive information about the Group’s activities is provided 
in the Annual Report and the Half-yearly Report which are 
provided to shareholders. 
During 2015, the Chief Executive and Finance Director had a 
number of meetings with institutional and other shareholders, 
as did the Chairman. In addition, in April 2015 the Chairman 
wrote to shareholders to update them on the Group’s progress 
and other important matters affecting them and the Group.
Enquiries from individuals on matters relating to their 
shareholding and the business of the Group are welcomed 
and are dealt with in an informative and timely manner. 
Shareholders are encouraged to attend the Annual General 
Meeting to discuss the progress of the Group.
Conflicts	 of	 interest
The Company complies with the provisions on conflicts of 
interest in the Companies Act 2006. 
The Company has procedures in place for the disclosure 
and review of any conflicts, or potential conflicts, of interest 
which the Directors may have and for the authorisation of 
such conflicting matters by the Board. In deciding whether to 
authorise a conflict or potential conflict the Directors must 
have regard to their general duties under the Companies 
Act 2006. The procedure operates to ensure the disclosure 
of conflicts, and for the consideration and if appropriate, the 
authorisation of them by non-conflicted Directors. 
The authorisation of a conflict matter, and the terms of 
authorisation, may be reviewed at any time by the Board. The 
Nomination Committee supports the Board in this process, 
both by reviewing requests from Directors for authorisations 
of situations of actual or potential conflict and making 
recommendations to the Board and by reviewing any situations 
of actual or potential conflict that have been previously 
authorised by the Board, and making recommendations 
regarding whether the authorisation remains appropriate.
Going	 concern
The Board closely monitors and manages its liquidity risk 
using cash flow forecasts which are regularly produced and 
applies sensitivities for different scenarios including, but not 
limited to, changes in oil and gas prices, changes to production 
and other tax rates in relation to the Group’s producing assets, 
changes in Rouble and Hryvnia exchange rates, increased 
operating and capital expenditure and delays to additional 
future revenue, while also considering the current and future 
country and currency risks that the business is exposed to.
At the date of this report, there is a combination of 
circumstances which results in the existence of a material 
uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about the Group’s 
and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The 
combination of circumstances giving rise to the material 
uncertainty is discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements. 
After making enquiries and considering the circumstances 
discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Directors 
have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a 
reasonable expectation that the Company and Group will 
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial 
statements.

Matters considered Response and conclusion
The impact on the going concern of the Company of:
• the sudden fall in worldwide oil and gas prices; and
• the ability to settle the potential $30.1 million which  
may become payable in February 2017
 
The Committee has been in discussion throughout the year with 
management and the external auditors (PwC) in order to assess the 
impact of foreign exchange controls in Ukraine and the continued low 
international oil and gas prices.
The Committee received reports prepared by management outlining 
their assessment of the ability of the Group to continue as a going 
concern, subject to the reprioritisation of capital expenditure, tighter 
cost control and successfully repatriating cash to the UK through 
other legitimate means. 
The Committee challenged the appropriateness of the key 
assumptions used and was fully briefed on discussions between the 
Board, local management and advisors regarding the potential for 
further unforeseen decrees in Ukraine affecting the Group.
In addition, PwC provided a detailed report on this issue to the 
Committee. The audit opinion, provided by them, includes an 
‘emphasis of matter’ paragraph referencing specific risks relating to 
further legislation from the Ukrainian government affecting the 
energy industry and material deterioration of our oil and gas 
realisations, which represent material uncertainties. Whilst it is 
unclear whether either or both of these risks will be realised, if 
realised, they may cast significant doubt about the Group’s ability to 
meet its obligations as they fall due and continue as a going concern. 
The Committee has advised the Board that, on the basis of 
management’s reasonable expectations as to the likely outcome and 
impact of these risks, including consideration of mitigating measures, 
the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future and therefore the going concern 
basis is the appropriate basis of preparation for the 2015 financial 
statements. However, this notwithstanding, the Committee has 
advised the Board that the current political and economic 
uncertainties that exist, particularly those relating to oil and gas 
realisations, together represent a material uncertainty, which should 
be, and is, appropriately disclosed in the financial statements (see 
Note 2 to the Group financial statements).
The Group has a significant obligation of $30.1 million which may 
become payable pursuant to its $40 million Convertible Bond in 
February 2017 (see Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial 
statements) if all of the Bondholders exercise their put option at that 
time, or in February 2018 if the Bond expires at its full term. 
The majority of the Group’s revenues, profits and cash flow from 
operations are currently derived from its oil and gas production in 
Ukraine.
Accordingly, the Group’s going concern assessment is sensitive to 
the realisations that are achieved from oil and gas sales in Ukraine 
and the Company’s ability to repatriate cash to the UK to meet its 
obligations to creditors and bondholders.
JKX’s oil and gas markets were severely affected through 2015 by the 
sustained low international oil prices which have adversely affected 
its financial results. 
Under guidelines set out by the UK Financial Reporting Council the 
Board is required to consider whether the going concern basis is the 
appropriate basis of preparation for the Financial Statements, and 
furthermore, is required to include appropriate disclosure of any 
significant considerations or uncertainties relevant to the going 
concern assumption.
The carrying value of the Group’s oil and gas assets
 
The Committee received reports from management outlining the 
basis for each of the key assumptions used, and these assumptions 
were reviewed and challenged by the Committee to ensure 
reasonableness and consistency e.g. with the Group’s 2016 Budget 
which is approved by the Board. In addition, this area is a prime 
source of audit focus and accordingly our auditors provide detailed 
reporting to the Committee. Management also brought to the 
attention of the Committee the sensitivity analysis disclosed in Note 5 
to the financial statements. 
The Committee agreed that, on the basis of the evidence available, 
after the provision for impairments of $49.6m and $1.5m in respect of 
our oil and gas assets in Ukraine and Hungary, the projected future 
cash flows from the Group’s CGUs adequately supported the carrying 
value of the associated oil and gas assets, and noted that full 
disclosure of the key assumptions (including a sensitivity analysis in 
Note 5) had been appropriately disclosed in the financial statements.
As more fully explained in Note 5 to the financial statements, JKX’s 
oil and gas assets are grouped into cash generating units (‘CGUs’) for 
the purpose of assessing the recoverable amount. Each period these 
assets are reviewed for indications of impairment. If any assets are 
considered to have been impaired, the carrying value is adjusted 
downwards by an appropriate amount, with a corresponding charge 
made to the Income Statement.
An impairment review necessarily involves the use of assumptions 
such as long-term production forecasts, gas prices, production-
related taxes, capital expenditure, discount rates, and other 
macroeconomic assumptions underlying the valuation process. This 
is particularly challenging in relation to the Group’s interests in 
Ukraine and southern Russia due to the lower medium term visibility 
of gas prices which are set by the respective governments and are 
vulnerable to unexpected short term political manoeuvring.
Audit Committee Report
Attendance at meetings
The Audit Committee met five times during 2015 (2014: three).
The Committee’s meetings were always attended by the 
Chief Executive, the Finance Director, the lead partner of our 
external auditors, and by certain senior managers who are 
responsible for specific topics, such as risk management, 
financial control, and internal compliance procedures. Other 
Directors are invited to attend the meetings from time to time 
when appropriate. 
The Committee Chairman maintains contact with those other 
attendees throughout the year. Twice during 2015 (2014: twice), 
the Committee met with the external auditors to discuss 
matters which the auditors and Audit Committee may wish to 
raise without Executive Directors being present.
The Committee’s activities during 2015
The Committee had an annual work plan, developed from its 
terms of reference, with standing items that the Committee 
considers at each meeting in addition to any specific matters 
arising and topical items on which the Committee has chosen 
to focus.
The work of the Audit Committee during the year principally 
fell under three main areas and is summarised below.
Significant issues considered by the Audit Committee
After discussion with management and the external auditors, 
the Committee determined that the key risk of misstatement in 
relation to the Group’s 2015 financial statements related to:
• The going concern basis of accounting; 
• The carrying value of the Group’s Oil and Gas assets; and 
• The Group’s exposure to production-related taxes in 
Ukraine.
These issues were discussed with management and the 
external auditors at the time the Committee reviewed and 
agreed the auditors’ Group Audit Plan, during the review of the 
half year interim financial statements in July 2014 and at the 
conclusion of the audit of these financial statements.
Internal controls and risk External auditors Accounting, tax and financial reporting
• Considered reports from KPMG in 
relation to their audits and assessment of 
the control environment in Russia and 
Ukraine
• Considered reports from the external 
auditors on their assessment of the 
control environment
• Considered feedback from both the 
internal and external auditor reports as 
submitted by local and Group 
management
• Reviewed Risk Committee reports, which 
required management to identify risks 
and evaluate them, and ensured 
appropriate mitigating controls were 
agreed and implemented
• Approved the scope of the internal audit 
programme for the year
• Considered the effectiveness of the 
internal audit function
• Assessed the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal control environment
• Assessed the effectiveness of the Group’s

and scope of the audit work to be undertaken 
by the external auditors and the fees for the 
same
• Reviewed auditor’s reports on their audit 
findings at the half year review and at the 
year end
• Reviewed and updated the policy governing 
non-audit services
• Considered the independence of the auditors 
and their effectiveness, taking into account: 
(a) non-audit work undertaken by the 
external auditors and compliance with the 
policy; 
(b) FRC guidance; 
(c) feedback from a survey targeted at 
various stakeholders; and 
(d) the Committee’s own Assessment
• Considered the recommendations in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code regarding the 
tender of the external audit contract
• Considered and approved letters of 
representation issued to the external 
auditors
• Reviewed the half year and annual 
financial statements and the significant 
financial reporting judgements made 
therein
• Considered the liquidity risk and the basis 
for preparing the Group half yearly and 
full year financial statements on a going 
concern basis and reviewed the related 
disclosures in the Annual Report
• Reviewed the external auditors’ report on 
audit and accounting judgements, 
including consideration of relevant 
accounting standards and underlying 
assumptions
• Reviewed disclosures in the Annual 
Report in relation to internal controls, 
risk management, principal risks and 
uncertainties and the work of the 
Committee

External audit
The Audit Committee maintains an objective and 
professional relationship with the Company’s auditors, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’), who have been auditors 
to the Group since 2006, and meets in private session with 
them on a periodic basis. 
PwC were reappointed as the Company’s auditors in 2011 
following a competitive tender process. The audit partner 
rotated in 2013. PwC are required to rotate the audit partner 
responsible for the Group audit every five years.
The Audit Committee are fully supportive of the Code’s 
requirement that the audit should be put out to tender at least 
once in every ten years. Any decision to open the external audit 
to tender within ten years is taken on the recommendation 
of the Audit Committee based on the results of the annual 
performance review.
Non-audit services
During the year the Committee reviewed their policy governing 
the engagement of the external auditor to provide non-audit 
services. The policy precludes PwC from providing certain 
services such as valuation work or the provision of accounting 
services and also sets a presumption that the external auditor 
should only be engaged for non-audit services where there is 
no legal or practical alternative supplier.
In such instances, the continued objectivity and independence 
of the auditors in their capacity of auditor is an objective of the 
Group. 
Under the policy, the Committee has delegated authority to 
the Finance Director for the approval of non-audit services 
from PwC of up to $20,000 per project and an aggregate 
amount of not more than $50,000 in any year. Decisions above 
these thresholds must be referred to the Audit Committee for 
pre-approval of the services and be supported by appropriate 
documentation detailing management’s reasons for  
selecting PwC.
In addition to the statutory audit fee, PwC and member firms 
charged the Group $110,000 for audit-related assurance 
services in 2015 in connection with the 2015 half year review 
process and $2,000 for the use of their online technical 
information database.
Further details of the fees paid, for both audit and non-audit 
services, can be found in Note 23 to the consolidated financial 
statements.
The Committee is satisfied that the quantum of the non-
audit services provided by PwC is such that the objectivity 
and independence of the external auditor has not been 
compromised.
Reappointment of Independent Auditors
During the year the performance of the auditor was formally 
assessed by the Committee in conjunction with the senior 
management team. In making this assessment the Committee 
focused on the robustness of the audit, the quality of delivery 
of audit services and the quality of the auditors’ staff.
Having reviewed the capability and effectiveness of PwC’s 
performance during the year, and having satisfied itself 
as to their continuing independence and objectivity within 
the context of applicable regulatory requirements and 
professional standards, the Committee has invited the Board 
to recommend the reappointment of PwC as auditor at the 
forthcoming AGM and a resolution to that effect will appear in 
the notice of the AGM.
Audit Committee Report
Matters considered Response and conclusion
The Group’s exposure to production-related taxes  
in Ukraine
The Committee addressed this issue, as in previous periods, by 
reviewing reports from senior management and examining the 
degree to which these are supported by professional advice from 
external legal and other advisory firms. This is also an area of 
elevated audit risk and accordingly the Committee received detailed 
verbal and written reporting from PwC on these matters.
Having reviewed these reports and submissions, the Committee was 
satisfied that a provision of $10.9m was required in respect of 
production taxes being claimed for 2010, and the other two claims 
were disclosable as contingent liabilities. 
Furthermore the Committee noted that the disclosures made in  
Note 27 to the financial statements appropriately reflected the 
uncertainties that necessarily persist.
As detailed in Note 27 to the financial statements, the Company is 
engaged in a claim against Ukraine under international arbitration 
proceedings for the recovery of overpayment of production taxes of 
more than US$180m, in addition to damages to the business. The 
claim is being heard in July 2016 and therefore the outcome is 
unknown.
In addition, in recent years, the Group has been in receipt of a 
number of unexpected claims for additional taxes, mainly 
retrospective in nature, all of which have been successfully managed 
and resisted by management to date and which have been/are being 
contested in the Law Courts of Ukraine. 
The outcome of legal challenges concerning additional production 
tax liabilities in Ukraine for the period to 31 December 2010 is 
underpinned by a range of judgements (see Note 27).
Misstatements
Management reported to the Committee that they were not 
aware of any material or immaterial misstatements made 
intentionally to achieve a particular presentation. The auditors 
reported the misstatements that they had found in the course 
of their work to the Committee and confirmed that no material 
amount remained unadjusted.
Internal control 
The Audit Committee monitors the integrity of the financial 
statements and related announcements, reviews the 
Company’s internal control processes and risk management 
systems, and reports its conclusions to the Board. The 
Committee regularly reviews the effectiveness of the 
Company’s systems of internal control and risk management. 
Risk management
The Risk Committee, which comprises the Chief Financial 
Officer and senior management, assists the Board in 
discharging their responsibility to review on an ongoing basis 
the risks potentially facing the Group, their potential impact, 
the strategies available to mitigate those risks and the costs of 
such mitigation.
The Risk Committee met three times in 2015.
The Chairman of the Risk Committee reports to the Audit 
Committee and the Board at relevant meetings on matters 
it has reviewed and material changes to the Group’s risk 
environment, in addition to making recommendations when 
appropriate. 
Following each Risk Committee meeting, the Committee 
reviews the minutes, the latest Risk Register and related 
output, and challenges the Group’s high-rated risks and the 
mitigating actions identified by each risk owner. An updated 
list of principal risks is included within the Strategic Report on 
pages 44 to 53.
For each high-rated risk the Committee reviews the Group’s 
current level of exposure and considers the appropriateness of 
the mitigating actions being taken by management.
The Committee was comfortable with the processes in place 
for risk management. 
Additional information on risk management is included in the 
Principal risks and how we manage them section on page 41.
Internal audit 
During the year, KPMG were retained to build on their prior 
year’s assessment on the adequacy of the Group’s procedures 
and controls in Russia and Ukraine, as well as complete full 
internal audit procedures on the procure-to-pay process at 
our significant operations in Ukraine. 
The scope of the procure-to-pay internal audit included testing 
of design and operating effectiveness of controls across the 
full process.
KPMG’s independent assessment of our processes and 
controls allowed management to prioritise their work so as to 
address their recommendations and continue to strengthen 
the financial and operating controls in these two operating 
subsidiaries. 
The Audit Committee is fully supportive of the development of 
the internal audit programme which is intended to ensure that 
the necessary processes and controls are firmly embedded 
within our organisation making the control environment 
stronger and more efficient. Financial statements

Summary of Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors and Non 
Executive Directors was approved by shareholders at the June 
2014 AGM and took effect from 1 January 2015. Below we 
provide a summary including the Remuneration policy table, 
and terms and conditions for members of the Board. The full 
policy report, as approved by shareholders, can be found on 
pages 125-133 of the 2013 Annual Report, a copy of which 
can be found on the Company’s website at www.jkx.co.uk/
investor-centre/investor-download-centre.aspx
Reward policies
The Company aimed to ensure that total remuneration was 
set at an appropriate level relative to peer group comparator 
companies, those being UK-based oil and gas companies 
which are primarily quoted on the London Stock Exchange 
or AIM. The main components of remuneration for Executive 
Directors and senior management are basic annual salary; 
pension and benefits (including non-contributory health 
insurance, life assurance and income protection); an annual 
bonus scheme linked to short-term financial and strategic 
objectives; and long-term incentives linked to the delivery of 
long-term shareholder value. 
The main objectives of JKX’s remuneration policy are to: 
• enable the Company to recruit, retain and motivate 
individuals with the skills, capabilities and experience to 
achieve its stated objectives; 
• strengthen teamwork by enabling all employees to share in 
the success of the business; and
• ensure alignment of Executive, senior management and 
shareholder interests. 
Reward principles
The principles of JKX’s remuneration policy are to:
• pay an appropriate level of total remuneration in relation to 
company and individual performance and with reference to 
peer group companies; 
• ensure that there is an appropriate link between 
performance and reward; 
• award annual bonuses which reflect the achievement of 
short term financial and strategic objectives as well as 
personal performance; and 
• ensure that long-term incentives are linked to Total 
Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) and to the delivery of Strategic 
Plan targets including the achievement of strategic 
objectives. 
Each element of remuneration has a specific role in achieving 
the objectives of the remuneration policy and aligning 
the interests of Executive Directors with the interests of 
shareholders. The combined potential remuneration from 
the annual bonus and long-term incentives ensures that the 
balance of the Executive remuneration package is weighted 
towards at risk performance pay with a higher weighting on 
long-term remuneration.
More than 97% of JKX staff are based outside of the UK, 
primarily in the Ukraine and Russia. The Committee takes into 
account remuneration conditions elsewhere in the Company, 
and particularly for those employees based in the UK, in 
formulating the Executive Director remuneration policy. 
A summary of the Directors’ remuneration policy applicable 
during 2015 is provided in the table overleaf. The policy will be 
reconsidered by the new Remuneration Committee once it is 
established. 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy
Executive Director Remuneration Policy Table
Base salary
Purpose and link to strategy To attract and retain talent by ensuring base salaries reflect individual performance and market factors.
Operation Base salaries are reviewed annually on 1 January, with reference to the individual’s role, experience and 
performance; salary levels at relevant UK sector comparators
1
; and the range of salary increases applying 
across the Group.
Opportunity Any base salary increases are applied in line with the outcome of the annual review.
It is not anticipated that salary increases for Executive Directors will exceed those of the UK-based 
workforce over the period over which this policy will apply. Where increases are awarded in excess of the UK 
employee population, the Committee will provide clear rationale in the relevant year’s Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
Performance metrics Business and individual performance are considerations in setting base salary.
1
  Comparator companies used to assess market pay competitiveness have historically included UK-based oil and gas companies listed on the London Stock Exchange or AIM. 
The Committee reviews comparator companies periodically to ensure they remain appropriate and retains the discretion to adjust the reference group or companies as 
appropriate.
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Independence
During 2015, the Committee comprised three independent  
Non Executive Directors.
JKX Board replaced on 28 January 2016
The entire Board of JKX was replaced on 28 January 2016 
following a General Meeting of the Company. The resignation 
of all independent Non Executive Directors meant that, since 
that date, the composition of the Board has not complied with 
UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’) in respect of the 
number of independent Non Executive Directors. Without 
independent Non Executive Directors, the Company has 
not been able to form a Remuneration Committee which is 
compliant with the Code. 
The Company has engaged an independent consultant to 
conduct due diligence on a short-list of candidates and is in 
the final phase of appointing two new independent  
Non Executive Directors who will form the new Remuneration 
Committee, in accordance with the requirements of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.
Remuneration of the Board appointed on 28 January 2016
Temporary remuneration levels have been put in place for the 
Board members appointed on 28 January 2016 pending the 
establishment of an independent Remuneration Committee 
which will set remuneration levels that will apply from  
28 January 2016. Any difference between the final 
remuneration levels approved by the new Remuneration 
Committee and the temporary levels currently in place will be 
adjusted back to 28 January 2016. For further information on 
this see pages 94 and 96.
Remuneration in 2015
Details of the remuneration decisions for the reporting year 
are covered in the Annual Report on Remuneration. The 
Committee annually examines the evolution of remuneration 
practices and policy. Changes proposed by The Committee at 
the AGM in June 2014 were approved and were to remain in 
place for three years from 1 January 2015 to  
31 December 2017.
No salary increases were awarded for 2015 across the 
organisation. Annual bonuses in 2015 were based on a similar 
performance framework as in 2014 using a range of strategic, 
financial and health and safety targets. 
Under the Performance Share Plan approved at the 2014 AGM, 
awards would normally be granted of nil cost options which 
equate to 150% of the base salary for each of the Executive 
Directors. For 2015, the Committee restricted the grant to 
100% of base pay with performance conditions that reflect the 
approved Remuneration Policy. 
Remuneration disclosure
As with last year, this Report is split into two parts: the Policy 
Report and the Directors’ annual remuneration report:
• The	 Directors’	 Remuneration	 Policy	 applicable	 during	
2015	 (pages	 85	 to	 88)	 was unchanged from that approved by 
shareholders at the June 2014 AGM, and we have therefore 
provided a summary in order to provide context. The full 
Policy Report, as approved by shareholders, can be found in 
our 2013 Annual Report available on our website.
• The	 Directors’	 annual	 remuneration	 report	 (pages	 89	 	
to	 99)	 sets out details of how our remuneration policy has 
been applied for the year ended 31 December 2015. This 
section is subject to an advisory shareholder vote.
These sections work together to give you full and transparent 
disclosure of the Company’s approach to Directors’ 
remuneration during 2015. 
At the 2016 AGM, the Directors’ annual remuneration report 
will be put to an advisory shareholder vote. Financial statements

Executive Director Remuneration Policy Table
Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’)
Purpose and link to strategy To incentivise strong long-term financial performance and superior longer term returns to shareholders 
relative to peers.
Operation The Remuneration Committee has the ability to grant awards of nil-cost options annually to Executive 
Directors, conditional on Group performance over a period of at least three years. The sale of vested PSP 
awards is subject to meeting shareholding requirements (see page 98).
Award levels and performance conditions will be reviewed from time to time to ensure they remain 
appropriate and no less stretching than the first cycle.
Clawback applies on unvested PSP shares in the event of gross misconduct, material misstatement, or in 
any other circumstance that the Committee considers appropriate.
Opportunity The PSP provides for an award up to a normal aggregate limit of 150% of salary for Executive Directors, with 
an overall limit of 200% of salary in exceptional circumstances.
The Committee has the discretion to authorise a payment, in cash or shares, equal to the value of dividends 
which would have accrued on vested shares during the vesting period.
Performance metrics Vesting of PSP awards is subject to continued employment and the Company’s performance over a 3-year 
performance period. If no entitlement has been earned at the end of the relevant performance period, 
awards will lapse.
From 2015, PSP awards are based on a number of financial and strategic measures, which may include, but 
not be limited to:
• TSR
• Earnings per Share (‘EPS’)
• Other financial measures (e.g. ROCE, Profit before tax, cash resources)
• Strategic and operational measures (e.g. production, reserves)
In addition, awards are subject to an underpin such that for any awards to vest, the Remuneration Committee 
must satisfy themselves that health and safety performance has been satisfactory over the performance 
period. Each measure can be applied a weighting of between 0% and 50%. The Committee has the discretion 
to adjust the performance measures and weightings in advance of making an award to ensure that they 
continue to be linked to the delivery of Company strategy.
Under each measure, threshold performance will result in up to 25% of maximum vesting for that element. 
The vesting level will increase on a sliding scale to 100% vesting for stretch levels of performance.
Vesting of PSP awards will be deferred in whole or in part for a period of up to two years following the end of 
a three year vesting period. The Company’s policy from 2015 will be for awards to vest 50% after 3 years with 
25% required to be held until the end of 4 years, and 25% until the end of 5 years.
As under the annual bonus, the Committee has discretion to adjust the formulaic PSP outcomes within the 
plan limits to ensure alignment of pay with performance, i.e. to ensure the outcome is a true reflection of the 
performance of the company. 
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Executive Director Remuneration Policy Table
Pension
Purpose and link to strategy To provide competitive retirement benefits.
Operation The Company makes a contribution to the pension scheme of the individual’s choice.
At their option, Executive Directors may either have equivalent contributions made to their personal pension 
schemes or cash in lieu of pension or a combination of both.
Opportunity Executive Directors are eligible to receive an annual contribution equivalent to 15% of base salary.
Performance metrics Not performance related.
Benefits
Purpose and link to strategy To provide competitive benefits.
Operation Executive Directors receive benefits which consist primarily of life assurance, income protection and private 
medical cover, although can include any such benefits that the Committee deems appropriate.
Opportunity Benefits values vary by role and are reviewed periodically relative to market circumstances.
The cost of the benefits provided changes in accordance with market conditions and will, therefore, 
determine the maximum amount that would be paid in the form of benefits during the Policy Period. The 
Committee retains the discretion to approve a higher cost in exceptional circumstances (e.g. relocation) or in 
circumstances where factors outside the company’s control have changed materially (e.g. increases in 
insurance premiums).
Performance metrics Not performance related.
Annual bonus
Purpose and link to strategy To incentivise the achievement of short-term financial and strategic objectives.
Operation Performance measures, targets and weightings are set at the start of the year according to strategic 
priorities. 
At the end of the year, the Remuneration Committee determines the extent to which the targets have been 
achieved, with any bonus payments delivered in cash. 
For Executive Directors, the Committee has the discretion to mandate the deferral of a proportion (up to 
100%) of the annual bonus in JKX shares, to be held for a minimum of 1 year. Deferred shares will be subject 
to clawback provisions in the event of gross misconduct, material misstatement, or in any other 
circumstance that the Committee considers appropriate.
Opportunity For Executive Directors, the maximum annual bonus opportunity is 100% of base salary, with target  
bonus set at 40% of maximum. For threshold level performance, the annual bonus will be between 0% to 
20% of base salary.
Performance metrics Performance is assessed annually based on challenging budget and stretch targets for financial and 
business performance. The measures selected may vary each year depending on business context and 
strategy, and measures will be weighted appropriately according to business priorities. Under normal 
circumstances, financial measures will make up at least half of the total bonus opportunity.
The Committee has discretion to adjust the formulaic bonus outcomes both upwards and downwards within 
the plan limits (including down to zero) to ensure alignment of pay with the underlying performance of the 
business, e.g., in the event of a target being significantly missed or unforeseen circumstances outside of 
management control. 
Further details of the measures, weightings and targets applicable are provided on page 92.

Executive Director service contracts		
1
Executive Director service contracts, including arrangements 
for early termination, are carefully considered by the 
Committee. The Committee considered appointments of 
indefinite term and with a notice period of one year to be 
appropriate. All service contracts and letters of appointment 
are available for viewing at the Company’s registered office 
and at the AGM. 
Executive Director Service Contract severance payments	
On 28 January 2016, the Executive Director Service contracts 
(see below) were terminated with immediate effect. The Board 
in place at that time approved:
• payments in lieu of notice totalling £1,007,500, equivalent 
to 12 months’ salary for Paul Davies, Cynthia Dubin, Peter 
Dixon and 6 months’ salary for Martin Miller;
• payments of £460,800 related to forfeiture of all unexpired 
share options and shares deferred under the 2014 bonus 
arrangements for Executive Directors (see page 91).
On 27 January 2016 the above amounts were approved and 
paid, prior to the General Meeting on 28 January 2016.  
These amounts will be included in the Directors remuneration 
for 2016.
Payments from existing awards 
Executive Directors were eligible to receive payment from 
any award made prior to the approval and implementation of 
the remuneration policy detailed in last year’s Remuneration 
Report, i.e. before 1 January 2015. Details of these awards 
were disclosed on pages 105 to 114 of the 2014 Annual Report, 
and included existing awards made under the DSOS. 
Clawback 
For the avoidance of doubt, the Committee has discretion 
to operate clawback as a mechanism to reduce unvested or 
deferred incentives in the event of a material misstatement 
in the annual financial statements, gross misconduct, or any 
other circumstances that the Committee deems appropriate.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy
Executive Director Remuneration Policy Table
Discretionary Share Option Scheme (‘DSOS’) 
The future policy proposed from 2015 does not envisage the grant of any DSOS awards.
Purpose and link to strategy To incentivise superior long-term financial and share price performance.
Operation The Remuneration Committee has the ability to grant awards of market-value options annually to Executive 
Directors and senior managers, conditional on Group performance over a period of at least three years.
Following the approval of the new PSP at the 2014 AGM, the Committee will not grant awards under the 
DSOS beyond 2014. Details of outstanding DSOS awards, and awards for 2014, are included in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration on page 99.
Opportunity The DSOS allows for awards up to an aggregate limit of 200% of salary in exceptional circumstances.
Performance metrics Where granted, DSOS awards will be subject to performance conditions.
Details of the targets applying to DSOS awards will be included in the Annual Report on Remuneration, 
where applicable.
Non Executive Director fees
Function To attract and retain Non Executive Directors of the highest calibre with broad commercial and other 
experience relevant to the Company.
Operation Fee levels are reviewed annually, with any adjustments effective 1 January in the year following review.  
The fees paid to the Chairman and Non Executive Directors are determined by the Board.
Additional fees are payable for acting as Senior Independent Director and as Chairman of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees, and for individual memberships of such Committees.
Fee levels are benchmarked against comparable companies in the sector as well as FTSE-listed companies 
of similar size and complexity. Time commitment and responsibility are taken into account when reviewing 
fee levels.
Opportunity Non Executive Director fee increases are applied in line with the outcome of the annual fee review. Fees for 
the year commencing 1 January 2015 are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Fee levels will be next reviewed during 2016, with any increase effective 1 January 2017. It is expected that 
increases to Non Executive Director fee levels will be in line with salaried UK-based employees over the life 
of the policy. In the event that there is a material misalignment with the market or a change in the complexity, 
responsibility or time commitment required to fulfil a non-executive role, the Board has discretion to make 
an appropriate adjustment to the fee level.

* In respect of the 2014 bonus, the Committee determined that the Executive Directors shall have no entitlement to receive a cash bonus in respect of the 2014 financial year 
and that the bonus shall be deferred into JKX shares. The Committee agreed with each Executive Director that the Company will award the applicable number of deferred 
shares later in 2015. No deferred shares were issued. The Executive Directors contracts were terminated on 28 January 2016 and the Board in place at that time agreed the 
settlement amounts noted above be paid to each of the directors on 28 January 2016 to replace the right to these deferred shares. The amounts above have been restated 
from last year’s report to equate to the amount paid in cash being the number of shares deferred multiplied by the share price on 27 January 2016.
1) Salary: amount earned for the year.
2) Benefits: the taxable value of benefits received in the year, including life assurance, income protection and private medical cover.
3) Annual Bonus 2014: this is the total bonus based on performance during the year which for 2014 was to be deferred into shares which were to be subject to clawback  
(see * above). Annual Bonus 2015: this is the total cash bonus earned based on performance during the 2015.
4) DSOS: no awards vested on performance to 31 December 2015 (2014: none) as the performance conditions were not met.
5) PSP: no awards vested on performance to 31 December 2015 (2014: none) as the performance conditions were not met.
6) Pension: annual contribution by the Group to directors’ pension plans or cash in lieu.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Annual report
Advisers
The Committee retains Kepler Associates (‘Kepler’) as 
its independent executive remuneration advisers. The 
Committee undertakes due diligence periodically to ensure 
that Kepler remains independent and that the advice provided 
is impartial and objective. Their total fees for the provision of 
remuneration services in 2015 were £15,371 on the basis of 
time and materials. Kepler provides no other services to the 
Group. Kepler is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants 
Group Code of Conduct, details of which can be found at www.
remunerationconsultantsgroup.com. 
The following section provides details of how JKX’s 
remuneration policy was implemented during the financial 
year ending 31 December 2015. In accordance with the 
Committee’s terms of reference and the Group’s remuneration 
policy, the Committee determines Executive Directors’ actual 
remuneration for the year. 
Membership and process
During 2015, the Remuneration Committee comprised three 
independent Non Executive Directors and was chaired by 
Dipesh Shah. 
Following the replacement of the entire JKX Board on  
28 January 2016 (see page 101), the Company is in the final 
phase of appointing two new independent Non Executive 
Directors who will form the new Remuneration Committee, 
in accordance with the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
The Committee meets at least twice a year, to assist the Board 
in determining the remuneration arrangements and contracts 
of the Directors and senior employees. The Committee met 
four times during 2015 (2014: three).
The Remuneration Committee had reviewed the Code, 
specifically Section D that addresses the level, make up and 
procedural aspects of remuneration. The Remuneration 
Committee considered that it complied with all the provisions 
and practices identified.
Attendance	 at	 meetings	 in	 2015
When required, the Chief Executive attends Committee 
meetings; however no Director plays a part in any discussion 
regarding his own remuneration. 
None of the Committee during 2015 had any personal  
financial interest except as a shareholder (as detailed on page 
101), which, given the level of holdings, the Board accepts 
does not impair independence, and no conflicts of interests 
arise from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in 
running the Group.

In any ten year period, the number of Shares which may be 
placed under Option, or issued:
• may not exceed five per cent of the Company’s ordinary 
share capital if issued under the discretionary employees’ 
share scheme; and
• may not exceed ten per cent of the Company’s ordinary 
share capital if issued under the other employees’ share 
schemes.
As at 31 December 2015, the maximum available shares  
under the Company’s 5% and 10% limits was 0.7 million 
(2014: 1.0 million) and 9.3 million (2014: 9.6 million) shares 
respectively, out of an issued share capital of 172.1 million 
shares.
2010	 Performance	 Share	 Plan	 (‘PSP’)
From 2015 onwards, grants under the DSOS ceased, in 
accordance with our policy, and a normal limit of 150% of 
salary applied under the PSP. In exceptional circumstances 
the Committee has the discretion to make awards of up to 
200% of a participant’s basic salary. 
To date, awards have never exceeded100% of salary. Maximum 
award opportunities in 2015 were 100% of salary for Paul 
Davies and Cynthia Dubin, and 80% of salary for Peter Dixon. 
No grants were made to Martin Miller in 2015.
PSP awards vest based on 3-year TSR performance relative 
to a relevant FTSE market capitalisation index (the FTSE 
SmallCap for 2014 awards, the FTSE Fledgling for 2015 awards) 
and FTSE All-Share Oil & Gas Producers index with half of the 
award being assessed against each index. Each part of the 
award will be based on performance relative to the relevant 
index, with 25% vesting for performance in line with the index. 
Vesting would increase on a straight-line basis between 
25% and 100% for index out-performance of up to 10% p.a. 
Historically, this has been broadly equivalent to upper quartile 
performance. In addition, the Committee must be satisfied 
that the recorded TSR is a genuine reflection of the underlying 
performance of the Company over the performance period. 
There is no retesting of performance targets.
TSR performance is measured using percentage out-
performance rather than a ranking approach since it is 
less sensitive to the TSR of individual comparators, and 
uses a 12-month averaging period due to the volatility of 
the Company’s share price and the long-term nature of the 
Company’s investments. Whilst noting market practice is 
typically to use a shorter averaging period, the Committee feel 
that 12-month averaging would give a fairer result for both 
management and shareholders. 
Change	 of	 control
In the event of a change of control, any outstanding PSP or 
DSOS awards will be pro-rated for time and performance. 
The Committee may in its absolute discretion waive time 
pro-rating of the award and retains discretion to determine 
the treatment of unvested awards. In the event of a change of 
control, JKX awards may alternatively be exchanged for new 
equivalent awards in the acquirer, where appropriate.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Annual report
Incentive outcomes for the year ended 31 December 2015 
(audited)
Annual	 Bonus	 Scheme	
The Annual Bonus Scheme for 2015 applied to Executive 
Directors and certain senior management including 
senior staff in Poltava Petroleum Company (‘PPC’) and 
Yuzhgazenergie (‘YGE’). Bonuses are based on both Group and 
individual performances against objectives determined by the 
Committee at the beginning of the year and are designed to 
reward short-term performance. The scheme is discretionary 
and annual awards are not pensionable.
The performance conditions for each financial year are derived 
from the Company’s Annual Budget and Strategic Plan and 
have been approved by the Board. In order to encourage 
teamwork across the Group the weighting applied to each 
performance condition was identical for each Executive 
Director and for senior management.
In 2015, the Maximum bonus opportunity for Executive 
Directors was 100% of base salary and target bonus was 40% 
of base salary. For senior managers target bonuses ranged 
between 12% and 20%, and maximum bonus opportunity 
ranged between 30% and 60%.
The Annual Bonus Scheme performance conditions and 
Achievements for 2015 were as shown below.
To earn the maximum level of bonus requires the maximum to 
be met or exceeded for each performance measure and all of 
the strategic objectives to be met. 
The Remuneration Committee considered that these 
performance measures as the key drivers and indicators of 
both short and long-term performance and value creation. 
Given the close link between these targets and JKX’s previous 
longer-term strategy, the Directors deemed that the targets 
are commercially sensitive and will not be published at this 
time. The Committee will disclose these bonus targets when 
they cease to be commercially sensitive which is expected to 
be in the 2018 Annual Report. 
On the basis of the 2015 results above, bonuses achieved were 
86% of basic salary for Executive Directors, and of between 
26% and 52% of basic salary for senior management. Annual 
bonuses were paid in January 2016. 
Scheme interests awarded in 2014 (audited)
The Company only operated one long-term incentive plan 
during 2015 that being the 2010 Performance Share Plan 
(‘PSP’) which was approved by shareholders at the 2010 and 
2014 Annual General Meetings. 
There were no grants of awards under the approved 
Discretionary Share Option Scheme (‘DSOS’) during 2015. 
The approved policy does not envisage the grant of any DSOS 
awards in future.
The PSP provides nil-cost options for Executive Directors 
and senior management. In the aggregate, the market value 
of shares that may be granted in any financial year under the 
DSOS and the PSP together cannot exceed 300% of basic 
salary for any Executive.

Long-Term	 Incentive	 Plans
In 2015 the Committee granted PSP awards to Executive 
Directors in line with the framework stated in the policy noted 
on page 87. Under the Performance Share Plan approved at 
the 2014 AGM, awards would normally be granted of nil cost 
options which equate to 150% of the base salary for each of 
the Executive Directors. For 2015, the Committee has decided 
to restrict the grant to 100% of base pay with performance 
conditions that reflect the approved Remuneration Policy. 
Details of the 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plans will be defined 
in accordance with the approved policy once an independent 
Remuneration Committee has been nominated and can review 
and approve all of the Board’s incentive arrangements.
Non Executive Director remuneration
Non	 Executive	 Directors	 Service	 Contracts	 during	 2015
The Non Executive Service Contracts shown below were in 
place throughout 2015 and up until 28 January 2016.
In 2015, all Non Executive Directors had specific terms of 
engagement and their remuneration was determined by the 
Board within the limits set by the Articles of Association. The 
Non Executive Directors service contracts noted above were for 
an indefinite term, not a finite term as recommended by Section 
B.2.3 of the Code, subject to re-election on an as required 
basis. The Board believed that these terms were appropriate 
given the Company size, the Non Executive skill set, including 
experience of natural resources and the geographical regions 
in which the Company operates, and the continuing evaluation 
of performance and independence. In the event of early 
termination, the Non Executive Directors’ contracts provided 
for compensation of three months base fee.
The Non Executive Directors were paid a base fee for  
carrying out their duties and responsibilities as Directors, and 
fees for membership and, where applicable, chairmanship of 
each of the remuneration, nomination and audit committees. 
The fees were last increased by 5% at the end of 2013 and 
based on a per annum rate (in Sterling) which was compared 
to published material concerning Non Executive Director fees 
in similar size companies and comparable companies in the 
sector. 
These fees were reviewed at the 2015 year end and no increase 
has been awarded from their 2014 level. Non Executive 
Directors’ fees for 2015 and 2016 were as shown below.
Non Executive Directors cannot participate in any of the 
Company’s share schemes nor are they eligible to join the 
Company’s pension benefit arrangements.
Non	 Executive	 Director	 Service	 Contract	 severance	
payments
On 28 January 2016, following a General Meeting of the 
Company, the Non Executive Director Service contracts noted 
below were terminated with immediate effect. The Board in 
place at that time approved payments in lieu of notice totalling 
£99,750, equivalent to 3 months’ salary for each of the five  
Non Executive Directors, with these amounts being approved 
and paid before the General Meeting on 28 January 2016.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Annual report
2013	 PSP	 and	 DSOS	 vesting
Options granted in 2013 under the DSOS, in accordance with 
the terms noted above, are subject to a 3-year performance 
target of EPS growth of 10% p.a. for maximum vesting with 
threshold vesting at 5% (on a straight-line basis between 
these points). 3-year EPS growth to 31 December 2015 did not 
reach the threshold vesting target therefore all DSOS awards 
granted in 2013 will lapse in 2016.
PSP awards granted in 2013 vest based on a 3-year TSR 
performance as described above, with TSR assessed relative 
to the FTSE250 index and FTSE All-Share Oil & Gas Producers 
index. The TSR for the 3-year period to 31 December 2015 was 
below the performance of both indexes and therefore all PSP 
awards granted in 2013 will lapse in 2016. 
Executive Director remuneration for 2016
Base	 salary
An Executive Director’s basic salary and the other fixed 
elements of pay are determined by the Committee at the 
beginning of the year. The individual salaries and benefits 
of Executive Directors were reviewed taking into account 
individual performance and market factors, with reference to 
independent and objective research that provides up-to-date 
information on a comparator group of UK companies operating 
in the independent oil and gas sector. 
In recognition of the financial circumstances facing the 
Company, the Committee did not increase basic salaries with 
effect from 1 January 2016 (shown below).
Similarly, no salary increase was awarded to the UK 
employees (2014: nil).
Executive	 Directors	 temporary	 base	 salary	 from	 	
28	 January	 2016
On 28 January 2016, following a General Meeting of the 
Company, all of the above Executive Directors were replaced. 
Tom Reed and Russell Hoare were appointed as Executive 
Directors and their base salaries have been set temporarily at 
the following amounts shown in the table below.
These temporary salaries will be replaced once an 
independent Remuneration Committee has been nominated 
and can review and approve all of the Board’s incentive 
arrangements. Any difference between the final salary levels 
approved by the new Remuneration Committee and the 
temporary levels noted below will be adjusted back to  
28 January 2016.
Pension	 and	 benefits
The Company will make a contribution equivalent to 15% of 
basic salary to the pension scheme of the individual’s choice. 
At their option, Executive Directors may either have 
contributions of the same amounts made to their personal 
pension schemes or cash in lieu of pension at the stated rate, 
or a combination of pension contributions and cash in lieu at 
the stated rate, subject to normal statutory deductions.
Benefits provided to Executive Directors includes life 
assurance, which is also provided for senior managers, for a 
sum assured of four times base salary; income protection  
(¾ base salary deferred for 13 weeks); and private medical 
cover (AXA PPP) is offered to all Company employees and 
provides medical cover for them and their dependents, on a 
non-contributory basis.
Annual	 Bonus	 Scheme	
Subject to the approval of the newly appointed Remuneration 
Committee, the performance related annual bonus for 
the 2016 financial year will operate on a similar basis as in 
2015, and in line with the stated future remuneration policy. 
Bonuses will continue to be based on Strategic Plan targets 
which are in line with the strategy of the new Board which was 
appointed on 28 January 2016. Details of the Annual Bonus 
Scheme will be defined in accordance with the approved 
policy once an independent Remuneration Committee has 
been nominated and can review and approve all of the Board’s 
incentive arrangements.
The performance targets previously set by the previous were 
linked with JKX’s longer-term strategy, therefore targets 
remain commercially sensitive and will not be published until 
such time that the Committee is confident there will be no 
adverse impact on the Company of such disclosure. At this 
time the Committee believes that disclosure of the targets in 
three years’ time is appropriate.

 At the request of the Remuneration Committee, half of the 2011 Annual Bonus earned was deferred into Performance Share Options at nil-cost and were subject to claw back 
and performance conditions being met. One third of the deferred options granted became exercisable on 31 March 2012 and the balance of the options lapsed.

The Non Executive Directors and their base fees have been set 
temporarily at the following amounts shown in the table below.
These temporary fees will be replaced once an independent 
Remuneration Committee has been nominated and can review 
and approve all of the Board’s incentive arrangements. Any 
difference between the final fee levels approved by the new

No payments were made to past directors in the year.
Percentage change in CEO remuneration
The table below shows the percentage change in CEO 
remuneration from the prior year compared to the average 
percentage change in remuneration for UK employees.
The CEO’s remuneration includes base salary, taxable benefit 
and annual bonus. The analysis excludes part-time employees 
and is based on a consistent set of all UK employees, i.e. the 
same individuals appear in the 2014 and 2015 populations.  
A comparison with UK employees is used as most of the 
Group’s senior management are based in the UK; all other 
Group staff are employed in Ukraine and Russia which have 
different economies from the UK driving their remuneration 
levels and practices. 
Relative importance of spend on pay
The table below show shareholder distributions (i.e. dividends 
and share buybacks) and total employee pay expenditure for 
the financial years ended 31 December 2014 and 31 December 
2015, along with the percentage change in both. 
Review of past performance 
The graphs opposite show the Company’s TSR performance 
compared to the performance of the FTSE All-Share and 
FTSE All-Share Oil & Gas Producers Index indices over a 
7-year and 10-year period. These indices have been chosen 
as suitable broad comparators against which the Company’s 
shareholders may judge their relative returns given that the 
Company is a member of the FTSE All-Share and continue to 
be part of the FTSE All-Share Oil & Gas Producers Index. 
The table opposite details the Chief Executive’s ‘single figure’ 
remuneration over a 7-year period. An investment of £100 
in the Company on 31 December 2008 was worth £15.42 at 
31 December 2015 (same investment on 31 December 2008 
was worth £6.79 at 31 December 2014). The calculation of 
the return assumes dividends are reinvested to purchase 
additional equity.

Directors’ Share Options
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Annual report
Where shareholders voted against the Annual Report on 
Remuneration, this was in part due to what the shareholders 
considered to be excessive reward for Executive Directors 
for unsatisfactory operational, financial and strategic 
management. In addition shareholders considered that the 
board was too large for the current circumstances of the 
Company and therefore total board remuneration was too high.
The entire Board was removed/resigned on 28 January 2016 
and a new Remuneration Committee is in the process of being 
appointed in order to review the arrangements in place.
The Board values, and encourages, direct feedback from 
shareholders.
Executive Directors’ shareholding requirements (audited)
In 2010, the Committee introduced executive share ownership 
guidelines of 100% of basic salary for Executive Directors 
which can be built up over a reasonable period of time from 
appointment. No specific value per share was designated for 
the calculation.

On 28 January 2016, following a General Meeting of the 
Company, the service contracts of above Executive Directors 
were terminated with immediate effect. Prior to the General 
Meeting, the Board in place at that time approved and made

Directors’ responsibilities
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are 
listed on pages 70 and 71, confirm that, to the best of their 
knowledge:
• the Group financial statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit of the Group; 
• the Directors’ report contained in the Annual Report 
includes a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Group, together with 
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that  
it faces;
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union, and the parent company financial statements 
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and 
applicable law). Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are  
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the Group and parent company financial statements 
respectively; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
Directors’ responsibilities statement
• the annual report and financial statements, taken as a 
whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
company’s performance, business model and strategy;
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; 
and
• he or she has taken all the steps that he or she ought to 
have taken as a Director in order to make himself or herself 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
By order of the Board
Capita Company Secretarial Services Limited
Company Secretary
18 March 2016
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements and the 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Directors’ report – other disclosures
Vladimir Tatarchuk and Vladimir Rusinov were appointed to the 
Board on 28 January 2016 and are deemed to have a beneficial 
interest in 34,288,253 ordinary shares and Convertible Bonds 
with principal amount of $3.4m, which are held by Proxima 
Capital Group. If fully converted, the convertible bonds held by 
Proxima would result in the issue of a maximum of 2,819,077, 
representing 1.64% of the issued share capital, based on 
the conversion price of 76.29 pence per ordinary share and a 
US$/GBP exchange rate of 1.5809. Further information on the 
terms and conditions of the Convertible Bonds is disclosed in 
Notes13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
There were no changes to the shareholders of the continuing 
Directors between the end of the financial year and the date of 
this Annual Report.
Details of Directors’ remuneration and share options are 
shown in the Remuneration Report on pages 84 to 99. No 
Director had a material interest in any significant contract, 
other than a service contract or contract for services, with the 
Company or any of its subsidiary companies at any time during 
the year.
The share capital structure is listed in Note 17 to the financial 
statements and the significant holdings are listed below. 
Directors’ indemnities 
As permitted by the Articles of Association, the Directors 
have the benefit of an indemnity which is a qualifying third 
party indemnity provision as defined by Section 234 of the 
Companies Act 2006. The indemnity was in force throughout 
the last financial year and is currently in force. The Company 
also purchased and maintained throughout the financial year 
Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance in respect of itself 
and its Directors.
Change of control (significant contracts)
The Company is not party to any significant agreements 
that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control 
following a takeover except for the $40m convertible bond dated 
19 February 2013, which could become repayable following a 
relevant change of control. There are no agreements between 
the Company and any Director or its employees that would 
provide compensation for loss of office or employment resulting 
from a change of control following a takeover bid, except that 
provisions of the Company’s share schemes may cause options 
and awards granted under such schemes to vest in those 
circumstances. All of the Company’s share schemes contain 
provisions relating to a change of control. Outstanding options 
and awards would normally vest and become exercisable for 
a limited period of time upon a change of control following a 
takeover, reconstruction or winding up of the Company (not 
being an internal reorganisation), subject at that time to rules 
concerning the satisfaction of any performance conditions. 
There are a number of other agreements that take effect, alter 
or terminate upon a change of control of the Company such as 
commercial contracts, finance agreements and property lease 
arrangements. None of these is considered to be significant in 
terms of their likely impact on the business of the Group as a 
whole.

Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Russia, Ukraine and Hungary – carrying value  
of oil and gas asset
Refer to page 81 (Audit Committee Report), page 123  
(critical accounting estimates and assumptions) and  
page 127 (Property, plant and equipment).
Oil and gas assets in Russia, Ukraine and Hungary total 
$192.4m after the recognition of a $51.1m impairment 
charge. These represent 98.9% of the Group’s total 
Property, plant and equipment. As well as the material 
nature of the balance, we focused on this area due to the 
further decline in oil and gas prices in 2015. In addition in 
Ukraine, the continuing poor political and economic 
situation has increased the yield on sovereign bonds,  
which is a proxy for risk free rate. 
These difficulties resulted in an impairment loss of 
$49.5m being booked by management on its Novo-
Nikolaevskoye Cash Generating Unit (“CGU”) and a 
further $1.5m loss on its Turkeve CGU in Hungary. In 
arriving at these impairment losses, and supporting the 
carrying value of other oil and gas assets, there are a 
number of complex and subjective judgements made by 
management including estimates of future commodity 
prices, production levels  
and capex requirements.
We evaluated the directors’ discounted cash flow forecasts which support the 
carrying value of the Russia, Ukraine and Hungary oil and gas assets. 
After considering internal and external factors, as well as preparing a ceiling 
test model, management concluded there were no impairment triggers in 
respect of the Russian CGU. 
We reviewed the factors in IAS 36 and reviewed the ceiling test model. One key 
assumption in the Russian cash flow forecast is the predicted change in the 
regulated gas price, which is set by the Russian Government. We reviewed the 
Ministry of Economics guidance, and considered wider macro-economic 
factors in Russia in determining that management’s gas pricing assumptions 
are within an expected range, and in the short term do not differ substantially 
from forecast inflation rates in Russia. 
Management’s production forecasts, another key assumption, were  
reconciled to the 31 December 2014 independent reserves report prepared by 
DeGolyer and MacNaughton (‘D&M’) adjusted for 2015 production and changes 
to internal modelling. Forecast production remains broadly in line with the 
D&M model.
We challenged management on the technical feasibility of planned workovers 
which are predicted to increase production from 2016, and we consider these 
assumptions to be reasonable. Other capital expenditure assumptions were 
assessed and found to be in accordance with our expectations. We also 
considered any potential impact from the current sanctions regime in place. 
The current regime does not impact the Group’s Russian operations. We were 
therefore able to conclude no impairment triggers exist in respect of the 
Russian CGU. 
In Ukraine, the key assumptions in management’s cash flow forecast relate to 
future sales prices and production. Management’s forecast oil and gas prices 
were benchmarked against a consensus forecast from leading analysts, and 
we also considered actual realised prices in 2015 when compared with the 
Brent price and European gas prices in determining management’s 
assumptions are within an expected range. 
Consistent with our approach to Russian assets, we reconciled forecast 
production to the D&M report, considering changes arising from 2015 
production and internal modelling. The forecast was deemed reasonable.
We discussed with management the recent suspension of the Group’s subsoil 
use permits, along with other independent producers in Ukraine. Management 
are still in the process of addressing concerns raised by the State Geology 
Service. The assumption that the permits will be retained is key to the 
impairment assessment, and management have acknowledged there remains 
some uncertainty regarding this in their Going Concern disclosure in Note 2. 
In Hungary, the key assumptions in the cash flow forecast relate to future  
sales prices and production forecasts. As with Ukraine, we benchmarked 
management’s forecast oil and gas prices against a consensus forecast from 
leading analysts. We found management’s forecasts to be within a reasonable 
range. Production forecasts were based on management’s internal modelling, 
so we considered consistency of these estimates with prior years. 
As no reserves are recognised in respect of Hungarian oil and gas assets, 
management have applied a risk weighting to the discounted cash flow model. 
This weighting is judgmental, however we note based on materiality a change in 
the risk weighting does not materially impact the analysis. 
For Russia, Ukraine and Hungary we assessed management’s discount rates, 
based on each CGU’s weighted average cost of capital, and found these to be 
within an acceptable range.
We also considered the adequacy of management’s disclosure of key 
judgements and sensitivities in relation to their impairment assessment in 
Note 5. These were deemed to be in line with the requirements of IFRSs.
Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of JKX Oil & Gas plc
Report on the Group financial 
statements 
Our opinion
In our opinion, JKX Oil & Gas plc’s group financial statements 
(the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2015 and of its loss and cash flows for the 
year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as 
adopted by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Emphasis of matter – Going concern
In forming our opinion on the financial statements, which is not 
modified, we have considered the adequacy of the disclosure 
made in note 2 to the financial statements concerning the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. A number of 
potential conditions exist that may impact this assumption:  
(i) gas and/or oil net realisations remain at current levels 
for the foreseeable future or deteriorate materially, (ii) the 
full $30.1 million obligation pursuant to the $40 million 
Convertible Bond becomes payable in February 2017, (iii) the 
Group becomes liable for additional Rental Fees in Ukraine 
as a result of unfavourable outcomes in one or more of the 
ongoing court proceedings, and (iv) the Group’s Ukrainian 
subsoil permits are suspended by the State Geology and 
Mineral Resources Survey of Ukraine. These conditions, along 
with the other matters explained in note 2 to the financial 
statements, indicate the existence of material uncertainties 
which may cast significant doubt about the group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not 
include the adjustments that would result if the group was 
unable to continue as a going concern.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report, 
comprise:
• the Consolidated income statement and Consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income for the year ended  
31 December 2015;
• the Consolidated statement of financial position as at  
31 December 2015;
• the Consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year 
then ended;
• the Consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then 
ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a 
summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere 
in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial 
statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial 
statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the financial statements is IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union, and applicable law.
Our audit approach
Overview
• Overall group materiality: $1.7m which represents 5% of 
five year average profit before tax adjusted for exceptional 
items, as defined in the accounting policies in Note 3.
• The group comprises 38 separate reporting units
• We identified three significant components, which were 
selected due to their size and risk characteristics. 
This enabled us to obtain coverage over 99% of Group 
consolidated revenue. We visited the components in Russia 
and Ukraine as part of our audit.
• Specific audit procedures were performed on certain 
balances and transactions at a further two reporting units.
• Russia, Ukraine and Hungary – carrying value of oil and gas 
assets.
• Going concern.
• Taxation in Ukraine - production taxes.
The	 scope	 of	 our	 audit	 and	 our	 areas	 of	 focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors 
made subjective judgements, for example in respect of 
significant accounting estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future events that are inherently 
uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the 
risk of management override of internal controls, including 
evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors 
that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest  
effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources 
and effort, are identified as ‘areas of focus’ in the table below. 
We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address 
these specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the 
financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make 
on the results of our procedures should be read in this context. 
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.  Financial statements

Materiality
Overall group materiality $1.7m (2014: $2.2m).
How we determined it
5% of five year average profit before tax adjusted for exceptional items as defined in the 
accounting policies in Note 3.
Rationale for benchmark applied
We did this to take account of the volatility that has impacted JKX Oil & Gas plc’s results 
and the nature of the exceptional items.
How	 we	 tailored	 the	 audit	 scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed 
enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic 
structure of the group, the accounting processes and controls, 
and the industry in which the group operates. 
The Group is structured along four operating segments being 
the Ukraine, Russia, Rest of World and the UK as set out in 
Note 4. The Group financial statements are a consolidation 
of 38 reporting units, comprising the Group’s operating 
businesses and centralised functions within these segments.
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we 
determined the type of work that needed to be performed at 
the reporting units by us, as the Group engagement team, or 
component auditors from other PwC network firms operating 
under our instruction. Where the work was performed by 
component auditors, we determined the level of involvement 
we needed to have in the audit work at those reporting 
units to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate 
audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on 
the Group financial statements as a whole.
Accordingly, of the Group’s 38 reporting units, we identified 
three which, in our view, required an audit of their complete 
financial information, either due to their size or their risk 
characteristics. Specific audit procedures on certain balances 
and transactions were performed at a further two reporting 
units. Because the Group includes a number of relatively small 
reporting units, this gave us coverage of 99% of consolidated 
revenue. This, together with additional procedures performed 
at the Group level, gave us the evidence we needed for our 
opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
Due to the analysis being prepared by management at Group 
level, the Group audit team performed the required audit 
procedures over impairment of oil and gas assets and going 
concern. 
We visited both of JKX Oil & Gas plc’s main operating locations 
in 2015, being Ukraine and Russia. This included meeting with 
local management and component auditors, as well as visiting 
JKX’s operations. This assisted with addressing significant 
audit risks including impairment of oil and gas assets and 
also enabled us to exercise oversight over the component 
auditors. In addition we attended the closing meetings, via 
teleconference, for both the Ukraine and Russian operations.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application 
of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for 
materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, 
helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, 
timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual 
financial statement line items and disclosures and in 
evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and 
on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined 
materiality for the financial statements as a whole as shown in 
the table below.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to 
them misstatements identified during our audit above $85,000 
(2014: $111,000) as well as misstatements below that amount 
that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going	 concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the 
directors’ statement, set out on page 78, in relation to going 
concern. We have nothing to report having performed our 
review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you 
if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to 
in relation to the directors’ statement about whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements and their identification of 
any material uncertainties. We have nothing material to add 
or to draw attention to other than the material uncertainty we 
have described in the emphasis of matter paragraph above. 
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have 
concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements. The going concern 
basis presumes that the group has adequate resources to 
remain in operation, and that the directors intend it to do so, 
for at least one year from the date the financial statements 
were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that 
the directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate, 
although because  of the factors outlined in the Emphasis 
of matter - Going concern above, a number of material 
uncertainties exist which may cast significant doubt about 
the use of the going concern assumption. However, because 
not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these 
statements are not a guarantee as to the group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Going concern
Refer to page 81 (Audit Committee Report) and page 116 
(Basis of Preparation).
The Group has a potential obligation of $30.1m which 
may become payable in February 2017 when convertible 
bondholders have the option to put the remaining bonds 
outstanding. During 2015, the political and economic 
situation in Ukraine continued to deteriorate, which 
impacted the Group’s profitability. This included the 
introduction of an emergency tax on gas production and 
a continuation of currency restrictions. While there have 
been some recent positive developments, including a 
reduction in the production tax rate on gas from 55% to 
29% from 1 January 2016, currency restrictions remain 
in place and the political and economic situation remains 
unpredictable. 
As discussed in the Area of Focus below, the Group is 
also subject to a number of challenges regarding 
production taxes (‘rental fees’) which could become 
payable in the foreseeable future if the Group is 
unsuccessful in the ongoing legal proceedings. 
The Group is also contending with a deterioration in 
international oil and gas markets which has impacted oil 
and gas realisations in 2015, as well as a recent 
suspension of its subsoil use permits in Ukraine pending 
rectification of several technical breaches of licence 
conditions. In arriving at their conclusion that the Group 
can continue as a going concern, the directors have 
made a number of judgmental assumptions about future 
cash flows.
We obtained management’s cash flow forecast which supports their use of the 
going concern basis of accounting. We tested the integrity of this model, 
including mathematical accuracy, and reviewed key assumptions such as 
forecast sales revenue and operating costs for consistency with impairment 
models (discussed above). Any differences were investigated. 
The key uncertainty in management’s going concern assessment concerns the 
ability of the Group to meet its expected $30.1m obligation in February 2017 in 
respect of outstanding convertible bonds which can be put on this date. 
Management are considering a range of options to mitigate this risk. 
Another key assumption is in relation to the ongoing disputes with the Ukraine 
tax authorities regarding non-payment of oil and gas rental fees (discussed 
below). Management have assumed no cash outflow in respect of these 
disputes and conversely no cash inflow is assumed from management’s claim 
against the Ukraine Government under the Energy Charter Treaty and bilateral 
investment treaties. This is a key judgment, and we sensitised the cash flow 
forecast to determine the impact if one or more of the disputed amounts 
became payable. 
We have challenged management on the likelihood of certain other downside 
sensitivities. These include continuing low oil and gas realisations, further 
deterioration in oil and gas realisations and reductions in forecast production 
due to well integrity issues. 
From our work performed, it is clear there are material uncertainties, which  
if realised, may affect the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, with 
the outcome over the next 18 months dependent on a number of external 
factors outside the Group’s control. We have therefore considered the 
adequacy of management’s disclosure of material uncertainties, included in 
Note 2. We concluded these are sufficient to inform the users of the financial 
statements about the risks facing the Group.
An Emphasis of Matter paragraph is included in our opinion to highlight these 
uncertainties. Our conclusion on going concern is below.
Taxation in Ukraine – production taxes
Refer to page 82 (Audit Committee Report) and page 147 
(Taxation).
The Group is subject to a number of challenges by the tax 
authorities in Ukraine concerning rental fees for periods 
from January to March 2007, April to December 2010 and 
January to December 2015. The total assessments as 
well as potential interest and penalties for these periods 
are disclosed in Note 27 and total $41m. The Group has 
recognised a $10.9m provision in the Annual Report in 
respect of the 2010 dispute. No provision has been 
recorded in respect of the 2007 and 2015 disputes on the 
basis management believe the risk of a cash outflow is 
not probable. However, the risk has been assessed as 
possible and thus a contingent liability has been 
disclosed. We have focused on this area due to the 
potential material impact on the financial statements and 
because the decision on whether to recognise a provision 
in the financial statements is judgmental.
We updated our understanding of events that have occurred during 2015 in 
relation to the ongoing disputes with the Ukraine tax authorities, as well as the 
international arbitration. This included discussions with the Group’s solicitors 
and legal experts in Ukraine. 
The Group received an Interim Award from the International Arbitration 
Tribunal in July 2015 directing Ukraine not to collect rental fees above the level 
of 28%, to remain in effect until the main hearing in July 2016. From our 
discussions with the Group’s solicitors and review of the key documents in the 
arbitration case, we consider the Group has a reasonable chance of success in 
the main arbitration hearing in July 2016. If the tribunal rules in favour of the 
Group, this will require enforcement in the Ukrainian courts, however we 
understand there is recourse under international law should Ukraine not 
accept the decisions of the tribunal. 
We therefore assessed the likelihood of cash outflows in relation to the 2007, 
2010 and 2015 disputes both on their own legal merits and also in the context of 
the international arbitration. 
We concur with management that the likelihood of a cash outflow in relation to 
the 2007 and 2015 disputes is possible, but not probable, and therefore 
disclosure of the contingent liabilities is sufficient. In relation to the 2010 
dispute, having lost the most recent case in the High Administrative Court in 
Ukraine, we consider the recognition of a provision to be appropriate.

you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit. We have no 
exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not made. We have no 
exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of

Responsibilities for the financial 
statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 103, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for 
Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for 
and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for 
no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept 
or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other 
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it 
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent 
in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by the directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the 
directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming 
our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the 
financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other 
auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to 
provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We 
obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of 
controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to 
identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the company financial 
statements of JKX Oil & Gas plc for the year ended  
31 December 2015. That report includes an emphasis of

and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency 
or liquidity of the group
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you 
if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in 
relation to:
Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of JKX Oil & Gas plc
• information in the Annual Report is:
– materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
– apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the  
group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
– otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report.
• the statement given by the directors on page 103, in accordance with provision C.1.1 of the  
UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’), that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to  
be fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for members to assess 
the group’s position and performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge of the group acquired in the course of performing our audit.
We have no exceptions to report.
• the section of the Annual Report on page 79 to 83, as required by provision C.3.8 of the Code, describing 
the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the 
Audit Committee.
We have no exceptions to report.
• the directors’ confirmation on page 43 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.1 of the 
Code, that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group, including 
those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
We have nothing material to add 
or to draw attention to.
• the disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed 
or mitigated.
We have nothing material to add 
or to draw attention to.
• the directors’ explanation on page 52 and 53 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.2  
of the Code, as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what period they have done 
so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to 
any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
Refer to our Emphasis of Matter - 
Going Concern above. We have 
nothing else material to add or to 
draw attention to.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the group and the directors’ statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the group. Our review was substantially less in scope 
than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that the 
statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the Code; and considering whether the statements are consistent with the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing our audit. We have nothing to report having performed our review. Financial statements

Adoption of new and revised standards
The disclosed policies have been applied consistently by the Group for both the current and previous financial year with the 
exception of the new standards adopted.
The EU IFRS financial information has been drawn up on the basis of accounting policies consistent with those applied in the 
financial statements for the year to 31 December 2014, except for the following: 
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011-2013 Cycle       
The application of the amendments has had no impact on the disclosures of the amounts recognized in the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements.
Below is a list of new and revised IFRSs that are not yet mandatorily effective (but allow early application) for the year ending  
31 December 2015: 
 Effective for annual periods  
 beginning on or after
• IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ (Amendments)  01-Jan-16
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010 – 2012 Cycle  01-Jan-16

3.	 SIGNIFICANT	 ACCOUNTING	 POLICIES
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the 
Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. All intragroup balances, transactions, income and expenses and 
profits or losses, including unrealised profits arising from intragroup transactions, have been eliminated on consolidation.
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when 
the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the 
Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. The consolidated financial statements include all the assets, 
liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows of the Companies and their subsidiaries after eliminating intragroup transactions 
as noted above. Uniform accounting policies are applied across the Group.
Interests in joint venture agreements
A joint arrangement is one in which two or more parties have joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of 
control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of 
the parties sharing control. Where the Group’s activities are conducted through joint operations, whereby the parties that have 
joint control of the arrangement have the rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement, the 
Group reports its interests in joint operations using proportionate consolidation – the Group’s share of the assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses of the joint operation are combined with the equivalent items in the consolidated financial statements on a 
line-by-line basis. 
A joint venture, which normally involves the establishment of a separate legal entity, is a contractual arrangement whereby 
the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have the rights to the arrangement’s net assets. The results, assets and 
liabilities of a joint venture are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
1.	 GENERAL	 INFORMATION
JKX Oil & Gas plc (the ultimate parent of the Group hereafter, ‘the Company’) is a public limited company listed on the London 
Stock Exchange which is domiciled and incorporated in England and Wales under the UK Companies Act. The registered number 
of the Company is 3050645. The registered office is 6 Cavendish Square, London, W1G 0PD and the principal place of business is 
disclosed in the introduction to the Annual Report. 
The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries, (the ‘Group’), are the exploration for, appraisal and development of 
oil and gas reserves. 
2.	 BASIS	 OF	 PREPARATION
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) 
as adopted by the European Union, IFRS Interpretations Committee (‘IFRS IC’) interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 
applicable for Companies reporting under IFRS and therefore the consolidated financial statements comply with Article 4 of the 
EU IAS Regulations. The Group’s financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified for 
derivative instruments held at fair value through profit or loss. The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group are set 
out below.
Going concern
The majority of the Group’s revenues, profits and cash flow from operations are currently derived from its oil and gas production 
in Ukraine, rather than Russia. 
Throughout 2015 the decline in international oil and gas prices has significantly lowered oil and gas net realisations from JKX’s 
Ukrainian operations. The prolonged period of low international oil and gas prices has continued in 2016, further adversely 
affecting the financial results of the Group, and will continue to do so if prices do not recover.
If all of the Bondholders exercise their put option in February 2017, the Company will have an obligation of $30.1 million 
(consisting of $26 million principal, $1 million interest and a redemption premium of $3.1 million), which will become payable at 
that time. If some or all of the Bondholders do not exercise this option and the Bonds expire at their full term in February 2018, 
an obligation of up to $31.1 million will become payable, the amount being dependent on the number of remaining Bonds that 
were not put in February 2017 (see Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements). 
The Company’s Ukrainian subsidiary, Poltava Petroleum Company (‘PPC’) has three contingent liabilities arising from separate 
court proceedings over the amount of production taxes (‘Rental Fees’) paid in Ukraine for certain periods since 2007, which in total 
amount to approximately $41 million (including interest and penalties, see Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements).  
The Board believes that these claims are without merit under Ukrainian law and will continue to contest them vigorously. 
Also in relation to Rental Fees, the Company continues to pursue a final award under its arbitration claim against Ukraine for the 
overpayment of more than $180 million of Rental Fees, in addition to damages to the business (see Note 27 to the consolidated 
financial statements). This international arbitration is expected to be heard in July 2016.
Following action initiated in late 2015, in January 2016, the State Geology and Mineral Resources Survey of Ukraine suspended 
four subsoil use permits owned by PPC, initially with effect from 1 February 2016, but then with an extension period until  
1 March 2016. The authority gave a list of actions that were required in order to avoid suspension (including a change to the 
minimum production requirements under the licences) and would normally have given the operator sufficient time to remedy the 
failings. Instead PPC were given only one month to do so. Through further discussion with the relevant authority, PPC has been 
given more time to comply and hearings regarding the status of the licenses are planned for March 2016, at which the Board and 
PPC is confident of a positive outcome. 
The Directors have concluded that it is necessary to draw attention to the potential impact of (i) gas and/or oil net realisations 
remaining at current levels for the foreseeable future or deteriorating materially (ii) the full $30.1 million obligation pursuant to 
the $40 million Convertible Bond becoming payable in full in February 2017 (iii) the Group becoming liable for additional Rental 
Fees in Ukraine as a result of unfavourable outcomes in one or more of the ongoing court proceedings and (iv) the Group’s 
Ukrainian subsoil permits being suspended by the State Geology and Mineral Resources Survey of Ukraine. It is unclear whether 
any or all of these risks will be realised but they are material uncertainties which may cast significant doubt about the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. 
However, based on the Group’s cash flow forecasts, the Directors believe that the combination of its current cash balances, 
expected future production and resulting net cash flows from operations, the implemented cost reductions as well as the 
availability of additional courses of action with respect to financing, mean that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing these financial statements. These financial statements do not include the adjustments 
that would result if the Group was unable to continue as a going concern. Financial statements

Other	 assets
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, over their estimated useful lives, using the 
straight-line method, for the following classes of assets:
Motor vehicles   – 4 years
Computer equipment – 3 years
Other equipment   – 5 to 10 years
The estimated useful lives of property plant and equipment and their residual values are reviewed on an annual basis and,  
if necessary, changes in useful lives are accounted for prospectively. Assets under construction are not subject to depreciation 
until the date on which the Group makes them available for use.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement for the relevant period.

The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the 
aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments 
issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
that meet the criteria for recognition under IFRS 3 (revised) are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date. In a 
business combination achieved in stages, the previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured at its acquisition 
date fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in the income statement. Acquisition costs are expensed. 
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is initially measured at cost being the excess of the cost of the business combination 
over the Group’s share in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. After 
initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill impairment reviews are 
undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Impairment 
losses on goodwill are not reversed. 
On disposal of a subsidiary or jointly arrangement, the attributable amount of unamortised goodwill, which has not been subject 
to impairment, is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 
Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, the Group reviews the 
carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that 
those assets have suffered an impairment loss. Individual assets are grouped together as a cash-generating unit for impairment 
assessment purposes at the lowest level at which their identifiable cash flows, that are largely independent of the cash flows of 
the other Groups assets, can be determined.
If any such indication of impairment exists the Group makes an estimate of its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. Where the carrying amount of an 
individual asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset/cash-generating unit is considered 
impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Fair value less costs of disposal is determined by discounting the post-
tax cash flows expected to be generated by the cash-generating unit, net of associated selling costs, and takes into account 
assumptions, market participants would use in estimating fair value. In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are adjusted for the risks specific to the asset/cash-generating unit and are discounted to their present value that reflects 
the current market indicators.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset/cash-generating unit is increased to the 
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years.  
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
JKX Employee Benefit Trust
The JKX Employee Benefit Trust was established in 2014 to hold ordinary shares purchased to satisfy various new share scheme 
awards made to the employees of the Company which will be transferred to the members of the scheme on their respective 
vesting dates subject to satisfying the performance conditions of each scheme. 
The trust has been consolidated in the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRS 10. The cost of shares temporarily 
held by the trusts are reflected as treasury shares and deducted from equity.
Where the Group transacts with its joint operations, unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s 
interest in the joint operation.
Foreign currencies
All amounts in these financial statements are presented in thousands of US dollars, unless otherwise stated. The presentation 
currency of the Group is the US Dollar based on the fact that the Group’s primary transactions originate in, or are dictated by, the 
US Dollar, these being, amongst others, oil sales and procurement of rigs and drilling services.
Each entity in the Group is measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates  
(‘the functional currency’). Foreign currency transactions are translated into functional currency using the exchange rates 
prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses 
resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
On consolidation of subsidiaries and joint operations with a non US Dollar presentation currency, their statements of financial 
position are translated into US Dollar at the closing rate and income and expenses at the average monthly rate. All resulting 
exchange differences arising in the period are recognised in other comprehensive income, and cumulatively in the Group’s 
translation reserve. Such translation differences are reclassified to profit or loss in the period in which any such foreign 
operation is disposed of.
Subsidiaries within the Group hold monetary intercompany balances for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to  
occur in the foreseeable future and thus this is considered to be part of the Group’s net investment in the relevant subsidiary.  
An exchange difference arises on translation in the company income statement which on consolidation is recognised in equity, 
only being recognised in the income statement on the disposal of the net investment.
The major exchange rates used for the revaluation of the closing statement of financial position at 31 December 2015 were 
$1:£0.67 (2014: $1:£0.6), $1:24 Hryvnia (2014: $1:15.77 Hryvnia), $1:72.88 Roubles (2014: $1:56.26 Roubles), $1:289.43 Hungarian 
Forint (2014: $1: 259.29 Hungarian Forint).
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition are treated as assets/liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at 
the closing rate.
Property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets
Property plant and equipment comprises the Group’s tangible oil and gas assets together with computer equipment, motor 
vehicles and other equipment and are carried at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Cost includes purchase price and construction costs for qualifying assets, together with borrowing costs where applicable, in 
accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. Depreciation of these assets commences when the assets are ready for their 
intended use.
Oil	 and	 gas	 assets
Exploration, evaluation and development expenditure is accounted for under the ‘successful efforts’ method. The successful 
efforts method means that only costs which relate directly to the discovery and development of specific oil and gas reserves are 
capitalised.
Exploration and evaluation costs are valued at costs less accumulated impairment losses and capitalised within intangible 
assets. Development expenditure on producing assets is accounted for in accordance with IAS 16, ‘Property, plant and 
equipment’. Costs incurred prior to obtaining legal rights to explore are expensed immediately to the income statement.
All lease and licence acquisition costs, geological and geophysical costs and other direct costs of exploration, evaluation and 
development are capitalised as intangible assets or property plant and equipment according to their nature. Intangible assets 
are not amortised and comprise costs relating to the exploration and evaluation of properties which the Directors consider to 
be unevaluated until reserves are appraised as commercial, at which time they are transferred to property plant and equipment 
following an impairment review and are depreciated accordingly. Where properties are appraised to have no commercial value, 
the associated costs are treated as an impairment loss in the period in which the determination is made.
Costs related to hydrocarbon production activities are depreciated on a field by field unit of production method based on 
commercial proved plus probable reserves of the production licence, except in the case of assets whose useful life differs from 
the lifetime of the field, which are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their anticipated useful life of up to 10 years.
The calculation of the ‘unit of production’ depreciation takes account of estimated future development costs and is based on 
current period end unescalated price levels. The ‘unit of production’ rate is set at the beginning of each accounting period. 
Changes in reserves and cost estimates are recognised prospectively.

Restricted	 cash
Restricted cash is disclosed separately on the face of the statement of financial position and denoted as restricted when it is not 
under the exclusive control of the Group.
Government	 treasury	 bills	
Government treasury bills are securities with maturity of up to 4 months issued by the National Bank of Ukraine with a fixed 
coupon rate. Treasury bills are recognised as “Held-to-maturity financial investments”.
Held-to-maturity	 financial	 investments
The government US$ treasury bills issued by the National Bank of Ukraine are non-derivative financial assets with fixed 
payments and fixed maturity that are intended to be held to maturity.
Held-to-maturity financial investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less 
impairment. Interest income and discounts and premiums on held-to-maturity securities are recognised as “Interest and 
similar income” in the consolidated income statement.
Trade	 and	 other	 payables
Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the 
effective interest rate method if the time value of money is significant.
Financial	 liabilities	 and	 equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered 
into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its 
liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Inventories
Inventory is comprised of produced oil and gas or certain materials and equipment that are acquired for future use. The oil and 
gas is valued at the lower of average production cost and net realisable value; the materials and equipment inventory is valued 
at purchase cost. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs plus attributable overheads based 
on a normal level of activity and other costs associated in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost 
is calculated using the weighted average method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated 
costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution and any provisions for obsolescence.
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the current tax payable and deferred tax.
The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. 
Tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity or in 
other comprehensive income, in which case the tax is also dealt with in equity or other comprehensive income respectively.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax base used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred 
tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition 
(other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the 
accounting profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, and interests 
in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Any such reduction shall 
be reversed to the extent that it becomes probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset 
realised based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset 
when there exists a legal and enforceable right to offset and they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority 
and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position when the Group 
becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Derivative	 financial	 instruments
The Group may use derivative financial instruments (derivatives) primarily to hedge its risks associated with oil price fluctuations 
relating to certain firm commitments and forecasted transactions. Any such derivatives are initially recorded at fair value on the 
date at which the contract is entered into and subsequently re-measured at fair value on subsequent reporting dates.
A financial asset or liability is derecognised when the obligation under the asset or liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. 
The purpose for which a derivative is used is established at inception. To qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative must be 
’highly effective’ in achieving its objective and this effectiveness must be documented at inception and throughout the period 
of the hedge relationship. The hedge must be assessed on an ongoing basis and determined to have been ’highly effective’ 
throughout the financial reporting periods for which the hedge was designated.
For the cash flow hedge, the portion of the gains and losses on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective 
hedge is taken to equity and the ineffective portion, as well as any change in time value, is recognised in the consolidated income 
statement. The gains and losses taken to equity are subsequently transferred to the consolidated income statement during the 
period in which the hedged transaction affects the consolidated income statement or if the hedge is subsequently deemed to  
be ineffective. 
Gains or losses on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment (either from inception or during the life of the 
instrument) are taken directly to the consolidated income statement in the period.
Convertible	 bonds	 due	 2018
The net proceeds received from the issue of convertible bonds at the date of issue have been split between two elements: the 
host debt instrument classified as a financial liability in Borrowings, and the embedded derivative. 
The fair value of the embedded derivative has been calculated first and the residual value is assigned to the host debt liability. 
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bonds and the fair value assigned to the embedded derivative, 
representing the value of the host debt instrument, is included as Borrowings and is not remeasured. The host debt component 
is then carried at amortised cost and the fair value of the embedded derivative is determined at inception and at each reporting 
date with the fair value changes being recognised in profit or loss.
Issue costs are apportioned between the host debt element (included in Borrowings) and the derivative component of the 
convertible bond based on their relative carrying amounts at the date of issue. 
The interest expense on the component included in Borrowings is calculated by applying the effective interest method, with 
interest recognised on an effective yield basis.
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a 
method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the 
financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Trade	 and	 other	 receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, reduced by 
any provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence 
that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due. Indicators of impairment would include financial difficulties of 
the debtor, likelihood of the debtor’s insolvency, default in payment or a significant deterioration in credit worthiness. Any 
impairment is recognised in the income statement within ‘Administrative expenses’.
Loans	 and	 receivables
Loans and receivables, comprising trade and other receivables, and cash and cash equivalents, are non-derivative financial 
instruments which have a fixed or easily determinable value. They are recognised at cost, less any provisions for impairment in 
their value.
Cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and current balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash. Cash equivalents are short-term with an original maturity of less than 3 months.

mechanism. Revenue from other services are recognised when the services have been performed. Revenue is measured at the 
fair value of the consideration received, excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax (“VAT”) and other sales taxes or duty.
Revenue resulting from the production of oil and natural gas from properties in which the Group has an interest with other 
producers is recognised on the basis of the Group’s working interest (entitlement method). Gains and losses on derivative 
contracts are reported on a net basis in the consolidated income statement. 
Interest income is recognised as the interest accrues, by reference to the net carrying amount at the effective interest rate 
applicable.
Share capital and treasury shares
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised 
as a deduction from share premium, net of any tax effects. When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount 
of the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, net of any tax effects, is recognised as a deduction from 
share premium. 
Repurchased JKX Oil & Gas plc shares are classified as treasury shares in shareholders’ equity and are presented in the 
reserve for own shares. The consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs is deducted from equity 
attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued. 
When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity, and the 
resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented in share premium. No gain or loss is recognised in the financial 
statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of treasury shares.
Leasing
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant 
lease. Under operating leases, the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor. The Group has no finance leases.
Dividends
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid to the Company’s shareholders. Final dividends are recognised when they 
are approved by shareholders. 
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items comprise items of income and expense, including tax items, that are material in amount and unlikely to recur 
and which merit separate disclosure in order to provide an understanding of the Group’s underlying financial performance. 
Examples of events giving rise to the disclosure of material items of income and expense as exceptional items include, but are 
not limited to, impairment events, disposals of operations or individual assets, litigation claims by or against the Group and the 
restructuring of components of the Group’s operations. See Note 5 for further details.
Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, 
seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a risk of causing material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
a)	 Recoverability	 of	 oil	 and	 gas	 assets	 and	 intangible	 oil	 and	 gas	 costs	 (Note	 5)
Costs capitalised as oil and gas assets in property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets are assessed for impairment 
when circumstances suggest that the carrying value may exceed its recoverable value. As part of this assessment, management 
has carried out an impairment test (ceiling test) on the oil and gas assets classified as property, plant and equipment. This test 
compares the carrying value of the assets at the reporting date with the expected discounted cash flows from each project. For 
the discounted cash flows to be calculated, management has used a production profile based on its best estimate of proven 
and probable reserves of the assets and a range of assumptions, including an internal oil and gas price profile benchmarked 
to mean analysts’ consensus and a discount rate which, taking into account other assumptions used in the calculation, 
management considers to be reflective of the risks. This assessment involves judgement as to (i) the likely commerciality of the 
asset, (ii) proven, probable and possible (‘3P’) reserves which are estimated using standard recognised evaluation techniques 
(iii) future revenues and estimated development costs pertaining to the asset, (iv) the discount rate to be applied for the purposes 
of deriving a recoverable value and (v) the value ascribed to contingent resources associated with the asset. 
b)	 Carrying	 value	 of	 intangible	 exploration	 and	 evaluation	 expenditure	 (Note	 5	 (b))
The amounts for intangible exploration and evaluation assets represent the costs of active exploration projects the 
commerciality of which is unevaluated until reserves can be appraised. Where a project is sufficiently advanced the 
recoverability of intangible exploration assets is assessed by comparing the carrying value to estimates of the present value 
of projects. The present values of intangible exploration assets are inherently judgemental. Exploration and evaluation costs 
will be written off to the income statement unless commercial reserves are established or the determination process is not 
completed and there are no indications of impairment. The outcome of ongoing exploration, and therefore whether the carrying 
value of exploration and evaluation assets will ultimately be recovered, is inherently uncertain.
Segmental reporting 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision 
Maker. The Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the 
operating segments, has been identified as the Executive and Non Executive Directors of the Group that make the strategic 
decisions. 
Share options
The group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans, under which the Company receives services 
from Executive Directors and Senior Management as consideration for equity instruments (options) of the group. The fair value 
of the services received from Executive Directors and Senior Management in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised 
as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted:
• including any market performance conditions; (for example, the Company’s share price);
• excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions (for example, profitability, sales growth 
targets and remaining an employee of the entity over a specified time period); and
• including the impact of any non-vesting conditions (for example, the requirement for employees to save).
Non-market performance and service conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected 
to vest. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting 
conditions are to be satisfied.
In addition, in some circumstances employees may provide services in advance of the grant date and therefore the grant date 
fair value is estimated for the purposes of recognising the expense during the period between service commencement period 
and grant date.
At the end of each reporting period, the group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on 
the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, 
with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
When the options are exercised, the company issues new shares or shares held by the JKX Employee Benefit Trust. The proceeds 
received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the group is 
treated as a capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair 
value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit 
to equity in the parent entity financial statements.
The social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of the share options is considered an integral part of the 
grant itself, and the change will be treated as a cash-settled transaction.
The rules regarding the scheme are described in the Remuneration Report on pages 84 to 99 and in Note 26 on share based 
payments.
Bonus scheme
The Group operates a bonus scheme for its Directors and employees. The scheme has three performance conditions: 1. financial 
objectives; 2. key strategic objectives and 3. safety performance conditions. The bonus payments are made annually, normally in 
January of each year and the costs are accrued in the period to which they relate.
Pension costs
The Group contributes to the individual pension scheme of the qualifying employees’ choice. Contributions are charged to the 
income statement as they become payable. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Decommissioning 
Provision is made for the cost of decommissioning assets at the time when the obligation to decommission arises. Such 
provision represents the estimated discounted liability for costs which are expected to be incurred in removing production 
facilities and site restoration at the end of the producing life of each field. A corresponding item of property plant and equipment 
is also created at an amount equal to the provision. This is subsequently depreciated as part of the capital costs of the 
production facilities. Any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure attributable to changes in the estimates of the 
cash flow or the current estimate of the discount rate used are reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the property plant 
and equipment. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
Revenue recognition
Sales of oil and gas products are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer and 
it can be reliably measured. This generally occurs when the product is physically transferred into a vessel, pipe or other delivery

4.	 SEGMENTAL	 ANALYSIS
c)	 Depreciation	 of	 oil	 and	 gas	 assets	 (Note	 5)
Oil and gas assets held in property, plant and equipment are mainly depreciated on a unit of production basis at a rate  
calculated by reference to proved plus probable reserves and incorporating the estimated future cost of developing and 
extracting those reserves. Future development costs are estimated using assumptions as to the numbers of wells required to 
produce those reserves, the cost of the wells, future production facilities and operating costs; together with assumptions on oil 
and gas realisations.
d)	 Taxation	 (Notes	 27	 and	 28)
Tax provisions are recognised when it is considered probable that there will be a future outflow of funds to the tax authorities. 
In this case, provision is made for the amount that is expected to be settled. The provision is updated at each reporting date 
by management by interpretation and application of known local tax laws with the assistance of established legal, tax and 
accounting advisors. These interpretations can change over time depending on precedent set and circumstances in addition new 
laws can come into effect which can conflict with others and, therefore, are subject to varying interpretations and changes which 
may be applied retrospectively. A change in estimate of the likelihood of a future outflow or in the expected amount to be settled 
would result in a charge or credit to income in the period in which the change occurs. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent it is considered probable that those assets will be recoverable. This 
involves an assessment of when those deferred tax assets are likely to reverse, and a judgement as to whether or not there will 
be sufficient taxable profits available to offset the tax assets when they do reverse. This requires assumptions regarding future 
profitability and is therefore inherently uncertain. To the extent assumptions regarding future profitability change, there can be 
an increase or decrease in the level of deferred tax assets recognised that can result in a charge or credit in the period in which 
the change occurs. 
Tax provisions are based on enacted or substantively enacted laws. To the extent that these change there would be a charge or 
credit to income both in the period of charge, which would include any impact on cumulative provisions, and in future periods. 
e)	 Derivatives	 (Note	 14)
Under the terms of the placing of the $40m of guaranteed unsubordinated convertible bonds (see Note 13), at the option of the 
Company, any conversion notice can be settled in cash rather than shares. The Cash Alternative Amount is based on the Volume 
Weighted Average Price of the Company’s shares prior to the conversion notice. In addition there are other terms and conditions 
attached to the bond which, together with the Cash Alternative Amount, are classified as a derivative financial instrument (see 
Note 14). This derivative financial instrument was measured at inception at its fair value and changes in its fair value through 
to the reporting date are recorded each period in the Consolidated income statement. The fair value is computed based on 
the conversion price of each bond as well as directly observable market information, including the Company’s share price and 
historic volatility. The assumptions used are only an estimate of how the Company’s future share price may change and the 
appropriate discount rate and are, therefore, subjective. Changes in these assumptions could materially impact the internally 
computed fair value of the derivative resulting in corresponding impact on income or loss in the Consolidated income statement.    
4.	 SEGMENTAL	 ANALYSIS
The Group has one single class of business, being the exploration for, evaluation, development and production of oil and gas 
reserves. Accordingly the reportable operating segments are determined by the geographical location of the assets.
There are four (2014: four) reportable operating segments which are based on the internal reports provided to the Chief 
Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’). Ukraine and Russia segments are involved with production and exploration; the ‘Rest 
of World’ are involved in exploration, development and production and the UK is the home of the head office and purchases 
material, capital assets and services on behalf of other segments. The ‘Rest of World’ segment comprises operations in 
Hungary and Slovakia. 
Transfer prices between segments are set on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. 
Segment revenue, segment expense and segment results include transfers between segments. Those transfers are eliminated 
on consolidation.
Segment results and assets include items directly attributable to the segment. Segment assets consist primarily of property, 
plant and equipment, inventories and receivables. Capital expenditures comprise additions to property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets.

During 2014, due to unexpected pressure building in the annulus of well-27 at our Koshekhablskoye field in Russia, the well was 
diverted to the flare pit and a coiled tubing unit was mobilised to kill the well. This operation was completed successfully. The 
cost of these well control operations was $3.5m which has been charged to the income statement in 2014.
Exceptional item – provision for impairment of oil and gas assets
During both 2014 and 2015 impairment triggers were noted in respect of our oil and gas assets in Ukraine, Russia and Hungary.  
Impairment tests were completed resulting in impairments of $51.1m (2014: $69.1m) comprised of $49.6m (2014: $12.8m) in respect 
of our Ukrainian oil and gas fields, nil (2014: $46.3m) in respect of our Russian gas field, $1.5m (2014: $3.7m) in respect of our 
Hungarian oil and gas fields and nil (2014: $6.3m) in respect of our Hungarian exploration and evaluation costs (see Note 5 (b)).
Full impairment disclosures for each of the impairment tests are made in Notes 5 (c), (d), (e) and (f).

Key assumptions – NNC and Elizavetovskoye 
The key assumptions used in the impairment testing were:
• Production profiles: these were based on the latest available information provided by independent reserve engineers, 
DeGolyer & MacNaughton, as at 31 December 2014 adjusted for 2015 production volumes and data and reassessed internally.  
Such information included 3P reserves for NNC and Elizavetovskoye (including the West Mashivske extension) of 28.4 MMboe 
and 5.0 MMboe, respectively. 
• Economic life of field: it was assumed that the title to the licences is retained and that the NNC licence term will be 
successfully extended beyond its current 2024 expiration date through to the economic life of the field (expected to be around 
2032). The economic life of the Elizavetovskoye field is currently expected to be around 2023.
• Gas prices: during 2015 Ukraine acquired the ability to purchase gas from Europe rather than being completely dependent 
on Russia for imports. As such, Ukrainian gas prices are expected to be more aligned with European gas prices in future 
but also influenced by Russian-Ukrainian border price and international oil prices. The gas price used for 2016 is based on 
current and forecast gas prices realised by PPC. For the following six years a forward gas price curve was used with gas 
prices increasing at 2.8% thereafter.
• Oil prices: the Company used a forward price curve for the next six years and an increase of 2.8% per annum thereafter. 
• Production taxes: the Company has assumed production tax rates of 29% for gas and 45% for oil which were introduced by 
the government on 1 January 2016. 
• Capital and operating costs: these were based on current operating and capital costs in Ukraine for both projects. Estimates 
were provided by third parties and supported by estimates from our own specialists, where necessary. 
• Post tax nominal discount rate of 20%. This was based on a Capital Asset Pricing Model analysis consistent with that used in 
previous impairment reviews
Based on the key assumptions set out above:
• the NNC’s oil and gas assets were impaired by $49.6m after significant erosion of the headroom from the prior year due to the 
increase in discount rate applied, the international oil and gas price decline and the new expectation that prices will remain 
lower for longer. 
• Elizavetovskoye’s recoverable amount (including the West Mashivske extension) exceeds its carrying value by $34.9m and 
therefore NNC’s oil and gas assets were not impaired. 
Any impairment is dependent on judgement used in determining the most appropriate basis for the assumptions and estimates 
made by management, particularly in relation to the key assumptions described above. Sensitivity analysis to likely and potential 
changes in key assumptions has therefore been provided below.
The impact on the impairment calculation of applying different assumptions to gas prices, production volumes, production tax 
rates, future capital expenditure and post-tax discount rates, all other inputs remaining equal, would be as follows:

5.	 (C)	 IMPAIRMENT	 TEST	 FOR	 PROPERTY,	 PLANT	 AND	 EQUIPMENT	
A review was undertaken at the reporting date of the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment to determine whether 
there was any indication of a trigger that may have led to these assets suffering an impairment loss. Following this review 
impairment triggers were noted in relation to the Ukrainian assets (see Note 5 (d)) and the Hungarian assets (see Note 5 (f)). 
In respect of Yuzhgazenergie LLC (‘YGE’) in Russia, impairment triggers were noted in 2014 and a full impairment review was 
completed, however no impairment triggers were noted in 2015 (see Note 5 (e)).
As there is no readily available market for the Group’s oil and gas properties, fair value is derived as the net present value of 
the estimated future cash flows arising from the continued use of the assets, incorporating assumptions that a typical market 
participant would take into account.
The value in use of an oil and gas property is generally lower than its Fair Value Less Costs of Disposal (‘FVLCD’) as value in 
use reflects only those cash flows expected to be derived from the asset in its current condition. FVLCD includes appraisal and 
development expenditure that a market participant would consider likely to enhance the productive capacity of an asset and 
optimise future cash flows. Consequently, the Group determines recoverable amount based on FVLCD using a Discounted Cash 
Flow (‘DCF’) methodology.  
The DCF was derived by estimating discounted after tax cash flows for each CGU based on estimates that a typical market 
participant would use in valuing such assets. 
The impairment tests compared the recoverable amount of the respective CGUs noted below to the respective carrying values 
of their associated assets. The estimates of FVLCD meet the definition of level three fair value measurements as they are 
determined from unobservable inputs. 
5.	 (D)	 IMPAIRMENT	 TEST	 FOR	 THE	 UKRAINIAN	 OIL	 AND	 GAS	 ASSETS	
2014
The Ukrainian government issued decrees in the second half of 2014 which directed major industrial gas buyers to acquire 
their gas solely from the Ukraine state-owned gas company from 1 December 2014 through to 28 February 2015 and increased 
the rate of gas production tax to 55% (from 28%), initially for 3 months but extended through to 31 December 2015. These 
factors, combined with the sharp decline in international oil prices and a 71% reduction in the assessed 3P reserves for the 
Elizavetovskoye field constituted an impairment trigger at 31 December 2014 and accordingly an impairment test was undertaken. 
2015
During 2015, the geopolitical situation in Ukraine, the economic impact of the devaluation of the Ukrainian Hryvnia and the 
uncertainty about the political, fiscal and economic outlook increased the Company’s post tax discount rate used in its DCF 
calculations for impairment testing on the Ukrainian assets. The post tax discount rate increased from 17.2% to 20.0%. 
Together with the continued decline in international oil and gas prices during 2015, these constituted an impairment trigger and 
accordingly an impairment test was undertaken. 
Poltava Petroleum Company (‘PPC’), a wholly owned subsidiary of JKX, holds 100% interest in five production licences 
(Ignatovskoye, Molchanovskoye, Rudenkovskoye, Novo-Nikolaevskoye, Elizavetovskoye) and one exploration licence 
(Zaplavskoye) in the Poltava region of Ukraine. 
The Ignatovskoye, Molchanovskoye, Rudenkovskoye, Novo-Nikolaevskoye production licences contain one or more distinct fields 
which, together with the Zaplavskoye exploration licence, form the Novo-Nikolaevskoye Complex (‘NNC’). 
The Elizavetovskoye production licence is located 45km from the Novo-Nikolaevskoye Complex and has its own gas production 
facilities. 
Ukrainian Cash Generating Units (‘CGUs’)
In respect of the Group’s Ukraine assets the NNC forms a single CGU as these contain oil and gas fields which are serviced by 
a single processing facility and do not have separately identifiable cash inflows. In addition they have commonality of facilities, 
personnel and services. 
The Elizavetovskoye licence also has its own separate processing facilities and separately identifiable cash flows and therefore 
is a distinct CGU for the purpose of the impairment test. During 2015 an extension to the Elizavetovskoye production licence was 
awarded to PPC which included the West Mashivske field. Due to the proximity of the West Mashivske field to the Elizavetovskoye 
plant, production will be tied back to the Elizavetovskoye processing facilities and therefore forms part of this CGU. 
In accordance with IAS 36, the impairment review was undertaken in US$ being the currency in which future cash flows from 
NNC and Elizavetovskoye will be generated.

2015 update
For purposes of testing for impairment of YGE’s non-current assets in 2015, the Company adopted a similar process to that  
used in previous periods. Having taken account of developments since the last test for impairment, based on the assessment of 
fair value less costs to sell, the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value by approximately US$4.3m (4.9 per cent)  
(2014: nil) and no impairment trigger has been noted. However it should be noted that the FVLCD estimate of the recoverable 
amount uses a DCF methodology which is highly sensitive to changes in the key assumptions of future Russian gas prices and 
related production taxes, both of which are under the direct control of the Russian government. Therefore Russian gas prices 
may not align with international gas prices.
As in previous estimates, from 1 July 2016 and annually thereafter, the Company has assumed gas prices increase by Rouble 
inflation of between 4.3% and 8.0% through to 2021, which reflect the Russian government’s current stated intentions for gas 
prices, and a 5.1% thereafter.  
5.	 (F)	 IMPAIRMENT	 TEST	 FOR	 HUNGARIAN	 OIL	 AND	 GAS	 ASSETS	
Hungarian property plant and equipment – Folyópart Energia Kft (‘FEN’) (previously HHE North Kft (‘HHN’))
The Company now holds a 100% interest in six development licences (Mining Plots) through its wholly owned Hungarian 
subsidiary, Folyópart Energia Kft. The Hajdunanas IV Mining Plot (‘HMP’) (previously Hernad I licence) contains two suspended 
wells which experienced an unexpected decline in production rates in 2013. 
Hungarian property, plant and equipment – Turkeve
Through its wholly owned Dutch subsidiary, JKX Hungary BV, the Company holds a 50% beneficial interest in part of the Turkeve 
IV Mining Plot of 10 sq. km (‘Turkeve’) surrounding the Ny-7 well which encountered gas.
Hungarian intangible assets: exploration and evaluation expenditure - Tiszavasvári-IV Mining Plot (previously 
Tiszavasvári-6)
The Tiszavasvári-IV Mining Plot contains the Tiszavasvári-6 discovery well (‘TZ-6’), which, due to the early stage of appraisal, is 
classified as an exploration and appraisal asset and recognised within intangible assets.
During 2014 and 2015, there was a sharp decline in international oil and gas prices. In 2015 this constituted an impairment 
trigger and accordingly an impairment test was undertaken. In 2014, the absence of a firm work programme at year end to 
develop the Hungarian reserves, and the reclassification of the estimated reserves at the Group’s Hungarian oil and gas fields to 
contingent resources also constituted an impairment trigger. 
Hungarian Cash Generating Units (‘CGUs’)
HMP forms a single CGU as it holds the two suspended oil and gas wells which are serviced by a single processing facility and 
which do not have separately identifiable cash inflows. In addition they have commonality of facilities, personnel and services. 
The development of the Turkeve Ny-7 field and the TZ-6 discovery require their own distinct processing facilities. Once these 
discoveries are developed, they will have separately identifiable cash flows and therefore are two separate CGUs for the 
impairment test of the Hungarian oil and gas assets. 
In accordance with IAS 36, the impairment reviews for the Hungarian assets have been undertaken in US$ being the currency in 
which future cash flows from HMP, Turkeve and TZ-6 will be generated.
5.	 (E)	 IMPAIRMENT	 TEST	 FOR	 YUZHGAZENERGIE	 LLC	 (‘YGE’),	 RUSSIA	 –	 2014	 DISCLOSURES	
Following the 2007 acquisition of YGE in Russia, a technical and environmental re-evaluation of YGE’s Koshekhablskoye gas field 
redevelopment was undertaken by the Group. The re-evaluation resulted in a revised development plan and production profile. 
The development plan and production profile have continued to be refined since that time. 
For purposes of testing for impairment triggers of YGE’s non-current assets, the Company took account of developments since 
the last test for impairment in 2013, based on the assessment of FVLCD. 
In previous estimates, the Company assumed net-back convergence with European gas prices occurring in 2023, which was in 
line with the Russian government’s stated intention, after applying to increase gas sector tariffs annually by 10% to achieve this. 
The domestic gas market in Russia deteriorated significantly during 2014 and the prospects for a significant improvement in the 
domestic gas market in the near term have receded rapidly. 
The economic recession in Russia, the devaluation of the Rouble, the sharp decline in international oil prices and the declining 
gas demand in Europe and Russia have conspired to create a short term gas oversupply within Russia and a cessation of any 
political appetite for achieving net-back parity with European gas prices. 
This revision to our estimate of the future increases in Russian gas prices constituted an impairment trigger. Accordingly an 
impairment test was undertaken. 
In accordance with IAS 36, the impairment review was undertaken in Russian Roubles.
Key Assumptions – YGE – 2014 disclosures
The key assumptions used in the impairment testing were:
• Production profiles: these were based on the latest available information provided by independent reserve engineers, 
DeGolyer & MacNaughton, at 31 December 2014. Such information included 3P reserves for YGE of 68.3 MMboe.
• Economic life of field: it was assumed that YGE will be successful in extending the licence term beyond its current 2026 
expiration to the economic life of the field (expected to be around 2047). The discounted cash flow methodology used has 
not taken account of any opportunities that may exist to extract reserves in a shorter timeframe by investing to increase the 
current plant capacity.
• Gas prices: for 2015 these were based on the gas sales agreement that the Company had negotiated with Kubangazifikatziya 
for the forecast gas production in 2015. The gas price is expected to remain at the same level through to 1 July 2016. 
• Gas prices: from 1 July 2016 and annually thereafter, the gas prices have been increased by Rouble inflation of between 4.3% 
and 8.0% through to 2021, and 5.1% thereafter. 
• Gas prices: historically, gas prices in the Adygea Region are higher than the average gas price across all regions in Russia as 
a result of the vast transportation distances from Russia’s main producing regions. The Company has assumed that Adygean 
gas prices will remain higher than the average price across Russia.
• Capital and operating costs: these were based on current operating and capital costs in Russia, project estimates provided by 
third parties and supported by estimates from our own specialists, where necessary.
• Post tax nominal Rouble discount rate of 15.2%. This was based on a Capital Asset Pricing Model analysis consistent with that 
used in previous impairment reviews.
Based on the key assumptions set out above YGE was impaired by $46.3m. The main driver of the impairment has been the 
revision to the expected increase in Adygean gas prices.
Any impairment is dependent on judgement used in determining the most appropriate basis for the assumptions and estimates 
made by management, particularly in relation to the key assumptions described above. Sensitivity analysis to likely and potential 
changes in key assumptions has therefore been provided below.
The impact on the impairment calculation of applying different assumptions to gas prices, production, future capital expenditure 
and post-tax discount rates, all other inputs remaining equal, would be as follows:

As of 31 December 2015, there were no trade receivables which were impaired (2014: nil). At this date there were no trade 
receivables past due (2014: nil). 
There is no difference between the carrying value of trade and other receivables and their fair value.

Key Assumptions 2015 – HMP, Turkeve and TZ-6 
The key assumptions used in the impairment testing in 2015 were:
• Production profiles: these were based on the latest available information provided by our reserve engineers which included 
contingent resources of 0.6 MMboe for HMP, 0.1 MMboe (net to JKX) for Turkeve and 3.7 MMboe for TZ-6.
• Oil and gas prices: these were based on current prices being realised and short term price curves derived from expectations 
in the Hungarian oil and gas market.
• Capital and operating costs: these were based on project estimates provided by third parties and the partner and operator of 
our Hungarian assets.
The post tax discount rate of 10% was applied. This was based on a Capital Asset Pricing Model analysis for our Hungarian 
assets. 
Accordingly the impairment review is dependent on judgement used in determining the most appropriate basis for the 
assumptions and estimates made by management, particularly in relation to the key assumptions described above. Sensitivity 
analysis to likely and potential changes in key assumptions has therefore been provided below.
Based on the key assumptions set out above:
• HMP recoverable amount exceeds its carrying value by $1.3m and therefore the oil and gas assets related to HMP were not 
impaired;
• Turkeve was impaired by $1.5m after significant erosion of the headroom from the prior year due to international oil and gas 
price decline, the new expectation that prices are to remain lower for longer and the reduction in contingent resources from 
0.3 MMboe to 0.1 MMboe due to a reassessment of field development options; and
• TZ-6 recoverable amount exceeds its carrying value by $1.0m and therefore oil and gas assets relating to TZ-6 were not 
impaired.
In respect of the 2015 impairment review, the impact on the impairment calculation of applying different assumptions to 
production, oil and gas prices and future capital and operating costs, all other inputs remaining equal, would be as follows:

The Bonds have an annual coupon of 8 per cent per annum payable semi-annually in arrears. The Bonds are convertible into 
ordinary shares of the Company at any time from 1 April 2013 up until seven days prior to their maturity on 19 February 2018 at a 
conversion price of 76.29 pence per Ordinary Share, unless the Company settles the conversion notice by paying the Bondholder 
the Cash Alternative Amount (see below). 
Interest, after the deduction of issue costs and the inclusion of the redemption premium, will be charged to the income 
statement using an effective rate of 18.0%.
Cash	 Alternative	 Amount
At the option of the Company, the conversion notice in respect of the Bonds can be settled in cash rather than shares, the Cash 
Alternative Amount payable is based on the Volume Weighted Average Price of the Company’s shares prior to the conversion 
notice.
Credit	 facility
On 31 March 2011, Poltava Petroleum Company (‘PPC’), our subsidiary in Ukraine, entered into a reducing credit facility 
agreement with Crédit Agricole CIB (France) secured by indemnity provided by the parent company, JKX Oil & Gas plc. The 
credit facility was for a maximum of Ukrainian Hryvnia equivalent of $15.0m. The facility was renewed on 27 June 2014 and 
was available until 30 June 2015 with the maximum facility reducing to $10.0m and $5.0m on 30 April 2015 and 30 May 2015 
respectively. All provisions contained in the credit facility documentation were negotiated on normal commercial and customary 
terms for such finance arrangements. The interest was calculated at prevailing Crédit Agricole CIB (France) bank rate plus a 
margin.
The credit facility with Crédit Agricole CIB (France) lapsed on 30 June 2015.

them and continuing to evaluate their creditworthiness after transactions have been initiated. Where appropriate, the use of 
prepayment for product sales limits the exposure to credit risk. There is no difference between the carrying amount of trade and 
other receivables and the maximum credit risk exposure. 
The maximum financial exposure due to credit risk on the Group’s financial assets, representing the sum of cash and cash 
equivalents, trade receivables, held to maturity financial investments and other current assets, as at 31 December 2015 was 
$34.6m  (2014: $32.8m).
Capital	 management	 –	 Group
The Directors determine the appropriate capital structure of the Group specifically, how much is raised from shareholders 
(equity) and how much is borrowed from financial institutions (debt) in order to finance the Group’s business strategy. 
The Group’s policy as to the level of equity capital and reserves is to ensure that it maintains a strong financial position and low 
gearing ratio which provides financial flexibility to continue as a going concern and to maximise shareholder value. The capital 
structure of the Group consists of shareholders’ equity together with net debt. The Group’s funding requirements are met 
through a combination of debt, equity and operational cash flow.
Net debt
Net debt comprises: borrowings disclosed in Note 13 and total cash in Note 10 and excludes derivatives. Equity attributable to 
the shareholders of the Company comprises issued capital, other reserves and retained earnings (see Consolidated statement 
of changes in equity). 
The capital structure of the Group is as follows:
2015 
$000
2014 
$000
Current liabilities (Note 13) (10,856) (5,590)
Convertible bonds due 2018 – Non-current liability (Note 13) (23,494) (30,837)
Total cash (Note 10) 26,255 25,943
Government treasury bills (Note 11) – 2,700
Net debt (8,095) (7,784)
Total shareholders’ equity 174,266 281,348
Following the issue of $40m of convertible bonds in February 2013, the primary capital risk to the Group is the level of 
indebtedness. The convertible bond includes a financial covenant which limits the Group’s indebtedness (excluding the bonds 
themselves and the $15.0m Credit Agricole facility) in respect of any new borrowings (in addition to the bond amount) to three 
times 12-month free cash flow based on the most recently published consolidated financial statements. During the year the 
Group has complied with this financial covenant.
Liquidity risk – Group
The treasury function is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management under policies approved by the Board 
of Directors. Liquidity needs are monitored using regular forecasting of operational cash flows and financing commitments. 
The Group maintains a mixture of cash and cash equivalents and committed facilities in order to ensure sufficient funding for 
business requirements.
Significant restrictions
Cash and short-term deposits held in Ukraine are subject to local exchange control regulations. These regulations provide for 
restrictions on exporting capital from Ukraine (see Note 37). 
Cash and short term deposits included within the consolidated financial statements to which these restrictions apply is $6.1m 
(2014: $0.5m).
Temporary capital controls established by the National Bank of Ukraine (‘NBU’) on 1 December 2014 remain in place in an 
attempt by the Ukrainian government to safeguard the economy and protect foreign exchange reserves in the short term.
On 4 March 2015 a number of new NBU Resolutions were implemented with immediate effect (NBU No. 160 dated 3 March 2015; 
Resolution of the NBU No. 161 dated 3 March 2015; Resolution of the NBU No. 154 dated 2 March 2015). 
The Resolutions extended the currency control restrictions implemented in Ukraine on 1 December 2014 and introduced 
additional measures which have the impact of restricting the remittance of funds to foreign investors under certain conditions 
and bans the transfer of Hryvnia to purchase Ukrainian Government bonds.

2015 relate entirely to the convertible bonds due 2018.
Fair value hierarchy
Derivatives
At the year end the Group’s derivative financial instrument related to various embedded derivatives within the convertible bonds 
due 2018 (Note 14). The value of the derivative was calculated at inception, using the Monte Carlo simulation methodology, and at 
the reporting date using the Black-Scholes formula, discounted cash flow methodology, the Company’s historic share price and 
volatility, treasury rates and other estimations. As it was derived from inputs that are not from observable market data it was 
been grouped into Level 3 within the fair value measurement hierarchy. 
The main assumptions used in valuation of the derivative conversion option as at 31 December 2015 were:
• underlying share price of: £0.2725 (31 December 2014: £0.120);
• £/US$ spot rate of 1.4736 (31 December 2014: £1/$1.5577);
• historic volatility of 45.0% (31 December 2014: 70.7%);
• discount rate of 8.2% (31 December 2014: 8.2%)
• risk free rate based on 2.14 years (31 December 2014: 3.14 years) US Treasury rate of 0.932% (31 December 2014: 0.897%). 
A 10% increase/decrease in Company’s historic share price volatility would have resulted in an increase in the fair value loss for 
the year of $0.3m (31 December 2014: reduction in the fair value gain of $0.3m) and a decrease in the fair value loss of $0.1m  
(31 December 2014: increase in the fair value gain of $0.2m) respectively, assuming that all other variables remain constant.
A 3% increase/decrease in the discount rate would have resulted in an increase in the fair value loss for the year of $0.6m and a 
decrease in the fair value loss of $0.7m respectively, assuming that all other variables remain constant.
Held-to-maturity	 financial	 investments
Held-to-maturity securities were grouped into Level 1 as market prices were available at the reporting date for the treasury bills 
from the National Bank of Ukraine benchmark.
Credit	 risk	 –	 Group
The Group has policies in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with appropriate credit worthiness. 
The Group limits credit risk by assessing creditworthiness of potential counterparties before entering into transactions with

2014 fixed rate financial assets comprised Ukrainian government US$ treasury bills which matured on 7 January 2015 (Note 10) 
and 11 February 2015 (Note 11).
Interest rate sensitivity – Group
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates on our short term deposits at the 
reporting date. 
If interest rates had been 1 per cent higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s loss after tax and net 
assets for the year ended 31 December 2015 would increase/decrease by $52,000 (2014: $51,000). 1 per cent is the sensitivity 
rate used as it best represents management’s assessment of the possible change in interest rates that could apply to the Group.
Foreign currency exposures – Group
The table below shows the extent to which the Group has monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than the functional 
currency of the operating company involved. These exposures give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the 
income statement. 
As at 31 December the asset/(liability) foreign currency exposures were:

Bulgarian Leva 90 11
Russian Roubles 5 33
Canadian Dollar 1 29
Total net 3,379 (977)
Foreign currency sensitivity – Group
The Group is mainly exposed to the currency fluctuations of Ukraine (Hryvnia), Russia (Rouble) and UK (Sterling). The sensitivity 
analysis principally arises on money market deposits and working capital items held at the reporting date.
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10 per cent increase and decrease in the US Dollar against Sterling and  
30 per cent against Hryvnia and Rouble, all other variables were held constant. Due to the significant foreign currency fluctuation 
in Ukraine and Russia 30 per cent has been used to calculate sensitivity for Hryvnia and Rouble. 30 per cent and 10 per cent 
are the sensitivity rates that best represents management’s assessment of the possible change in the foreign exchange rates 
affecting the Group. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit and equity when the US Dollar weakens against the 
relevant currency. For a strengthening of the US Dollar against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite 
impact on the profit and other equity, and the balances below would be negative.

Commodity risk and sensitivity – Group 
The Group’s earnings are exposed to the effect of fluctuations in oil, gas and condensate prices and the risks relating to 
their fluctuation in are discussed on page 46, together with the discussion of financial risk factors. The Group’s oil, gas and 
condensate is sold to local trading companies through market related contracts. 
The Group is a price taker and does not enter into commodity hedge agreements unless required for borrowing purposes which 
may occur from time to time. Therefore no sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the exposure to oil, gas or condensate 
prices for outstanding monetary items at the 31 December 2015 as there is no impact on any outstanding amounts.
15.	 FINANCIAL	 INSTRUMENTS	 (continued)
The restrictions were initially effective until 3 June 2015 but have subsequently been extended until 8 June 2016.
The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of non-derivative financial liabilities. The tables 
include both interest and principal cash flows on an undiscounted basis. To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the 
undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at the reporting date.
The maturity analysis for Convertible bonds due 2018 is based on the earliest Put dates for the relevant portions of the Bonds 
(see Note 13) of 19 February 2016 and 2017. None of the Bonds were put on 19 February 2015.

Interest rate risk profile of financial assets and liabilities – Group
At 31 December 2014, the Group was exposed to interest rate risk principally in relation to the balance outstanding on the credit 
facility with Crédit Agricole CIB (France) where interest is calculated at prevailing Crédit Agricole CIB (France) bank rate plus a 
margin, however there were no balances outstanding on this facility. The facility lapsed on 30 June 2015.
Fixed rate interest is charged on the Group’s convertible bond (see Note 13). The interest rate profile of the other financial assets

Ukrainian production based taxes (‘Rental Fees’) 10,854 –
Exceptional production based taxes  
The provision, which has been recognised as a charge in the 2015 Consolidated income statement, is in respect of a claim 
against PPC for additional Rental Fees for the period from August to December 2010. The claim is being contested in the 
Ukrainian courts (see Note 27). The amount is denominated in Ukrainian Hryvnia (‘UAH’) and is stated above at its US$-
equivalent amount using the 2015 year end rate of UAH24.0/$. The provision is based on the total value of the claim plus interest 
and penalties. The Board believes that the claim is without merit under Ukrainian law and the Company will continue to contest 
it vigorously.

The provision in respect of Ukraine represents the present value of the well and site restoration costs that are expected to be 
incurred up to 2034 (2014: 2034). The Russia provision results from the decommissioning of 12 wells (2014:12) and removal of 
plant as required by the license obligation. Decommissioning is due to take place from 2016 to 2048 (2014: 2015 to 2048). The 
provisions are made using the Group’s internal estimates that management believe form a reasonable basis for the expected 
future costs of decommissioning.

16.	 JKX	 EMPLOYEE	 BENEFIT	 TRUST
In 2013, JKX Employee Benefit Trust was established and acquired 5,000,000 of shares in JKX Oil & Gas plc at a cost of $4.0m 
for the purpose of making awards under the Group’s employee share schemes and these shares have been classified in the 
statement of financial position as treasury shares within equity. 
None of these shares were used in 2015 (2014: nil) to settle share options, therefore at the year end JKX Employee Benefit Trust 
held 5,000,000 shares in JKX Oil & Gas plc (2014: 5,000,000).

Merger reserve was created on 30 May 1995 when JKX Oil & Gas plc acquired the issued share capital of JP Kenny Exploration & 
Production Limited for the issue of ordinary shares and represents the difference between the fair value of consideration given 
for the shares and the nominal value of those instruments.
Capital redemption reserve relates to the buy-back of shares in 2002, there have been no additional share buy-backs since this 
time.
Foreign currency translation reserve includes movements that relate to the retranslation of the subsidiaries whose functional 
currencies are not the US Dollar.
During 2015, the Russian Rouble (‘RR’) devalued by approximately 23% (2014: 72%) from RR56.26/$ to RR72.88/$ (2014: RR32.72/$ 
to RR56.26). A significant portion of the currency translation differences of US$26.3m (2014: US$130.2m) included in the

Company. In December 2015 the Supreme Court overturned the Appeal Court ruling and therefore the Company is required 
to settle the appropriate portion of the legal expenses incurred by the two shareholders during the process. The amount

The current tax charged in the year of $4.8m relates to Ukrainian corporation tax and foreign exchange losses on local prepaid tax 
which has arisen in the Group subsidiary, Poltava Petroleum Company. Taxes charged on production of hydrocarbons in Ukraine 
and Hungary are included in cost of sales (Note 20). The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 21% to 20% with 
effect from 1 April 2015. Accordingly, the Company’s profits for this accounting year are taxed at an effective rate of 20.25%.

For the share options outstanding as at 31 December 2015, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 8.3 years  
(2014: 8.5 years).
During the year share options were granted in accordance with the Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’), which was introduced in 
2010. In addition, in 2014, share options were granted in accordance with the Discretionary Share Option Scheme (‘DSOS’). These 
schemes reflect the best practice aspects recommended by the Association of British Insurers following the publication of their 
guidelines in March 2001 (the ‘ABI Guidelines’). 
Lapsing of Directors share options in 2016
On 28 January 2016, following a General Meeting of the Company, the service contracts of the four Executive Directors were 
terminated with immediate effect. Prior to the General Meeting, the Board in place at that time approved and made payments of 
£460,800 to forfeit 9,460,000 unexpired share options, which are included in the table above, and shares deferred under the 2014 
bonus arrangements for Executive Directors (see page 98).
2014 Share Option Schemes
DSOS
The DSOS is made up of two parts. Options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company granted under Part A are ‘Approved 
Options’ and options to acquire Shares granted under Part B of the DSOS are ‘Unapproved Options’. No consideration shall be 
payable for the grant of an Option.
No options were granted under the DSOS in 2015 (2014: 3,162,900). The weighted average exercise price of options granted under 
DSOS is nil (2014: 59.75p). For these options to vest there has to be an increase in the Group’s Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’) growth 
over the performance period measured over the 3 consecutive calendar years commencing from the date the options were 
granted. The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year under the DSOS was nil per option (2014: 24.01p).
PSP
PSP are granted to Executive Directors and senior management. Executive Directors and senior management receive awards 
under the 2010 Performance Share Plan in the form of nil cost options. No consideration is required to be paid for the grant or 
exercise of an Option.
3,845,900 (2014: 1,811,800) options were granted under PSP in 2015. The PSP options provide a conditional right to acquire 
shares at nil cost subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions and continued employment with the Group. For these 
options to vest a comparison is performed between the Group’s TSR against the FTSE Fledgling index (half the options) (2014: 
FTSE SmallCap index)and the All-Share Oil & Gas Producers index (other half of options). The weighted average fair value of 
options granted during the year under the PSP was 10.35p per option (2014: 26.00p).
Fair	 value	 of	 share	 options	 granted
The fair value of options granted under the DSOS is estimated as at the date of grant using a variance of the Binomial model, 
taking into account terms and conditions upon which the options are granted, which includes the performance condition related 
to the Company’s earnings per share directly. No dividends are paid on shares under the scheme prior to exercise.
The fair value of options granted under the PSP is estimated as at the date of grant using a variant of the Monte Carlo model, 
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options are granted, which includes the performance condition 
related to the TSR directly. No dividends are paid on shares under the scheme prior to exercise.
The total share based payment charge for the year was $0.7m (2014: $0.3m).
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the options granted in the years ended 31 December 2015 and  
31 December 2014. The expected future volatility has been determined by reference to the historical volatility.

• January – March 2007: approximately $6 million (including $3 million of interest and penalties). The statutory term for the 
tax authorities to claim payments in respect of the 2007 financial year has lapsed however in February 2013 PPC lost a legal 
challenge to the legitimacy of these payments. In July 2013, PPC appealed the decision to the Kharkov Court of Appeal. PPC 
won this case on the basis of a 1,095 day statute of limitation for collection having passed under Ukrainian legislation. The 
Poltava tax office then filed an appeal in the High Administrative Court of Ukraine. At a hearing on 24 February 2016, the High 
Administration Court of Ukraine ruled in favour of PPC although the tax authorities may choose to appeal to the Supreme 
Court of Ukraine. No provision has been made in respect of this claim.
• August – December 2010: approximately $10.9 million (including $4 million of interest and penalties). On 11 March 2014 PPC 
won the case in the Poltava Court. The tax office appealed and the Kharkov Court of Appeal reversed the earlier decision. 
PPC then filed an appeal in the High Administrative Court of Ukraine. This hearing commenced on 3 February 2016 but was 
deferred until 2 March 2016 when the court ruled against PPC. The Board intends to continue to pursue a successful decision 
in this case.
• January – December 2015: approximately $24 million (including $9 million of interest and penalties). Following the 
commencement of international arbitration proceedings at the beginning of 2015 (see above), from July 2015 PPC reverted to 
paying a 28% Rental Fee for gas production (instead of the revised official rate of 55%) as a result of the awards granted under 
the arbitration. PPC also declared part of its Rental Fee payments at 55% for the first 6 months of 2015 as overpayments 
and consequently stopped paying the Rental Fee for gas in order to align the total payments made in 2015 with the 28% 
rate awarded made under the arbitration proceedings. The Ukrainian tax authorities have issued PPC with claims for the 
difference between 28% and 55% for the first, second and third quarters of 2015 and we anticipate receiving a claim for the 
fourth quarter shortly. 
As part of these proceedings, property, plant and equipment that cost UAH158m (approximately $6.6m at the period end rate of 
UAH24.0/$1) was required to be pledged as security against the non-settlement of any claims that may arise in the event that the 
Ukrainian authorities are successful. The net book value of the property, plant and equipment is $22.0m based on the historical 
exchange rates at the dates of acquisition which were between UAH5/$1 and UAH8/$1. 
A provision for $10.9m has been made in respect of the claim for the period from August-December 2010 (see Note 19).  
No provision has been made for the possible future liabilities that may result from the tax uncertainties in respect of the claims 
for periods from January-March 2007 and from January-December 2015. 
No adjustment has been made to recognise any possible future benefit to the Company that may result from the international 
arbitration proceedings.

A deferred tax liability of $14.3m (2014: $21.9m) arises in respect of PPC’s activities and $0.6m (2014: $3.3m) in respect of YGE’s 
activities.
No deferred tax asset (2014: $nil) has been recognised in respect of brought forward UK losses. A deferred tax asset has of 
$2.2m been recognised in respect of Yuzhgaznergie LLC (2014: nil) in respect of Russian tax losses as sufficient future taxable 
profits are forecast against which these losses can be utilised before they expire. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the 
extent it is considered probable that those assets will be recoverable. This involves an assessment of when those deferred tax 
assets are likely to reverse, and a judgement as to whether or not there will be sufficient taxable profits available to offset the 
tax assets when they do reverse. This requires assumptions regarding future profitability and is therefore inherently uncertain. 
To the extent assumptions regarding future profitability change, there can be an increase or decrease in the level of deferred tax 
assets recognised which can result in a charge or credit in the year in which the change occurs.
27.	 TAXATION	 (continued)
Factors	 that	 may	 affect	 future	 tax	 charges
A significant proportion of the Group’s income will be generated overseas. Profits made overseas will not be able to be offset by 
costs elsewhere in the Group. This could lead to a higher than expected tax rate for the Group.
The UK corporation tax rate changes announced in the July 2015 Budget include reductions to the main rate of UK corporation 
tax to 19% in 2017. The March 2016 Budget included a reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 17% in 2020, which 
has not been substantively enacted. The impact of the rate reduction is not expected to have a material impact on provided and 
unprovided UK current or deferred taxation. 
The corporation tax rate in Ukraine for 2015 was 18% (2014: 18%).
Taxation in Ukraine – production taxes
Since Poltava Petroleum Company’s (‘PPC’s’) inception in 1994 the Company has operated in a regime where conflicting laws 
have existed, including in relation to effective taxes on oil and gas production. 
In order to avoid any confusion over the level of taxes due, in 1994, PPC entered into a licence agreement with the Ukrainian State 
Committee on Geology and the Utilisation of Mineral Resources (‘the Licence Agreement’) which set out expressly in the Licence 
Agreement that PPC would pay royalties on production at a rate of only 5.5% even in the event that existing tax rates were 
amended or new taxes introduced so as to adversely affect the economic benefit to be derived by PPC or the Company. 
Pursuant to the Licence Agreement, PPC was granted an exploration licence and four 20-year production licences, each in 
respect of a particular field. In 2004, PPC’s production licences were renewed and extended until 2024. New licence agreements 
were also signed to reflect this change and PPC’s operations continued as before. 
The Company and PPC have continued to invest in Ukraine on the basis that PPC would pay royalties on production at a rate of 
only 5.5%. 
In December 1994, a new fee on the production of gas (known as a ‘Rental Payment’ or ‘Rental Fee’) was introduced in Ukrainian 
law. On 30 December 1995, PPC was issued a letter by the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Finance and the State Committee 
for the Oil and Gas Industry (‘the Exemption Letter’), which established a zero rent payment rate for oil and natural gas produced 
in Ukraine by PPC. Based on the Exemption Letter PPC did not expect to pay any Rental Fees.
Rental Fees paid since 2011
In 2011, new laws were enacted which established new mechanisms for the determination of the Rental Fee. Notwithstanding 
the Exemption Letter, in January 2011 PPC began to pay the Rental Fee in order to avoid further issues with the Ukrainian 
authorities but without prejudice to its right to challenge the validity of the demands. 
Since 2011, the Rental Fees paid by PPC have amounted to more than $180m. These charges have been recorded in cost of sales 
in each of the accounting periods to which they relate.
International arbitration proceedings 
In 2015, the Company and its wholly-owned Ukrainian and Dutch subsidiaries commenced arbitration proceedings against 
Ukraine under the Energy Charter Treaty, the bilateral investment treaties between Ukraine and the United Kingdom and the 
Netherlands, respectively. In these proceedings, the Company is seeking a repayment of more than $180m in Rental Fees that 
PPC has paid on production of oil and gas in Ukraine since 2011, in addition to damages to the business.
During 2015 Rental Fees in Ukraine were increased to 55% and capital control restrictions were introduced. On 14 January 2015, 
an Emergency Arbitrator issued an award ordering Ukraine to cease imposing Rental Fees in excess of 28% on gas produced by 
PPC, pending the outcome of the application to a full tribunal for the Interim Award. On 23 July 2015 an international arbitration 
tribunal issued an Interim Award requiring the Government of Ukraine to limit the collection of Rental Fees on gas produced by 
PPC to a rate of 28%. 
The Interim Award was to remain in effect until final judgement is rendered on the main arbitration case, which is expected to be 
heard in July 2016.
Rental Fee demands 
The Group currently has three claims for additional Rental Fees being contested through the Ukrainian court process.  
These arise from disputes over the amount of Rental Fees paid by PPC for certain periods since 2007, which in total amount 
to approximately $41 million (including interest and penalties and translated at the 2015 year end rate of UAH24.0/$), as noted 
below. All amounts are being claimed in Ukrainian Hryvnia (‘UAH’) and are stated below at their US$-equivalent amounts using 
the 2015 year end rate of UAH24.0/$. The Board believes that these claims are without merit under Ukrainian law and the 
Company will continue to contest them vigorously.

In accordance with IAS 33 (Earnings per share) the effects of antidilutive potential have not been included when calculating 
dilutive loss per share for the year end 31 December 2015 (2014: nil). 29,849,048 (2014: 33,165,609) potentially dilutive ordinary 
shares associated with the convertible bonds (Note 13) have been excluded as they are antidilutive in 2015, however they could be 
dilutive in future periods.
There were 12,740,100 (2014: 10,854,700) outstanding share options at 31 December 2015, of which 7,141,100 (2014: 3,637,200) had

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the unprovided deferred taxation items because it is not probable 
that future taxable profit will be available to utilise these deductible temporary differences.
29.	 LOSS	 PER	 SHARE
The calculation of the basic and diluted loss per share attributable to the owners of the parent is based on the weighted average 
number of shares in issue during the year of 172,125,916 (2014: 172,125,916) and the loss for the relevant year. 
Loss before exceptional item in 2015 of $25,772,141 (2014 loss: $21,959,036) is calculated from the 2015 loss of $81,463,000  
(2014: $79,531,000) and adding back exceptional items of $64,896,496 (2014: 72,532,964) less the related deferred tax on the 
exceptional items of $9,205,637 (2014: $14,961,000).
The diluted earnings per share for the year is based on 172,125,916 (2014: 172,125,916) ordinary shares calculated as follows:

35.	 BUSINESS	 COMBINATIONS
On 20 November 2014, the Group acquired the remaining 50% of the share capital of HHE North Kft (‘HHN’), a Hungarian 
registered company in exchange for 25% of share in Sarkad Licence. Following the acquisition the Hungarian company changed 
its name to Folyópart Energia Kft (‘FEN’). The Group owns100% of the equity share capital of FEN. 
The following table summarises the consideration paid for HHN, the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed at the 
acquisition date.

Purchase consideration at 20 November:
Fair value of 25% interest in the Sarkad licence 4,626
Purchase consideration to be settled in cash 272
Cash acquired (721)
Fair value of existing interest at acquisition date 4,178
Total purchase consideration 8,355
Recognised amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed:

Fair value of existing 50% working interest

4,178
Gain on stepped acquisition recognised 222

  The fair value of existing working interest is calculated based upon the consideration for the outstanding ordinary shares excluding amounts attributed to the acquisition of 
non-controlling interests.
As a result of the acquisition, the 50% previously held equity interest in HHN was required to be re-measured at fair value as at 
the acquisition date (IFRS 3), resulting in a gain of $0.2m. This gain has been included within the net gain arising from business 
combinations line in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Acquisition-related costs of $0.4m have been charged to administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement for the 
year ended 31 December 2014.
No revenue contributed by HHN has been included in the consolidated income statement since 20 November 2014. HHN also 
contributed a loss of $0.9m over the same period. Had HHN been consolidated from 1 January 2014, the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income would have included revenue of $0.01m and a loss of $1.9m.
36.	 JOINT	 ARRANGEMENTS
HHN was set up for the purpose of holding the Hernad I and Hernad II Licences. On 20 November 2014 the Company increased 
its holding in HHN from 50% to 100% (see Note 35) taking full control and therefore HHN has been consolidated from that date.
The following amounts represent that share of the revenue and expenses of HHN to the period ending 20 November 2014:

The transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation. 
Amounts owed by and to joint ventures are disclosed in Note 36.
Key management personnel are considered to comprise only the Directors. The remuneration of Directors during the year was

 Restated from prior year to replace the value of the bonus in respect of 2014, which was paid in cash in January 2016 at $0.552m. In the prior year financial statements 
$0.819m  had been included in the above amount which reflected the value of the 2014 bonus at the time, which was expected to be deferred into shares. 
Further information about the remuneration of individual Directors, together with the Directors’ interests in the share capital  
of JKX Oil & Gas plc, is provided in the audited part of the Remuneration Report on pages 84 to 99 and in the Directors Report on 
pages 101 and 102.
Share-based payments represents the expenses arising from share-based payments included in the income statement, 
determined based on the fair value of the related awards at the date of grant (Note 26).
Subsidiary undertakings and joint operations
The Company’s principal subsidiary undertakings including the name, country of incorporation and proportion of ownership 
interest for each are disclosed in Note B to the Company’s separate financial statements which follow these consolidated 
financial statements. Transactions between subsidiaries and between the Company and its subsidiaries are eliminated on 
consolidation. Folyópart Energia Kft (previously HHE North Kft), a Hungarian registered company, is the only entity where the 
Group recognised its share of assets and liabilities up to the point of acquisition on 20 November 2014; refer to Note 36 for 
further details.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the members of JKX Oil & Gas plc
Report on the company financial 
statements
Our opinion
In our opinion, JKX Oil & Gas plc’s company financial 
statements (the ‘financial statements’):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2015;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006.
Emphasis of matter – Going concern
In forming our opinion on the financial statements, which is  
not modified, we have considered the adequacy of the 
disclosure made in Note A to the financial statements 
concerning the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
A number of potential conditions exist that may impact 
this assumption: (i) gas and/or oil net realisations remain 
at current levels for the foreseeable future or deteriorate 
materially (ii) the full $30.1 million obligation pursuant to the 
$40 million Convertible Bond becomes payable in February 
2017 (iii) the Group becomes liable for additional Rental Fees 
in Ukraine as a result of unfavourable outcomes in one or 
more of the ongoing court proceedings and (iv) the Group’s 
Ukrainian subsoil permits are suspended by the State Geology 
and Mineral Resources Survey of Ukraine. These conditions, 
along with the other matters explained in Note A to the 
financial statements, indicate the existence of a material 
uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the 
company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial 
statements do not include the adjustments that would result if 
the company was unable to continue as a going concern.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report, 
comprise:
• the Company statement of financial position as at  
31 December 2015;
• the Company statement of changes in equity for the year 
then ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a 
summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere 
in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial 
statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial 
statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
the preparation of the financial statements is United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced 
Disclosure Framework”, and applicable law (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

37.	 EVENTS	 AFTER	 THE	 REPORTING	 DATE
JKX Board replaced 
On 28 January 2016, Cynthia Dubin, Dipesh Shah, Richard Murray and Alastair Ferguson resigned as directors of the Company, 
Nigel Moore, Paul Davies, Peter Dixon, Martin Miller and Lord Oxford were removed as directors at a General Meeting on the 
same day. At the same meeting Paul Ostling, Tom Reed, Russell Hoare, Vladimir Rusinov and Vladimir Tatarchuk were appointed 
as directors of the Company.
The resignation of all independent Non Executive Directors meant that, since that date, the composition of the Board has not 
complied with UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’) in respect of the number of independent Non Executive Directors. The 
Company is in the final phase of appointing two new independent Non Executive Directors.
Board severance payments
Prior to the General Meeting on 28 January 2016, the previous board approved and paid themselves $2.2 million of severance 
costs and additional remuneration. In addition the Company incurred $0.3 million of related social security costs.
National Bank of Ukraine (‘NBU’) strengthens its currency control restrictions
Temporary capital controls established by the NBU on 1 December 2014 remain in place in an attempt by the Ukrainian 
government to safeguard the economy and protect foreign exchange reserves in the short term (see Note 15).
On 5 March 2016, these restrictions were extended until 8 June 2016.
Further award of production licences in Hungary
In January 2016,  the Company’s wholly owned Hungarian subsidiary, Folyópart Energia Kft (previously HHE North Kft), was 
granted a further three 35-year production licences (mining plots) covering an additional area of approximately 124 sq km within 
its original Hernad I & II exploration licence areas.  Financial statements

Responsibilities for the financial 
statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 103, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for 
Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for 
and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for 
no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept 
or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other 
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it 
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent 
in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & 
Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient 
to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are 
free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by the directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the 
directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming 
our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the 
financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other 
auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to 
provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We 
obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of 
controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to 
identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Notes to the Company financial statements
A.	 PRESENTATION	 OF	 THE	 FINANCIAL	 STATEMENTS
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101, ‘Reduced Disclosure 
Framework’ (FRS 101). The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified for 
financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through income statement, and in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
Please refer to Director’s report on page 100 for information on Company’s domicile, legal form, country of incorporation, 
description of the nature of the entity’s operations and business activities.
Going concern
The majority of the Group’s revenues, profits and cash flow from operations are currently derived from its oil and gas production 
in Ukraine, rather than Russia. 
Throughout 2015 the decline in international oil and gas prices has significantly lowered oil and gas net realisations from JKX’s 
Ukrainian operations. The prolonged period of low international oil and gas prices has continued in 2016, further adversely 
affecting the financial results of the Group.
The Company may have an obligation of $30.1 million (consisting of $26 million principal, $1 million interest and a  
redemption premium of $3.1 million) which may become payable pursuant to its $40 million Convertible Bond in February 2017, 
if Bondholders exercise their put option at that time, or $31.1 million in February 2018 if the Bond expires at its full term  
(see Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements). 
The Company’s Ukrainian subsidiary, Poltava Petroleum Company (‘PPC’) has three contingent liabilities arising from separate 
court proceedings over the amount of production taxes (‘Rental Fees’) paid in Ukraine for certain periods since 2007, which in total 
amount to approximately $41 million (including interest and penalties, see Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements).  
The Board believes that these claims are without merit under Ukrainian law and will continue to contest them vigorously. 
In addition, the Company continues to pursue a final award under its arbitration claim against Ukraine for the overpayment 
of more than $180 million of Rental Fees, in addition to damages to the business (see Note 27 to the consolidated financial 
statements). This international arbitration is expected to be heard in July 2016.
Following action initiated in late 2015, in January 2016, the State Geology and Mineral Resources Survey of Ukraine suspended 
four subsoil use permits owned by PPC, initially with effect from 1 February 2016, but then with an extension period until  
1 March 2016. The authority gave a list of actions that were required in order to avoid suspension (including a change to the 
minimum production requirements under the licences) and would normally have given the operator sufficient time to remedy the 
failings. Instead PPC were given only one month to do so. Through further discussion with the relevant authority, PPC has been 
given more time to comply and hearings regarding the status of the licenses are planned for March 2016, at which the Board and 
PPC is confident of a positive outcome. 
The Directors have concluded that it is necessary to draw attention to the material uncertainties relating to the risks that (i) gas 
and/or oil net realisations remain at current levels for the foreseeable future or deteriorate materially (ii) the full $30.1 million 
obligation pursuant to the $40 million Convertible Bond becomes payable in February 2017 (iii) the Group becomes liable for 
additional Rental Fees in Ukraine as a result of unfavourable outcomes in one or more of the ongoing court proceedings and 
(iv) the Group’s Ukrainian subsoil permits are suspended by the State Geology and Mineral Resources Survey of Ukraine. It is 
unclear whether any or all of these risks will be realised. These specific risks, which represent material uncertainties, may cast 
significant doubt about the Group’s ability to meet its obligations as they fall due and continue as a going concern. 
However the Directors believe that there is a reasonable basis to mitigate the effects of such eventualities through further 
operational and cash management measures and other restructuring and/or refinancing options which are currently being 
assessed.
Based on the Group’s cash flow forecasts, the Directors believe that the combination of its current cash balances, expected 
future production and resulting net cash flows from operations, the implemented cost reductions as well as the availability of 
additional courses of action should the need arise, mean that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing these financial statements. These financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result 
if the Company was unable to continue as a going concern.
Transition to FRS 101
The Company is preparing its financial statements in accordance with FRS 101 for the first time and has consequently applied 
the provisions of IFRS 1 – First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, where applicable. There are no 
differences to previously reported results arising from GAAP change.

When the options are exercised, the Company issues new shares or shares held by the JKX Employee Benefit Trust. The 
proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share 
premium.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the group is 
treated as a capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair 
value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit 
to equity in the parent entity financial statements.
The social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of the share options is considered an integral part of the 
grant itself, and the change will be treated as a cash-settled transaction.
The rules regarding the scheme are described in the Remuneration Report on pages 84 to 99 and in Note I on share based 
payments.
Share capital and treasury shares
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised 
as a deduction from share premium, net of any tax effects. When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount 
of the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, net of any tax effects, is recognised as a deduction from 
share premium. 
Repurchased JKX Oil & Gas plc shares are classified as treasury shares in shareholders’ equity and are presented in the 
reserve for own shares. The consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs is deducted from equity 
attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued. 
When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity, and the 
resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented in share premium. No gain or loss is recognised in the financial 
statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of treasury shares.
JKX Employee Benefit Trust
The JKX Employee Benefit Trust was established in 2014 to hold ordinary shares purchased to satisfy various new share scheme 
awards made to the employees of the Company which will be transferred to the members of the scheme on their respective 
vesting dates subject to satisfying the performance conditions of each scheme. 
The trust has been consolidated in the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRS 10. The cost of shares temporarily 
held by the trusts are reflected as treasury shares and deducted from equity.
Leasing
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
relevant lease. Under operating leases, the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor. The Company has no 
finance leases.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes party to 
the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Derivative	 financial	 instruments
The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in line with IFRS 7 – ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ and IAS 39 
– ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement’.
Any such derivative was initially recorded at fair value on the date at which the contract was entered into and subsequently re-
measured at fair value on subsequent reporting dates.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Fair value is the amount for which a financial asset, liability or instrument could be exchanged between knowledgeable and 
willing parties in an arm’s length transaction. It is determined by reference to quoted market prices adjusted for estimated 
transaction costs that would be incurred in an actual transaction, or by the use of established estimation techniques such as 
option pricing models and estimated discounted values of cash flows.
Convertible	 bonds	 due	 2018
The fair value of the embedded derivative associated with the convertible bond has been calculated at inception and changes in 
the fair value at each reporting date are recognised in the income statement.
Notes to the Company financial statements
A.	 PRESENTATION	 OF	 THE	 FINANCIAL	 STATEMENTS	 (continued)
The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101:
• Presentation of statement of cash flows;
• The requirements of IFRS 7 ‘Financial instruments’: Disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information regarding risks 
arising from all financial instruments held by the Company. Equivalent disclosures are included in the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements;
• The requirement of IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ to disclose the valuation techniques and inputs used to develop fair 
value measurements for assets and liabilities held at fair value. Equivalent disclosures are included in the Group consolidated 
financial statements;
• Disclosure of related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group. Equivalent disclosures are 
included in the Group consolidated financial statements;
• Disclosure of information relating to new standards not yet effective and not yet applied;
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historic purchase cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes the original 
purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. 
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment, less their residual values, over their expected 
useful lives using the straight line basis as follows:
Fixtures and fittings      –  five to ten years 
Computer equipment and software    –  three years
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments are initially measured at historic cost, including transaction costs, and stated at cost less accumulated impairment 
losses. The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable. If any such indication of impairment exists, the Company makes 
an estimate of its recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, the 
investment is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the statement of 
financial position date, with a corresponding charge or credit to the income statement. Non-monetary items are measured in 
terms of historical cost in foreign currency and are translated using the exchange rates of the original transaction.
The presentation and functional currency of the Company is the US Dollar. The US$/£ exchange rate used for the revaluation of 
the closing statement of financial position at 31 December 2015 was $1/£0.67 (2014: $1/£0.6).
Share based payments
The Company operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans, under which the Company receives 
services from Executive Directors and Senior Management as consideration for equity instruments (options) of the Company. 
The fair value of the services received from Executive Directors and Senior Management in exchange for the grant of the options 
is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted:
• including any market performance conditions; (for example, the Company’s share price);
• excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions (for example, profitability, sales growth 
targets and remaining an employee of the entity over a specified time period); and
• including the impact of any non-vesting conditions (for example, the requirement for employees to save).
Non-market performance and service conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected 
to vest. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting 
conditions are to be satisfied.
In addition, in some circumstances employees may provide services in advance of the grant date and therefore the grant date 
fair value is estimated for the purposes of recognising the expense during the period between service commencement period 
and grant date.
At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest 
based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income 
statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. Financial statements

historic volatility. The assumptions used are only an estimate of how the Company’s future share price may change and are, 
therefore, subjective. Changes in these assumptions could materially impact the internally computed fair value of the derivative 
resulting in corresponding impact on income or loss for the year.

A.	 PRESENTATION	 OF	 THE	 FINANCIAL	 STATEMENTS	 (continued)
Cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and current balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash. Cash is short-term with an original maturity of less than 3 months, highly liquid investments 
that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Restricted	 cash
Restricted cash is disclosed separately in the notes and denoted as restricted when it is not under the exclusive control of the 
Company.
Financial	 liabilities	 and	 equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered 
into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its 
liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Dividends
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid to the Company’s shareholders. Final dividends are recognised when they 
are approved by shareholders.
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the current tax payable and deferred tax.
The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. Company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. 
Tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity or in 
other comprehensive income, in which case the tax is also dealt with in equity or other comprehensive income respectively.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax base used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred 
tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition 
(other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the 
accounting profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, and interests in 
joint ventures, except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Any such reduction shall 
be reversed to the extent that it becomes probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset 
realised based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset 
when there exists a legal and enforceable right to offset and they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority 
and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
The Company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, 
seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a risk of causing material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets 
a)	 Derivatives	 (Note	 F)
Under the terms of the placing of the $40m of guaranteed unsubordinated convertible bonds (see Note F), at the option of the 
Company, any conversion notice can be settled in cash rather than shares. The Cash Alternative Amount is based on the Volume 
Weighted Average Price of the Company’s shares prior to the conversion notice. In addition there are other terms and conditions 
attached to the bond which, together with the Cash Alternative Amount, are classified as a derivative financial instrument (see 
Note F). This derivative financial instrument was measured at inception at its fair value and changes in its fair value through 
to the reporting date are recorded each period in the Consolidated income statement. The fair value is computed based on 
the conversion price of each bond as well as directly observable market information, including the Company’s share price and

Factors that affect the total tax charge
The total tax charge for the year of $nil (2014: nil) is higher (2014: higher) than the average rate of UK corporation tax of 20.25% 
(2014: 21.5%). The differences are explained below:

Tax losses 3,486 –

Other temporary differences 112 60
3,605 63
Neither the deductible temporary differences nor the tax losses expire under current tax legislation. Deferred tax assets have 
not been recognised in respect of the unprovided deferred taxation items because it is not probable that future taxable profit will 
be available to utilise these deductible temporary differences.
The UK corporation tax rate changes announced in the July 2015 Budget include reductions to the main rate of UK corporation 
tax to 19% in 2017. The March 2016 Budget included a reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 17% in 2020, which 
has not been substantively enacted. The impact of the rate reduction is not expected to have a material impact on provided and 
unprovided UK current or deferred taxation.

$45.6m (2014: $46.5m) owed by subsidiary undertakings are unsecured, bears interest based on LIBOR plus a mark-up and 
repayable on demand. Although amounts owed by group undertakings are due on demand, it is management’s intention that 
the amounts will not be demanded in less than one year. $217.6m (2014: $322.0m) owed by subsidiary undertakings bears no 
interest as these loans were classified as quasi-equity. 
During the year the Company increased provision for impairment by $103.7m (recognised in 2014: $129.2m) related to 
intercompany loan receivables from various subsidiaries, of which, nil (2014: $11.1m) and $103.7m (2014: $118.1m) relate to 
amounts falling due within one year and after more than one year respectively. Following recent impairments to some of the 
assets held by subsidiaries (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements), the Company expects that the carrying value 
of the intercompany loan receivable may not be recoverable as these entities may not generate sufficient future profits from the 
impaired assets to settle the amounts owing and accordingly, these amounts have been provided for.

Non-current derivative financial instruments 
Convertible bonds due 2018 – embedded derivatives
On 19 February 2013 the Company successfully completed the placing of $40m of guaranteed unsubordinated convertible 
bonds with institutional investors which are due 2018 raising cash of $37.2m net of issue costs. The Company’s wholly-owned 
direct subsidiary, JKX Oil & Gas (Jersey) Limited holds the bonds raised to finance the JKX Group. The Company unconditionally 
guaranteed all the performance conditions including the conversion option.
The Bonds have an annual coupon of 8 per cent per annum payable semi-annually in arrears. The Bonds are convertible into 
ordinary shares of the Company at any time from 1 April 2013 up until seven days prior to their maturity on 19 February 2018 at a 
conversion price of 76.29 pence per Ordinary Share, unless the Company settles the conversion notice by paying the Bondholder 
the Cash Alternative Amount (see below). 
Interest, after the deduction of issue costs and the inclusion of the redemption premium, will be charged to the income 
statement using an effective rate of 18.0%.
Cash	 Alternative	 Amount
At the option of the Company, the conversion notice in respect of the Bonds can be settled in cash rather than shares, the Cash 
Alternative Amount payable is based on the Volume Weighted Average Price of the Company’s shares prior to the conversion 
notice.
Coupon	 Makewhole
Upon conversion of a Bond prior to the 19 February 2015 the Company is required to pay an amount of interest equal to the 
aggregate interest which would have been payable on the principal amount of the Bond if such Bond had been outstanding until 
19 February 2015.
Bondholder	 Put	 Option
Bondholders have the right to require the Company to redeem the following number of Bonds on the following dates together 
with accrued and unpaid interest to (but excluding) such dates:

I.	 SHARE-BASED	 PAYMENTS
Share options 
Share options are granted to Executive Directors and senior management based on performance criteria. The scheme rules are 
described in the Directors’ Remuneration Report and repeated below. All share-based payments are equity settled.
At 31 December 2015, there were outstanding options under various employee share option schemes, exercisable during the 
years 2016 to 2025 (2014: 2015 to 2024), to acquire 12,740,100 (2014: 10,854,700) shares of the Company at prices ranging from 
£0.00 to £3.15 per share (2014: £0.00 to £3.15). The vesting period for 12,740,100 (2014: 10,854,700) of the share options is 3 years, 
with an exercise period of 7 years making a 10 year maximum term. 
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices (‘WAEP’) of, and movements in, share options 
during the year.

Outstanding at 31 December 12,740,100 28.39p 10,854,700 45.75p
Exercisable at 31 December – – 158,000 151.50p
For the share options outstanding as at 31 December 2015, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 8.3 years  
(2014: 8.5 years).
During the year share options were granted in accordance with the Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’), which was introduced in 
2010. In addition, in 2014, share option were granted in accordance with the Discretionary Share Option Scheme (‘DSOS’). These 
schemes reflect the best practice aspects recommended by the Association of British Insurers following the publication of their 
guidelines in March 2001 (the ‘ABI Guidelines’). 
Lapsing of Directors share options in 2016
On 28 January 2016, following a General Meeting of the Company, the service contracts of the four Executive Directors were 
terminated with immediate effect. Prior to the General Meeting, the Board in place at that time approved and made payments of 
£460,800 to forfeit 9,460,000 unexpired share options, which are included in the table above, and shares deferred under the 2014 
bonus arrangements for Executive Directors (see page 98). 
Share Option Schemes
DSOS
The DSOS is made up of two parts. Options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company granted under Part A are ‘Approved 
Options’ and options to acquire Shares granted under Part B of the DSOS are ‘Unapproved Options’. No consideration shall be 
payable for the grant of an Option.
No options were granted under the DSOS in 2015 (2014: 3,162,900). The weighted average exercise price of options granted under 
DSOS is nil (2014: 59.75p). For these options to vest there has to be an increase in the Group’s Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’) growth 
over the performance period measured over the 3 consecutive calendar years commencing from the date the options were 
granted. The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year under the DSOS was nil per option (2014: 24.01p).
PSP
PSP are granted to Executive Directors and senior management. Executive Directors and senior management receive awards 
under the 2010 Performance Share Plan in the form of nil cost options. No consideration is required to be paid for the grant or 
exercise of an Option.
3,845,900 (2014: 1,811,800) options were granted under PSP in 2015. The PSP options provide a conditional right to acquire 
shares at nil cost subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions and continued employment with the Group. For these 
options to vest a comparison is performed between the Group’s TSR against the FTSE Fledgling index (half the options) (2014: 
FTSE SmallCap index) and the All-Share Oil & Gas Producers index (other half of options). The weighted average fair value of 
options granted during the year under the PSP was 10.35p per option (2014: 26.00p).
Fair	 value	 of	 share	 options	 granted
The fair value of options granted under the DSOS is estimated as at the date of grant using a variance of the Binomial model, 
taking into account terms and conditions upon which the options are granted, which includes the performance condition related 
to the Company’s earnings per share directly. No dividends are paid on shares under the scheme prior to exercise.

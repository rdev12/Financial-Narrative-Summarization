Overview

 Chairman’s  
statement
2010 has been a year of substantial progress for London Mining 
globally. We are now well positioned to take advantage of the 
many new opportunities that have arisen from the Group’s 
technical and corporate advances. London Mining’s growing 
reputation as a pioneer in the development of iron ore resources 
in new territories is supported by its strong management team 
and its well funded balance sheet.
The Group is fully financed to first production at Marampa and for 
its coke project in Colombia. In 2010 a USD 60.0 million revolving 
credit facility was arranged with Standard Chartered and in 
January 2011 London Mining successfully completed a USD 
110.0 million convertible bond issue. The issue was over two 
times subscribed with significant contributions from existing 
shareholders. This financing was the first time that London Mining 
has accessed the capital markets since 2007 when it raised 
funds to fast track development of its mine in Brazil, and reflected 
the market’s positive view of our abilities and prospects. 
We will generate cash flow from our flagship Marampa project 
by the end of 2011, a key milestone in our goal of becoming a 
mid tier supplier to the global steel industry. London Mining is 
confident it can continue to deliver extraordinary returns for its 
shareholders through the sequential delivery of its milestones.
Of particular note during 2010 was the commencement of 
construction at London Mining’s Marampa mine following  
the ratification of its Mining Licence Agreement (“MLA”), by 
the Sierra Leone Parliament in February 2010. The drilling 
programme also provided exceptional results, increasing 
resources ten-fold leading to an equivalent increase in 
projected production volumes from the licence. 
First production from Marampa, expected in Q3 2011, will allow 
us to increase significantly our contribution to the Sierra Leone 
economy not only through the creation of jobs and support of 
local businesses, but also through payments of taxes and 
revenue royalties. It is anticipated that up to one percent of 
revenue will fund corporate responsibility initiatives both locally 
and nationally as directed by London Mining in conjunction with 
a board of locally appointed representatives from the community. 
London Mining has already made significant contributions in 
Sierra Leone on community projects that add tangible benefits 
and a lasting legacy to health, education and the environment. 
As a key investor in Sierra Leone, we are committed to ongoing 
support for legacy projects linked to the country’s celebration of 
its 50th Anniversary of independence throughout 2011.
London Mining announced in January 2011 that it had signed  
a five year offtake agreement for Marampa with Glencore 
International, covering 9.5 million tons of production from the 
first phase of the project over five years. The agreement 
underlines the appetite for the type of high quality ore 
Marampa will be producing. 
Whilst Marampa remains the focus for 2011, London Mining’s 
other projects are beginning to come to the fore and I expect 
all of them to gain prominence over the course of 2011 as 
London Mining looks to secure finance. 
We are continuing to develop our coking coal resources and 
constructing our coke production project in Colombia, with 
progress on track for first production by the end of 2011.
Isua in Greenland is now recognised as a 15Mtpa operation  
and in the case of both Isua and Wadi Sawawin in Saudi Arabia, 
London Mining believes that most value can be delivered for 
shareholders by bringing in a partner to fund further 
development of the projects. 
I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Luciano Ramos, 
Chief Operating Officer and Benjamin Lee, Head of Corporate 
Development to the Board. Both have played integral roles in the 
London Mining story and I expect them to contribute significantly 
to the future development of the Group. 
Colin Knight
Chairman 5
Chief Executive’s  
statement
Building on strong project fundamentals, 
London Mining has a clear strategy and 
proven capability to deliver exceptional  
near term and long term value growth.
2010 has been another year of strong achievement for London 
Mining in our goal to become a significant new producer of raw 
materials for the global steel industry. In the past year we have 
added over 1.0 billion tonnes to our iron ore resource base and 
advances at our projects in Sierra Leone, Greenland and Saudi 
Arabia mean that we are now targeting over 30Mt of iron ore 
production by 2015 from our current iron ore resource base  
of over 2.3 billion tonnes. We are now in construction on two 
projects with both coming into production this year. Additionally, 
we have transformed our Greenland iron ore project into an 
economically compelling 15Mtpa operation which will complete 
its bankable feasibility work during 2011.
As a result of our recent highly oversubscribed convertible bond 
issue, together with the revolving credit facility secured with 
Standard Chartered, London Mining is fully funded to bring 
Sierra Leone to 3.6Mtpa and Colombia to 200ktpa of coke 
production. High margins and the incremental growth potential 
of these projects allow organic expansion to be significantly or 
completely self-funded without the requirement for a strategic 
investor. The progress made and anticipated production growth 
to 30Mtpa has continued to validate London Mining’s strategy  
of focusing on projects with deliverable logistics which can be 
rapidly developed into production and expanded quickly to 
significant size. Our key projects have now demonstrated these 
fundamental value aspects and, with first production at 
Marampa expected in Q3 2011, less than 18 months after 
approvals were granted in Q1 2010, we are demonstrating  
our ability to deliver production from our projects in a rapid  
and cost effective manner. 
Development at Marampa continues apace and we are excited 
about the opportunities presented by near term substantial cash 
flow and the increasing scope of the planned operation. A year 
ago Marampa was being considered as a simple 1.5Mtpa 
tailings reprocessing operation with resource potential for  
a 5Mtpa mine.

Chief Executive’s  
statement continued
The success of our Mineral Resource Development programme 
now means that we have JORC resources ten times the 
historical resource estimates and a deliverable plan to over 
16Mtpa production over a greatly extended mine life. One of the 
major advantages presented by Marampa relative to many other 
West African iron ore projects is London Mining’s ability to 
entirely self fund its development. This is a result of a number of 
factors including Marampa’s proximity to the coast and simple 
logistics solution and the presence of higher grade weathered 
material which greatly reduces the amount of processing 
required to produce a premium product suitable for sale in all 
markets. An offtake agreement with Glencore for an initial 
portion of production has endorsed our ore quality, our 
production plans and assists with working capital needs as we 
ramp up to 3.6Mtpa and beyond. 
We are also very encouraged by recent developments at Isua 
in Greenland, with a new scoping study now showing that the 
resource can support a 15Mtpa operation with greatly reduced 
capital intensity. 
Over the course of 2010 we also acquired 100% of a coke and 
coking coal business in Colombia. Coking coal complements 
our iron ore business very well and London Mining Colombia, 
(formerly International Coal Company, (“ICC”), is forecast to 
produce its first coke in Q3 2011 and contribute cash flows to 
our business from early 2012. Our current focus is to significantly 
develop our resources in Colombia over the course of the year: 
an agreement has been signed for a concession near our coke 
ovens and the Company is currently drilling this and other 
concessions with the expectation of developing coking coal 
mines both to supply our coke ovens and for direct export of 
coking coal. We expect to reach full coke capacity of 200ktpa  
in Q1 2012, followed by a second phase of construction 
increasing capacity to 400ktpa of coke which will produce 
cashflow to fund coking coal mine development activity.
Financing for the Wadi Sawawin project in Saudi Arabia is also 
advancing and we expect further developments over the course 
of 2011. The agreement signed in July 2010, giving us a 25% 
free carried interest in the project, greatly improves the internal 
rate of return (“IRR”) for London Mining and allows us to focus 
on delivering the technical aspects of the project.

With regard to our markets, tight supply and high China 
domestic production marginal costs means that “higher for 
longer” pricing is now being expected for iron ore and for coking 
coal for the next decade and indeed record prices are currently 
being experienced. London Mining is in a very favourable 
position to benefit from this strong pricing both for its near term 
production and from its near term significant expansion as it 
targets 30Mtpa in 2015.
London Mining’s key iron ore projects all produce premium high 
quality low impurity iron ore products. In a market where in situ 
grade quality is falling for many worldwide producers, both 
major and China domestic, securing long term sources of 
quality iron ore supply is becoming more and more important for 
steelmakers. London Mining expects to enjoy premium pricing 
and strong demand for its planned production and expansion  
in all its projects. Combined with low opex and/or capex cost 
bases, this leads to superior margin and return on investment  
for years to come.
China, as the most important consumer of iron ore and other 
commodities, continues to be a key focus of London Mining’s 
approach to long term development of our assets. We continue 
to build meaningful links based on London Mining’s high quality 
assets and products as well as our reputation for technical 
excellence in mining development. This is driven by a long term 
commitment to building sustainable partnerships with Chinese 
interests. An example of this is the involvement of two leading 
Chinese state owned engineering and construction companies, 
Sinosteel and CCCC (“China Communications Construction 
Company”), being involved with the Isua Project in Greenland. 
This has allowed London Mining to optimise total capex and 
construction times making the Isua project stand out in terms  
of IRR, product quality and speed to significant production 
volumes in 2015. It is also opening additional potential financing 
avenues in China.
Whilst continuing to deliver strong shareholder value growth, 
London Mining at its core focuses on and is led by a philosophy 
of “win–win” for all stakeholders. These include our employees, 
the communities and countries in which we operate, the 
environment, our customers, contractors and partners. In Sierra 
Leone, we take very seriously the responsibility we have of 
being a significant provider economic development through both 
our direct activities and all the indirect benefits from our 
investment, training, infrastructure development, job creation, 
and re-development of an iron ore mining industry. We support 
transparency initiatives and see our pioneering commitment and 
successful operations in Sierra Leone as an example to attract 
further international capital for the country’s industrial and 
economic development. In Greenland, the Isua mine will bring 
substantial and much needed economic activity and revenue  
to the country. Again London Mining’s early and continued 
commitment to this important project for Greenland will build  
a secure economic future. 
Looking forward, in 2011 the company will be focused on 
delivering its production plans and other key milestones to 
enable us to achieve our growth objectives. We will also be 
working on bringing together the required financial resources 
and partners to fund Greenland and Sierra Leone large scale 
expansions in 2012. Building on strong project fundamentals, 
London Mining has a clear strategy and proven capability to 
deliver exceptional near term and long term value growth.

2010. This is an increase of 15% compared to 2009 and is a 
new record for global crude steel production. Commentators 
broadly see production slowing to single figures in 2011 
but demand for steel making inputs is expected to remain 
strong. China remains the principal producer of crude steel 
representing 44% of global production (down from 47% as a 
result of the rebound in market conditions elsewhere) and the 
major customer for iron ore. Crude steel production is 
estimated by CRU to exceed 2,050Mt by 2021. 
Iron ore supply and demand
As iron ore is an essential ingredient to make steel, the 
demand for iron ore is directly proportional to the demand for 
steel. During the period 2005 to 2010, global iron ore demand 
rose from 1,489Mt to 2,215Mt, mostly due to the strong 
demand from China. Annual iron ore demand is expected  
to continue its strong growth over the next 10 years, with  
CRU estimating Global demand of 2,699Mt by 2021  
(Source: CRU). Importantly a significant driver for the global 
iron ore market is the demand from the seaborne market.

China
China is the biggest importer of iron ore products 
predominantly for blast furnaces. London Mining will service 
this market though its operations in Sierra Leone and 
Greenland.
Middle East and North Africa (“MENA”)
The availability of natural gas and absence of any local sources 
of coking coal means that the iron ore market in the MENA 
region is almost exclusively for products that can be used in 
Direct Reduced Iron (“DRI”) plants i.e. premium quality, high 
grade, low impurity pellets. London Mining, through its Saudi 
London joint venture, has demonstrated it is able to produce  
a high quality DR pellet from its Wadi Sawawin operation.  
Isua can produce a pellet feed product suitable for HYL-type 
DRI plants.
Europe
The European market consists almost entirely of blast furnaces 
with Brazil currently the biggest supplier of lump, sinter and 
blast furnace pellet feed. Marampa and Isua are ideally placed 
to enter this market.
CRU estimated global seaborne trade of iron ore was 992Mt 
in 2010. CRU expects the expansion of the seaborne iron ore 
market will continue and that by 2021, the seaborne iron ore 
trade will be 1,475Mt. Chinese demand is pivotal to the growth 
of the industry with seaborne iron ore imports into China 
comprising 80% of the increase in global seaborne iron ore 
imports between 2010 and 2021.
Our markets
London Mining is able to produce a number of products to 
supply its target markets. The Marampa and Isua projects are 
both capable of producing high quality products that can be 
easily sold on the seaborne market and the Wadi Sawawin 
Project is ideally located to access the key domestic market of 
the Middle East. 
In January 2011 London Mining entered into an agreement with 
Glencore to sell the first 1.8Mtpa of production from its 
Marampa project on to the seaborne market. The key features 
of this agreement were the exposure to the developing trend to 
sell iron ore to a spot related price and secondly that the base 
case assumes that sales are primarily to be directed into China 
with upside on pricing if the product is placed into the 
European market.  10

Marampa
Marampa, Sierra Leone (100%)
The Marampa mine is a brownfields site formerly operated  
by the Sierra Leone Development Company (“DELCO”) and 
William Baird between 1933 and 1975. Marampa reached a 
peak production of 2.5Mtpa in the 1960s before low iron ore 
prices forced its closure. Continuing weak market economics, 
outdated processing technology and civil war prevented 
redevelopment of the mine until the mining licence was 
acquired by London Mining in 2006.
London Mining plans to develop Marampa in two phases. 
Phase 1 considers the processing of tailings from previous 
operations and highly weathered ore to produce 3.6Mtpa 
of premium sinter concentrate. Phase 2 is the focus of a 
prefeasability study (“PFS”) due in Q2 2011 and will consider 
an expansion to 16Mtpa of pellet feed or sinter concentrates 
from moderately weathered and unweathered ore. 
Construction of the first 1.8Mtpa production module for Phase 
1 (“1a”) is under way and construction of the second 1.8Mtpa 
module (“1b”) is expected to commence by the end of 2011. 
The current focus at Marampa continues to be the construction 
and optimisation of Phase 1 to incorporate the new resources 
reported on 17 January 2011. In the same announcement London 
Mining reported a move in plant production start date to the end 
of Q3 2011 mainly as a consequence of a reconfiguration of 
the plant layout due to the new ore discovery. Export of first 
concentrate is now expected in Q4 2011. The capital budget for 
Phase 1a is USD 136.0 million. At the end of December 2010, 
USD 115.0 million had been committed of which USD 45.0 million 
had been spent. 
Marampa progressed significantly over the course of 2010. 
Highlights for the project in the period were the maiden 
JORC resource in January, the ratification of the MLA and 
commencement of construction in February, delineation of 
higher grade weathered material in August and the reporting  
of almost a billion tonnes of resources at year end. Work also 
commenced on a PFS for an expanded 16Mtpa operation 
incorporating all resources which is expected to be completed 
in Q2 2011. In January 2011, London Mining was awarded all 
environmental permits required for the Marampa operation. 
Resources
As announced on 17 January 2011, Snowden Mining Industry 
Consultants now estimate a total primary resource, excluding 
tailings, of 906Mt grading 32% Fe comprising 379Mt at 32% 
Fe in the Indicated category and 527Mt at 32% Fe in the 
Inferred category. These resources represent an increase  
of 70% to the total primary resource of 533Mt at 31% Fe 
reported in November 2010 and a tenfold increase of the 
historical primary resource of 84Mt grading 37% Fe reported 
at the time of London Mining’s admission to AIM in November 
2009. The new resource also reflects 24Mt of highly 
weathered ore at 38% Fe and 107Mt of moderately weathered 
ore at 35% Fe. The focus of the 56,825 metre diamond drilling 
programme completed in 2010 was to define the parameters of 
the primary resource to at least the Inferred category in order 
to determine the optimum production capacity for Phase 2. The 
additional 20,000 metres of drilling, to be completed in the first 
half of 2011, is aimed at converting resources from Inferred to 
Measured and Indicated categories for detailed mine planning 
purposes. It is expected however, that there will be further 
additions to the total resource. The tabular nature of the 
Marampa ore body, homogenous geochemistry of the ore and 
highly competent geotechnical behaviour of the Marampa pit 
walls mean that the life of mine strip ratio is expected to allow 
almost all the currently defined resources to fall within the 
confines of an open pit and therefore in the final reserve. 11
First ore to ROM pad
Phase 1 progress 
Mine 
Detailed mine and tailings plans have now been completed with 
a strip ratio of 0.9 estimated for weathered ore and 0.02 for 
tailings with ROM ore comprising 70% tailings and 30% 
weathered ore. The mineable resource, including the weathered 
ore, is currently estimated to be 59Mt with a head grade of 
26.5% Fe. This mine plan currently only considers weathered 
material from the Campbelltown and Hospital Ridges, with 
further material from Masaboin Hill and the north east extension 
expected to be captured in a revised mine plan. Preliminary 
mining of tailings and weathered ore will commence in Q2 2011, 
using equipment already located on site, to establish a run of 
mine stock pile ahead of plant commissioning. 
Plant
Construction of the Phase 1a plant continues although 
reconfiguration of the plant layout to allow full realisation of the 
new ore discovery now means first production will commence  
at the end of Q3 2011 and first commercial export and sales of 
concentrate will be in Q4 2011. Construction is ongoing with 
work on all essential concrete footings expected to be 
completed during Q1 2011. All necessary earthworks are 
expected to be completed ahead of the start  
of the wet season in May. 
Test work indicates that 100% of highly weathered material 
and 75% of material considered moderately weathered can be 
processed in the Phase 1 processing circuit with the installation 
of a small rod mill; the capital expenditure for which has been 
included in the Phase 1a cost of USD 136.0 million. It is 
envisaged that the remaining moderately weathered material will 
be stockpiled for processing in Phase 2 although this fraction 
may be increased if it improves the overall economics of the 
project. A revised optimised production plan for Phase 1 will  
be released as part of the Phase 2 PFS in Q2 2011, but is not 
expected to change the production start date.
Commissioning of the plant is expected to be completed in Q3 
2011 with first concentrate from the plant also expected by the 
end of Q3 2011, and shipment of first concentrate within one 
month of first commissioned production. Ramp up to the full 
capacity of 1.8Mtpa is expected to take 6 months. 
Construction of the second 1.8Mtpa module to complete the 
ramp up to 3.6Mtpa is scheduled to start in Q4 2011 with 
commissioning expected nine months later. Earthworks for 
Phase 1b are to be completed as part of the Phase 1a 
construction programme. In addition, excess WHIMS plant 
and power generating capacity has been installed as part of 
the Phase 1a programme and London Mining is investigating 
further strategies to accelerate Phase 1b. 
Logistics
Work on the 25km second section haul road from Rogberi to 
Lunsar has commenced and is expected to be completed 
ahead of the wet season in Q2 2011. Construction of the  
19km first section between Rogberi and Tawfayim is complete. 
Bollore Africa has been contracted to provide road haulage 
and maintenance with mobilisation expected to take six months. 
Construction of the port at Tawfayim is scheduled to take place 
between Q1 and Q3 2011. Ausenco-Sandwell has completed 
the final designs and is to act as construction manager for the 
project. The main long lead items for this aspect of operations, 
namely the jetty and barge loading equipment, have been 
ordered from Quayquip and Telestack respectively and are 
under construction. The final design uses a floating jetty which 
can accommodate river level fluctuations. Jan de Nul, the 
dredging contractor, has started dredging a navigable channel 
in the Port Loko River. London Mining is in the final stages of 
agreeing contracts for barging and transhipment with 
mobilisation expected in time for first exports in Q4 2011. The 
use of tidal assistance to optimise barge loads and reduce 
dredging requirements is being evaluated. The planned loading 
rates of around 20,000t per day will be unaffected. 12

Phase 2 prefeasibility study
The Phase 2 PFS is being reconfigured to reflect the increase 
in resources, and the targeted production of up to 16Mtpa 
with the inclusion of some moderately weathered ore is 
expected to have a significant favourable impact on initial 
operating cost and metallurgical recovery. The PFS will 
provide capital expenditure and operating expenditure 
estimates and will enable a detailed evaluation of the full 
potential and deliverability of the Marampa project, including 
mining, processing, waste disposal and logistics plans, as well 
as time to production. The PFS is due for completion during 
Q2 2011. Further to the completion of this study London 
Mining is also to complete a scoping study to determine an 
early expansion, low capital expenditure stage incorporating 
moderately weathered ore. 
New metallurgical testwork indicates that a fine concentrate 
suitable for use as either sinter or pellet feed can be produced 
from all Marampa ores, irrespective of weathering. This is likely 
to have significant implications to both capital expenditure and 
operating expenditure as it reduces the amount of grinding and 
downstream processing required to produce a 
saleable concentrate. 
Mining Lease Agreement (“MLA”) and review of fiscal incentives
A review of the MLA comprising fiscal incentives for Phase 1 by 
the Sierra Leone Government (“GoSL ”) is near to conclusion. 
Current discussions with the Government review committee 
(“the Committee”) indicate there should be no material change 
to the project value as a result of any modifications to the MLA 
and associated fiscal incentive package and hence the 
investment programme remains unchanged. 
London Mining has also engaged in discussions with the 
Committee to accelerate the review that was to take place  
after five years and to agree now what the fiscal regime will be 
for the five years from 2015. This will provide certainty on the 
financial modelling, in particular for the expansion of Phase 1 to 
incorporate the full effect of the weathered ore and the Phase 2 
development. It is expected that the resulting package for the 
second five years should not differ materially from fiscal 
incentives either awarded recently to other mining companies  
or from those that have previously been negotiated with 
companies already having been through this review process. 
London Mining supports efforts to increase transparency in the 
mining industry in Sierra Leone, and GoSL remains very 
supportive of London Mining’s production and investment plans.
Any changes to the MLA will require ratification by Parliament. 
Were changes not ratified, the existing MLA is still valid for the 
lease term. 13
Environmental permitting and management
London Mining received its full environmental permit for 
Marampa at the beginning of January 2011. The issuance of 
the permit followed the formal approval and acceptance by the 
Sierra Leone Environmental Protection Agency (“SLEPA”) of 
London Mining’s Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”), 
the EIA having been discussed publically via four public 
hearings in Sierra Leone, which were attended by members of 
the public and NGOs. The permit is subject to an annual 
renewal by SLEPA, which requires ongoing environmental 
compliance in accordance with the Sierra Leone Environmental 
Act 2008 and the payment of an annual fee. The EIA meets all 
local regulations and London Mining is working with an 
internationally recognised environmental consultant to ensure 
compliance with international best practice.
Offtake and marketing 
An offtake agreement for Marampa was signed with the trading 
house Glencore International AG (“Glencore”) on 26 January 
2011. The offtake covered 9.5 million wet metric tonnes (WMT) 
production from Phase 1a of the Company’s Marampa project. 
The five year agreement, which included a pre-payment facility 
for up to USD 27.0 million, will provide guaranteed offtake and 
shipping from Sierra Leone for all Phase 1a production, with 
the option for London Mining to expand the agreement to 
Phase 1b on the same terms. The offtake will be based on 
Platts 62% CFR China benchmark, with an upward adjustment 
for the Fe content of the Company’s 65% Fe sinter feed 
concentrate, and an incentive to place product at locations 
such as Europe where there is a net pricing benefit through 
lower shipping costs. The Agreement accommodates London 
Mining’s ramp up expectations and is flexible to accommodate 
varying shipping sizes and frequencies to supply European, 
Chinese and other markets. 14

Greenland
Isua
Isua, Greenland (100% ownership) 
Isua is located 150km Northeast of Nuuk and 100km from a 
proposed deep seawater port. Isua will produce a premium 
quality 70% Fe pellet feed concentrate with low impurities and 
benefits from its position in the warmer south-west corner of 
Greenland which allows for year round shipping.
In March 2010, London Mining reported a JORC resource 
estimate completed by Snowden Mining Industry Consultants  
of 951Mt at 36% Fe. A PFS for a 10Mtpa open pit and 
processing operation from an initial 451Mt open pit mine plan 
was completed by SNC Lavalin in June 2010. The June 2010 
PFS considered a 10Mtpa operation with a 21 year initial mine 
life and estimated capital expenditure of USD 1.7 billion. 
 
In February 2011 London Mining released the results of a 
15Mtpa scoping study completed by SNC Lavalin. The scoping 
study considered a 15Mtpa open pit and processing operation 
with a 15 year initial mine life for estimated capital expenditure  
of USD 2.0 billion, representing a 22% reduction in capital 
intensity. Operating costs increased from USD 27 to USD 29/t 
mostly due to a 20% increase in fuel costs. The scoping study 
was based on capital and operational cost estimates to a level  
of accuracy of -30% to +40% with Chinese contractors CCCC 
and Sinosteel, providing engineering support and cost estimates 
for certain capital items. 
The 15Mtpa scoping study and detailed work undertaken for 
the 10Mtpa PFS is to form the basis of a 15Mtpa bankable 
feasibility study (“BFS”) which has already commenced and  
is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2011.

London Mining has now completed three seasons of 
exploration drilling, further to previous drilling which took place 
during the 1970s, with drill holes from the 2010 campaign to 
be included in a new resource estimate as part of further 
feasibility work. The 2010 drill data will be augmented by a 
further campaign of 7,000 to 8,000 metres of drilling to be 
undertaken in 2011 to allow conversion of all necessary 
resources currently in the Inferred category to be upgraded to 
Indicated. In addition, all necessary base line data collections, 
advanced field drilling programmes, EIA and Social Impact 
Assessment (“SIA”) have been, or are expected to be 
undertaken to allow completion of a full BFS by the end of 
2011 with construction estimated to start in 2012 and first 
production at the beginning of 2015. London Mining is 
investigating strategies to fund the BFS programme by selling 
a minority stake at project level and also plans to introduce  
a strategic partner to provide funding for construction.  
A separate listing for Isua is also being considered.  16

Wadi Sawawin, Saudi Arabia (25% ownership) 
The Wadi Sawawin Project located in the north-west corner of 
Saudi Arabia, 125km from Tabuk and 60km from the Red Sea 
port of Duba. Wadi Sawawin is of strategic and economic 
importance to Saudi Arabia as it will provide a domestic source  
of Direct Reduction (“DR”) pellets for use in the DRI steel plants 
which account for 90% of steel production in the Middle East and 
North African region. The location of Wadi Sawawin will provide  
it with a competitive advantage over competing Brazilian and 
European supply through reduced freight rates from its deep 
water port in the Red Sea and access to low cost Saudi Arabian 
energy. In addition, the project will assist in the programme of 
diversification of the economy which is an important element of 
Saudi Arabian economic policy, and the government is expected 
to provide low cost funding via the Public Investment Fund (“PIF”) 
and Saudi Investment Development Fund (“SIDF”).
The process to secure the funding of the Wadi Sawawin project 
continues. There have been initial positive discussions with the 
power, water and port authorities in Saudi Arabia regarding the 
provision of these services. In the event that agreements are 
reached, this would materially reduce the capital expenditure 
requirement of the project. London Mining is currently producing 
10 tonnes of concentrate at a pilot plant in Perth, Australia to 
enable DR pellet samples to be produced by pellet plant 
bidders, and to provide samples to potential offtake providers. 
National Mining Company (“NMC”) and London Mining continue 
to work jointly on the ongoing application to the Deputy Ministry 
for Mineral Resources for an exploitation licence for the proposed 
5Mtpa 20 year operation and there are ongoing discussions. 
In July 2010, London Mining announced the results of an 
updated bankable BFS for the Wadi Sawawin project and  
a revised agreement with its partner NMC.
Under the terms of the new agreement signed on 20 July 2010, in 
return for no further material funding requirements and no further 
dilution from subsequent equity fundings, London Mining will 
receive a direct interest of 25% in the Wadi Sawawin project 
through NMC. NMC holds the historical exploitation licence for 
the Wadi Sawawin project and three adjacent exploration 
licences. The Chairman of NMC is Prince Nawaf bin Sultan bin 
Abdul Aziz al Saud, who has provided his full commitment to the 
project and to this agreement. This agreement supersedes the 
previous agreement whereby London Mining held a 50% interest 
in a joint venture company, Saudi London Iron Limited, into which 
the licences were going to be transferred. Upon closing London 
Mining will receive shares equal to 25% of the issued share 
capital of NMC. 
The updated BFS further improved the feasibility of the Wadi 
Sawawin project at 5Mtpa. The key economic parameters, 
based on the detailed analysis undertaken in the BFS, are:
–  25% stake in joint venture with National Mining Company
–  5–10Mtpa (on 100% basis) of DR pellets in key areas of iron 
ore demand growth
–  Strategic location with low energy cost and deep water access
–  Following BFS, in discussions with offtake partner

The economics of the project were also positively impacted 
by the assumption of higher pricing for Brazilian benchmark 
Tuberao DR quality pellets, which feed directly to higher 
pricing expectations for Wadi Sawawin DR pellets. In addition, 
the potential to increase the IRR through further optimisation  
of the capital expenditure, provision of power, desalination  
and potentially port facilities by third parties and through  
the expansion of the mine to 10Mtpa is significant.
The equity IRR will be dependent on the funding structure 
selected. NMC expects to raise financing to build the project 
through a combination of funding from local sources (including 
PIF and SIDF), commercial debt and the provision of offtake 
arrangements in exchange for an equity stake. The minimum 
leverage achievable is expected to be 60%.
The current indicated JORC resource of 248Mt grading 39.8% 
Fe is sufficient for a mine life of 21 years at the run rate of 
5Mtpa. In addition, London Mining has inferred resources of 
134Mt grading 39.2% Fe (as well as further exploration targets) 
which may provide the basis for an extension of the mine life at 
5Mtpa by over 10 years or an expansion to 10Mtpa. London 
Mining will continue to undertake sufficient exploration to 
maintain the licences in good standing until funding is secured. 
The current resource is based entirely within the Western 
exploration licence and is contiguous with the current exploration 
licence. NMC has recently submitted to the Ministry of 
Petroleum and Mines in Jeddah an application for a revised 
exploitation licence sufficient for a 5Mpta 20 year mine.
The BFS process was managed by the London Mining project 
team, based primarily in Oman, who engaged a team of 
consultants comprising: Worley Parsons (project management, 
transport, bathymetry and ESHIA studies), Ausenco (mineral 
processing and plant engineering), Snowden Group (geology 
and mine planning), AMMTEC (ore variability testing), Corus 
Consulting (formerly British Steel Consulting Overseas, mineral 
processing), CIT (drilling contractor), AME Mineral Economics 
and CRU Strategies (market report) and Southern Mining 
Consultants (financial analysis). The BFS has been conducted 
to ensure the operation will meet Equator Principles. 18

Colombia (100% ownership)
In March 2010 London Mining acquired the 80% of ICC,  
(now renamed to London Mining Colombia) that it did not 
already own for an initial consideration of USD 5.5 million in 
cash and 3.5 million newly issued London Mining shares, with 
potential further consideration of up to USD 8.5 million and up 
to 6.3 million shares payable subject to the satisfaction of 
performance conditions. The performance conditions were 
linked to EBITDA and capital expenditure targets for the coke 
ovens, and to the delivery over time of attractive coking coal 
and port opportunities. 
London Mining is now constructing coke ovens with a capacity 
of 200ktpa in the Boyaca region of Colombia, a region with 
significant local production of high quality coking coal. 
Completion of construction and first coke production is now 
expected in Q3 2011. This revised timeline is due to severe 
flooding associated with the La Niña weather system which 
required significant remedial drainage and some limited 
redesign. Full capacity of 200ktpa is expected to be reached in 
Q1 2012, following which the Company expects to commence 
a second phase of construction, increasing capacity to 
400ktpa of coke. The capital expenditure for the first phase  
is expected to be USD 30.0 million. 
The Company has agreed in principle a supply agreement with 
a local coking coal producer at a small discount to local market 
prices for up to 300ktpa of low volatility coking coal from mines 
being developed on neighbouring properties to London 
Mining’s coke ovens. Following a high-level drilling programme 
on these properties, London Mining decided to enter into a 
supply agreement in preference to the original proposed joint 
venture structure. 
The Company is in the process of investigating the potential  
of further concessions both in proximity to the coke ovens and 
also in other areas with high coking coal potential. An 
agreement has been signed for a concession in the vicinity  
of the coke ovens and which the Company is currently drilling 
with the expectation of developing a low and mid volatility 
coking coal mine to supply the coke ovens. In addition, the 
Company has signed a concession agreement for a property in 
the Cundinamarca province, which it will be exploring as a joint 
venture with another party. At the end of December 2010, 
2,615 metres of diamond drilling and 3,724 metres of RC 
drilling had been completed.
The Company is also in a number of discussions with port and 
transport companies regarding short and medium term export 
arrangements.

CGMR pit, China
 
China & Chile
China Global Mining Resources Joint Venture (“CGMR JV”), 
China (50% ownership through a joint venture)
Mining operations were halted by the mining authorities in Anhui 
province during the year, for reasons which primarily concerned the 
continued delay in consolidating the mines situated on the CGMR 
JV licence. The operator of the other two pits on the CGMR JV 
licence has recently won a court case which ruled that all current 
pits on the licence should be integrated into one jointly owned 
operation without payments being made between the parties. The 
CGMR JV has appealed this ruling, for which London Mining was 
advised there was no legal basis. 
In addition, the arbitration claim from the original vendors of the 
XNS mine and Sudan processing plant regarding the timing for 
payment of deferred consideration of approximately USD 18.0 
million (translated at 31 December 2010) remains unresolved, 
with an initial hearing date now set for April 2011. Given the 
current inability to operate the mine and the ongoing legal claims 
and rulings, London Mining has written down its investment in 
the CGMR JV to USD nil carrying value. London Mining is 
investigating bringing in a Chinese partner to operate the mine in 
return for equity in the business.
Chile (50% ownership through a joint venture) 
As announced on 30 July 2010 London Mining has entered into  
a joint venture with a Chinese and Chilean based partner to take 
advantage of iron ore opportunities in the Atacama region of Chile. 
Under the agreement, London Mining has subscribed for 50%  
of the shares of the joint venture company, Atacama Mining 
Resources Corporation (“Atacama”). 
At the date of investment, Atacama held options over a number of 
concessions to iron ore deposits in the Atacama region of Northern 
Chile, an area of known iron ore resources. Atacama is also actively 
exploring a number of new opportunities that could secure 
alternative options over iron ore concessions that are of great 
interest to Chinese strategic investors. Atacama has also recently 
secured an option over port access rights within a short distance  
of this region and is considering potential for establishing near-term 
production. Under the terms of the agreement, any prospective iron 
ore concessions discovered in Chile by London Mining’s partners 
will be developed through the Joint Venture; London Mining also 
receives a priority loan return from production and/or any new  
cash raised by the venture. 
Prior to year end, London Mining’s investment in the Joint Venture 
was USD 11.2 million (net of exploration costs expensed during the 
year) of which USD 5.0 million was recorded as goodwill and USD 
6.2 million was shown as a long term receivable. In accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards, London Mining has 
written down the goodwill recognised at the date of the agreement 
to USD nil and has made full provision against the long term 
receivables. The provision is required because the portfolio of iron 
ore concessions and logistics opportunities being considered by 
Atacama has changed since the date of London Mining’s initial 
investment into the venture. In accordance with accounting standards, 
the initial investment of USD 1 1.2 million is not able to be reassigned 
to new exploration and port concession opportunities now being 
evaluated or obtained. The provision made against the receivable  
may be reversed if either new cash is invested into the venture or  
the venture has a defined resource or reaches production from one  
of the many new early stage opportunities it is currently negotiating. 
The joint venture has received interest from a number of parties  
for a potential off-take from concessions undergoing early stage 
exploration in and around this area based on initial sample 
specifications taken and is currently in negotiations for a possible 
strategic investor into the project. 20

London Mining plans to apply international best practice, 
specifically compliance with the IFC Equator Principles at all 
its projects, where appropriate. The focus of current efforts is 
the ongoing development and implementation of environment, 
community and health and safety management plans at 
Marampa following the completion of the environmental impact 
assessment and award of the environmental permits in January 
2011 and ahead of first production in 2011. Base line work 
continues in Greenland ahead of the likely completion of a 
BFS in 2011. The Colombia operations have received all 
necessary permits to develop and operate coke ovens. 
Marampa – Sierra Leone
Once in production London Mining will pay a 3% royalty to the 
Government of Sierra Leone, the standard government royalty 
for iron ore producers, and may contribute up to a further 1% 
of revenues into a community development fund of which half 
will be used to fund local projects and half will be contributed 
towards national initiatives. This fund will be administered by 
a board comprising London Mining and representatives of all 
sections of the local community. London Mining intends to 
focus on projects that leave a legacy investment in health, 
education and the environment.
During 2010 London Mining committed over USD 0.5 million 
to several initiatives including: funding of 300 primary and 
secondary school scholarships; the provision of school 
libraries and training of teachers in over 50 schools in the 
Lunsar and Port Loko region; construction of public toilets in 
Lunsar and Port Loko and the construction of the medical 
centre in the Military Hospital in Freetown. London Mining has 
also commenced collaboration with a local technical academy 
in Lunsar that teaches around 200 local youths, trade skills 
e.g. engineering; carpentry; electrical etc. London Mining 
plans to implement a mentoring scheme to provide 
employment for some of the graduates from this scheme. 
London Mining is a responsible corporate 
entity, and is aware of the key roles it fulfils 
as an employer; as a partner in developing 
local communities; and of the impact its 
operations can have on the environment.  21
Isua – Greenland
London Mining has now completed two full seasons of 
baseline data collection at Isua with the following areas 
targeted: mine rock geochemistry and lake water chemistry, 
hydrology, meteorology, studies on glacier and sea ice, 
regional biodiversity, archaeology and local socioeconomic 
systems. The social impact study is now in progress, a scoping 
study has been completed and draft terms of reference have 
been submitted and several public consultation meetings have 
now been completed. The Environmental Impact Assessment 
is expected to start in Q1 2011. Both the environmental and 
social impact studies are expected to be in place to allow 
completion of the BFS by the end of 2011. 
Colombia 
In Colombia London Mining is pursuing several important 
initiatives including focus on mine safety, employment and 
activities to mitigate any potential adverse environmental 
impact. 
London Mining is working with local miners and local 
government institutions to set up rescue centres and security 
support centres. We are creating programs to incentivise the 
mining safety practice under the highest security standards in 
the region and have documented such standards in Safety 
Manuals (in both English and Spanish) for our employees, 
consultants and third party contractors. 
London Mining is also significantly involved in environmental care 
and sustenance; the purpose is to be a model company in terms 
of mitigation of environmental impact and the implementation of 
proper measures in order to benefit the region with employment 
and sustainability, and at the same time to be environmentally 
friendly with the region. As part of this scheme London Mining has 
developed reforestation programs that considered at least 2,000 
native plant species, with the support and participation of local 
school students.
Local employment generation: London Mining also prioritises the 
hiring of local people in order to improve the economic conditions 
and ensure area support.
Wadi Sawawin – Saudi Arabia
Operations at Wadi Sawawin are being undertaken to ensure 
compliance with Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (“KSA”) legislation 
as well as the Equator Principles. London Mining has a number 
of policies and management strategies designed to mitigate 
potential risks to the surrounding environment (including the 
social setting). These include an HSE management system; 
safety regulations during construction; safety regulations after 
preliminary takeover; construction environmental management 
standards; excavation requirements; Wadi Sawawin HSE 
management plan; and security requirements. All environmental 
planning, protection and policy in KSA is to encompass all 
aspects of Islam and its teachings. Protection, conservation 
and development of the environment and natural resources are 
all regarded as mandatory religious duties.  22
Overview
Operational and financial review
Corporate governance
Financial statements
 Financial 
review
In the year ended 31 December 2010 the Group has changed to 
equity accounting for its interest in joint ventures to better reflect 
the way the Group now manages and reviews such investments. 
For the year ended 31 December 2009 the Group accounted for 
investments in joint ventures using the proportionate consolidation 
method as permitted by IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures. 
Results for the year ended 31 December 2009 have therefore 
been restated to reflect the change in accounting policy, the 
effects of which are shown in note 5 to the financial statements.
 
1. Income statement 
The principal key performance indicator by which the Group 
measures the performance of its projects is earnings before 
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA
1
). EBITDA 
for the year ended 31 December 2010 is a net loss of 
USD 31.4 million (equivalent year ended 2009 net loss: 
USD 31.7 million). 
It is noted that no amounts are included in EBITDA for joint 
ventures following the change in accounting policy from 
proportionate consolidation to equity accounting. EBITDA is 
stated prior to any impairment of joint ventures or associates. 
Included in EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2010 is:
USD 32.4 million (2009: USD 32.5 million) of administration  >
costs including: 
staff related costs of USD 14.0 million (2009: 19.1  –
million) comprising:
i) USD 1.9 million (2009: USD 4.2 million) charge 
arising from the return bonus plan
2
; this charge 
reflects the non-cash IFRS 2 charge: cash payments 
for the return bonus plan during the year were USD 
2.9 million (2009 USD 2.0 million) and a further USD 
4.2 million is due (subject to the return bonus plan 
rules), payable over the next three years, of which 
USD 1.6 million will be covered by proceeds from  
the exercise of respective options;
First production at Marampa and Colombia fully funded

 Compensation payments made under the Return Bonus Plan relate to the “Return 
of Cash” to shareholders. Full details of the compensation scheme are disclosed in 
the 2008 annual report. In summary, participants in the Company’s share-based 
remuneration schemes receive an equivalent compensation payment for the loss of 
value in awards held at the time of the Return of Cash. The compensation payment 
vests in accordance with underlying terms of the original award to which it relates.

ii) USD 3.9 million (2009: USD 4.8 million) staff costs for 
Directors and key management. The reduction is due 
to one off AIM listing and other bonuses paid in 2009;
USD 5.4 million of other staff costs (2009: USD 4.8 
million). Higher costs reflect the increase due to higher 
head count following the ramp up of Sierra Leone 
operations and the acquisition of Colombia during the 
year, which was previously equity accounted; and
iii) A non-cash charge of USD 2.8 million (2009: USD 
5.3 million) of share based payments to staff, 
Directors and key management. This reduction is due 
to options vesting in 2010.
Other costs: –
i) USD 7.0 million (2009: USD 4.3 million) of 
consultancy and legal fees. The increase is a result of 
fund raising costs, litigation costs in China and higher 
activity in Sierra Leone and Colombia (which was 
consolidated during the year);
ii) USD 3.1 million (2009: USD 2.0 million) of travel 
costs, due to higher activity at all projects, in 
particular Sierra Leone;
iii) USD 4.0 million (2009: USD 1.7 million) of other 
Sierra Leone overheads as the operation ramps up  
to production and also includes USD 0.6 million of 
corporate and social responsibility costs in relation  
to the Group’s community investment projects of 
education, health and the environment; offset by
iv) USD 0.1 million (2009: USD 2.2 million) of AIM listing 
fees, due to the listing in November 2009.
Impairments
The ongoing legal claims and production cessation in the 
Group’s Chinese Joint Venture have resulted in a prolonged 
delay to the fund raising process to acquire and consolidate 
the neighbouring pits. As a result the Directors have 
determined until such time there is more certainty around the 
legal status of the integrated CGMR JV licence and the 
required fund raising the recoverable amount from the 
investment should be written down in full.
Therefore, for the year ended 31 December 2010, an 
impairment of USD 50.0 million has been made in relation to 
the Chinese operations, of which USD 14.2 million was made 
in the period to 30 June 2010. This includes an impairment of 
USD 48.2 million to the Group’s share of the investment in the 
CGMR JV and an impairment of USD 1.2 million to receivables 
from the joint venture partner (note 9). 
In accordance with International Financial Reporting standards 
London Mining has written down its net investment in the Chile 
joint venture to USD nil. The provision is required because the 
portfolio of iron ore concessions and logistics opportunities being 
considered by the venture has changed since the initial 
investment. In accordance with accounting standards the initial 
investment cost is not able to be reassigned to new exploration 
and port concessions opportunities now being evaluated or 
obtained. This has resulted in an impairment of USD 11.6 million.
Loss on disposal of subsidiary
On 31 March 2010 the Company received net proceeds of 
USD 0.8 million in relation to the disposal of its investment in 
Compania Minera Suizo-Mexicana, SA de CV Ltd, (“CMSM”) a 
Mexican incorporated entity. CMSM has been deconsolidated 
from that date and a loss on disposal recognised of  
USD 0.2 million.
Fair value loss on deferred consideration
A cumulative loss for the year to date of USD 5.6 million has 
been recognised in respect of deferred London Mining share 
consideration payable on the acquisition of ICC. The loss 
arose due to the revaluation of deferred share consideration  
to market value reflecting the increase in the London Mining 
share price from acquisition to 31 December 2010, (note 25).
Taxation
A USD 1.3 million deferred tax asset has been recognised in 
the year, which relates to Sierra Leone carried forward losses 
which are expected to be utilised against future taxable profits.
2. Balance sheet
Intangible assets
Intangible assets increased from USD 49.3 million at 31 
December 2009 to USD 97.2 million at 31 December 2010. 
This is primarily the result of the acquisition of ICC which has 
added goodwill of USD 39.7 million and further assets of USD 
4.4 million. In addition there has been continued development 
at projects in Greenland, (USD 10.1 million drilling and 
feasibility study costs) and Saudi Arabia, (USD 7.3 million). 
Intangible assets in 2009 included USD 11.5 million related to 
Sierra Leone which have been transferred to Property, plant 
and equipment in 2010 in accordance with Group accounting 
policies when a project moves through to development.
Property, plant and equipment
Property plant and equipment increased from USD 3.6 million 
at 31 December 2009 to USD 81.1 million at 31 December 
2010. This is due to additions of USD 74.1 million for the 
Marampa project, of which USD 20.7 million was transferred 
from intangible assets (including the 2009 Sierra Leone 
opening intangible asset balance of USD 11.5 million). Further 
additions of USD 53.4 million have been made during the year, 
the result of ongoing construction and in particular for 
contracts and orders for the WHIMS plant, power generators 
and port facility. 
Investment in joint ventures and associate, loans and 
receivables and assets held for sale
The investments in CGMR JV and Atacama have been written 
down to a USD nil value as at 31 December 2010 – see note 24.
At 31 December 2009, London Mining had a convertible loan 
due from DMC Energy (Proprietary) Limited (“DMC Energy”) 
and a 39.3% associate investment in DMC Coal Mining (Pty) 
Limited (“DMC Coal”). On 13 January 2010 London Mining 
converted the loan and equity investment in DMC Coal into an 
associate investment of 28.0% (now diluted to 27.5%) of the 
issued share capital of Delta Mining Consolidated Limited 
(“DMC Group”).
On 23 April 2010, London Mining accepted an offer from 
Sable Mining Africa Limited (“Sable”) of USD 24.8 million  
in cash for its interest in DMC Group, (“DMC”) pending 
regulatory approval. As a result the investment in DMC  
at 31 December 2010 is classified as held for sale.  24
Overview
Operational and financial review
Corporate governance
Financial statements
Under the terms of a downside protection agreement between 
the CEO and CFO of DMC, London Mining is entitled to an 
additional amount of USD 15.2 million. Approval was received 
from The South African Regulatory Bank in respect of 
enforcement of the downside protection agreement in August 
2010. No reversal of the previous USD 6.0 million impairment 
made in Q2 2009, nor upwards revaluation of the carrying 
value has been made to reflect the full value of the protection 
agreement as London Mining is currently in the process of 
enforcing the downside protection agreement against the CEO 
and CFO.
Deferred consideration payable
The USD 24.3 million non-current deferred consideration 
relates to the acquisition of ICC and comprises potential 
deferred cash and non-cash share consideration, the vesting 
of which are subject to performance milestones, (note 25).
Movements in equity
Share capital and the merger reserve have increased due to 
the issue of 3.5 million shares as a non-cash transaction as 
part of the consideration for the acquisition of ICC. Since 
31 December 2009 there have been 676,666 shares issued, 
500,000 in relation to the exercise of warrants and 176,666 in 
relation to exercised options by London Mining employees, 
resulting in a net cash inflow of USD 1.7 million.
The shares held in the employee benefit trust reserve have 
decreased by USD 8.8 million as a result of:
A reduction of USD 10.0 million as a result of the transfer   >
of 4.7 million shares held by the trust to the CEO following 
the vesting and subsequent exercise of his nil-cost share 
awards. The transfer is at the weighted average cost of  
the total shares held by the trust;
A reduction of USD 5.5 million from sale proceeds of   >
1.8 million shares sold on behalf of the CEO to fund part of 
the tax arising on the exercise of the nil cost share awards, 
(sales proceeds of USD 5.0 million) and a USD 3.0 million 
reduction from the sale of 1.0 million shares, (sales 
proceeds of USD 4.9 million); offset by
USD 9.7 million increase arising from 2.6 million shares  >
purchased by the Trust during the period.
The warrant and option reserve has decreased by USD 3.0 
million during the year due to USD 5.8 million of share based 
payment charges on exercised options being transferred into 
retained earnings, which is partially offset by the USD 2.8 
million of share based payment charge in the period.
3. Cash flow
Total cash decreased during the year by USD 127.9 million 
(excluding foreign exchange) to USD 76.0 million 
In summary the net decrease in cash during the year resulted 
from: 
USD 29.6 million net outflow from operating activities,  >
(2009: USD 22.8 million outflow);
USD 98.1 million net outflow from investing activities,  >
(2009: USD 77.7 million outflow); and
USD 0.2 million net outflow from financing activities,   >
(2009: USD 12.0 million outflow). 
Operating cash outflow
The USD 29.6 million operating cash outflow has arisen  
from the USD 99.6 million net loss for the year adjusted for 
non-cash and non-operating items, including:
USD 61.7 impairment charges; >
USD 5.6 million fair value loss on deferred consideration; >
USD 2.8 million share based payment expense; >
USD 1.3 million deferred tax credit; >
 Financial review 
continued 25
USD 1.0 million depreciation; >
USD 1.0 million share of loss from joint ventures and  >

USD 1.1 million outflow from working capital. >
Investing cash outflows
Investing cash flows for the year included:
A total of USD 82.3 million spent on intangible assets and  >
property, plant and equipment, reflecting the ongoing 
development of projects including:
USD 52.1 million Marampa, Sierra Leone; –
USD 10.4 million Wadi Sawawin, Saudi Arabia; –
USD 11.3 million Isua, Greenland; and –
USD 7.5 million ICC, Colombia. –
USD 6.5 million loans provided to fund acquisition and  >
exploration in relation to the Chilean joint venture (note 16);
USD 5.1 million net cash outflow in respect of the  >
acquisition of ICC; and
USD 5.5 million payment of previously accrued transaction  >
costs in relation to the 2008 Brazil disposal stated net of 
proceeds from the Mexico disposal of USD 0.8 million.
For the year ended 31 December 2009 the investing cash flow 
included an amount of USD 44.5 million in respect of the 
acquisition and funding of the CGMR JV (note 16).
Financing cash outflow
Net cash outflow from financing activities of USD 0.2 million  
is a result of:
USD 9.9 million inflow into the employee benefit trust from  >
the sale of shares;
USD 1.7 million inflow from the exercise of warrants and  >
options; 
USD 9.7 million outflow from the purchase of shares by   >
the employment benefit trust; and
USD 2.1 million outflow in relation to arrangement fees   >
for the revolving credit facility.
4. Liquidity and going concern
At 31 December 2010 the Group had cash of USD 76.0 
million and no material drawn down borrowings.
In February 2011 the Company received the proceeds (net of 
costs) of a USD 110.0 million offering of unsecured convertible 
bonds, repayable in 2016. The bonds carry a coupon of 8% per 
annum, payable semi-annually in arrears and will be convertible 
into London Mining Plc shares at a conversion price of GBP 
4.84 per share, representing a 38% premium to the average 
market price on the date of offering. 100% of the bonds’ 
principal amount, unless previously converted, redeemed or 
purchased and cancelled, will be redeemed on maturity. London 
Mining has the right to redeem all outstanding bonds at par 
together with accrued interest from three years after the closing 
date at any time as long as the share price exceeds 130% of the 
conversion price for more than 20 out of 30 consecutive trading 
days or if 15% or less of the bonds remains outstanding.
On 15 October 2010 London Mining announced that it had 
concluded a USD 60.0 million two year revolving credit facility 
arranged by Standard Chartered Bank, (“SCB”). The facility is 
subject to certain conditions precedent which the Directors 
expect to be fully satisfied in Q2 2011.
London Mining has sufficient cash resources in conjunction with 
the expected receipt of USD 24.8 million proceeds from the sale 
of DMC, convertible bond and SCB facility to deliver Phase 1a 
tailings production at Sierra Leone; to accelerate Phase 1b 
expansion; to fund the Phase 2 bankable feasibility study; and for 
initial coke production and exploration activity in Colombia in 
accordance with the Group’s reported timetable.
Production funding for the more capital intensive projects in 
Greenland and Saudi Arabia will be sought from external 
funding into these projects directly. London Mining is seeking 
funds to finance a 15Mtpa BFS in 2011 for the Isua project, 
with financial and strategic partners being considered. Royal 
Bank of Canada and Macquarie are advising on the process 
for selecting a funding partner.
External funding of the CGMR JV is still needed to finance the 
required consolidation and growth of the Chinese operations. 
London Mining is investigating bringing in a Chinese partner to 
operate the mine in return for equity in the business, and it is in 
discussions with several parties regarding this approach.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of 
reasonably possible changes in trading performance and the 
timing of project commissioning, show that the Group has 
sufficient committed liquidity even without reliance on the SCB 
facility, to fund its committed expenditure and will be able to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going  
concern basis. 
5. Change in accounting policy
For the year ended 31 December 2010 the Group has changed 
its accounting policy to account for joint ventures using the 
equity method rather than the proportionate consolidation 
method to better reflect the way in which the Group now 
manages and reviews its investment in joint ventures. Results  
for the year ended 31 December 2009 and 2010 have been 
restated to reflect this change in accounting policy. 
Previously the Group had recognised revenues, costs, assets 
and liabilities on a proportionate consolidation basis, these 
items have now been consolidated into share of results of joint 
ventures in the income statement and Investment in Joint 
ventures and associates on the balance sheet (note 5).
6. Related party transactions
Related party transactions are disclosed in note 32.

Principal risks  
and uncertainties
London Mining is exposed to a variety of 
risks and uncertainties which can have 
a financial, operational or reputational 
impact on the Group and which may 
also impact the achievement of social, 
economic and environmental objectives. 
The principle risks and uncertainties 
facing the Group have been categorised 
into headline risk areas. The Group’s risk 
management policies and procedures 
are also discussed in the corporate 
governance statement on page 38. 
Risks
1. Mineral reserves and resources
2. Dependence on licences
5. Environmental risk and hazards
3. Commodity prices
6. Foreign operations 
8. Insurance and uninsured risk 
4. Government regulations 
7. Joint ventures
9. Dependence on key personnel
10. Liquidity and counterparty risk 
11. Currency risk  27
Description of risks
There are a number of uncertainties inherent in estimating mineral reserves and mineral resources, including many factors beyond the 
Group’s control. Such estimation is a subjective process, and the accuracy of any reserve or resource estimate is a function of the 
quantity and quality of available data and of the assumptions made and judgments used in engineering and geological interpretation. 
There can be no assurance that mineral resources can be upgraded to proven or probable mining reserves and recovered. 
The Group is dependent on the granting and renewal of mining and exploration licences in order to explore for and produce 
mineral resources from the assets of the Group and its joint venture companies. Failure to obtain a licence, revocation of an 
existing licence or failure to renew a licence could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial performance. 
The Group is exposed to environmental risk, for example in the form of dust suppression, carbon emissions and deforestation. 
Failure to adequately manage environmental risks could result in fines or penalties, environmental remediation or in certain cases 
government authorities forcing closure of mines on a temporary or permanent basis.
The market price of the Company’s shares, financial results, exploration, development and operating activities have previously 
been, and may in the future be, significantly adversely affected by declines in commodity prices.
The Group currently has interests in exploration, development and operating projects in Sierra Leone, Greenland, Colombia, 
Saudi Arabia, China and Chile. Therefore the activities of the Group are exposed to varying degrees of political and economic 
risk and other risks and uncertainties. 
Although the Group maintains insurance to protect against certain risks in such amounts as it considers reasonable and seeks  
to ensure that its joint venture companies in which it invests do likewise, such insurance will not cover all the potential risks 
associated with a mining Group’s operations and may not be adequate to cover any particular liability.
The exploration, development and operating activities of the Group are subject to various laws governing exploration, development, 
mining, processing, taxes, labour standards and occupational health and safety, toxic substances, transportation on land use, water 
use, land claims of local people and other matters. Although the Group believes that the activities are currently being carried out in 
accordance with all applicable laws, no assurance can be given that new rules and regulations will not be enacted or that existing 
rules and regulations will not be applied in a manner which could limit or curtail production or development. 
Joint ventures involve special risks. The risks may be associated with the possibility that the Group’s joint venture partners may (i) 
have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with or opposed to those of the Group, (ii) exercise veto rights 
so as to block actions that the Group believes to be in its or the joint venture’s best interests, (iii) take action contrary to the 
Group’s policies or objectives with respect to its investments, or (iv) as a result of financial or other difficulties, be unable or 
unwilling to fulfil their obligations under the joint venture or other agreements. 
The success of the Group is dependent on its senior management. The experience of these individuals will be a factor 
contributing to the Group’s continued success and growth. The loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s business prospects.
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group and the joint venture companies in which it invests may not be able to meet their liabilities as 
they fall due and as a result, cease trading. The Group’s policy on overall liquidity is to ensure that there are committed funds in 
place which, when combined with available cash resources, are sufficient to meet the funding requirements for the foreseeable 
future. The Group expects its Greenland, Saudi Arabia and Chinese projects to raise external finance to fund development. If this 
finance is not raised, then the timing of these or other projects may have to be delayed, or the Group may need to raise additional 
financing or seek to recover its investment through other means.  
The Group is also exposed to counterparty risk from customers or holders of cash that could result in financial losses should those 
counterparties become unable to meet their obligations to the Group. The Group uses multiple banks to diversify its counterparty risk. 
The Company’s functional currency is United States Dollars (“USD”). Iron ore sales and the sales of other minerals and metals 
are typically denominated in USD while the Group’s costs are incurred in several currencies. The Group may undertake hedging 
activities against these potential fluctuations. However, there are no assurances that hedging strategies, if implemented, would be 
successful.  28

Corporate governance statement
1. Governance of London Mining Plc
London Mining Plc (the “Company”) is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance. 
The Company has adopted a common approach to corporate governance to comply with regulatory obligations associated with its 
listing on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange (“AIM”) and the Oslo Axess of the Oslo Stock Exchange (“Oslo Axess”). 
Whilst not a mandatory requirement of the Company’s listing on AIM, the Directors have chosen to apply the Combined Code on 
Corporate Governance published by the UK Financial Reporting Council in June 2008 (the “Combined Code”) to promote good 
corporate governance, where considered practical for a company of its size and development stage of the mining cycle. 
The Directors have also applied section 13.2.2(5) of the Continuing Obligations of Stock Exchange Listed Companies published 
by the Oslo Stock Exchange. In its application, the Company is exempt from applying the Norwegian Code of Practice for 
Corporate Governance published on 21 October 2009 (the “Norwegian Code”) on the basis that the Norwegian Code shares 
common corporate governance themes with the Combined Code. 
Adherence to the Combined Code is based on a “comply or explain” principle, whereby companies are expected to comply with 
the recommendations or explain why they have chosen an alternative approach. Below is a summary of the departures from the 
Combined Code with an explanation of how the Company’s actual practices contribute to good corporate governance.
2. Combined Code compliance
The Company has scoped out its investments in joint ventures for the purpose of these Corporate Governance disclosures as 
permitted by the Turnbull Guidance on internal controls. 
The Company is in compliance with the provisions of section 1 of the Combined Code as at 31 December 2010 except for:
A.1.3. the Non-Executive Directors have not yet met to appraise the Chairman’s performance in the year. The Nomination  >
Committee did however evaluate the Board, its structure and its committees and made recommendations to the Board. 
A.6 The Board did not undertake a formal annual evaluation of its own performance and that of its committees and individual  >
Directors.
C.2.1 The Audit Committee has not performed a formal review of the effectiveness of the system of internal controls,  >
(see section 5 below for mitigating circumstances). 
Areas of non-compliance in relation to Director’s remuneration are included in the remuneration report on page 41 at paragraph 4.
3. The Board of Directors
3.1 Membership
Following the changes described above at the date of this report, the Board consists of nine Directors: four Executive Directors 
and five Non-Executive Directors including the Chairman. The names, skills, experience and expertise of each Director together 
with their terms in office are shown in the biographical details on pages 28 and 29. 
3.2 Roles and responsibilities
The main responsibilities of the Board include but are not limited to:
providing strategic direction for the Company; >
overseeing the Company’s systems of internal control, governance and risk management; >
evaluating the performance of executive management; and >
monitoring and facilitating the operation of the audit, nomination, and remuneration committees. >
The Directors have agreed a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for the Board which can be viewed in the corporate 
governance section of the Company’s website at www.londonmining.co.uk. These decisions include but are not limited to the 
approval of the Company’s annual business plan and budget, major changes to the Company’s corporate structure, approval of the 
Company’s Annual Report and treasury policy and the approval of major capital expenditure. Responsibility for the day-to-day 
management of the Company rests with the executive team.
Directors receive timely, regular and appropriate management information to enable them to fulfil their duties and have access to 
the advice of the Company Secretary. The Board has agreed guidelines for Directors to obtain independent professional advice if 
they seek it at the Company’s expense. 36
Overview

3.3 Board independence
The Combined Code requires that small companies should have at least two independent non-executive Directors. Three of the 
Company’s five non-executive Directors, (Dr. Colin Knight, Malcolm Groat and Dr. Hans Schønwandt) are not considered 
independent. Dr Colin Knight as Chairman is  not considered to be independent. Dr. Hans Schønwandt has been a consultant to 
the Company and is not considered to be independent and Malcolm Groat was an executive Director of the Company (Finance 
Director) within the last 5 years. The Company considers that whilst Hans Schønwandt and Malcolm Groat are not considered 
independent, their appointment as non-executive Directors enhances the overall strength of the Board and outweighs any 
perceived compromise to their independence. 
Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Bt DL and Graham Mascall are both considered to be independent having not had any previous connection 
with the Company prior to their appointments to the Board. The Board is of the opinion that Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Bt DL and 
Graham Mascall remain independent with regards to their character and judgement.
 
In keeping with the entrepreneurial nature of the Company the Board is keen to ensure that Directors interests are in alignment 
with the interests of shareholders and, therefore, it has been the Board’s practice to issue share options to Directors. The Board 
has not considered that this practice impairs the independence of non-executive directors however it is aware that the granting of 
share options to non-executive Directors is not consistent with the Combined Code. It is therefore the Remuneration Committee’s 
and the Board’s aim, in 2011, to find a more appropriate way, in future, to remunerate non-executive Directors such that their 
interests are aligned with the interests of shareholders and also to fulfil the requirements of  the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
As noted below, the Board also intends to appoint further independent non-executive Directors in due course which will 
strengthen independence of the Board.
3.4 Board Structure and performance
The Board has, on the recommendation of the nomination committee, reviewed the structure, size and composition of the Board 
and the effectiveness of Board committees. As a result of this evaluation the Board has reassessed the membership of each of its 
Committees. The Board has also recognised the need to appoint further Non-Executive Directors and intends to appoint 
additional independent Non-Executive Directors to the Board in due course. 
3.5 Election and re–election of Board members
Directors are elected by shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting after their appointment and, after that, offer themselves 
for re-election by a vote of shareholders at least once every three years. Graham Hossie and Colin Knight will retire by rotation at 
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and, being re-eligible offer themselves for re-election. Graham Mascall will be offering 
himself for election as this will be the first AGM since his appointment on 1 May 2010. Luciano Ramos and Benjamin Lee will also 
be offering themselves for election as this will also be the first AGM since their appointments on 23 February 2011.
3.6 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separate and the division of their responsibilities has been formally 
approved by the Board. 
The Combined Code recommends that the Chairman by definition of the role should be independent on appointment. The 
Chairman was independent on appointment but is no longer deemed independent. However the Board is satisfied that the 
current composition still contributes to good corporate governance for reasons discussed in the section ‘Board independence’.
4. Committees of the Board
The Company has the following Board committees in operation: the audit committee, nomination committee, remuneration 
committee and investment committee. These committees are governed by terms of reference which are agreed by the Board and 
can be viewed in the corporate governance section of the Company’s website at www.londonmining.co.uk. All Board committees 
are required to report to the Board of Directors.
4.1 Audit committee
The audit committee is chaired by Malcom Groat and consists of Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Bt DL, Dr. Colin Knight and Graham 
Mascall as committee members. 
Of the committee members, Graham Mascall and Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Bt DL are considered independent. As a fellow of the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales who qualified with Price Waterhouse, Malcolm Groat is considered to 
have recent and relevant financial experience. 
Corporate governance statement continued 37
The role of the audit committee is to ensure the integrity of financial reporting, review internal controls and risk management systems, 
consider the need for and manage the Company’s internal audit function, review with the external auditors the scope and results of 
their audit, make recommendations to the Board and shareholders in relation to the appointment, reappointment and removal of the 
Company’s external auditor and to assess the Company’s arrangements for whistle-blowing and detecting fraud. 
During 2010, following a review, the audit committee concluded that given the continued growth and development of the 
Company, an internal audit function would be beneficial to the Company. As such London Mining has established the 
responsibilities of the Internal Audit function which will be staffed during H1 2011. 
The Board has approved a formal whistle-blowing policy that enables employees to raise concerns they may have about 
workplace fraud or mismanagement on a confidential basis. The Chairman of the audit committee is provided with reports from 
the whistleblowing system. The whistleblowing policy has been communicated to all of London Mining’s subsidiaries and 
employees.
The audit committee monitors the relationship with the Company’s external auditors relating to the provision of non-audit services 
to ensure that auditor objectivity and independence is safeguarded. This is achieved by disclosure of the extent and nature of 
non-audit services (see note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and the prohibition of selected services by the external 
auditor. The audit committee has considered information pertaining to the balance between fees for audit and non-audit work for 
the Company in 2010 and concluded that the nature and extent of non-audit fees do not present a threat to the external auditor’s 
objectivity or independence.
 
The appointment of Deloitte LLP as the Group’s external auditors (incumbents since the last tendering process in 2008) is kept 
under annual review by the audit committee. 
The committee’s assessment of the external auditors’ performance and independence underpins its recommendation to the 
Board to propose to shareholders the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as auditors until the conclusion of the AGM in 2012. 
Resolutions to authorise the Board to re-appoint and determine their remuneration will be proposed at the AGM on 13 May 2011.
4.2 Nomination committee
The nomination committee is chaired by Dr. Colin Knight and consists of Sir Nicholas Bonsor Bt DL, Malcolm Groat and Graham 
Mascall as committee members. Dr. Hans Schønwandt stepped down as a member of the committee during the year.
The main role of the nomination committee is to review regularly the structure, size and composition of the Board and to give 
consideration to succession planning for Directors and other Senior Executives. It reviews the leadership needs of the Company, 
both executive and Non-Executive and consults with external search consultants as required, to fill vacancies as they arise. During 
the year the Nomination Committee reviewed the structure, size and composition of the Board’s committees and made 
recommendations to the Board on the composition of these Committees. The Nomination Committee also made 
recommendations to Board on its own composition.
The nomination committee also reviews the time required to be committed to Company business by Non-Executive Directors and 
assesses whether they are devoting enough time to fulfil their duties.
The Non-Executive Directors, led by Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Bt DL (Deputy Chairman) are responsible for the appointment and 
performance evaluation of the Chairman, taking into account the views of the Executive Directors.
4.3 Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee is chaired by Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Bt DL and consists of Dr. Colin Knight, Malcolm Groat and 
Graham Mascall as committee members. Dr. Hans Schønwandt stepped down as a member of the committee during the year.
Of the committee members Graham Mascall and Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Bt DL are considered independent. 
The remuneration committee is responsible for establishing and developing the remuneration policy for the Company’s executives 
and key management and for determining specific remuneration packages for Executive Directors. No Director or executive 
employee is involved in deciding their own remuneration. 
The Director’s remuneration report, setting out the Company’s policy on executive remuneration, is set out on pages 40 to 44. 
A resolution to approve the remuneration report will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM. 38

 Appointed to the Board on 1 May 2010.
Ten further ad hoc Board meetings convened at short notice were held in the year to deal with ad hoc commercial matters. 
4.5 Investment committee
The Company has also formed a separate investment committee to appraise significant acquisition and project expenditure 
opportunities. 
5. Internal controls & risk management
The Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls and risk management systems to safeguard 
shareholders’ investment and Company assets. 
Internal controls are designed and maintained to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting  
and the preparation and fair presentation of the Company’s published financial statements in accordance with IFRS. Because  
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance, and may not detect all 
misstatements whether caused by error or fraud. 
Although Executive and key management understand well the financial, operational and compliance risks of the Group, currently 
London Mining is not in strict compliance with the Turnbull Guidance in respect of having a formally documented risk matrix which  
is presented to the Board for discussion. Operational risk is managed at the business unit level and any material risks are regularly 
discussed with the Board. As part of the Group’s commitment to comply with the Combined Code in all practical aspects, the Group 
will establish an internal audit function during 2011, one of the key responsibilities of which will be the implementation of formally 
documented risk management. Details of the Company’s approach to financial risk can be found in note 30 to the financial statements. 
 
During the year the Board did not perform a formal review of the effectiveness of internal control and was therefore not in strict 
compliance with the Combined Code. During 2010 however, executive management implemented a full review of business level 
controls, with a specific focus in relation to the Sierra Leone operations. This review includes a full assessment of organisational 
structure and operational readiness as the operation targets production during 2011 and is currently being performed in conjunction 
with a leading external consultant. Following the completion of this review and recommended actions the Board will perform a full 
effectiveness review of the systems of internal control in 2011.
Details of risks that the Company is exposed to are set out in the operational and financial review on pages 26 and 27.
 
Corporate governance statement continued 39
6. Relations with shareholders
The Company is committed to maintaining the highest standards of disclosure ensuring that all investors and potential investors 
have the same access to high quality, relevant information in an accessible and timely manner to assist them in making informed 
decisions. The investor relations department manages the flow of information to all investors and potential investors and regular 
presentations take place at the time of the quarterly, half year and final results as well as during the rest of the year.
Any concerns raised by a shareholder in relation to the Company and its affairs are communicated to the Board.
Copies of announcements to the stock exchanges on which the Company is listed, investor presentations, interim financial 
reports, the Annual Report and other relevant information are posted to the Company’s website at www.londonmining.co.uk
Shareholders will have the opportunity at the forthcoming AGM to put questions to the Board, including the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director and the Chairmen of the audit, remuneration and nomination committees.  40

Directors’ remuneration report
Unaudited information
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006. 
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the 
Board has applied the principles relating to Directors’ remuneration in the Combined Code. A resolution to approve the report 
will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Company’s members on certain parts of the Directors’ remuneration report and to 
state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Accounting 
Regulations. The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
1. Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee has powers delegated to it by the Board which are reflected in its terms of reference. These terms 
of reference are available on the Company’s website at www.londonmining.co.uk.
The duties of the remuneration committee include the consideration of all material elements of remuneration policy, remuneration and 
incentives of Executive Directors and senior employees with reference to independent remuneration research and professional 
advice in accordance with the Combined Code. The Committee will make recommendations to the Board on the framework for 
executive remuneration and its cost. 
The Board is responsible for implementing the recommendations of the remuneration committee and agreeing the remuneration 
packages of individual Directors. Directors are not permitted to vote on their own terms and conditions of remuneration. Non-
Executive Directors’ fees will be determined by the Chairman and the executive members of the Board.
1.1 Composition of the remuneration committee
The members of the remuneration committee are:
Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Bt DL (chairman) >
Dr Colin Knight >
Malcolm Groat >
Graham Mascall  >
Dr. Hans Schønwandt stepped down as a member of the committee during the year and Graham Mascall was appointed in his place.
None of the remuneration committee members have any personal financial interest (other than as shareholders), conflicts of 
interest arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the Company. 
Under its terms of reference the remuneration committee must meet at least twice each year. During the year ended 
31 December 2010, the committee met four times and the following issues were discussed: 
Review of the market competitiveness of the remuneration policy and the remuneration arrangements for the Executive Directors and  >
senior management;
Review of the salary levels of Executive Directors and senior management; >
Agreement of annual bonuses payable to Executive Directors >
Agreement of how the annual bonus plan will operate in 2011; and >
Grants of share options awarded to Executive Directors and other employees.  >
2. Responsibilities of the remuneration committee and remuneration policy
Remuneration policy is designed to attract and retain high calibre Executive Directors and Senior Executives and to motivate them to 
develop and implement business strategy. Individual remuneration packages are structured to align rewards with the performance of 
the Company and the interests of shareholders. The Committee is responsible for considering and making recommendations to the 
Board on:
determining the framework or Board policy for remuneration of the Company’s Executive Directors and key management; >
ensuring appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and that individual contributions to the success of the  >
Company are rewarded in a fair and responsible manner;
determining targets for any performance related pay schemes and approving total annual payments made under such schemes; >
reviewing the design of all share incentive plans and determine the awards to be made; >
ensuring that contractual terms on termination are fair to the individual and the Company and that failure is not rewarded; >
ensuring that salaries are set a market competitive level by benchmarking against appropriate competitors; and >
ensuring that the overall package reflects market practice and takes into account the levels of remuneration elsewhere in the Group. > 41
3. Components of Executive Directors’ remuneration 
Executive Directors’ remuneration consists of basic salary, bonus payments, share options and benefits under the Company’s 
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). None of the Directors serving during the year received any remuneration in respect of post-
retirement benefits.
Bonuses are payable based on the remuneration committee’s assessment of the general overall performance of individual 
Executive Directors and in addition on the attainment of certain pre-set quantitatively measured objectives.
The target annual bonus payable to the Chief Executive Officer that is linked to share price performance targets is up to 100% of 
annual base salary. Additional special bonuses may be awarded for achievement of significant operational and corporate 
development milestones at the discretion of the remuneration committee. 
The Chief Financial Officer may receive a contractual annual bonus of up to £50,000 at the discretion of the remuneration 
committee. Additional discretionary bonuses may be awarded to the Chief Financial Officer for the achievement of significant 
operational and corporate development milestones that the remuneration committee has determined the Chief Financial Officer  
to have taken an active role in. 
The Non-Executive Directors do not receive remuneration in bonuses.
3.1 Share options
Grants of share options are made to Directors employed directly by the Company and to entities providing the services of Directors 
in terms of the London Mining Plc No. 1 Share Option Plan and the London Mining Plc No. 2 Share Option Plan respectively. 
A Joint Share Option Plan, (“JSOP”) has also been adopted during 2010 and an employee benefit trust (the London Mining Plc 
Long Term Incentive Trust 2010) was set up to assist in the operation of the JSOP. An Approved Company Share Option Plan 
(the “CSOP”) was approved by HM Revenue & Customs on 17 May 2010 and approved by the shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting held on 30 April 2010. 
The remuneration committee has responsibility for supervising the schemes and approving the grant of options under their terms. 
The grants under the Company’s share option plans and awards under the LTIP fall within the maximum limit of ten percent of 
share capital that may be awarded for share incentive programmes. 
3.2 Long term incentive plan (LTIP)
Grants of shares under the Company’s LTIP are made to executive management as approved by the remuneration committee. 
A trust deed has been formalised with Fenlight Trustees, an independent company, and a Trust has been established to facilitate 
the operations of the LTIP. Funds are lent by the Company to the Trust to fund the acquisition of shares.
4. Compliance with the Combined Code
During the year under review the Company complied with the detailed code provisions set out under Section B of the Combined 
Code except as follows:
The Combined Code recommends share options and awards should not vest in less than three years. During 2010 options  >
were awarded to certain employees that could, subject to the meeting of specific performance criteria, vest in less than three 
years. This is considered appropriate to align employee incentives with Company objectives.
The Combined Code recommends that all incentive schemes, including new grants under existing share option schemes,  >
should be subject to challenging performance criteria reflecting the Company’s objectives. In 2010 a minority portion of share 
options awarded to certain employees were not subject to specific performance criteria, for each individual employee the 
majority of awards were however subject to performance criteria. In addition during 2010 options were awarded to  
Non-Executive Directors which were not subject to any performance criteria as it was not considered appropriate to set 
performance criteria for Non-Executive Directors on the basis it would compromise their independence. 
The Directors are eligible for bonuses which are based on the achievement of specific milestones, the limits of which are not  >
pre–determined in underlying employment contracts. These are determined by the remuneration committee after a detailed 
appraisal of the Company’s overall performance and achieved milestones during the year. In addition elements of their bonus 
arrangements do not include specified performance criteria but are awarded based on individual contribution which is 
assessed and approved by the remuneration committee.
The number of share options and awards to which Directors are entitled to be granted are not subject to specific performance  >
criteria. Awards are based on individual contribution and are assessed and approved by the remuneration committee. 42

6. Remuneration policy for Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration is approved by the Board as a whole on the recommendation of the Chairman and 
Executive Directors. Remuneration is sufficient to attract and retain high calibre Non-Executive Directors and is compared to 
Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration of similar sized mining companies.
7. Directors contracts
Executive Directors have indefinite term contracts, with the Chief Executive Officer having a termination period of 12 months  
and the Chief Financial Officer a termination period of six months. Both contracts provide for a termination payment in excess of 
12 months’ salary in the result of change of control of the Company. 43

Directors’ remuneration report continued 45
Statement of directors’ responsibility
For the year ended 31 December 2010
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors are 
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the Parent Company financial 
statements under IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the Directors must not approve the accounts 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
properly select and apply accounting policies; >
present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable  >
information; 
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to  >
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. >
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
the financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, give a true and fair view of  >
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development and  >
performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Corporate governance
Financial statements
We have audited the financial statements of London Mining Plc for the year ended 31 December 2010 which comprise the 
consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated balance sheet, the 
consolidated statement of changes in equity, the consolidated cash flow statement and the related notes 1 to 34, the Parent 
Company balance sheet, the Parent Company statement of changes in equity, the Parent Company cash flow statement and the 
related notes 1 to 34. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company 
financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31  >
December 2010 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;
the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; >
the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European  >
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. >
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in 
our opinion:

Other matters
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 that would have applied were the Company a quoted company.
Although not required to do so, the Directors have voluntarily chosen to make a corporate governance statement detailing the 
extent of their compliance with the June 2008 Combined Code. We reviewed:
the Directors’ statement, contained within the Directors’ report, in relation to going concern;  >
the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June  >
2008 Combined Code specified for our review; and
certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on Directors’ remuneration. >

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
1. General information
London Mining Plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act and listed on the AIM stock 
exchange and Oslo Axess stock exchange. The address of the registered office is 39 Sloane Street, London, SW1X 9LP. The 
nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in note 6 and in the operational and financial review on 
pages 10 to 27.
Going concern
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate funding resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the condensed financial statements, (see page 32 of the Directors Report).
2. New and revised International Financial Reporting Standards
(a) Adoption of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards
In the year ended 2010 the Group has adopted the following new standards:
IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2008)
In the current period the Group has adopted IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2008) in accounting for business combinations. 
The change in accounting policy has been applied prospectively. The May 2010 ICC acquisition has been accounted for in 
accordance with the revised standard. Goodwill has been measured as the fair value of the consideration transferred less the net 
recognised amount of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date (see note 25). Transaction 
costs, other than those associated with the issue of equity securities, were expensed as incurred.
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (2008)
In the current period the Group has adopted IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (2008) for accounting for 
non-controlling interests. The change in accounting policy has been applied prospectively and there was no impact on the 
Group’s results in the current period. From 1 January 2010, acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as 
transactions with equity holders in their capacity of equity holders and therefore no goodwill is recognised.
There are no other standards or interpretations which apply for the first time in the year ended 31 December 2010 which are 
expected to have a material impact on the Group.
(b) New IFRS accounting standards and interpretations not yet adopted
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied 
in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not been adopted by the EU):
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013)
IAS 24 (Revised) Related party disclosures (effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011)
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on 
the financial statements of the Group.
3. Significant accounting policies
(a) Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). The 
financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group 
financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments which are 
measured at fair value. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. 
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption under section 405 of the Companies Act 2006 and consequently the income 
statement of the Parent Company is not presented as part of these financial statements. The net loss recorded by the Parent 
Company for the financial year amounted to USD 94.3 million (2009 loss: USD 19.0 million).
(b) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the 
Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern 
the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. 53
3. Significant accounting policies continued
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are presented separately from the Group’s equity. 
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the 
non-controlling interest’s share of changes in equity since the date of the combination.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the 
effective date of acquisition, or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line 
with those used by the Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
(c) Investments in joint ventures and associates
A joint venture entity is an entity in which the Group holds a long term interest and shares joint control over the strategic, financial 
and operating decisions with one or more other ventures under a contractual arrangement.
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control, through 
participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee. 
For the year ended 31 December 2010 the Group changed its accounting policy for joint ventures to equity accounting from 
proportionate consolidation, see note 5.
The results, assets and liabilities of joint ventures and investments in associates are incorporated in the financial statements 
using the equity method of accounting. Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by 
post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of 
individual investments.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of fair values of the identifiable assets of the associate at the date of 
acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for 
impairment as part of that investment. If the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the 
date of acquisition exceeds the cost of acquisition the difference is credited in the income statement in the period of acquisition. 
(d) Foreign currencies
The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
it operates.
Transactions entered into by Group entities in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency are recorded at the rates of 
exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items carried at 
fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when fair value was 
determined. Exchange differences are recognised in the consolidated income statement in the period in which they arise.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are 
translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average 
exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates 
at the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and are recognised in the 
Group’s foreign exchange reserve. On disposal these exchange differences are recycled to form part of the Group’s calculation 
of the profit and loss on disposal.
(e) Business combinations and goodwill arising thereon
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the 
aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments 
issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. The 
acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date. 54
Overview
Operational and financial review
Corporate governance
Financial statements
3. Significant accounting policies continued
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the 
business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities 
recognised. If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the consolidated 
income statement.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the net fair 
value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
(f) Assets held for sale
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally 
through a sale transaction rather than continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when a sale is highly probable and 
the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale 
which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification. Disposal 
groups are groups of assets, and liabilities directly associated with those assets, that are to be disposed of together as a group in 
a single transaction. 
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are initially measured at the lower of carrying value and fair 
value less costs to sell. At subsequent reporting dates non-current assets (and disposal groups) are remeasured to the latest 
estimate of fair value less costs to sell. As a result of this remeasurement any impairment is recognised by charging to the 
Consolidated Income Statement, any increase in fair value is applied to reverse previous impairment charges on the non-current 
assets (or disposal groups) to a maximum of the original amortised cost. 
(g) Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the net invoice value of goods and is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable, after 
deducting discounts, volume rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes.
A sale is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed, and when revenue can be measured 
reliably. This is generally when title and any insurance risk have passed to the customer, and the goods have been delivered to a 
contractually agreed location.
(h) Finance income
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and foreign exchange gains. Interest income is recognised in the 
income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest rate method.
(i) Finance costs
Finance costs comprise interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest rate method, the accumulation of 
interest on provisions and foreign exchange losses.
(j) Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expenses that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted 
for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences 
and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of any deferred tax asset is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
continued 55
3. Significant accounting policies continued
(k) Intangible assets (exploration and evaluation expenditure)
The costs of exploration properties and leases, which include the cost of acquiring prospective properties and exploration rights, 
are capitalised as intangible assets.
Mineral rights and exploration and evaluation costs arise from expenditure incurred prior to development activities and include the 
cost of acquiring and maintaining the rights to explore, investigate, examine and evaluate an area for mineralisation. These costs 
include metallurgical testing, conducting geological and environmental studies, exploratory drilling and sampling, market studies, 
engineering consulting and other such costs incurred in evaluating the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a 
mineral resource. 
Mineral rights and exploration and evaluation expenditure are capitalised within intangible assets until such time that the activities 
have reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of commercially exploitable reserves. Once this 
has occurred, the respective costs previously held as intangible assets are transferred to mineral properties within property, plant 
and equipment. 
Capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is assessed for impairment in accordance with the indicators set out in IFRS 6 
Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Reserves. In circumstances where a property is abandoned, the cumulative costs 
relating to the property are written off.
(l) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Each item’s estimated useful life is based on the physical life limitation of the specific asset. Estimates of remaining useful lives 
are made on a regular basis for all mine buildings, plant and equipment, with annual reassessments for major items. Changes in 
estimates are accounted for prospectively and depreciation commences when the item is available for use.
Capitalisation ceases when commercial levels of production are achieved, at such point mineral properties are depreciated on a 
units of production basis.
Buildings and plant and equipment are depreciated down to their residual values at varying rates, on a straight line basis over 
their estimated useful lives or life of the mine, whichever is shorter. Estimated useful lives normally vary from up to 10 years for 
items of plant and equipment to a maximum of 25 years for buildings. Fixtures and fittings are depreciated over three years.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to 
arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) is included in the income statement in the year the item 
is derecognised. Assets under construction are capitalised and included as work in progress at purchase price plus directly 
attributable costs to bring the asset into working condition for its intended use. On completion construction in progress is 
transferred to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment.
(m) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of 
the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash 
flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which 
the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately in the consolidated income statement. 56
Overview
Operational and financial review
Corporate governance
Financial statements
3. Significant accounting policies continued
Goodwill arising on business combinations is allocated to the Group of cash generating units (“CGUs”) that are expected to 
benefit from the synergies of the combination and represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Group’s 
Board of Directors for internal management purposes. The recoverable amount of the CGUs or group of CGUs to which goodwill 
has been allocated is tested for impairment annually on a consistent date during each financial year, or when events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement. Impairments 
of goodwill are not subsequently reversed.
(n) Inventories
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes all costs incurred in the normal course of business 
in bringing each product to its present location and condition. Cost for raw materials and consumables is purchase price and for 
work in progress and finished goods is the cost of production, including the appropriate proportion of depreciation and 
overheads. Raw materials and consumables are stated on a first-in first-out (‘FIFO’) basis. The cost of work in progress and 
finished goods is based on the weighted average cost method. In the case of work in progress and finished goods, cost includes 
an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity. 
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any further costs expected to be 
incurred to completion and disposal.
(o) Receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value net of an appropriate allowance for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts. 
(p) Convertible loans and receivables
In the consolidated balance sheet, the Group’s financial assets have all been classified as ‘loans and receivables’. These are 
initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Derivatives embedded in financial instruments (including rights to covert loan receivables to equity investments) or non-financial 
host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of their host 
contracts and the host contracts themselves are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income 
statement. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognised immediately in the income statement. 
The Company’s financial asset investments include amounts owed by subsidiaries, classified as ‘loans and receivables’ and 
equity holdings in subsidiaries and associates, which are held at cost less any provision for impairment. Provision is raised 
against these assets when there is a doubt over future realisation as a result of a known event or circumstance.
(q) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and on demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that 
are readily convertible to a known amount of cash.
(r) Borrowings and convertible debt
Interest bearing bank borrowings are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct transaction costs. Finance charges are 
accounted for on an accruals basis and charged to the income statement using the effective interest method. They are added to 
the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Convertible bonds are regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability and an equity component. At the date of issue, 
the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt and is 
recorded within borrowings and carried at amortised cost. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bond 
and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the 
Group is included within equity.
(s) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value or amortised cost.
(t) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event for which it 
is probable that an outflow of an economic benefit will occur. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect 
is material.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements

3. Significant accounting policies continued
The Group has an obligation to incur restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs when environmental disturbance is 
caused by the development or ongoing production of a mining property. These costs are estimated on the basis of a formal 
closure plan and are subject to regular review. Such costs are discounted to net present value and are provided for and 
capitalised at the start of each project, as soon as the obligation to incur costs arises. Provision is not made for additional 
obligations expected to arise from future disturbance and costs of subsequent site damage created on an ongoing basis during 
production are provided for at their net present values and charged against profits as extraction progresses.
At the time of establishing the provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised and depreciated through operating costs. The 
provision is discounted to present value and the unwinding of the discount is included in finance costs.
(u) Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
(v) Share-based payments (including warrants)
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees and consultants. Equity-settled share-based 
payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair 
value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based 
vesting conditions. The fair value is determined at grant date by use of a Black Scholes Model and taking account of market 
based vesting conditions.
(w) Return Bonus Plan
The London Mining Return Bonus Plan (the “RBP”) was adopted by the Group on 4 September 2008. Under the RBP, cash 
bonus awards can be made to participants in the London Mining Plc Share Option Plan, the London Mining Plc No. 1 (employees 
only) Share Option Plan (together, the “Plans”) and the LTIP if either a special dividend or return of share capital is made by the 
Company (the “Return of Cash”) after the date of grant of the bonus award but prior to the exercise/vesting of the related option/
LTIP award granted under the Plans/LTIP and no compensating adjustment is made to such option/LTIP award to take account of 
the Return of Cash. Participants in the LTIP have the choice to participate in the RBP or to have a compensatory adjustment 
made to the number of their underlying awards.
The bonus awards granted under the RBP entitle participants to receive a cash payment equal to the number of Ordinary Shares 
under the related option/LTIP award multiplied by the aggregate amount due per Ordinary Share under the Return of Cash. The 
bonus awards vest and lapse in accordance with the terms of the related option/LTIP award held under the Plans/LTIP, and are 
accounted for in accordance with the Group’s policy for share-based payments, set out above.
4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and 
associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors which are considered to be relevant. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates.
(a) Impairment of assets
The Group reviews the carrying value of its intangible assets and property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets are impaired. The recoverable amount of those assets is measured at the higher of their fair value less 
costs to sell and value in use.
Directors necessarily apply their judgement in estimating the probability, timing and value of underlying cash flows and in 
selecting appropriate discount rates to be applied within the value in use calculation. Such estimates and forecasts include 
commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, capital expenditure, future commissioning dates, production targets, operating costs 
and timings for the granting of licences and permits. Subsequent changes to estimates and assumptions in the value in use 
calculation could impact the carrying value of the respective assets. 
The carrying value is also dependent on the estimate of mining reserves and resources, for which there are inherent uncertainties 
as the estimation is a subjective process based on the quality and quantity of available data. 58

4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
(b) Valuation of share-based payments
In order to value options and warrants granted, the Group has made judgements as to the volatility of its own Ordinary Shares, 
the probable life of the options and warrants granted and the time of exercise of those options and warrants. The Group has also 
made a judgement as to which methodology to use in valuing the options and warrants. During the year ended 31 December 
2010, the Group has changed the share option valuation method used to fair value the share-based payments to Black Scholes. 
In prior years, the bi-nominal method was applied. This has not had a material impact on these accounts.
(c) Tax provisions
Judgement is required in determining tax positions for the Group as it is subject to tax in several jurisdictions. Assessments are 
made on the advice of independent tax advisors and through consultation with relevant tax authorities. While the Directors believe 
that these estimates and forecasts are reasonable, actual results could vary significantly from these estimates.
(d) Estimation of provision for restoration and rehabilitation costs and timing of expenditure
Estimating the cost of settling the legal or constructive obligation for rehabilitation, including decommissioning and dismantling 
equipment and restoring the mine site from damage caused to the environment during the development can be complicated  
and subjective. These costs are likely to be significant and are likely to be impacted by future regulatory obligations, future 
technological developments and the future costs of engineers and other skilled labour. Determining the timing of future cash  
flows and an appropriate discount rate will also impact the provision required. 
Where Directors believe that the provisions for restoration and rehabilitation will be significant, the Group obtains third party 
valuations to estimate the likely cost. These judgements and estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the 
relevant facts and circumstances but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the financial statements.
5. Change in accounting policy in respect of joint ventures
London Mining has chosen to change its accounting policy for joint ventures from proportionate consolidation to equity 
accounting. This is due to management reassessing the manner in which it manages its joint ventures, as well as the expected 
amendment to IAS31 ‘Interests in Joint Ventures’ which is expected to eliminate the current choice between using proportionate 
consolidation or equity accounting, and mandating companies to use equity accounting only. 
This choice means that instead of the results of joint ventures being reported on a line-by-line basis in both the income statement 
and balance sheet, the Group’s share of results of joint ventures and associates (net of tax) are instead disclosed on a single line. 
This change in accounting policy must also be applied retrospectively and previously reported financial information for 2009 has 
been restated where appropriate in these financial statements.
The Group had no joint venture investments prior to the acquisition of the joint venture interest in China Global Mining Resources 
BVI (“CGMR JV”) in 2009, (see note 24a), as a result no comparative financial information for the year ended 2008 has been 
presented. The change in accounting policy has had no impact on retained earnings, or net assets.

6. Segment reporting
The Group operates in five principal geographical areas, Sierra Leone, Greenland, Saudi Arabia, China and Colombia.
Segment revenues and results
The following is an analysis of the Group’s results from continuing operations by reportable segment. There is no segmental 
revenue in the years 2010 or 2009 following the change in joint venture accounting policy. The key segment result presented to 
the Board of Directors for strategic decision making and allocation of resources is EBITDA. Group EBITDA represents earnings/
losses from operations excluding depreciation and amortisation, (and therefore excludes Group’s share of results of joint ventures 
and associates (net of tax) and impairments). Group EBITDA is analysed below.
The analysis of the Group’s results from continuing operations by reportable segment for the year ended 31 December 2010 is

For the purposes of monitoring segment performance and allocating resources between segments, all assets are allocated to 
reportable segments other than investments in joint ventures and associates (excluding the Group’s net investment in the CGMR JV, 
which has been included within segment assets) convertible loans, other corporate assets, such as cash, together with the assets 
held in Mexico at 31 December 2009, as this subsidiary, which was sold on 31 March 2010, was not a reportable segment. These 
assets are all classified as “unallocated including corporate”. The Group’s net investment in CGMR JV has been included within 
segmental assets.
All liabilities are allocated to reportable segments other than liabilities held within the corporate head office.
Included in unallocated assets at 31 December 2009 is a total of USD 5.0 million in respect of the Group’s investment in Chile. 
At 31 December 2010, all loans from London Mining Plc with regards to Chile have been written down to USD nil.

Meeting held on 10 November 2008, bonus awards were made under the RBP to all optionholders and two LTIP awardholders. Payments are due on vesting of the related 
option/LTIP award. The USD 1.9 million charge to the income statement in the year ended 31 December 2010 represents the non-cash charge. Cash payments in the year 
were USD 2.9 million (2009: USD 2.0 million) and a further USD 4.2 million is due (subject to the return bonus plan rules), payable over the next three years, of which 
USD 1.6 million will be covered by proceeds from the exercise of respective options granted in 2009.

Mineral rights and evaluation and exploration costs consist of costs incurred on the exploration of the Group’s Marampa, Isua and 
Wadi Sawawin projects located in Sierra Leone, Greenland and Saudi Arabia respectively. During October 2010 the existence of 
commercially exploitable reserves was confirmed in Sierra Leone and the project moved into the mine development phase. The 
mineral rights and exploration and evaluation costs in Sierra Leone were therefore transferred into mining properties in property, 
plant and equipment in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies.
The goodwill acquired in the period has arisen on the acquisition of ICC (note 25). This has been allocated fully to the Colombia 
CGU and forms the entirety of goodwill recognised in the Group. The recoverable amount of Colombia has been assessed by 
value in use calculations on the basis of latest prices and growth forecasts for commodity prices and exchange rates consistent 
with external sources of information discounted appropriately at the Group’s weighted average cost of capital applicable to 
Colombia. Despite confidence that the life of the ovens will be significantly longer, the recoverable amount has been assessed on 
an asset life limited to 20 years. Management believes that any reasonable possible change in the key assumptions would not 
cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount.
During 2009 USD 1.3 million of costs relating to the Isua camp set up in Greenland were transferred out of intangible assets and 
into property, plant and equipment.  66

14. Intangible assets continued
The Group has certain licences which will be subject to renewal during 2011 but management has no reason to believe that these 
will not be renewed in the ordinary course of business. Mineral rights and exploration and evaluation costs will be transferred to 
property plant and equipment once the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the respective projects is demonstrable. 
These costs will then be depreciated on a unit of production basis of tonnes mined over the total resource. Software costs 
capitalised as intangible assets are amortised over three years.

Joint venture investment in CGMR:
The company completed the 50% joint venture in CGMR JV on 23 April 2009 with an initial investment of USD 44.5 million. For 
the year ended 31 December 2010 the carrying value of the investment has been written down to USD nil, see note 24a.
Joint venture investment in Atacama:
On 30 July 2010 the Company entered into a joint venture agreement to acquire 50% of Atacama. In consideration London 
Mining converted a USD 5.0 million loan, and has provided additional loans of USD 6.7 million. For the year ended 31 December 
2010 the carrying value of the investment has been written down to USD nil – see note 24b.
Associate investment in ICC:
Following the acquisition of the remaining 80% of ICC (see note 25) the previously held 20% associate investment in ICC has 
been disposed of and an acquisition of 100% of ICC recognised. The fair value of the associate investment has been taken into 
account when determining the purchase consideration (note 25).
Associate investment in DMC:
Investments in associates held at 31 December 2009 relate to investments made in DMC Coal. In June 2009 an impairment of 
USD 6.0 million was made following DMC’s management’s decision to not proceed with the Pixley KaSeme coal project.
On 13 January 2010, London Mining converted the USD 18.5 million convertible loan due from DMC Group (see note 18) and its 
39.3% net equity investment in DMC Coal into 28.0% of the issued share capital of DMC Group, on a fully diluted basis. The fair 
value of the 28% holding of DMC Group acquired was deemed to be the fair value of the cost of acquisition, which included the 
USD 18.5 million convertible loan and the USD 10.4 million share of 39.3% held in DMC Coal. The 28.0% holding was diluted 
during the three months to 31 March 2010 to 27.5%. The overall carrying value at 31 December 2010 is USD 28.1 million.
On 23 April 2010, London Mining accepted an offer from Sable Mining Africa Limited (“Sable”) for USD 24.8 million in cash for 
its 27.5% interest in DMC Group. The offer is subject only to regulatory approvals relating to change of control in DMC Group 
and anti-trust matters. As a result the investment has been reclassified as held for sale.  68

The USD 28.1 million investment in DMC Group has been reclassified to investments held for sale at following the Sable offer. 
The Group’s share of the loss in DMC Group has been included in the London Mining accounts until 23 April 2010, the date of 
acceptance of the Sable offer, at which point the asset was reclassified as held for sale.
In addition London Mining entered into an agreement on 19 January 2010 with private investment vehicles of Heine van Niekerk 
and Pieter Wiese, (CEO and CFO respectively of DMC Group), which, inter alia, guaranteed that London Mining would receive 
total proceeds of USD 40.0 million in the event of the sale of DMC Group. London Mining has accepted the offer for USD 24.8 
million cash from Sable for its 27.5% stake in DMC, and is therefore due under the private agreement a further USD 15.2 million, 
which it expects to be paid in Sable shares. Approval has been received from The South African Regulatory Bank in respect of 
enforcement of the downside protection agreement. No reversal of the previous USD 6.0 million impairment made in 2009, nor 
upwards revaluation of the carrying value has been made to reflect the full value of the protection agreement as London Mining is 
currently in the process of enforcing the downside protection agreement against the CEO and CFO.

24. Acquisitions of joint ventures
(A) Investment by London Mining Plc in the CGMR JV
On 23 April 2009, the Company completed a joint venture agreement with Wits Basin Precious Minerals, Inc. (“Wits Basin”) in 
relation to the 50:50 CGMR JV. The CGMR JV through its wholly owned subsidiary, CGMR, has a 100% interest in two Chinese 
companies: Xiaonanshan Mining Co Limited (“XNS”) and Nanjing Sudan Mining Co (“Sudan”). Under the terms of the 
agreement, the Company subscribed USD 38.7 million and made a direct loan to Wits Basin for USD 5.75 million (of which USD 
2.0 million was repaid in January 2010), making a total initial investment of USD 44.5 million. 
Impairment of CGMR JV
For the year ended 31 December 2010 the Group has made an impairment of USD 50.0 million to the investment in the CGMR 
JV to write it down to a carrying value of USD nil of which USD 14.2 million was recorded in the period ended 30 June 2010. The 
USD 50.0 million consists of a USD 48.8 million impairment against the investment in the joint venture and USD 1.2 million 
impairment of loans receivable from the joint venture partner.
Mining operations continue to be halted by the mining authorities in Anhui province, for reasons which primarily concern the 
continued delay in consolidating the mines situated on the CGMR licence. The arbitration claim from the original vendors of the 
XNS mine and Sudan processing plant regarding the timing for payment of deferred consideration of approximately USD 18.0 
million (translated at 31 December 2010) remains unresolved, with an initial hearing date set for April 2011. While London Mining 
is in negotiations with the vendor regarding the arbitration, the outcome is uncertain. In January 2011 The operator of the other 
two pits on the CGMR licence, Maanshan Binyong Mining Co. Ltd (“Binyong”), has recently won a court case which ruled that 
integration of CGMR’s XNS pit with the two Binyong pits should be enforced whereby Binyong would receive 60% of the equity 
in an enlarged XNS. CGMR has appealed this ruling as Chinese legal counsel, based on the evidence available, believes there is 
no legal basis for the claim, (see note 33).
The ongoing legal claims and production stoppages have resulted in a prolonged delay to the fund raising process to acquire and 
consolidate the neighbouring pits which was the investment basis of the Group’s interest in the CGMR JV. As a result the 
Directors have determined that until such time there is more certainty around the legal status of the integrated CGMR JV licence 
and the required funding process the recoverable amount of the investment should be written down to USD nil.
London Mining is investigating bringing in a Chinese partner to operate the mine in return for equity in the business, and it is in 
discussions with several parties regarding this approach. London Mining has no intention to commit material new funds to the 
CGMR JV joint venture, and is minimising the management time spent on this project.
Accounting for the CGMR JV following change in accounting policy and impairment
During the year ended 2010 the Group has changed its accounting policy to accounting for joint ventures using the equity 
method, see note 5. As a result of this change and the impairment, the Group’s consolidated balance sheet shows an investment 
in joint ventures and associates of USD nil for the year ended 2010, (2009: USD 49.5 million) in respect of the CGMR JV. The 
consolidated income statement shows a result (profit) from joint venture of USD 0.3 million, (2009 USD 3.6 million).
Accounting for the CGMR JV prior to change in accounting policy
Note 5 sets out the presentational change to the Group’s consolidated balance sheet and income statement as a result of the 
change in accounting policy for joint ventures for the year ended 31 December 2009.
For the year ended 31 December 2009 the Group consolidated 50% of the CGMR JV using proportionate consolidation. For 
accounting purposes the USD 38.7 million investment was treated as debt due from the joint venture of USD 34.9 million 
(discounted for the timings of the anticipated cash flows) and an equity contribution to the joint venture of USD 3.8 million (in 
exchange for the Group’s 50% interest). 
Full details of the acquisition accounting for the CGMR JV under the proportionate consolidation method are disclosed in the 
Group’s 2009 Annual Report.  72

(B) Investment in Chile Joint Venture
On 30 July 2010 London Mining entered into a joint venture agreement with a Chinese and Chilean based partner in order to 
take advantage of several iron ore opportunities in the Atacama region of Chile. The joint venture company, Atacama Mining 
Resources Corporation (“Atacama”) through its Chilean subsidiary, British Mining Resources Corporation Ltda, (“British Mining”) 
holds options over concessions to iron ore deposits in the Atacama region of Chile. Under the agreement London Mining 
subscribed for 50% of the share capital of Atacama.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
continued 73
24. Acquisitions of joint ventures continued
In consideration for the 50% share capital of Atacama, London Mining converted a previously outstanding convertible loan of 
USD 5.0 million. The full USD 5.0 million was recognised as goodwill within intangible assets on acquisition with the fair value of 
assets acquired being assessed as having USD nil value.
London Mining has also made available additional loans totalling USD 7.0 million to British Mining to fund acquisitions of a 
number of concessions in the area and to get exclusive rights from joint venture partners on future iron ore prospects in Chile. 
This loan will be repaid to London Mining from the earlier of first sales of ore made by the joint venture or third party funding of the 
joint venture. At 31 December 2010 a total of USD 6.5 million of loans had been drawn down by British Mining.
Impairment 
Prior to year end, London Mining’s investment in the Joint Venture was USD 11.2 million (net of exploration costs expensed during 
the year) of which USD 5.0 million was recorded as goodwill and USD 6.2 million was shown as a long term receivable. In 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, London Mining has written down the goodwill recognised at the 
date of the agreement to USD nil and has made full provision against the long term receivables. The provision is required because 
the portfolio of iron ore concessions and logistics opportunities being considered by Atacama has changed since the date of 
London Mining’s initial investment into the venture. In accordance with accounting standards, the initial investment of USD 11.2 
million is not able to be reassigned to new exploration and port concession opportunities now being evaluated or obtained. The 
provision made against the receivable may be reversed when either new cash is invested into the venture or the venture has a 
defined resource or reaches production from one of the many new opportunities it is currently negotiating. 
The joint venture has received interest from a number of parties for a potential off-take from concessions undergoing early stage 
exploration in and around this area based on initial sample specifications taken and is currently in negotiations for a possible 
strategic investor into the project. 
Group’s share of results for the Chile joint venture
As at 31 December 2010 Atacama had net liabilities of USD 1.0 million and in the period since acquisition had recorded a loss of 
USD 1.0 million (on a 100% basis, which includes the exploration write-off of USD 0.8 million following drilling results on a 
particular concession). 
25. Acquisition of subsidiary, International Coal Company Limited
On 30 March 2010, London Mining announced the acquisition of the remaining 80% issued share capital of ICC (now ‘London 
Mining (Colombia) Limited’) for initial consideration of USD 5.5 million cash and 3.5 million newly issued London Mining shares. 
The acquisition was conditional on various completion requirements which were satisfied on 5 May 2010 when the acquisition 
was completed and initial consideration transferred.
London Mining now holds 100% of this investment. London Mining (Colombia) Limited (“London Mining Colombia”) is a Cayman 
Islands incorporated company with operations in Colombia, South America. London Mining Colombia’s strategy is to become a 
fully integrated developer of coal properties for the international steel and energy markets. 
Potential further consideration of up to USD 8.5 million cash and up to 6.3 million shares is payable subject to performance 
conditions. These conditions include meeting annual or cumulative EBITDA targets in 2011, 2012 and 2013 and the completion of 
feasibility studies or the acquisition of mining concessions and port opportunities. 74

Total consideration paid for 100% of ICC was USD 39.9 million. Assets acquired were USD 0.2 million with goodwill on acquisition recognised of USD 39.7 million and 
included in intangible assets. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
1
 The goodwill arising on the acquisition of ICC is attributable to the acquisition of land; environmental and construction permits; and detailed plans to build coke ovens with a 
nameplate capacity of 200ktpa and three coking coal concessions in the Socha region of Colombia with an aggregate area of 606 hectares. 
2
 The Directors consider the fair value of the Group’s previous 20% holding in ICC to equal fair value and as such no gain or loss has been recognised on the initial recording 
of the transaction.
3
 The fair value of the 3,500,000 Ordinary Shares issued as part of the consideration paid for ICC of USD 12.0 million, was determined on the basis of the GBP 2.26 share 
price at 5 May 2010, translated at the USD 1.52: GBP 1 exchange rate at that date.
4
 The fair value of deferred consideration was determined by reviewing the performance criteria and assessing the probability of each milestone being achieved. Total 
deferred consideration of USD 18.2 million comprises USD 5.0 million cash consideration, discounted to net present value and USD 13.2 million in deferred equity 
consideration. This was valued based on an expectation of 4,250,000 shares being payable and using the acquisition date share price of GBP 2.26 and has been 
discounted to net present value.
b) Fair value loss on deferred consideration
At each reporting date the deferred consideration is re-stated to market value based on a re-assessment of the probability of the 
achievement of individual milestones and the fair value of cash and equity consideration.
For the period from acquisition to 31 December 2010 there has been no change to probabilities. Deferred equity consideration 
has increased in value as a result of the increase in London Mining Plc’s share price at acquisition of GBP 2.26 to GBP 3.15  
at 31 December 2010. This resulted in a cumulative USD 5.6 million fair value loss which has been recorded in the income 
statement. This fair value loss, together with the USD 528,000 increase in the deferred consideration as a result of the  
unwinding of the discount has resulted in the deferred consideration liability increasing from USD 18.2 million at acquisition  
to USD 24.3 million at 31 December 2010.
The potential undiscounted amount of all future payments that London Mining Plc could be required to make under the contingent 
consideration is USD 5.5 million cash payments and the issuing of USD 36.9 million value of Ordinary Shares, valued at  
31 December 2010. The fair value of the contingent cash consideration arrangement of USD 5.0 million was estimated by 
discounting the expected future payments using a 3.85% discount rate, representing the quoted 12 month USD LIBOR at the 
time of acquisition.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
continued 75
25. Acquisition of subsidiary, International Coal Company Limited continued
Acquisition related costs included in the administrative expenses in London Mining Plc’s consolidated income statement for the 
year ended 31 December 2010 amounted to USD 193,000 (year ended 31 December 2009 USD 295,000). The future expected 
costs to be incurred on the issuing of the share capital to the vendors has been estimated to be USD nil. 
c) London Mining Colombia performance
LMC contributed a loss of USD 2.6 million to the Group’s loss for the year to 31 December 2010, including a USD 0.3 million 
Group’s share of the loss of an associate. If the acquisition of ICC had been completed on the first day of the 2010 financial year 
the Group’s revenue would remain the same, but the Group’s loss would have increased by USD 1.3 million to USD 93.3 million.
 
d) Merger reserve
Following the issue of the initial 3.5 million shares an amount of USD 12.0 million has been recognised in the merger reserve in 
relation to the fair value of shares issued over the nominal value, in accordance with Companies Act 2006.

27. Share-based payments
Share options, LTIP awards and warrants (“share based payment awards”) to subscribe for Ordinary Shares in the Company are 
granted to certain employees, Directors and consultants providing services to the Group. Share based payment awards are 
exercisable at a price equal to the closing quoted price of the Company’s shares on the date of grant. The vesting period varies 
from immediate settlement to three years and there may or may not be other vesting/performance conditions. Share based 
payment awards are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the awards vest.
Each employee share based payment award converts into one Ordinary Share on exercise. No amounts are paid or payable by 
the recipient on receipt of an LTIP award. An amount equal to the share price at the date of grant is payable by the recipient on 
the exercisable of each option or warrant. The Share based payment awards carry neither rights to dividends nor voting rights 
and may be exercised at any time from the date of vesting to the date of their expiry.
The number of awards granted is calculated in accordance with the performance-based formula approved by shareholders at a 
previous Annual General Meeting and is subject to approval by the remuneration committee. 76

The related weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options and warrants exercised during 2010 was 
USD 4.72 (2009: USD 3.15). The options outstanding at the end of 31 December 2010 had a weighted average exercise price of 
USD 2.30 (2009: USD 3.04) and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 5.96 years (2009: 6.42 years). The inputs into 
the pricing model for all share options granted during the year and the preceding year were as follows:
2010
Black 
Scholes
2009
Binomial
method
Weighted average fair value of option (USD) 0.61 1.31

Expected volatility 38% 50%
Expected life 1.80 years 1.45 years
Risk free rates 0.99% 2.89%
Expected dividend yields 0% 0%
During 2010 the Group changed its share based payments valuation model from the binomial method to the Black Scholes 
method as this method is considered most appropriate for London Mining share options.
The estimated aggregate fair value of the options granted during the year to 31 December 2010 was USD 1.0 million, 
(2009: USD 5.4 million).
Expected volatility of the options issued during the year to 31 December 2010 was determined by calculating the average volatility 
of the 90 days prior to the granting of the option. The expected volatility of any options or warrants issued during the prior year 
were determined on a weighted average basis using the average volatility between the 7 October 2007 date of listing on the 
Oslo Axess Stock Exchange and the date of grant. See note 7 for the total expense recognised in the income statement for share 
options and warrants granted to Directors and employees.

29. Contingent liabilities
As part of the Mining Lease Agreement between London Mining and the Government of Sierra Leone London Mining has entered 
into a Performance Bond in the form of a letter of credit of USD 1.0 million which shall be encashed if London Mining fails to 
make substantial progress towards the re-opening of the Marampa. The Directors current expectation is that the Performance 
Bond will not be encashed.
As part of the acquisition of its Chinese joint venture described in note 24, the vendor has an entitlement to receive further 
consideration of up to USD 38.6 million under consulting agreements payable subject to continuing employment for up to 8 years 
and available cash in CGMR after the priority repayment of the Group’s USD 44.5 million initial investment and subsequent 
ongoing distribution rights. The Group has not recognised any provision for the year ended 31 December 2010 based on the 
Directors current expectation that the likelihood of the vendor being entitled to a material balance is remote.
As part of the disposal of the Brazilian operations in 2008, London Mining granted certain warranties and indemnities to the purchaser, 
ArcelorMittal. Having taken appropriate legal advice, the Group believes the likelihood of a material liability arising is remote.
The Company considers no UK tax to be payable on the USD 664.2 million profit arising on the disposal of the Brazilian 
operations in 2008 since it is anticipated the sale will qualify for the UK substantial shareholdings exemption.
30. Financial instruments, risk management and exposure
(a) Financial risk and risk management
The following disclosures represent the risk management policies and procedures of the Group.
Credit Risk
The Group is principally exposed to credit risk from cash and cash equivalents and deposits held with financial institutions, loans 
and other receivables. It is Group policy to manage credit risk by:
holding and investing cash in multiple, reputable financial institutions >
dealing with creditworthy counterparties  >
The Group does not enter into derivatives to manage credit risk.
i) Cash and cash equivalents
The objective in respect of cash and cash equivalents is to maximise returns whilst minimising risks. To maximise credit protection 
all cash and cash equivalents are held with a variety of major banks and invested in AAA funds to minimise credit risk. 
The policy of the Group is to hold funds at Parent Company level and minimise funds held within operating and service 
subsidiaries. This reduces credit risk by ensuring funds are held in higher rated funds. A cash call process occurs each month. 
Each subsidiary submits a monthly cash call with support to be approved and released by the Parent Company.
The Group has a policy of ensuring any significant advance payments against major contracts are protected by bond or escrow.
ii) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables represent a potential credit risk due to the possibility of default.
Loans and other receivables primarily relate to advance and mobilisation payments to contractors.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
continued 79
30. Financial instruments, risk management and exposure continued
Liquidity risk
The Group has sufficient cash resources and available financing facilities which provide liquidity to support Group strategy in the 
medium term.
Certain of the Group’s mining projects require significant additional financing which represents a liquidity risk to the Group. To 
mitigate this risk bankable feasibility studies are conducted in advance of funds being committed or to support the raising of 
external finance. Forecast and actual cash flows are monitored to estimate the timing and size of any funding gap. This is updated 
at least quarterly and presented to the Board. The forecast includes an expectation of when payments for capital contracts will 
be required. 
It is the policy of the Group not to enter into capital contracts such that commitments exceed available funds at any time.
The Group has additional financing facilities at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk as set out below.
On 15 October 2010 the Group concluded a USD 60.0 million two year revolving credit facility with Standard Chartered Bank. 
The facility is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent including security being taken over certain shares and 
assets of London Mining and certain of its subsidiaries. 
On 31 January 2011 the Group announced the raising of a USD 110.0 million through an offering of senior, unsecured convertible 
loans, (see note 33).

All financial liabilities are non-interest bearing.
Market risk
i) Commodity price risk
Cash flows are forecast using forecast prices for iron ore and coal. Sensitivities are performed using a variety of commodity price 
assumptions to highlight commodity price risk. 
The Group has not used any commodity price derivatives in this or the prior year.
On 26 January 2011 the Group entered into an offtake agreement that will cover 9.5 million of wet metric ton production from the 
Marampa project, directly correlated to the benchmark CFR China price (note 33).
The Group has not historically hedged future sales. This policy may change subject to future financing arrangements and terms.
ii) Exchange rate risk
The functional currency of all Group subsidiaries is the USD. Although the majority of the Group’s transactions are recorded in 
USD, some operating costs and investments are incurred in British Pounds, Chinese Renminbi, Australian Dollar, Canadian 
Dollar, Colombian Pesos, EURO, and Danish Kroner.
The Group manages foreign exchange risk by holding cash balances in USD and GBP for respective supplier payments. It is 
anticipated that future commercial transactions for the Group will be in USD which is the same as the functional currency of the 
Company and its subsidiaries. 
At balance sheet date, the Group held GBP 10.4 million (2009: GBP 2.2 million) in its cash at bank balance. A movement of 5% 
strengthening or weakening of the USD to GBP would respectively decrease or increase the Group’s profit before tax by 
USD 0.8 million (2009: USD 0.2 million) based on the Group’s current GBP cash balance. 80
Overview
Operational and financial review
Corporate governance
Financial statements
30. Financial instruments, risk management and exposure continued
At balance sheet date, the Group held GBP 0.2 million (2009 GBP 7.8 million) in trade and other payables. A movement of 5% 
strengthening or weakening of the USD to GBP not have a significant impact on the 2010 Group’s result (2009: USD 0.6 million) 
based on the Group’s current payables balance. The Group has no other material currency exposures.
The Group policy is to negotiate contract terms where possible in USD to reduce exchange rate risk. A portion of the Group’s 
capital cost will be incurred in currencies which are not denominated in USD. This gives rise to an exchange rate risk in that the 
rate at the time of entering into a contract can be different to when payments are made. 
The Group has not used any exchange rate derivatives in this or the prior period. 
iii) Interest rate risk
Fluctuations in interest rates impact on the value of cash investments and financing activities, giving rise to interest rate risks. The 
Group has no loans or receivables which have floating interest rates. 
As at 31 December 2010 the Group had no drawn borrowings and therefore no exposure to interest rates. The Standard 
Chartered facility of USD 60.0 million has a floating interest rate. The USD 110.0 million convertible loan has a fixed interest rate 
of 8.00% (more detail on this is provided in note 33).
iv) Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
Capital managed by the Group at December 2010 consists of cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity  
holders of the parent. The capital structure is reviewed by management through regular internal and quarterly financial  
reporting and forecasting. As at 31 December 2010 equity attributable to equity holders of the parent is USD 244.4 million, 
(2009 USD 327.2 million) whilst cash and cash equivalents amount to USD 76.0 million, (2009 USD 204.3 million).
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
(b) Potential impact of market risks
i) Credit risk
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2010 was USD 104 million (2009: USD 278 million). The Group’s 
financial assets do not represent a concentration of material exposure of credit risk.
The Group does not have any financial assets that are past due or impaired except those noted in note 9:
ii) Liquidity risk
At 31 December 2010, the Group’s financial liabilities consisted primarily of trade and other payables and non-current deferred 
consideration payable on the acquisition of London Mining (Colombia), and an amount of USD 3.8 million (2009: USD 4.9 million) 
accrued in respect of the Return Bonus plan, as discussed in note 7. 
iii) Sensitivity analysis
Financial instruments affected by market risk include cash and cash equivalents, loans and receivables and trade payables. 
Any change in market variables, (exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices) will have an immaterial effect on 
these instruments.

Instruments: Disclosure’ (see note 25 for more information).
The change in the fair value of the deferred consideration payable on the acquisition of London Mining Colombia) is fully

32. Related party transactions
At 31 December 2010 the Directors of the Group and their related parties, and entities in which they had a beneficial interest, 
controlled 6.5% (2009: 3.97%) of the Ordinary Shares of the Company.
The Group has a related party relationship with its subsidiaries, joint venture and its associates. Transactions between Group 
entities are eliminated on consolidation and are not included in this note. 
On 30 March 2010, London Mining announced the acquisition of the remaining 80% issued share capital of ICC (now ‘London 
Mining (Colombia) Limited’) for initial consideration of USD 5.5 million cash and 3.5 million newly issued London Mining shares. 
The acquisition was conditional on various completion requirements which were satisfied on 5 May 2010 when the acquisition 
was completed and initial consideration transferred. G Hossie, the Chief Executive Officer of London Mining Plc had a  
beneficial interest of 12% in ICC, and therefore received 15% of the consideration paid for the remaining 80% acquired.  
As a consequence of this interest, Mr Hossie does not represent London Mining on the London Mining Colombia board and  
does not participate in any decisions of the London Mining Board in relation to London Mining Colombia. As at 31 December 
2010, the Group recognises deferred contingent consideration due to former shareholders of ICC, including G Hossie, of USD 
24.3 million. G Hossie, London Mining’s CEO, would receive 15% of the deferred consideration payable, which at 31 December 
2010 totals USD 3.6 million.
On 30 July 2010 London Mining entered into a joint venture agreement with Chinese and Chilean based partner Atacama to 
explore iron ore opportunities in Chile. In consideration for the 50% share capital of Atacama, London Mining converted a 
previously outstanding convertible loan of USD 5.0 million. London Mining has also made available additional loans totalling 
USD 7.0 million to Atacama’s subsidiary, British Mining, to fund acquisitions of a number of concessions in the area and to get 
exclusive rights from joint venture partners on future iron ore prospects in Chile. At December 2010 a total of USD 6.5 million of 
loans had been drawn down by British Mining.
Key management personnel compensation is disclosed in note 8.
33. Events after the balance sheet date
Court ruling regarding CGMR license
The operator of the other two pits on the CGMR license, Maanshan Binyong Mining Co. Ltd (“Binyong”), has recently won a 
court case which ruled that integration of CGMR’s XNS pit with the two Binyong pits should be enforced whereby Binyong would 
receive 60% of the equity in an enlarged XNS, the Company which holds the CGMR JV mining licence. This would integrate all 
current pits on the licence into one operation without payments being made between the parties. London Mining and the CGMR 
group received legal advice from Chinese counsel throughout the court process that based on the evidence available; there was 
no legal basis for the claim. The CGMR JV intends to appeal this ruling.
Off take agreement
On 26 January 2011 London Mining signed an offtake agreement with the trading house Glencore International AG (“Glencore”). 
The offtake will cover 9.5 million wet metric tonne production from Phase 1a of the Company’s Marampa project. The five year 
agreement, which includes a pre-payment facility for up to USD 27 million, will provide guaranteed offtake and shipping from 
Sierra Leone for all Phase 1a production, with the option for London Mining to expand the agreement to Phase 1b on the same 
terms. The offtake will be priced at around Platts 62% CFR China benchmark, with an upward adjustment for the iron content of 
the Company’s 65% iron sinter feed concentrate, and an incentive to place product at locations such as Europe where there is a 
net pricing benefit through lower shipping costs. The offtake accommodates London Mining’s ramp up expectations and is 
flexible to accommodate varying shipping sizes and frequencies to supply European, Chinese and other markets.
Funding
On 17 February 2011 the Company received the proceeds of a USD 110.0 million, (net of costs) offering of unsecured 
convertible bonds, repayable in 2016. The bonds carry a coupon of 8% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears and will be 
convertible into London Mining Plc shares at a conversion price of GBP 4.84 per share, representing a 38% premium to the 
average market price on the date of offering. 100% of the convertible bonds’ principal amount unless previously converted, 
redeemed or purchased and cancelled, will be redeemed on maturity. London Mining has the right to redeem all outstanding 
bonds at par together with accrued interest from three years after the closing date at any time as long as the share price exceeds 
130% of the conversion price for more than 20 out of 30 consecutive trading days or, if 15% or less of the bonds remain 
outstanding. The Bonds have been issued by the Company’s, newly incorporated, wholly-owned subsidiary London Mining 
(Jersey) Plc and will be guaranteed by the Company. If the convertible bond is fully converted into shares, it would result in the 
issue of London Mining Ordinary Shares representing 12% of the share capital as at 31 December 2010.

Marampa mining history
The Marampa mine is a 13.82km
2
 
brownfields site formerly operated 
by the Sierra Leone Development 
Company (DELCO) and William Baird 
between 1933 and 1975. Marampa 
reached a peak production of 2.5Mtpa 
in the 1960s before low iron ore prices 
forced its closure. Continuing weak 
market economics and civil war 
prevented redevelopment of the mine 
until the mining licence was acquired  
by London Mining in 2006.

Secretary, whose details appear on the inside back cover of 
this report.
This report covers the year 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013 
and follows on from the 2012 Annual Report. It includes 
the activities of the holding company Pan African Resources 
PLC, which is incorporated in England and Wales, all of its 
South African operations and subsidiaries, and its investment 
in Auroch Minerals NL (Auroch). During the year, the 
Group divested of its 100% shareholding in Manica, its gold 
exploration project in Mozambique, in exchange for a 42% 
equity share in Australian-listed Auroch. No non-financial 
performance indicators are included in this report for either 
Manica or Auroch. More information concerning Auroch 
is available at www.aurochminerals.com. The acquisition of 
Evander Gold Mines Limited (Evander Mines) was finalised 
during the year and its financial results consolidated into the 
Pan African Resources Group results with effect from 1 March 
2013. Similarly, unless otherwise stated, Evander Mines’ non-
financial information is for the four months ended 30 June 
2013.
No limitations were placed on the Group in preparing this 
report. 
Details of Pan African Resources’ engagement with its 
stakeholders appear on page 96. This engagement, together 
with a review of internal information – including risk 
analysis, strategic objectives, the operating environment, 
performance indicators (both financial and non-financial) used 
by management and the board, and the availability of other 
non-financial performance indicators – instructed the content 
of this report. While every effort was made to produce a 
balanced report, materiality has been applied subjectively in 
this first integrated report.
In this, the first integrated annual report (IAR) of Pan 
African Resources (the Group or Company as the context 
determines), the board and management have sought to 
provide a concise view of the Group’s strategy, its financial 
and non-financial performance for the year, its governance 
principles and its future prospects. 
This 2013 Integrated Annual Report has been prepared 
in line with the recommendations of the King Report on 
Governance for South Africa, 2009 (King III) and complies with 
the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) Listings Requirements 
as well as the AIM rules of the London Stock Exchange (LSE). 
The report draws on the concepts and principles included 
in the Consultation Draft of the International Integrated 
Reporting Framework, released in April 2013 by the 
International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC). In addition, 
the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) Sustainability Reporting 
Guidelines and its GRI 3.1 content index of standard 
disclosures and Metals and Mining sector supplement have 
been considered in preparing this report and identifying 
sustainability disclosures relevant to Pan African Resources. 
The financial information provided in the consolidated and 
Company annual financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) and were externally audited by Deloitte and T ouche. 
This report represents one of three elements of Pan African 
Resources’ 2013 annual communication strategy with 
stakeholders, the other two being: 
  The Group’s completed and referenced GRI content 
index, containing additional non-financial disclosures,
  The Group’s Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve 
Report, which provides detailed technical and 
operational information. Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 3
COMPANY OVERVIEW LEADERSHIP STATEMENTS OUR BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Management acknowledges that, notwithstanding progress 
made in many areas relating to the application of integrated 
and sustainability reporting practices, this report and 
the activities that support the collection of non-financial 
performance information have to be developed further in 
the continuous journey to ensure the sustainability of Pan 
African Resources. This will be done through balancing long-
term social, environmental and economic interests with the 
principle of needing to maximise profits of the Group, while 
acting in a responsible manner. In particular, comparative 
information is often unavailable for certain environmental 
and social performance indicators, and relatively few 
performance targets have been set for these indicators. 
During the coming year, the Group will, where feasible, set 
performance benchmarks.
Data measurement techniques and assumptions relating to 
non-financial performance indicators are provided, either 
where the data is disclosed or in the glossary, appearing 
on pages 48 to 89. To promote relevance, consistency and 
comparability, non-financial performance indicators are 
generally disclosed by significant operation and are not 
aggregated in a Group view.
As this is the Group’s first integrated report and, in some 
cases, systems and processes for the recording, collection and 
collation of selected non-financial performance indicators 
have yet to be introduced or tested further for veracity, the 
board has decided against obtaining independent assurance of 
the non-financial performance indicators.
This integrated report, together with the GRI 3.1 content 
index, meets application level B of the GRI Reporting 
Guidelines.
Forward-looking statements
Statements in this report, other than historical facts, that 
address, without limitation, exploration activities, mining 
potential and future plans and objectives of Pan African 
Resources are forward-looking statements and forward-
looking information that involve various risks, assumptions 
and uncertainties and are not statements of fact. The 
directors and management of Pan African Resources are of 
the belief that the expectations expressed in such forward-
looking statements or forward-looking information is 
based on reasonable assumptions, expectations, estimates 
and projections. However, such statements should not be 
construed as being guarantees or warranties (whether 
expressed or implied) of future performance. 
There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to 
be accurate and actual values, results and future events could 
differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. 
Important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
materially from statements expressed in this presentation 
include, among others, the actual results of exploration 
activities; technical analysis; the lack of availability to Pan African 
Resources of necessary capital on acceptable terms; general 
economic, business and financial market conditions; political 
risks; industry trends; competition; changes in government 
regulations; delays in obtaining governmental approvals; 
interest rate fluctuations; currency fluctuations; changes in 
business strategy or development plans; and other risks. 
Although Pan African Resources has attempted to identify 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
materially, there may be other factors that cause results not to 
be as anticipated, estimated or intended.
Pan African Resources is not obliged to publically update any 
forward-looking statements that are included in this report, 
or revise any changes in events, conditions or circumstances 
on which any such statements are based, occurring after the 
publication date of this report.
Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare such financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law, the directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union 
(EU) and Article 4 of the International Accounting Standards 
(IAS) Regulation, and have also chosen to prepare the parent 
Company financial statements under IFRS as adopted by 
the EU. Under company law, the directors must not approve 
the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and of the 
profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the IAS requires that directors: 
 Properly select and apply accounting policies, 
  present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information,
  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the entity’s financial 
position and financial performance,
  make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions, and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply with the United 
Kingdom (UK) Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 4
DIRECTORS’
RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: 
1.  The financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole. 
2.  The management report, which is incorporated into the directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
3.  That the directors are not aware of any legal proceedings or other material conditions that may impact the mining or 
exploration activities of the Group.
4. The directors confirm that the Group holds title to the mining rights as set out in this report. 
By order of the board.

COMPANY OVERVIEW LEADERSHIP STATEMENTS OUR BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 10
Pan African Resources is steadily fulfilling our vision of 
becoming a mid-tier precious metals mining company. We 
understand that successful and sustainable businesses are not 
built overnight, but rather shaped, moulded and grown over 
time. We also recognise that for a mining business to succeed, 
and to continue to be successful, one requires a number of 
elements. These include quality assets, the right people, and 
the ability to mine safely and operate sustainably in our local 
environment. 
There is no denying that the global mining industry is currently 
experiencing difficult times, and South Africa is no exception. 
In addition to lower gold prices of late, South Africa has to deal 
with labour unrest and cost inflation, amongst other challenges. 
Amidst all of this, Pan African Resources has however been 
able to distinguish itself. It has been growing prudently to mid-
tier status, through both optimisation of existing assets and 
via new acquisitions. Successful growth, from a Pan African 
Resources perspective, is not measured by more attributable 
production ounces, but rather by sustainable increases in 
profitability and earnings. 
We finalised the acquisition of Evander Mines from Harmony 
Gold Mining Company Limited in February this year. Through 
the acquisition of Evander Mines, our Group has entered a new 
and exciting chapter in our history by adding another flagship 
operation. Evander Mines contributes profitable production 
ounces, and also has very attractive growth projects. 
Pan African Resources is absolutely committed to delivering 
results with zero harm to our people, communities and 
environment. It is therefore with deep regret that we have 
to report on the following two fatal accidents suffered during 
the year:
 On 17 November 2012, Gert Fourie, a fitter employed at 
Sheba Mine, was fatally injured on surface when he lost 
control of a truck he was driving when it slid off the road 
and rolled down the embankment, 
 On 7 March 2013, Velly Therry Malumane, a welder 
employed underground at Sheba Mine, was fatally injured 
when he was electrocuted whilst carrying out welding 
operations on a load haul dumper. 
In this report, we elaborate on how Pan African Resources 
will continue on a sustainable track of profitable growth, 
by focusing on key performance areas, such as completing 
the successful integration of our recent Evander Mines 
acquisition and bedding down the new Barberton Tailings 
Retreatment Plant (BTRP) for optimal production. In addition, 
management spends significant effort in identifying, analysing 
and mitigating critical business risks. Pan African Resources 
has operated according to a “four pillars” business model that 
integrates the key financial, social and environmental aspects 
of our operations, even before integrated reporting became 
imperative in stakeholder relations.
Our successful bid for 
Evander Mines is a game 
changer and propels the 
Group into mid-tier status. 
CHAIRMAN’S
REPORT
Keith Spencer (Chairman) Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 11
COMPANY OVERVIEW LEADERSHIP STATEMENTS OUR BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As the Chairman of a focused and motivated board, executive 
team and workforce, it is a privilege to introduce an excellent 
set of results for this financial year and to contribute to a 
report that succinctly and clearly reveals the material features 
of this financial year, and the strategies, analyses and forward 
planning important to shareholders, investors and other 
stakeholders. 
between our key business drivers, which include USD gold 
prices, South African inflation, wage and productivity increases 
and the USD/ZAR and GBP/ZAR exchange rates. Although 
movements in these factors cannot be accurately predicted, 
Pan African Resources models and plans using conservative 
assumptions to ensure measured and consistent growth.
It is evident that some miners strive for higher gold ounce 
production targets, while not paying due attention to the costs 
incurred in reaching these targets. Increased gold production 
may excite shareholders and appear good in annual reports, 
but the real costs of producing these ounces, weighed against 
economic drivers, must be thoroughly understood. I am 
confident that the board, executive and mine management 
of Pan African Resources are well schooled in these realities.
The board took the decision that our active participation 
in the Manica gold exploration project in Mozambique was 
no longer aligned with the Group’s strategy of investing and 
operating producing assets. We therefore disposed of our 
interest with effect from January 2013 to Australian-owned 
Auroch, and we remain a significant shareholder in Auroch.
South African gold mining in context
It is no secret that the South African mining industry is 
presently under duress for a number of reasons. The most 
widely publicised is the labour discord following on the 
Marikana tragedy. All parties should share responsibility for 
this situation, and we should never allow a similar incident 
to reoccur. 
Societal inequality is a pressing reality in South Africa. It is, 
however, beyond the ability of mid-tier mining groups such 
as ours to resolve in isolation. However, we have to strive 
to be part of the solution in a proactive manner. In our area 
of influence, we offer our miners fair reward for their work, 
recognition of their value and inputs, and a safe working 
environment, in addition to supporting workers’ health 
and our communities. We trust that the sound working 
relationships we have developed with our employees and 
their representatives will continue. We view all our employees 
as valued team members who contribute their productivity 
in support of Pan African Resources’ sustainable business 
model. Over the past year, we created 302 employment 
opportunities during the construction of the BTRP .
A further current matter is that of South African mining 
legislation and conditions, laid out in the Mining Charter 
and proposed amendments to the B-BBEE Act. Pan African 
Resources wholeheartedly supports the intent of these 
regulations and legislation, as these are areas where we can 
proactively help address inequality and historic disadvantages. 
We are well positioned to continue to comply with both 
regulations and also best practice.
Global economic shifts often have a direct effect on gold 
prices and, in recent months, these haven’t been favourable. 
World demand for commodities has been erratic, and 
gold prices in particular have been weak of late. A key impact 
The real costs of producing these 
ounces, weighed against economic 
drivers, must be thoroughly understood. 
I am confident that the board, 
executive and mine management 
of Pan African Resources are well 
schooled in these realities.
2013  
HIGHLIGHTS
What drives our results
As a gold mining business, the ongoing viability of Pan African 
Resources depends on maintaining the optimum balance 
Gross revenue in GBP increased by  
32.0% to £133.5 million 
(2012: £101.1 million). 
Gross revenue in ZAR increased by 
49.0% to ZAR1,848.1 million 
(2012: ZAR1,240.3 million).
Group capital expenditure in GBP incurred  
£27.6 million (2012: £17.4 million).
Group capital expenditure in ZAR incurred  
ZAR381.6 million 
(2012: ZAR213.9 million).
Gold sold increased by 38.2% to 
130,493oz (2012: 94,449oz).
Proposed dividend of ZAR0.1314 per 
share or ZAR240 million to shareholders. Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 12
was the USA’s announcement that it will begin “tapering” its 
quantitative easing programme, which has strengthened the 
US dollar and weakened gold prices, although Asian demand 
for physical gold remains high. How this will affect gold mining 
over the next year is impossible to predict at this time, but Pan 
African Resources is positioned to adapt as necessary within 
our low cost and high grade model. 
Future planning and outlook
The Group’s strategic thrust in the short term is to 
consolidate our assets, contain or lower costs and increase 
productivity. Working through all the requirements of 
managing Evander Mines and effectively doubling the Group 
in size required immense effort, and I thank Harmony’s 
board and management for the proactive role they played in 
this process. Bedding down the acquisition is continuing this 
year, and we are integrating the procurement and financial 
departments to realise efficiencies. An enterprise resource 
planning (ERP) system rolled out at Barberton Mines in 2012 
is being extended throughout the Group to enhance financial 
controls and reporting. 
A key focus of financial and operational management in 2014 
will be to contain costs so that margins and cash generation 
are maximised. The finance department, in particular, is 
exploring synergies to optimise systems.
We are happy to reward our shareholders by proposing that 
we recommence our dividend payment this year.
With a solid platform for growth having been established, in 
the longer term Pan African Resources may prudently seek 
out further acquisitions that can be profitably operated within 
our business model.
Appreciation and the road ahead
The board wishes to extend our sincere appreciation to our 
former CEO, Jan Nelson, who resigned during the current 
year. Jan’s contribution to our business was significant, and his 
legacy remains.
The bedrock of Pan African Resources remains our workforce 
– the men and women who daily competently go about their 
duties, often under physically challenging circumstances – 
to ensure that our gold arrives safely at its end destination. 
That we are able to announce such excellent results is their 
success, as much as it is the executive and your board. I would 
also like to extend my appreciation to the board for their 
support during the year.
For the immediate future, the board and management remain 
realistically confident. Experienced in mining and business, we 
have lived through boom and gloom economic cycles, and 
manage the Group accordingly. We believe that Pan African 
Resources has the business model and controls to continue 
viable operations through all foreseeable economic cycles.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
OFFICER’S REPORT
Ronald Holding (Chief Executive Officer)
“Pan African Resources exceeded most of its targets for 
the financial year ended 30 June 2013, delivering growth 
with pleasing operational and financial performances.  
Evander Mine’s acquisition and the commissioning of 
the new BTRP have positioned Pan African Resources to 
produce approximately 200,000 profitable ounces of gold 
a year. There is also further growth potential through 
the exploitation of other near term organic projects.  
The board of Pan African Resources has decided to 
recommend a dividend approximating ZAR0.1314 per share 
or ZAR240 million to shareholders, for approval at the 
annual general meeting.”
2013 highlights
Pan African has significantly increased headline earnings per 
share by 20.8% in ZAR terms to 30.07 cents  
(2012: 24.89 cents) and in GBP terms by 6.9% to 2.17 pence 
(2012: 2.03 pence). 
 We completed the acquisition of Evander Mines.
 We successfully poured our first gold bar at the 
Barberton Mines’ BTRP .
  Our strong Statement of Financial Position allows for 
sustained results and profitable growth.
  Our board has recommended a dividend in ZAR terms 
of approximately ZAR0.1314 per share to shareholders.
Evander now a part of the Group
The Group was transformed into a mid-tier gold producer 
when we acquired Evander Mines from Harmony Gold Mining 
Company Limited (Harmony), on 28 February 2013. Evander 
Mines will double our annual gold production profile to 
200,000 oz of gold. The mine is performing as anticipated and 
is currently meeting production targets. Evander contributed 
34,197 oz of gold for the last four months of our financial year. 
Since the signing of the Sale and Purchase agreement with 
Harmony, Evander’s incumbent management team together 
with our corporate office worked proactively and tirelessly 
to ensure a seamless and efficient handover of systems 
and processes. Evander’s integration into the Group will be 
finalised in 2014.
Evander Mines’ management is committed to our organic 
growth plans to exploit its mineral resources more efficiently. 
During the next year we will focus on managing infrastructure 
to minimise the risk of mining interruptions, contain costs and 
increase gold production through targeting low capital cost 
projects which have quick and sustainable returns.
The addition of Evander Mines contributed in the 
achievement of the following Group production statistics for 
the financial year:
Pan African Resources 
exceeded most of its 
targets for the financial 
year ended 30 June 2013,

Sustained performance and growth

Barberton Mines contributed substantially to the Group’s 
success in 2013. It remains one of the lowest cost-of-
production and highest grade mines in South Africa. 
The mine exceeded its production targets, producing 
96,296 oz of gold during the financial year (2012: 94,449 oz).  
The team commissioned the on-site BTRP on schedule and 
within budget, conducting the inaugural gold pour on 28 June 
2013.  The BTRP not only adds approximately 20,000 oz of 
gold to our annual production, it will also steadily eliminate 
many of the historic and environment-degrading tailings 
dumps scattered around the Barberton Mines mining area.
Phoenix Platinum –  
Not quite risen from the ashes
In brief, Phoenix Platinum had a mediocre performance and 
we did not achieve our target ounces. This was primarily due 
to International Ferro Metals PLC halting its underground 
chrome mining operation when it became uneconomical, 
moving their run of mine chrome source to a highly oxidised 
opencast section. Phoenix, which is designed to treat sulphide 
tailings, now has to cope with the resultant serious metallurgical 
challenges. We have instituted equipment and operational 
changes to process the deleterious feedstock with some 
success, resulting in improved production in recent months.
Phoenix Platinum processed more than 274,000 tons of 
chrome tailings, and produced 6,480 oz of PGM 6Es.
This operation’s supply chain was analysed and additional 
training given to improve efficiencies and reduce costs.  Building 
a dedicated tailings storage facility in the future will enable 
oxidised material to be entirely bypassed and ameliorate the 
feedstock issue.

Solid Group financial performance
The continued contribution from Barberton Mines, with the 
acquisition of Evander Mines, has propelled the Group to new 
heights in terms of both its gold production and profitability. 
The earnings per share figures discussed in this report are 
the result of a variety of production, cost and revenue factors 
that underpin the financial year’s strong performance.
Gold revenue increased by 49.0% in ZAR terms but only 
32.0% in GBP terms, due to the weakening of the South African 
currency against all other major currencies, including the GBP 
and USD. During the financial year the Group realised an 
average gold price of ZAR440,424/kg (2012: ZAR422,215/kg)  
and an average price for PGM 6E of ZAR292,354/kg.
Evander Mines contributed 72.2% of the increase in revenue.
The Group’s EBITDA for the financial year increased by 33.1%, 
in ZAR terms mainly as a result of the inclusion of Evander 
Mines’ mining profit of ZAR134.3 million. 
Pan African increased earnings per share (EPS) in both cents 
and pence by more than 30%. As this included a net beneficial 
impact of a bargain purchase gain on the Evander acquisition 
and impairments on the Group’s investments in Phoenix 
Platinum and Auroch Minerals NL (Auroch), the improvment 
in its headline earnings per share (EPS) was somewhat less.  Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 18

  On 17 November 2012, Gert Fourie passed away when 
the truck he was driving left the road, overturned and 
rolled down a hill at Barberton’s Sheba Mine, 
  On 7 March 2013, Velly Malumane was fatally 
electrocuted while welding underground. 
These tragedies were an anomaly, as Barberton Mines is 
known for its good safety record. These accidents have been 
thoroughly investigated to prevent any re-occurrences. 
The two fatalities leads us to reflect on the overall safety of 
our own operations and South African mining in general. Pan 
African Resources prides itself on a superior safety record, 
within an industry that has remarkably enhanced its safety 
levels over the past decade. 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REPORT
continued
Current year earnings were reduced by once-off costs 
associated with two impairments – amounting to  
R242.3 million – and the Evander Mines acquisition costs of 
R18.3 million. These impairments arose from the write-down 
of Phoenix Platinum and Auroch investments due to the 
challenges experienced at Phoenix Platinum and the impact of 
lower gold prices and exploration challenges in Mozambique.
Safety –  
Our Primary Concern is for our People
This past financial year was not without severe disappointments 
and challenges from a safety perspective. Although safety is 
the top priority at Pan African Resources, we are saddened to 
report the tragic loss of two employees at Barberton Mines.

COMPANY OVERVIEW LEADERSHIP STATEMENTS OUR BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Current year safety performances at Evander Mines have 
resulted in the best ever recorded Reportable Injury and Lost 
Time Injury Frequency Rates for this operation 
Phoenix maintained its excellent safety record, with no injuries 
recorded since turning the first sod in April 2010.
In South Africa, most of the shallow and easily accessible 
mineral deposits are depleted with mining now taking place 
at exceptional depths. Despite these difficult conditions, the 
mining industry has improved safety over the past 10 years 
by 66%, to levels comparable with the United States. Fatalities 
from “fall of ground”accidents have reduced by 81%, from  
134 in 2003 to 26 in 2012. The industry reduced the  
172 fatalities reported in 2002 to 54 in 2011.
The fact that the South African mining industry was able to 
outperform every other mining country in improving safety 
levels is an object lesson as to what can be done when 
labour, management and government proactively collaborate 
in resolving a pressing issue. This proves that with a focused 
effort, all stakeholders can work together for the common 
good of the industry. 
South African mining in context
Despite all the social and economic difficulties in the mining 
sector, currently highlighted by the anniversary of the Marikana 
tragedy and demanding labour negotiations, our industry 
remains a primary South African economic driver. The South 
African Chamber of Mines estimates that mining is directly 
responsible for 19% of all South African economic activity 
and that its products support a further 25% of industrial and 
other economic activity. The materials produced by South 
Africa’s mines are beneficiated or processed by downstream 
industries to produce many of our countries most essential 
goods and services.  Mining also generates a very significant 
percentage of South Africa’s foreign currency reserves, and 
supports our own rand.
According to the Chamber of Mines the South African mining 
industry directly employed an estimated 513,000 employees 
with an average annual remuneration per mining employee 
of ZAR169,679 in 2011. This represents approximately 6.3% 
of the country’s formal non-agricultural employment and an 
increase of 169% in annual wages from 2001 to 2011.
Although a mature industry in South Africa and possibly 
incorrectly perceived to be declining in importance, South 
Africa as a country still has the world’s biggest stockpile of 
proven mineral reserves. This is in a world where global mining 
provides the raw materials for 45% of the world’s economic 
activity. Although South Africa has slipped down the table of 
gold producers from its previously held top spot, our country 
holds approximately 12.7% of the world’s gold reserves and 
produces approximately 7.8% of its annual production (2011 
Chamber of Mines figures).
Our government attracts a good deal of negative media 
attention at times. South African leaders have however 
recognised that urgent societal and economic transformation 
is required to uplift our poor and mend our society, and 
their programmes over the last 20 years have done a great 
deal.  Since 2009 South Africa has spent ZAR860 billion rand 
on infrastructure projects, with a further ZAR430 billion 
allocated for additional development. This funding goes 
into schools, public health, water and sanitation, as well as 
expanding transport and logistics links. South Africa’s National 
Development Plan will provide the “blueprint” for our future 
development and growth.
South African mining has a key role to play in financing GDP 
growth and helping reduce unemployment. To be able to 
perform this role, we must be allowed the security of tenure 
and scope to attract capital investment into maintaining and 
developing mines.
Our mining industry has entered into a critical phase. For 
some years now it has been the battleground of choice for 
opposing political ideologies, populist leaders – and more 
recently, competing trade unions. 
Government has been working hard to stabilise the situation 
and we are fully behind Deputy President Motlanthe’s 
consensus-seeking efforts to draw all stakeholders into 
working together for a sustainable future for mining.
South African mining is at this juncture right now and we call 
on the leaders of all stakeholders – employees, government, 
mining houses, communities and political parties – to come 
to the table with the level-headed vision that South Africa 
showed the world when negotiating our relatively peaceful 
transition to democracy. At stake is the bedrock upon which 
the South African economy was built. 
Pan African has a diverse, multi-national shareholder base, but 
our operations and management is proudly South African.   
We are positive about the future of South Africa as a mining 
investment and operating destination, nowhere else in Africa 
has the established infrastructure, technical knowledge and 
support, and mining history and legacy of our country. We ask 
that shareholders continue to trust us to generate growth and 
returns in an environment we know well.
Pan African – 
A high-yielding dividend stock
We recognise that equity investors require a tangible return 
on their investment.   
The board has recommended a dividend approximating 
ZAR240 million for the financial year 2013, equating to 
ZAR0.1314 per share, resulting in a dividend cover of 
2.3 times. This dividend is to be approved at the AGM on 
22 November 2013. 
We believe the fact that we are able to pay a dividend so soon 
after the acquisition of Evander Mines, in a difficult economic 
and operating environment, demonstrates the quality of the  Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 20
Group’s people, assets and management’s ability to continue 
to deliver results. 
Subject to shareholder approval 
at the AGM, we will resume 
dividend payments at a proposed 
dividend of ZAR0.1314 per share.  
Mining reserves and resources
The Group’s approach to maximising the value of mineral 
resources and reserves is based on a well-defined exploration 
programme, innovation in both geological/resource modeling, 
optimal mine planning, and continual optimisation of the asset 
portfolio and brownfield projects.
The Group’s gold resources increased more than fivefold, due 
to the successful conclusion of the Evander Mines acquisition.  
Mineral resources now total 35.13 Moz of gold and 0.68 Moz 
of PGM 4E (2012: 5.98 Moz of gold and 0.49 Moz of PGM 4E). 
An aggressive exploration strategy at Barberton Mines 
identified new resources including the Segalla and Camelot 
slimes dams. Year-on-year, Barberton Mines raised its mineral 
resources by 574,164 oz of contained gold.
The Evander Mines acquisition contributed to a 693% increase 
in the Group’s mineral reserves to 9.20 Moz of gold.
Our successful commissioning of the BTRP at Barberton has 
encouraged us to develop the Evander Tailings Retreatment 
Plant (ETRP). Its tailings dumps contain a mineral reserve of 
409,000 oz of gold. This additional throughput will optimise 
the existing processing plant, and has a time frame of between 
12 and 18 months.
Other potential organic projects at Evander include the  
No. 3 Decline, which has a mineral resource of 2.30 Moz and 
a time frame of between 18 and 24 months to convert to a 
reasonable reserve.
Brownfield projects at Evander include Poplar and Evander 
South, both at a pre-feasibility stage. Recommendations have 
been submitted regarding the scope of work for a bankable 
feasibility study for these two projects.
Future outlook and growth
On-mine projects
Pan African Resources successfully operates according to our 
low cost and high margin business model. With the addition 
of a flat, empowered management team and low overhead 
structure, the Group believes that it has positioned itself as a 
long-term, sustainable business. 
Barberton Mines, as is evident from the success of the BTRP , 
has demonstrated a proven ability to source additional 
ounces at low input costs. The social impact of the BTRP in 
the Barberton area which has high unemployment, has been 
very positive with the creation of an additional 83 permanent 
employment opportunities. The Group will continue to ensure 
historic productions levels are maintained at Barberton Mines 
from the underground operations. The management team will 
further ensure the BTRP is brought into full production, taking 
Barberton Mines to 115,000oz of gold production.
Over the past year the mining industry has placed greater 
emphasis on cost delivery, free cash flows and enhanced

shareholders returns. Without diverting from this demand we 
will continue to concentrate on the efficient use of capital. 
Evander Mines has commenced a lower-grade mining cycle, 
until the 2015 financial year, when we will revert to the high-
grade mining cycle. In an effort to ameliorate this reduction in 
revenue from the mine, we have identified and are evaluating 
numerous potential organic projects at Evander Mines. 
Through the process of targeting incremental ounces, cost 
of production at Evander Mines will be reduced with greater 
economies of scale and infrastructure synergies. 
Already underway is a sweeping and vamping project at 
Evander No. 7 Shaft, producing gold from previously mined out 
areas. A second project to process additional surface sources 
requires the conversion of one of the current autogenous 
mills to a ball mill to process fines at a rate of 20,000 tonnes 
per month over 21 months, thereby extending the current 
LOM of surfaces sources. 
A further initiative being considered is the reopening of the 
No. 3 Decline mining section at Evander Mines No. 7 Shaft. 
This could enable the quick recovery of additional gold. An 
additional benefit of this project is that it allows access to the 
2010 Payshoot exploration project, which has the potential of 
a significant new mining area. 
Surface tailings within the Evander Mines complex have a total 
resource of 203 million tonnes at an average grade of 0.29 
g/t. A total reserve of 39 million tons of tailings at 0.32 g/t 
is available at Kinross. The Kinross metallurgical plant, with a 
nameplate capacity of 260,000 tonnes per month, has some 
180,000 tonnes per month of excess capacity. Having identified 
this as a “quick value” project, we initiated the necessary 
project work to bring the proposed ETRP into production. 
This project entails the upgrading of the existing Evander 
Mines plant, with capital spend estimated to be significantly 
less costly than that of the BTRP and with expected delivery 
to be within 18 months.
Phoenix Platinum will remain a focus area over next year in 
order to identify alternative feedstock for the plant to process, 
improve recoveries, reduce cost efficiencies and improve 
production levels.
Other major projects at Evander Mines
Additional major opportunities are Poplar, Evander South 
and Rolspruit projects. We have tasked SRK to perform a 
bankable feasibility gap analysis on previous pre-feasibility 
studies on the Poplar and Evander South projects and will, 
during the 2014 financial year, consider options of progressing 
these projects in a manner that will benefit the Group and 
its shareholders.
The Group’s operations have sufficient reserves and resources 
for long-term mining. While the gold price fluctuates through 
a zone of uncertainty and mining in general is challenged by 
labour, regulatory and cost pressures, Pan African will adopt 
a “steady as it goes” low-expenditure approach until the 
market indicates that we should develop more aggressively 
for faster growth.
Partnering with our stakeholders
Local communities at Barberton Mines and Evander Mines, 
are home to the majority of our operations employees. The 
betterment of these communities is in the interest not just of 
the Group and its employees but also the employees’ families, 
their children and parents and extended families. Better living 
conditions for employees and their loved ones and increasing 
economic development in the local communities contributes 
to South Africa’s journey and progress. Only through the 
consideration and collaboration of all stakeholders will 
the business succeed in aligning the needs and requirements 
of all, and operate in balance and harmony.
During the year the Group’s various operations expended 
some ZAR20.2 million (2012: ZAR14.4 million) on community 
and local economic development projects in terms of the 
approved social and labour plans (SLPs). This represents 4.2% 
(2012: 4.0%) of the Group’s headline earnings. 
Barberton Mines
Government has set targets for the mining industry in 
terms of social development and community upliftment. At 
Barberton Mines we strive not only to meet the criteria but 
to exceed them. We believe in creating a community where 
opportunity and development is available to all and to do so 
in a sustainable manner. This means that we provide funding 
and support through our community projects with the goal 
that they will become fully sustainable organisations in their 
own right.
As a result we have established a Transformation Trust with the 
explicit aim of ensuring critical mass by having our suppliers 
to invest alongside us in order to provide further financing 
for investing in the community. Deloitte Consulting has been 
appointed to administer the Trust. In this manner the Trust 
aims to raise a further two to three million rand per annum, 
over and above contributions from Barberton Mines. The 
project portfolio for the Trust is aligned with the Integrated 
Development Plan of the Umjindini Local Municipality.
Through Our Social and Labour Plans as well as our 
Corporate and Social investment initiatives, which form part 
of our approved mining licence, we operate several Local 
Economic Development (LED) projects in the community of 
which we are extremely proud. 
At Barberton Mines, a partnership with Adopt-a-School 
has resulted in the opening of the Sinqobile Primary School, 
which provides education to 1,100 pupils drawn from the 
local Sinqobile community. The project took three years 
from the planning and consultative stage to completion and 
created 39 temporary jobs during the construction period. 
The majority of the construction and establishment costs 
were expended with local suppliers. Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 22
The Sinqobile vegetable garden project has created nine 
permanent jobs and is operated as a fully functioning small 
business, providing fresh produce to the local community and 
retailers.
The Community Skills Development Centre in Sinqobile 
represents a significant investment in infrastructure in the 
community and is designed to promote job creation and small 
business development through the provision of technical 
training. To date, three cooperatives have been established by 
alumni of the centre. Barberton Mines assisted the Sewing 
cooperative in obtaining SABS standards approval, which 
affords them the opportunity to supply the Mine and other 
local businesses with safety clothing. The Welding cooperative 
has secured a contract with a local Hardware store to supply 
steel window frames and security gates.
The Umjindi jewellery project provides metal arts and 
jewellery manufacturing skills to disadvantaged youths from 
the local community, through a formal training and mentorship 
programme. The training is accredited by the MQA and has 
resulted in the creation of 8 full time jobs to date.
Bursaries – Following on our theme of learning and the 
development of our employees and the community, 
Barberton Mines implemented a fulltime bursary scheme 
during the 2011 financial year. Candidates are sourced from 
our local community, with the intention of offering them job 
opportunities on the completion of their studies. The bursary 
covers full tuition fees, accommodation, textbooks and a 
monthly allowance. Currently we have 10 fulltime students 
enrolled.
The mine also supports improved community health through 
participating and financially supporting the local municipality 
in its annual HIV/Aids awareness campaign. A follow up 
campaign at local schools was also sponsored during the year. 
This campaign focused on educating teachers and learners on 
dealing with pupils who are affected by HIV/AIDS. Five local 
schools benefitted from the program. The Department 
of Education expressed its appreciation to the Mine for 
supporting this initiative.
Over and above the current projects that are in place, 
Barberton Mine has also committed itself to the following 
new projects for the 2013/2014 financial year:
  The expansion of the Makhanya road in the Emjindini 
T ownship at a total project cost of ZAR2.5 million.
  Renovation of the De Kaap Vallei primary school at Sheba 
at a total project cost of ZAR800,000.
  The construction of a library and science block 
at Emjindini high school at a total project cost of 
ZAR1.2 million.
Barberton Mines also support and contribute financially on a 
monthly basis to the following local organisations:
  Verulam soup kitchen in Sinqobile – monthly contribution 
of ZAR12,000.
  Thandanani soup kitchen in Emjindini – monthly 
contribution of ZAR5,000.
 Mlambongwane Home based care centre – monthly 
contribution of ZAR5,000.
 St John’s HIV orphanage – monthly contribution of 
ZAR10,000.
 De Kaap Vallei school soup kitchen – monthly 
contribution of ZAR5,000.
Evander Mines
Evander Mines undertook several local economic 
development projects which have had a direct impact 
on the mining community surrounding the mine and its 
labour sending area in the Eastern Cape. These projects are 
conducted in partnership with the local municipalities and 
are designed to support implementation of Evander Mine’s 
integrated development plans.
Specific projects include:
  An internship programme, which employs four interns 
from the local community.
  The development of an SMME business through the 
construction of a bakery in Embalenhle T ownship. This 
project is expected to take three years to complete at 
an estimated cost of ZAR6 million.

Welcome and thanks
A warm welcome to all new employees, and stakeholders to 
the Pan African Resources stable and in particular, to all of 
the new employees at Evander Mines. Our thanks go out to 
Graham Briggs and his Harmony team for the professional 
and friendly manner in which the Evander Mines deal was 
undertaken and the continued support provided to Evander 
Mines through the current shared services arrangement.
Pan African Resources is privileged to have the right people 
at all levels in our organisation, but none are more important 
than those men and women who go underground daily and 
competently perform their duties, often under physically 
challenging circumstances. I would like to thank the general 
managers, namely Casper Strydom at Barberton Mines, 
Manny da Silva at Evander Mines and Bertin Mcleod at 
Phoenix Platinum for their tireless effort and achievements 
during the financial year. 
Underpinning our success and assisting in ensuring a bright 
future for Pan African Resources are the on-mine support 
crews, management and the behind the scenes corporate 
employees who deliver their best for the Group. Our lean and 
flat structure makes the business model possible and ensures 
we continue to deliver on our set goals.
At the end of February 2013 our previous CEO, Jan Nelson, 
left Pan African Resources and we thank him for his years of 
service and wish him well in his future ventures.
During the current year, our shareholders entrusted us with 
more than ZAR707.3 million in an oversubscribed rights issue.  
We wish to thank this very distinguished shareholder base for 
their continued faith and loyal support. 
We have also been strongly supported by a well established 
board that offers a broad range of experience in mining and 
commerce. Their ongoing advice and guidance is invaluable in 
ensuring we remain on course. During the year Shanduka, our 
BEE shareholder, rendered exceptional business expertise and 
contributed to our success. 
We look forward to continuing our onward journey together!

Commentary on financial results
Pan African Resources is committed to creating value for all 
its stakeholders. For shareholders, value is determined by 
the share price performance, sustainable earnings, cashflow 
growth and by dividends paid by the Company.
All of the Group’s subsidiaries are incorporated in South 
Africa and their functional currency is ZAR. The Group’s 
books of prime entry are maintained in ZAR and, with 
the exception of product sales, which are conducted in 
US dollars (USD) prior to conversion into ZAR, business 
is conducted in ZAR. The ongoing review of the results of 
operations conducted by executive management and by the 
board is also performed in ZAR.
The Group’s presentation currency is the Pound sterling 
(GBP), due to its ultimate holding Company, Pan African 
Resources PLC, being incorporated in England and Wales 
and dual-listed in the United Kingdom and South Africa.
In the current financial year, the average ZAR/GBP exchange 
rate was ZAR13.84:1 (2012: ZAR12.27:1), and the 
closing ZAR/GBP exchange rate was ZAR15.01:1 (2012: 
ZAR12:91:1). The year-on-year change in the average and 
closing exchange rates of 12.8% and 16.3% respectively must 
be taken into account for the purposes of translating and 
comparing year-on-year results.
The commentary below analyses the current year’s results 
and provides insight into the Group’s expectations for the 
2014 financial year. Key aspects of the Group’s ZAR results 
appear in the body of this commentary and have been 
used as the basis against which its financial performance 
is measured. The gross GBP equivalent figures can be 
found in the Salient Features of this report, appearing on 
page 5. Similarly, ZAR is the currency used in discussing 
the operations’ performance, included in the Operational 
performance section on page 52 to 89.
External drivers of financial results
The profitability of the Group is dictated by various economic 
drivers, the most significant of which are:
  The USD spot gold price – determines the price received 
for gold and PGM 6E produced.
  The USD/ZAR exchange rate – determines the value 
received in South Africa for gold and other metals 
produced and ultimately the Group’s revenue. Also drives 
specific costs of production and capital goods.
  South African general inflation, wage rate and other price 
increases – which determine the rate of increase in the 
major elements of the Group’s costs.
  The GBP/ZAR exchange rate – influences the Group’s 
reporting performance in GBP .

the year in a stronger 
financial position. Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 25
COMPANY OVERVIEW LEADERSHIP STATEMENTS OUR BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Platinum price during the 2013 financial year decreased 
by 3.4% to USD1,552/oz (2012: USD1,606/oz). Phoenix 
Platinum achieved an average market basket price of  
USD1,030/oz (2012: USD968/oz), after taking into account the 
terms of the off-take agreement with Western Platinum Limited.
The USD/ZAR exchange rate
The Group converts and records its revenue from precious 
metal sales in ZAR, and the deterioration in the value of 
the ZAR/USD exchange rate during the financial year had a 
compensating effect on the weaker USD metals price revenue.
The average ZAR/USD exchange rate was 13.9% weaker, at 
ZAR8.83:1 (2012: ZAR7.75:1).
The average ZAR gold price received by the Group increased 
by 4.4% to ZAR440,824/kg (2012: ZAR422,215/kg), shielded 
by the weakening in the ZAR against the USD.
The average ZAR PGM 6E basket price received by the Group 
increased by 21.3% to ZAR9,093/oz (2012: ZAR7,499/oz).
USD and ZAR gold prices for the previous two years are 
represented graphically in the chart below.
South African inflation, wage rate 
and other cost increases
During the financial year, the consumer price index (CPI), (a 
primary indicator of South Africa’s inflation), was reported 
at 5.5% (2012: 5.5%). The main indicator of producer price 
inflation (PPI), was measured at 5.9% (2012: 6.6%).
The GBP/ZAR exchange rate
The ZAR’s performance against the GBP is a key determinant 
of the GBP results and, as such, it is important for shareholders 
both in South Africa and the UK to be aware of the effect 
exchange has on reported results. The value of the ZAR 
against the GBP deteriorated for the major part of the 
financial year, with a significant weakening in the ZAR seen 
from October 2012. The average GBP/ZAR exchange rate 
was 12.8% weaker at ZAR13.84:1 when compared to the 
previous year (2012: ZAR12.27:1).
The GBP/ZAR exchange rate for the previous year is

2.  Maximising cash generation and increasing the revolving 
credit facility (RCF) to ensure sufficient funding for the 
BTRP and on-mine capital expenditure.
  Although the Group increased its available RCF from 
ZAR150 million to ZAR600 million, it generated sufficient 
internal cashflows to fund all the BTRP and on-mine capital 
expenditure, amounting to ZAR381.6 million, without 
drawing on this facility.

concluding a rights issue with shareholders and finalising 
debt finance with third parties.
  The Group successfully completed its acquisition of 
Evander Mines from Harmony on 28 February 2013. 
4.  Integrating Evander Mines’ financial systems with those 
of Pan African Resources, which also included migrating 
Harmony’s shared services (currently provided to Evander 
Mines) to Pan African Resources.
The Group is engaged in the integration process and is aiming 
to implement a new financial system at Evander Mines. We will 
further ensure that all shared services processes are migrated 
by the end of the 2014 financial year.
Analysing the successful  
acquisition of Evander Mines 
On 30 May 2012, Pan African Resources advised shareholders 
that it had entered into an agreement with Harmony to acquire 
the entire issued share capital and claims against Evander 
Interest rates
The Group pays a margin of 280 bps above the Johannesburg 
interbank agreed rate (JIBAR) on our RCF balance outstanding, 
and received interest on cash on hand at quoted call account 
rates. Movements in interest rates affects the interest expense 
and income. Currently Jibar at 30 June 2013 was quoted at 
the following rates:
1 month  5.0%
3 month  5.1%
6 month  5.5%
9 month  5.6%
12 month  5.9%
Report-back on the financial 
objectives as outlined in the  
2012 report
All the financial objectives set in 2012 were successfully met 
in 2013, thereby ensuring Pan African Resources finished the 
year in a stronger financial position:
1.  Maximising margins by containing costs, based on a 
forecasted average gold price of ZAR400,000/kg, PGM 6E 
basket price of USD1,030/oz and exchange rates of ZAR/
USD 8.34:1 and ZAR/GBP 13.26:1.
  The stronger gold price that prevailed over the first three 
quarters of the financial year, weaker ZAR against the USD 
and overall cost containment helped the Group achieve 
this objective.

Mines for a purchase consideration of ZAR1,500 million. 
The acquisition was concluded by a wholly-owned subsidiary 
of the Company, Emerald Panther Investments 91 Pty Ltd 
(Emerald Panther). In terms of the sale and purchase 
agreement, the purchase price increased effectively from 
1 October 2012, until the date that all conditions precedent 
had been met resulting in the purchase price increasing by 
ZAR23.1 million to ZAR1,523.1 million. 
The Group assumed effective control over Evander Mines on 
28 February 2013 and settled the final purchase consideration 
of ZAR1,523.1 million in the following manner:
 Funds raised from the shareholder rights issue of 
ZAR707.3 million,
  debt funded from a drawdown on the Group’s RCF 
of ZAR350 million (total RCF facility available of 
ZAR600 million),
  cash funded from operational cash flows of 
ZAR255.8 million,
  cash generated by Evander Mines prior to Emerald 
Panther taking control of ZAR210.0 million. 
The ZAR210.0 million above represents cash generated 
by Evander Mines between 1 April 2012 and 28 February 
2013, and was paid as a dividend to Harmony prior to Pan 
African Resources assuming effective control of Evander 
Mines. For accounting purposes, this amount was deducted 
in determining the final purchase price consideration and 
investment held by Emerald Panther in Evander Mines, with 
the final investment amount calculated as ZAR1,313.1 million.
A preliminary analysis of the fair value assets and liabilities 
of Evander Mines at acquisition appears in the following 
purchase price allocation (PPA) table, prepared in accordance 
with IFRS3. This analysis resulted in a bargain purchase 
consideration of ZAR322.4 million, included in earnings for 
the year.

continued
Pan African Resources consolidated 
results
Group revenue year-on-year increased by 49.0% to 
ZAR1,848.1 million (2012: ZAR1.240.3 million). Evander 
Mines contributed ZAR438.9 million, Phoenix Platinum 
contributed ZAR58.9 million and Barberton Mines contributed 
ZAR110 million, resulting in a ZAR607.8 million increase in 
revenue. Barberton Mines recorded an increase in revenue 
due to an increase in gold ounces sold and higher ZAR gold 
prices achieved. The Group realised an average gold price of 
ZAR440,824/kg (2012: ZAR422,215/kg) and an average price 
for PGM 6E of ZAR292,355/kg.
The Group’s year-on-year total cost of production reflects 
an increase by ZAR419.1 million to ZAR985.1 million (2012: 
ZAR566.0 million), of which Evander Mines contributed 
ZAR275.5 million, and Phoenix Platinum ZAR48.9 million 
of the increase. Barberton Mines’ costs increased by 16.7%, 
which contributed ZAR94.7 million to the Group’s cost of 
production increase.
The Group has adopted reporting cash costs in line with 
the recommendation of the World Gold Council, and the 
table below reflects the consolidated Group’s overall gold 
operations costs per kilogram.
The Group’s cost of production per kilogram increased by 
19.7% to ZAR231,439/kg (2012: ZAR193,360/kg). Evander 
Mines’ cost of production averaged ZAR259,640/kg, 
compared to Barberton Mines’ average cost of production of 
ZAR221,424/kg. Factors contributing to the average increase 
year-on-year were salary and wages costs increases at 
Barberton Mines of 16.1%, an increase in the cost of electricity 
of 15.0%, mining costs increasing by 32.3%, primarily due to 
higher vamping contractor costs as a result of additional 
kilograms produced by this contractor. The mining costs also 
included additional secondary support costs incurred at 
Fairview to establish additional mineable panels.
The Group’s all-in sustaining cash cost of production per 
kilogram (including direct cost of production, royalties, 
associated corporate costs and overheads and sustainable 
capital expenditure) increased by 14.1% to ZAR281,551/kg 
(2012: ZAR 246,801/kg), largely impacted by higher on-mine 
maintenance and development capital expenditure.
The Group’s all-in cost per kilogram (sustaining cost of 
production plus once-off expansion capital) increased by 
29.4% to ZAR343,949/kg (2012: ZAR 265,713/kg), due to 
high capital expenditure incurred on the construction of 
the BTRP and Evander shaft deepening project. The Group 
incurred overall lower royalty costs as a result of the higher 
capital expenditure on the BTRP, which is factored into the 
all-in cash costs for the royalty calculation. When costs are 
compared to the average gold price received of ZAR440,824/
kg during the year, it demonstrates the Group’s current overall 
available gold mining margins. The Group’s EBITDA increased 
by 33.1% to ZAR735.2 million (2012: ZAR552.5 million), 
mainly as a result of the inclusion of Evander Mines’ EBITDA 
of ZAR152.3 million.
Pan African Resources achieved an increase of 55.7% in profit 
after tax to ZAR558.9 million (2012: ZAR358.9 million), due 
to inter alia, the following reasons:
 An improved performance at Barberton Mines,
 four months profit contribution from Evander Mines, 
 bargain purchase gain of ZAR322.4 million arising on the 
Evander Mines acquisition. 
The bargain purchase gain was largely offset by once-off 
costs, comprising of Phoenix Platinum’s impairment of 
ZAR100 million, an Auroch impairment of ZAR142.3 million, a 
Manica loss on disposal of asset held for sale of ZAR8.2 million 
and once-off acquisition costs relating to Evander Mines of 
ZAR18.7 million.

COMPANY OVERVIEW LEADERSHIP STATEMENTS OUR BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The impairments arose as a result of, inter alia, lower precious 
metal price forecasts and exploration and mining challenges in 
the current depressed mining environment.
The Group’s current tax charge increased marginally by 5.4% 
to ZAR167.9 million (2012: ZAR159.3 million). The significant 
BTRP capital expenditure of ZAR229.6 million incurred in the 
year was fully tax deductible, resulting in the effective current 
tax rate decreasing to 22.2% (2012: 30.7%). Phoenix Platinum 
has unredeemed capital expenditure of ZAR133.2 million at 
year end, which will be utilised in the future.
The Group’s EPS in ZAR amounted to 34.51 cents 
(2012: 24.83 cents) resulting in an increase of 39.0%. The 
rights issue during January 2013 resulted in the weighted 
average number of shares in issue increasing by 12.1% during 
the year to 1,619.8 million (2012: 1,445.2 million).
The Group’s HEPS in ZAR terms amounted to 30.07 cents 
(2012: 24.89 cents), an increase of 20.8%. The current year’s 
HEPS differ from EPS due to the bargain purchase gain, 
impairment charges and loss on disposal of asset held for sale, 
which are adjusted for when calculating the HEPS. This net 
adjustment amounted to ZAR71.9 million. 
Readers are directed to the segmental information included 
on page 129 of the annual financial statements and the 
operational performance reviews for further analysis.
Because of the funds required for the acquisition of Evander 
Mines, the board of directors did not propose a dividend 
for the year ended 30 June 2012. Now, with the continued 
satisfactory results from Barberton Mines and the successful 
funding of the Evander Mines transaction, the board of 
directors has proposed a dividend of ZAR240 million, or 
ZAR0.1314 cents, resulting in a dividend cover of 2.3 times. 
Non-current assets increased by 225.8% to 
ZAR3,726.2 million. The majority of this significant increase 
is attributable to the Evander Mines acquisition and related 
fair value adjustment to the property plant and equipment 
acquired (ZAR2,157.0 million) as well as capital expenditure 
at Barberton Mines of which ZAR316.8 million, of which 
ZAR229.6 million related to the BTRP and is classified as a 
major project and therefore non-sustainable capital. Included 
in non-current assets at 30 June 2013 is Evander Mines’ 
rehabilitation trust fund balance of ZAR218.7 million. The 
rehabilitation trust funds are invested in interest-bearing 
short-term investments or medium-term equity linked notes 
issued by commercial banks.
Current assets increased by 9.2% to ZAR401.5 million as 
a result of increases in inventory and accounts receivable. 
Inventory increased due to the inclusion of Evander Mines’ 
inventory balances, which included Evander Mines’ gold stock 
not yet sold. In addition BTRP’s reagent consumables were 
held for the first time in the current year. The Group’s debtor 
days increased to 30 days (2012: 15 days), due to larger 
debtor balances at year-end.
Contributing to the increase in the Group’s equity are the 
proceeds of ZAR707.3 million rights issue undertaken to fund 
the Evander Mines acquisition and the increase in the current 
year’s retained income, as a result of profit of after tax of 
ZAR558.9 million.
Non-current liabilities increased by 564.2% to 
ZAR1,200.9 million due to the inclusion of Evander Mines’ 
rehabilitation provision of ZAR182.3 million and Evander 
Mines’ deferred tax liability of ZAR607.9 million. In addition, 
Pan African Resources raised ZAR350 million in RCF debt to 
fund Evander Mines’ transaction. At 30 June 2013, an amount 
of ZAR165.2 million of this RCF debt remains outstanding and 
is included in non-current and current liabilities. It is pleasing to 
note that ZAR184.8 million was repaid within four months of 
the initial ZAR350 million drawdown.
Current liabilities increased by 152.8% to ZAR361.2 million. 
The majority of the increase relates to the inclusion of 
Evander Mines’ trade and other payables, amounting to 
ZAR192.1 million. The balance of the increase mainly relates 
to Barberton Mines’ increase in trade and other payables of 
ZAR58.3 million as result of the BTRP construction contracts.

Cash performance
The Group’s cash and cash equivalents decreased to  
ZAR71.6 million (2012: ZAR255.5 million) due to funding 
of both the Evander Mines acquisition and construction of 
the BTRP. Despite these outflows, the group was still able 
to generate sufficient cashflows from its operations to fund 
on-mine capital expenditure and ZAR184.8 million in RCF 
repayments during the year. 
The Group remains cash generative with a net debt position 
of only ZAR93.6 million at year-end. The cash generated by 
the operations is a reflection of the quality gold assets and 
the available profit margins as a result of cost control and 
improved production results.
Share price performance
Pan African Resources’ share price has over the past year 
performed well, relative to the FTSE/JSE gold mining index (SA 
gold mining index). The Group experienced an increase in the 
share price after announcing the Evander Mines transaction, 
however the share price declined along with other gold 
counters, as perceptions about the outlook for the global 
economy changed. Pan African Resources has performed 
better than its peers within the SA gold mining index.
The AIM share price performance highlights that during the 
year Pan African Resources remained competitive and in line 
with its peers, outperforming on occasion.

Financial objectives for 2014
Fully integrate Evander Mines into 
the Pan African Resources Group
The successful conclusion of the Evander Mines acquisition 
during the year required immense work and effort from 
many employees within the Group and at Harmony. These 
efforts have continued subsequent to the acquisition, and are 
now focused on integrating the procurement and financial 
departments and to realise efficiencies and cost savings. 
Following the successful implementation of an enterprise 
resource planning system at Barberton Mines in 2012, the 
same system is to be introduced at Evander Mines, Phoenix 
Platinum and Pan African Resources corporate office in order 
to improve financial control and alignment of reporting. 
Cost containment
The finance department will, together with operational 
management, focus on cost containment in 2014, in order to 
maximise margins and cash generation. In particular, we will 
look at exploring synergies to optimise systems and processes 
further and to ensure effective financial management and 
control at a reasonable cost.
Maintain dividend payments
It is the Group’s objective to maintain dividend payments 
to shareholders, subject to financial performance and future 
forecasts.

BACKGROUND
THE PAN AFRICAN RESOURCES GROUP
Pan African Resources is an African-focused precious metals 
mining company, comprising the following operations:
  The Barberton Mines gold mining operations, including the 
BTRP , with a total annual production capacity of 115 koz 
of gold.
  The Evander Mines gold mining operations, having an annual 
production capacity of 100 koz of gold.
 Phoenix Platinum, a chrome tailings retreatment plant 
(CTRP), having an annual production capacity of 12 koz 
PGM 6E.
The Company also has a 42% investment in Auroch, an 
Australian-listed gold exploration company, operating 
in Mozambique.
The Group’s total Mineral Reserves amount to 9.20 million 
ounces (Moz) of gold and 0.25 Moz of PGM 4E.
The Group’s total Mineral Resources amount to 35.13 Moz of 
gold and 0.68 Moz of PGM 4E.
Pan African Resources is committed to value creation for all 
its stakeholders through a strategy that places safe mining 
at its core, followed by the optimal mining of quality grade 
orebodies at low cash costs, in a manner that is sustainable 
and with minimum impact on the environment and a beneficial 
impact on the community.
Profitable growth is primarily achieved through prioritising 
organic projects available within the Group’s current asset 
portfolio. Where appropriate, targeted acquisitions fitting into 
the Group’s business philosophy are mining of quality, high 
grade low cost orebodies are considered.
Supporting this strategy are a variety of governance structures

COMPANY OVERVIEW LEADERSHIP STATEMENTS OUR BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
  Incorporated as Viking Internet PLC on February 2000 
and admitted to AIM in May 2000.
  Name changed to White Knight Investments PLC in 
September 2001.
  In December 2003, the Company completed the acquisition 
of Mistral, a company holding rights in relation to gold 
exploration properties in Ghana and Mozambique.
  A reverse takeover of Brampton Capital in September 2005 
resulted in the Company being readmitted to AIM as Pan 
African Resources.
  An interest in two exploration projects in the Central African 
Republic was acquired in 2006.
  A 74% interest in Barberton Mines was acquired from 
Metorex Limited (Metorex) in 2007, resulting in a reverse 
takeover of Pan African Resources by Metorex.
  Pan African Resources exercised its option to acquire 100% 
of Phoenix Platinum from Metorex for cash in May 2009.
  The Group acquired the remaining 26% of Barberton Mines 
from Shanduka in exchange for 295,751,549 shares in the 
Company in in the same transaction.
  Metorex disposed of its holdings in Pan African Resources 
to institutional investors and Shanduka in June 2009.
  During the financial year ended 30 June 2009, the feasibility 
of the exploration projects in Ghana and the Central African 
Republic were assessed, and it was concluded that these 
projects did not meet the Group’s criteria to continue with 
further exploration activity. Exploration activities on these 
projects were then discontinued.
  On 30 May 2012, Pan African Resources announced that it 
had entered into a conditional agreement pursuant to which 
Emerald Panther, a wholly owned subsidiary of Pan African 
Resources, would acquire the entire issued share capital of 
Evander Mines and all the shareholder loan claims against 
Evander Mines from Harmony.
HISTORY 
OF PAN AFRICAN RESOURCES
  On 28 August 2012, the Group entered into an agreement 
to dispose of 100% of its interest in Manica to Auroch.
  On 28 February 2013, Pan African Resources through 
Emerald Panther, finalised the acquisition of 100% of the issue 
share capital of Evander Mines.
  On 1 March 2013, Firefly Investments 251 (Pty) Ltd 
(renamed to Evander Gold Mining (Pty) Ltd), a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Emerald Panther, purchased the assets and 
liabilities of Evander Gold Mines Limited. Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 40
THE GLOBAL AND SOUTH AFRICAN
MINING ENVIRONMENT
Global economic conditions
 The gold industry is effectively a “price take”, and gold prices, 
denominated in USD, are impacted by worldwide economic 
conditions. 
The global recession has negatively impacted investment in 
mining activities, particularly as far as exploration and capital 
projects are concerned. This lack of investment should impact 
the supply of commodities in years to come.
 Over the past year, the global economic outlook has improved 
somewhat. The world’s economy has moved beyond the threat 
of a euro-led credit freeze and the USA is reporting generally – 
if somewhat erratic – improving production statistics, although 
the eurozone is expected to remain in recession for some 
time to come. However, uncertainty remains in global financial 
markets, which remain volatile. This continuing volatility may 
result in cost pressures and commodity price fluctuations.
 Recently, we have seen a flight of capital from emerging market 
economies, which has negatively impacted the currencies and 
economies in these countries. 
The South African economy 
The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has held its key 
repo rate at record lows in response to disappointing local 
economic growth and high unemployment. South African 
interest rates, however, remain relatively high compared to 
the world’s developed economies, which support the South 
African rand and mitigate to some extent imported and local 
inflation risks. Towards the end of 2012 and the first half of 
2013, continued weakness in the South African economy, the 
threat of mass strike action and a lack of investor confidence, 
together with signs of recovery elsewhere, saw the South 
African rand weaken to its lowest levels in more than four 
years. It is now considered to be severely undervalued. 
Not only does the recent rand weakness impact directly on 
current revenues and costs, but its inherent volatility as an 
emerging market currency increases uncertainty regarding future 
revenues and costs. It may be expected that a weaker South 
African rand would result in a higher rand gold price; however , the 
USD price of gold has also declined on signs of a global economic 
recovery. As such, the rand value of gold is range-bound by the 
combination of the gold price and the exchange rate.
The majority of the South African mining industry’s costs, 
mainly wages and energy, are rand-based. Social pressures 
have seen wages increase at rates significantly above inflation 
in recent years, and the need to recapitalise and develop the 
country’s energy industry has resulted in the cost of electricity 
increasing by more than 25% per annum between 2008 and 
2011, and 16% in 2012. Electricity tariff increases have been 
limited to a much lower 8% for 2013/14, but these increases 
remain above inflation. The five-year multiyear electricity price 
increase determination has been set at 8%, introducing a level 
of certainty to this key input cost going forward.
Changes in the market price for gold
 The market price of gold is very volatile. Fluctuations in gold 
prices are caused by numerous factors including speculative 
positions taken by investors or traders, changes in either the 
supply or demand for gold, financial market expectations 
regarding the rate of inflation, the strength of the US dollar 
relative to other currencies, changes in interest rates, actual 
or expected gold sales and purchases by central banks, the 
emergence of gold-based exchange traded funds, gold sales 
by gold producers in forward transactions, global or regional 
political or economic events and costs of gold production in 
major gold-producing nations.
Gold prices have recently been under pressure, inter alia, as a 
result of a general view that the world economy is recovering 
and new regulations to curb gold imports in India.
The gold price ranged from USD1,192 to USD1,792 per 
ounce in the 2013 financial year and the price of gold as at 
financial year-end was USD1,192 per ounce. The average 
price realised by the Group during the year was USD1,553 
per ounce. 
Labour disruption and trade union 
activities
 Employees in the South African mining industry are highly 
unionised and mining companies in South Africa face labour 
disruption resulting from labour disputes. Recently, trade union 
strike action at underground mines has had a major effect on 
the mining industry in South Africa. Inter-union rivalry, wildcat 
unprotected strikes and politicking by various political factions 
further complicate the industrial relations landscape. 
A high incidence of violence and intimidation is often 
associated with strikes, especially illegal strikes, resulting in 
loss of life and serious injury and property damage. Showing 
government’s commitment to the sector, South Africa’s 
deputy president, the Honourable Kgalema Motlanthe, was 
given the mandate to stabilise relationships between owners, 
managers and labour in a manner that will promote further 
investment in the sector. Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 41
COMPANY OVERVIEW LEADERSHIP STATEMENTS OUR BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The governance of mining rights  
and mining activities
 In South Africa, the award and maintenance of prospecting 
and mining rights are linked to meeting various obligations, 
including compliance with the Mining Charter, the Mineral and 
Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA) and other 
legislation. Compliance with the Mining Charter, measured 
using a designated scorecard (Mining Charter Scorecard), 
requires the achievement of equity participation in all 
prospecting or mining ventures by historically disadvantaged 
South Africans (HDSAs) of 26% by April 2014, and targeted 
levels of participation by HDSAs in management. 
 The industry is also prescribed to by the Code of Good 
Practice for the Minerals Industry (the Code) and the 
Housing and Living Conditions Standard (the Standard). The 
Code was developed to create principles to facilitate effective 
implementation of minerals and mining legislation and enhance 
implementation of the Mining Charter applicable to the mining 
industry. The Standard aims to include the provision of housing 
as an integral part of infrastructure during the development 
of a mine. 
 The South African Department of Trade and Industry has 
proposed changes to the Broad-based Black Economic 
Empowerment Act, No 53 of 2003 (BEE Act) which, if 
implemented, would provide a standard framework for the 
measurement of black economic empowerment compliance 
across all sectors of the economy. The implementation of 
an all-encompassing standard framework may result in 
targets previously agreed with the Department of Mineral 
Resources (DMR) becoming redundant, requiring the industry 
and individual mining houses to modify their approach to 
transforming the industry.
Competition 
 The mining industry is competitive in all of its stages. Mining 
companies compete for specialised equipment, components 
and supplies necessary for exploration and development, 
for mining claims and leases on exploration properties and 
for the acquisition of mining assets. 
 The South African industry also competes on a global basis to 
attract and retain key human resources with the appropriate 
technical skills and operating and managerial experience. 
This is further exacerbated in the current environment of 
increased mining activity across the globe. 
 The retention of staff is particularly challenging in South 
Africa where, in addition to the impacts of global industry 
shortages of skilled labour, the industry is required to achieve 
employment equity targets of participation by HDSAs in 
management. The current shortage of critical skills and 
experience in South Africa makes the development and 
retention of people essential to a successful mining business. 
Health and safety laws and regulations
 Over the past 20 years, the South African gold mining industry 
has responded to increasing demands to improve safety on 
its mines, and is subject to a variety of industry-specific health 
and safety laws and regulations to protect employees. The 
government enforces compulsory shutdowns of operations 
to enable investigations into the cause of accidents at those 
operations. In particular, the so-called “section 54” safety 
stoppages have become a significant issue. Stoppages can be 
enforced by the Inspector of Mines for a variety of reasons 
and can impact specific shafts or levels, or the entire mine. 
A demonstrable commitment to safe production and good 
relationships with the DMR and its representatives are key 
elements to minimising the impacts of these stoppages.
 Safety in South African mines has improved drastically over 
recent years, with a significant decrease in fatalities and injuries 
across all sectors of the industry.
Illegal mining 
 South Africa’s poor economic growth and high unemployment 
rates incite illegal mining activities. The presence of illegal 
miners on mine land and within the working area of a mine 
pose serious safety risks – not just to the illegal miners, but 
also to the mine’s employees. This phenomenon increases the 
security costs associated with mining. Pan African Resources 
is engaged in a continuous and focused effort to reduce the 
impact of illegal mining on our operations.
Environmental laws and regulations
Environmental laws and regulations in South Africa are world 
class and establish limits and conditions on the industry’s 
extraction; use and conservation of water resources; air 
emissions (including dust control); water treatment and 
discharge; regulatory and community reporting; clean-up of 
contamination; worker safety and community health; and 
the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid 
and hazardous wastes such as acids, radioactive materials 
and mine tailings. The requirement for compliance with 
environmental laws and regulations has increased in line with 
international trends.
Environmental laws and regulations are continually changing 
and are generally becoming more prescriptive. Failure to 
comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
may result in the suspension or revocation of permits 
and rights. 
Water quality and usage are areas of concern globally, but are 
particularly significant for water-stressed South Africa, where 
there is significant potential for environmental and social 
impacts. Any failure to secure access to suitable water supplies, 
or achieve and maintain compliance with the requirements of 
the permits or licences, could result in curtailment or halting 
of production at the affected operation. The South African  Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 42
THE GLOBAL AND SOUTH AFRICAN
MINING ENVIRONMENT continued
Department of Water Affairs monitors compliance with 
regard to water matters.
 South African mining companies are required by law to close 
their operations at the end of a mine’s life, rehabilitate the 
lands mined and manage the potential for acid mine drainage. 
Estimates of total ultimate closure and rehabilitation costs for 
gold mining operations are significant and based principally 
on life-of-mine (LOM) profiles, changing inflation and discount 
rate assumptions, changing designs of tailings storage facilities 
and current legal and regulatory requirements. Accounting 
standards require that environmental liabilities are accrued 
when they become known, probable and can be reasonably 
estimated. Increasingly, regulators are seeking security in the 
form of cash collateral or bank guarantees in respect of 
environmental obligations. Pan African Resources assesses its 
liabilities in this regard on an annual basis, and creates financial 
provisions accordingly.
 Both direct and indirect emissions of greenhouse gases 
(GHGs) are receiving ever-increasing attention and increased 
disclosure expectations. The South African mining industry, 
through its use of fossil fuels and electricity generated by 
Eskom, the local energy utility, is responsible for the emission 
of substantial quantities of GHGs. In response to international 
initiatives, including the Kyoto Protocol and the Durban 
Platform, commitments by the South African government 
to reduce the country’s emissions have led to a proposed 
carbon tax, expected to be introduced in 2015. The costs of 
monitoring, measuring and managing energy consumption 
may well be offset by energy efficiencies achieved. However, 
carbon taxes – especially those imposed on local electricity 
utility Eskom – will, in all likelihood, see further increases in the 
cost of electricity.
Climate change
 The mining industry could be exposed to a number of 
physical risks from climate change, such as changes in 
rainfall rates, reduced water availability, higher temperatures 
and extreme weather events. Events or conditions such as 
flooding or inadequate water supplies could disrupt mining 
and transport operations, mineral processing, power supplies 
and rehabilitation. Furthermore, these could cause resource 
shortages, damage property or equipment and increase 
health and safety risks.
Investor perceptions
The gold mining sector, as a whole, has failed to deliver 
adequate equity returns to investors over the last years. 
Currently, investors are demanding renewed focus by the 
management of gold mining companies on issues such as 
capital rationalisation, reduction of expenses and profitability.
Resource nationalism
 The bull market commodities have resulted in a global increase 
in resource nationalism. Stakeholders in the countries and 
areas in which mining companies operate are all demanding 
increased participation in mining ventures. This participation 
takes many forms, with increased taxation and shareholdings 
by communities being two examples. Mining companies can no 
longer view stakeholder engagement as ancillary to their core 
business – maintaining and improving working relationships 
with all stakeholders is critical to sustainability. Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 43
COMPANY OVERVIEW LEADERSHIP STATEMENTS OUR BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The four pillars – an integrated 
business and reporting model
Pan African Resources aims to create value for all our 
stakeholders by operating our business at a point or 
intersection where all our shareholders, our employees, 
partners and the local communities in which we operate 
benefit. To ensure we operate within these bounds, we use 
the concept of four business pillars to drive and monitor our 
performance:
  Profitable
  Sustainable
  Stakeholders
 Growth
Profitable
Ongoing profitability would be expected to be the most 
logical purpose for a business, but some mining companies 
appear to have overlooked this core principle in their pursuit 
of more mine developments and resource ounces. They have 
consequently suffered losses as a result of factors such as 
over expenditure, reduced commodity prices and growing 
stakeholder discord.
We are always aware that gold prices rise and fall, and 
therefore strive to keep costs down in anticipation of the 
lean years, when cash must still be generated for ongoing 
operations and shareholders. We are mindful that investors 
rightly expect due returns, so will only expand operations or 
make acquisitions when the fundamentals are in place. 
Profitability business pillar results in 
numbers:
  Average ZAR gold price realised ZAR440,824/kg  
(2012: ZAR422,215/kg).
 T otal gold cash cost ZAR231,439/kg  
(2012: ZAR193,360/kg).
  Gross profit margin achieved from gold operations 
of 47.5% (2012: 54.2%) or ZAR849.8 million  
(2012: ZAR672.3 million).
 Revenue from PGM 6E sales of ZAR58.9 million 
(2012: nil).
  EBITDA of ZAR735.2 million (2012: ZAR552.5 million), 
an increase of 33.1%.
  Attributable profit of ZAR558.9 million  
(2012: ZAR358.9 million), an increase of 55.8%.
 EPS up 39.0% to 34.51 cents (2012: 24.83 cents).
 HEPS up 20.8% to 30.07 cents (2012: 24.89 cents).

GROWTH Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 44
PERFORMING AGAINST
OUR BUSINESS MODEL continued
Sustainable
We view sustainability broadly in two ways. The wider definition 
of sustainability is that Pan African Resources’ operations and 
the pursuit of financial returns should not be conducted 
without heeding our broader responsibilities towards the 
environment and society. For Pan African Resources itself, 
sustainability means operating within parameters determined 
by government laws, the market context, current and long-
term risks and opportunities, corporate governance and 
financial prudence, so that the long-term viability of the 
Company is not at any time threatened.
Prudent capital structuring 
and investment
Pan African Resources is committed to maintaining the profit 
margins at our operations as the basis for our success, and 
we strive to do this safely. Should the gold price fall to a 
level approaching our all-in sustainable cost of production 
for any continued period, we will review all projects, capital 
expenditure and costs to preserve cash. We believe that a 
true measurement of our success must be based on an all-in 
cash cost of production in ZAR/kg.
An enabling culture
Pan African Resources remains competitive and sustainable 
by enabling a company culture that embraces our people 
as our primary asset, rather than an expensive liability. We 
value expertise and nurture talent, while encouraging the 
free flow of ideas, trends and information between all levels. 
We keep this culture of success vibrant by attracting the 
best people, retaining those we have and providing training 
and skills development. We also work diligently to maintain 
safe underground and working conditions, supported by 
continuous improvement of safety and productivity standards.
A key factor is that we encourage each individual to be an 
integral part of the business. Practically, this means engendering 
trust and honesty, continual listening and addressing issues 
rather than people. 
Pan African Resources is structured to support this flat and 
mutually supportive culture by having a small corporate 
office and devolving most management functions to the mine 
managers and their on-site teams.
Evander Mines has brought with it management systems 
inherited from Harmony. As long as these are appropriate 
to that particular mining operation, Pan African Resources 
will not change systems simply to match those at Barberton 
Mines. We are evaluating the two operations, and where 
appropriate will cross-pollinate with those systems we regard 
as best practice. Following the successful implementation of an 
ERP system at Barberton Mines in 2012, the same system is to 
be introduced at Evander Mines to improve financial control 
and reporting.
Environmental impacts 
and good corporate citizenship
Pan African Resources has long accepted that human 
activities are a direct cause of negative climate change, and 
that our operations cannot be conducted in isolation from 
environmental and social interests. Our engagement goes 
beyond mere compliance with legislated environmental, social 
and labour requirements. We are proud of the 1,100-learner 
school we built near Barberton Mines and the food and job 
opportunity projects in which Pan African Resources is involved.
Having recently acquired Evander Mines, we have evaluated 
its social and environmental programmes. Certain aspects are 
impressive – in particular, its internal employee development 
programme, and the building of a bakery and kiosks, totalling 
an investment of ZAR6 million over the last three years.
To keep this report concise in accordance with current 
integrated reporting best practice, we refer you to a full

Stakeholders
The Group’s shareholders and stakeholders are key participants 
in developing the strategic objectives that inform our planning 
and actions. By being involved, they understand the realities of 
Pan African Resources’ operations and will easier accept that 
there will be difficult years as well as good years. 
During this reporting period, we actively engaged key 
stakeholder groups such as our employees, communities, 
investors and shareholders, regulators, analysts and the media. 
We worked to ensure that these engagements were thorough 
and meaningful. Stakeholder inputs were fed back into strategy, 
risks, opportunities, future planning, environmental planning, 
social and labour plans (SLPs), and the relevant committees 
and operations. A further disclosure of Pan African Resources’ 
stakeholder engagement activities is included in the Corporate

  Community social investment amounted to 
ZAR20.2 million (2012: ZAR14.4 million), 4.2% of 
headline earnings (2012: 4.0%).
Growth
A key aspect of Pan African Resources’ business model is the 
healthy margin between our cost of production and the market 
price of the metals we produce. Ensuring a significant margin 
safeguards our sustainability and funds shareholder satisfaction.
Pan African Resources has no influence over metal prices, but 
we can control production costs and ensure that the Group 
only acquires high grade orebodies. The board has stipulated 
explicit criteria for orebodies already in our Reserves and 
additional projects we may consider acquiring. 
Should gold prices decline, as they have recently, the Group 
can continue generating profit due to the quality and cost 
profile of our operations and orebodies. We have invested 
considerable funds into our Mineral Resource Management 
(MRM) programme, to ensure that our Resources and 
Reserves are accurately mapped out for viable mining in the 
medium to long term.
As stated earlier, Pan African Resources has no immediate plans 
to make further acquisitions, unless exceptional opportunities 
become available that fit into our high grade/low cost parameters. 
On the cost of production side, we will factor in rising input 
costs – electricity in particular – and the potential for wage 
increases in excess of inflation due to the current mismatch 
between economic reality and worker expectations.

DELIVERING ON
OUR STRATEGY
In the year under review, the Group has achieved in all areas of our strategy through, inter alia, optimising existing operations at 
Barberton Mines – an asset with a significant production life that offers high grade gold mining at a relatively low cash cost.
Growth is being realised through the successful acquisition of Evander Mines, which promises expanded future production 
through an array of organic project opportunities. Following this successful transaction, further acquisitive growth opportunities 
will be thoroughly investigated as and when they arise, although this isn’t a priority at present.
In addition, the Group continues to address its environmental footprint and exposure through the retreatment of various tailings 
dams, both at its own gold mining operations and those arising as a result of chrome and platinum mining in South Africa’s North 
West Province. 
Indicators and comments on our performance against key drivers appear throughout this report. Below, we reflect on our 
performance against the four key strategic initiatives identified in our 2012 Annual Report. 
 Strategic initiative 2012 Performance in 2013
Finalise the acquisition of Evander Gold 
Mines and integrate it into the Group
  Cash of ZAR210 million generated prior to transaction closing was offset 
against Evander Mines purchase price.
 Final cash settlement price ZAR1.313 billion.
  ZAR707.3 million of total purchase price secured through an oversubscribed 
rights issue.
  Balance funded from internal cash resources and Nedbank/ABSA RCF of 
ZAR350.0  million.
 Results were consolidated from 1 March 2013 and integration into the Group 
progressing well.
 Management services agreement in place with Harmony until 28 February 
2014 (extendable by another six months).
 Evander Mines’ production totalled 34,197 oz for the four months ended 
June 2013.
 Investigation of project opportunities at No 7 Shaft progressing well and 
additional Mineral Resources quantified.
 The potential to treat surface material at Evander Tailings Retreatment Plant 
(ETRP) will contribute further to profitability.
 Other organic projects being investigated further.
Finalise the disposal of the Group’s  
Manica operation 
  100% of Manica sold to a wholly owned subsidiary of Australian Stock 
Exchange-quoted Auroch on 31 December 2012.
  T otal potential purchase consideration of AUD6 million payable in cash and 
shares in Auroch.
  Underlying purpose of the transaction was to fund exploration activities 
in Mozambique.
 At year-end, the Group’s equity interest in Auroch amounted to 42%.
  The balance of the purchase price is deferred until the achievement of 
certain milestones.
  The decline in both the gold price and market conditions has necessitated a 
ZAR142.3 million impairment of the Group’s investment in Auroch Minerals NL

 Strategic initiative 2012 Performance in 2013
Commission the BTRP  The plant was commissioned on schedule and within budget (ZAR305 million), 
with the inaugural gold pour taking place on 28 June 2013.
 The project was funded entirely from internal cash resources.
  the plant is designed to re-treat 100,000 tonnes of gold tailings per month at an 
estimated average cash cost of USD725/oz.
 The plant will ramp up to full production during the second quarter of the 
financial year 2013.
 The plant is expected to contribute an additional 20,000 oz of gold per annum.
Optimise the CTRP and produce  
PGM 6E
  Project plan was based on the retreatment of sulphide material from 
International Ferrous Metals’ (IFM) Lesedi Mine.
  PGM and chrome prices fell significantly below those forecasts at the time of 
the feasibility study.
 As a result of the poor chrome market conditions, IFM cut back operations 
at its Lesedi Mine in January 2012 and eventually stopped the underground 
sulphide production.
 IFM redirected its efforts towards its open-cast section.
 Highly oxidised tailings from open-cast chrome mining negatively impacts 
on the Phoenix Platinum plant’s recovery and concentrate grade, and hence 
PGM production.
 The Group is considering expediting an additional tailings storage facility to 
allow for the bypassing of the oxidised tailings and allow the plant to treat 
sulphide material from the existing tailings storage facility.
 Once the additional tailings storage facility is completed, recoveries and revenue 
are expected to increase significantly.
 The bypassing of oxide feedstock directly to the IFM tailings storage facility 
has had a positive effect. The continued success of this is dependent on the 
continued safe operation of the IFM tailings storage facility.
 An impairment of ZAR100 million was raised against Phoenix Platinum at year-
end, as a result of a decline in commodity prices and operating conditions. Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 48

Setting the scene
Barberton first produced gold in 1886 after the discovery of 
the first gold nugget by Edwin Bray.
During the 1970s and 1980s, AngloVaal consolidated various 
operations in the area including Sheba, New Consort and 
Agnes Mines. In 1998, the Company acquired Fairview Mine 
from the then owners Goldfields (previously Gencor). In 2003, 
AngloVaal sold the operations, excluding Agnes, to Metorex 
and, in 2006, Metorex reversed Barberton Mines into Pan 
African Resources.
The Barberton Mines mining complex consists of three 
mines: Fairview, New Consort and Sheba, and now the 
BTRP. The three mines currently produce approximately  
95,000 oz of gold per annum, with the BTRP , commissioned 
in June 2013, expected to produce 20,000 oz per annum. The 
combined operations are expected to produce approximately  
115,000 oz of gold in the 2014 financial year.
The Biological Oxidation (BIOX
®
) gold extraction process 
was developed at Barberton Mines and is used as a training 
facility for other BIOX
®
 plants in the industry. BIOX
®
 is an 
environmentally friendly process of releasing gold from the 
sulphide that surrounds it, using bacteria that perform this 
process naturally.
Barberton Mines is known for its high average head grade 
and remains one of the lowest cash cost producers of gold in 
the country. During 2013, the Barberton Mines team excelled, 
surpassing production targets and limiting average production 
cash costs to ZAR221,424/kg. As such, this relatively small 
mine in the Mpumulanga contributed considerably to the 
Group’s success in 2013. Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 53

Exploiting the orebody
Underground semi-mechanised cut and fill mining continued 
at all three of Barberton Mines mines and small quantities 
of low grade surface material were also processed. Whilst 
underground tonnages declined slightly from 2012, the 
additional low grade surface volumes resulted in the operation 
increasing its total tonnage milled and optimising plant 
throughput. From July 2013, the traditional underground 
mining operations will be supplemented by the BTRP .
Consistent recoveries and improved head grade allowed 
Barberton Mines to increase its overall recovered grade to 
9.64 (g/t), surpassing 2012’s gold production and sales.
Between 16% and 18% of gold is recovered by sweeping and 
vamping contractors, focusing on worked-out areas and high 
grade pillars. The proportion of gold production between 
the three mines of Fairview, Sheba and New Consort is 
approximately 50:30:20. The three mines introduce a level of 
flexibility and versatility with regard to potential interruptions 
and resource allocation.
The mix of ore from the mines is planned every month 
to maintain the targeted grade and gold production, thus 
managing the mines cash flow at an early stage in the mining 
process. 
Between 600 metres and 700 metres of development 
are drilled every month. A total of ZAR40.9 million 
(2012: ZAR37.7 million) of development capital was invested 
at Barberton Mines during the year.
Mining and processing –  
challenges and achievements
The mines at Barberton have been mined for more than 
100 years, and current production practices have been in place 
for many decades and are now embedded. The bulk of mining 
takes place during the morning shift, with the evening shift 
being dedicated to cleaning, dragging and hoisting. Planned 
plant maintenance takes place over weekends.
However, mining of the Fairview Mine faces increasing 
challenges as it becomes deeper. These challenges include 
managing the orebody, increasing ventilation, and development 
in the bottom of the mine to ensure orebody availability. 
BARBERTON MINES
continued
During the first six months of the financial year, operating 
performance was below budget, mainly attributed to a 
mechanical failure of the Sheba ZK winder bull gear as well 
as shaft refurbishment at the No 2 and No 3 declines at 
Fairview Mine. During the second half of the financial year, 
the Barberton Mines team delivered a solid performance and 
exceeded expectations, their production targets resulted in 
overall gold sold of 96,296 oz (2012: 94,449 oz). 
The on-time and within-budget construction and 
commissioning of the BTRP was a considerable achievement 
during the year. This is dealt in detail on page 57. 
The overall 14.5% increase in total cash costs per kilogram 
of gold was driven by increased vamping contractor fees 
(mainly due to greater production), higher payroll costs and 
electricity tariffs. 
The ZAR2,153/t (2012:ZAR1,844/t) total cash costs per 
tonne milled of ZAR2,153/t increased by 16.7% as a result 
of increased volumes, mainly due to the additional supply of 
low grade surface tonnes. The average price received for the 
year was ZAR450,829/kg, resulting in Barberton Mines margin 
of ZAR229,405/kg or 50.9%. Keeping costs under control 
is a continuous exercise of monitoring expenditure and 
identifying cost-cutting opportunities that do not compromise 
safe operations. 
Barberton Mines is not a member of the Chamber of Mines, 
allowing it to negotiate wage rates independently. Successful 
wage negotiations, albeit higher than the budget target, were 
conducted with the on-mine union representatives, and no 
industrial action occurred at the mine during the year. As a 
result of these negotiated wages, the mine’s overall payroll 
costs increased by 16.1% during the year. 
The employee incentive scheme was revised during the year, 
increasing the emphasis on safety targets, achieving production 
targets and increasing penalties for absenteeism. During the 
year, an absenteeism monitoring system was implemented 
where all employees returning from sick leave are counselled 
by human resources, to establish the reasons and validity of 
sick leave. 
Total electricity costs increased by 15% to ZAR72.1 million 
(2012: ZAR62.8 million). 
Barberton Mines invested more than ZAR2.7 million in 
training of its workforce during 2013, an increase of 173% on 
the corresponding 2012 figure. Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 55
COMPANY OVERVIEW LEADERSHIP STATEMENTS OUR BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The intelligence-driven approach to security in respect 
to illegal miners continues to pay dividends. The cost of 
security decreased by 12.9% to ZAR25.6 million (2012: 
ZAR29.4 million).
Efforts continued during the year to improve the living 
conditions of the workforce. Approximately 86% of the 
workforce reside with their families in the local community 
and surrounds and are paid a living-out allowance. The balance 
of employees live in mine-provided accommodation – 6% in 
single sex hostels and 8.2% in married accommodation.
The production goals for the Barberton Mines team in 2014 
are clear:
 repeat 2013’s gold production at a reasonable cash cost
  bringing the BTRP up to steady-state production, 
achieving its planned 20,000 oz per annum capacity
Risks
SA labour environment
Barberton Mines is not excluded from the current labour 
turmoil experienced by the South African mining industry. 
The rivalry for union dominance between the Association 
of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) and the 
National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) that is occurring 
in the industry also affects Barberton Mines. This is one of 
the biggest threats to the ongoing success of the mine. The 
relationship between labour and management is regulated 
by the Labour Relations Act, which requires management to 
enter into a recognition agreement with the majority union. 
Barberton Mines has recognition agreements with the NUM 
for Category 4-8 employees and the United Association 
of South Africa (UASA) representing the officials, artisans 
and miners.
Aged mining infrastructure
Fairview Mine, accountable for the majority of the gold 
production at Barberton Mines, has aged infrastructure that 
continually needs maintenance or replacement in order to 
operate successfully. The conditions of the shaft infrastructure 
at No. 2 and No. 3 declines were identified as a high-risk area 
more than a year ago, and a programme of refurbishment 
was implemented to ameliorate the risks. This programme is 
ongoing and capital to the amount of ZAR3.8 million (2012: 
ZAR2.6 million) has been spent for the financial year. As 
these declines are operating shafts, the refurbishments are 
conducted over weekends during off periods.

Setting the scene
As a consequence of successful metallurgical test work 
carried out on composite drill hole samples drilled during the 
previous financial year, the potential of retreating the Bramber 
tailings dam was assessed in a feasibility study on the proposed 
construction of a tailings retreatment plant at Fairview Mine. 
The viability of a retreatment plant was confirmed in an 
independent review by Venmyn Rand (Pty) Ltd. 
Detailed engineering, process and flow design to treat 
approximately 1.2 Mt per annum was carried out by Basil 
Read Matomo. 
When in full production, the BTRP will increase the annual 
production profile at Barberton Mines by 20,000 oz, to 
approximately 115,000 oz a year. 
With a forecast cost structure of USD725/oz, this project falls 
well in line with the Company’s strategy of developing low 
cost, high margin projects. 
The LOM of the BTRP has been augmented by auger drilling 
on an additional 6 Mt of tailings at the Consort tailings dam, 
extending the life of the project from 6 to 12 years.
Final commissioning was completed in June 2013 and 
production build-up commenced. The commissioning of the 
BTRP project created 83 new jobs in the Barberton area. Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 57

The final stage of the BTRP was completed during June 2013. The first gold pour on 28 June 2013 was a success for the 
management team of Barberton Mines, who was responsible for bringing this value-adding mineral asset to fruition. The project 
was in time and within budget, testifying to excellent leadership in the project execution. The BTRP is expected to contribute an 
additional 20,000 oz of gold sold to the bottom line of Barberton Mines. 
An additional inferred Mineral Resource has been identified which will possibly extend the life of mine to 12 years.

Setting the scene
Evander Mines was acquired from Harmony for a total net 
purchase consideration of ZAR1.313 billion. The transaction 
was effective from 1 March 2013, the date from which its 
results of operations have been consolidated by the Group. 
In terms of the sale agreement, cash generated by the mine 
between the date of signature and the effective date was 
applied to reduce the purchase consideration. A management 
agreement between the Group and Harmony is in place to 
ensure the efficient and effective transfer of the assets.
The Evander Mines operations comprise the operating 
Evander Mines No. 8 Shaft and several potential development 
projects – namely Rolspruit, Poplar, Evander South and Libra 
(a surface tailings storage facility), as well as the Kinross 
metallurgical processing plant and tailings storage facility. At 
the time of the acquisition, the total underground Resource

and Mineral Reserve report on page 67 for more details 
of Evander Mines’ Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. 
The Evander Mines No 8 Shaft currently has an expected 
LOM of approximately 14 years, and is expected to produce 
approximately 95 koz of gold per annum.
The original Harmony-appointed management remained 
intact at Evander Mines, and is led by general manager Manny 
da Silva. 
The management and directors are extremely pleased with 
this acquisition and its performance to date. The opportunities 
it presents for organic growth, and the current year’s progress 
made by both the Evander Mines and head office teams in 
successfully incorporating it into the Group, are most satisfying.  Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 61

Exploiting the orebody
During the four-month period under review, underground 
production was conducted through No 8 Shaft in the No 2 
Decline area on 24 Level. All stoping was concentrated in the 
western side of the larger Kinross Payshoot. In the old mine, 
only one stope was mined, on 18 Level. 
The mining plan for the development was to continue 
opening Reserves on 24 Level at North 1C and 1D, as well as 
developing the winzes down from 24 Level up to the fault to 
25 Level. Capital was allocated to extending the new decline 
down to 25 Level, starting with infrastructure development, 
which is now underway. It is anticipated that the first raise will 
hole in August 2014.
Stoping was to follow the upside-down Christmas tree 
configuration in North 1A, 1B and 1C raise lines on 24 Level. 
Some stoping was also done at North 1D on 23 Level. In the 
last quarter, compressed air pressure levels were raised on 
24 Level.
Mining and processing –  
challenges and achievements
The most significant challenge faced at Evander Mines is the 
need to haul rock along 11 conveyors from the rockface to 
the bottom of No. 7 Shaft, where it is hoisted to surface. 
This requires extensive supervision and means mining relies 
on a single chain of infrastructural assets, with no mining 
flexibility should a failure in any component occur. However, 
the underground rock handling and ventilation infrastructure 
was upgraded by Harmony between 2011 and 2013, and the 
majority of this infrastructure is in good working condition. 
There were no significant interruptions to mining operations 
during the year, although the No. 1 cooling plant performed 
below standard and several stoppages were necessitated by 
failure in major pieces of equipment. Despite these challenges, 
the operation achieved 93% of its targeted underground 
production tonnes. There were no incidents of industrial 
action or section 54 safety stoppages at Evander Mines.
Cost of production – current year
Despite projects to reduce energy consumption, Evander 
Mines’ electricity bill increased by 17% during the year, due 
to tariff rate hikes. The cost of food provided to the hostels 
increased by 15%, well above the official inflation rate. 
Management has introduced various initiatives to manage 
costs.
In total, ZAR0.16 million was invested in training the Evander 
Mines workforce during the four months ended 30 June 2013.
As at Barberton Mines, the management of absenteeism and 
sick leave remains a time-consuming function, necessary to 
ensure continuous, safe mining. Approximately 91 employees 
(3.6% of the workforce) were either sick or absent each 
working day. Evander Mines has introduced a wellness 
programme. Employees who abuse their sick leave are 
counselled by a social worker. If employees continue with this 
practice, disciplinary steps are taken. 
As a former subsidiary of Harmony, a member of the 
Chamber of Mines, Evander Mines concluded a two-year 
wage agreement that expired in 2013. Under the terms of 
this agreement, employees received the following increases:
Categories 3 and 4:   10.0%
Categories 5 to 8:   8.5%
Miners/artisans and officials:  7.5%
Industrial action throughout the mining industry during 
October 2012 resulted in additional wage adjustments being 
made:

Evander Mines has two hostels with a total of 1,208 rooms, 
accommodating 1,435 employees in the Category 4 to 8 
bargaining unit. A detailed action plan has been developed 
to meet the Mining Charter’s requirement of one person per 
room by 2014. Block A, B and C family units at Musimuhle 
Village are being renovated to accommodate an additional 
26 families.
Risk
Mining activities moved into an area of lower gold grades 
during the year. The mining of this lower grade will continue 
until the first quarter of 2015. This lower grade cycle, together 
with the current lack of flexibility in mining operations, makes 
Evander Mines vulnerable to a falling gold price. 
To mitigate this risk, management has identified the following 
initiatives for 2014:
 ETRP is at a pre-feasibility stage and indications are 
positive to move this project to a bankable stage in the 
following 3 to 6 months. Should the project be approved 
the ETRP will generate between 8,000 oz to 10,000 oz 
annually over the LOM.
  Increase sweeping and vamping operations throughout 
the current assets.
 Upgrade an autogenous mill to a ball mill in the second 
quarter of 2014, allowing for the processing of fine 
surface material. It is estimated that this mill will process 
the available material at a rate of 20,000 tonnes per 
month for 21 months.
 Re-open the No 3 Decline at No. 7 Shaft. This decline 
was closed by Harmony in 2009 as part of the mine’s 
rationalisation. However, this decline has approximately  
12 months of reserves at grades similar to those in 
No 8 Shaft. In addition, working this decline will provide 
access to the 2010 payshoot, an area of interest for 
further exploration.
The latter two initiatives, together with other potential 
value-adding projects, will require capital expenditure. Given 
the challenging times the industry finds itself in at present, 
management is conscious of the need to commit only to 
capital expenditure that provides quick returns, following a 
rigorous project evaluation. 
Besides optimising Evander Mines current operations through 
the above short-term initiatives, 2014 will focus on evaluating 
and prioritising the larger, medium-term organic projects, 
as described in the abridged Mineral Resource and Mineral 
Reserve report on page 67. Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 64

Setting the scene
The chrome tailings retreatment plant (CTRP or Phoenix 
Platinum) was designed to treat sulphide material from 
International Ferrous Metals Limited’s (‘IFM’) Lesedi Mine. 
IFM initially supplied Phoenix with sulphide-rich material 
from its Lesedi underground operations. However, IFM cut 
back drastically on operations at Lesedi in January 2012 and 
started mining oxidised material from an open cast section. 
This resulted in oxidised tailings being blended into the 
Phoenix feedstock.
The metallurgy of oxidised tailings negatively affects recovery 
and concentrate grade in the CTRP. This in turn results in 
poor PGM concentrate production. The oxide versus sulphide 
ratio has increased since beginning November 2012 and 
100% oxide material is now being mined by IFM. The Group 
is currently exploring the expediting of an additional Tailings 
Storage Facility (‘TSF’) that will allow management at Phoenix 
to bypass oxidised tailings. Once the TSF is completed the 
Group will expect recoveries and revenue to increase 
significantly at this time. Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 65

Mining and processing – 
challenges and achievements
To mitigate the effect of the highly oxidised feed source, 
the following actions have been implemented:
 The re-mining from surface tailings (the re-mining of 
sulphide-rich tailings discards that have been stored on 
the IFM tailings storage facility) was increased by 38% to 
compensate for the loss in recoverable ounces.
 T o reduce the chrome content in the concentrate being 
supplied to Lonmin, a reagent (an oxide collector) was 
introduced into the CTRP floatation section. Excessive 
chrome content in the concentrate leads to chrome 
penalties from Lonmin.
The current CTRP tailings storage facility has limited capacity. 
A new long-term tailings storage facility has been designed 
and the necessary EIA and water usage licence applications 
have been submitted. This long-term facility will allow Phoenix 
Platinum to bypass any oxidised chrome tailings from IFM 
directly to the new site, thereby enabling more re-mining 
tonnages to be treated in the CTRP . 
The effect of the increased re-mining tonnages and the oxide 
collector has led to improved recoveries at the CTRP, from 
21% in 2012 to 26% in May 2013 and 29% in June 2013 
respectively.
Cost of production – current year
In this year, the electricity price increased by 8% and wage 
increases impacted on the cost per ounce and the cost per 
tonne processed. To manage these unit costs, management 
targeted additional material for processing through the plant, 
and further ramping up of volumes will continue in 2014. 
Various laboratory tests were conducted to reduce chrome 
fees charged by Lonmin, and a new reagent was introduced 
to the process, reducing the chrome fees by nearly 50%. In 
addition, local suppliers were sourced to supply consumables 
previously obtained from overseas suppliers, with prices linked 
to South Africa’s CPI. 
Costs were well contained. Re-mining costs were reduced by  
5.9% to ZAR3.2 million (2012: ZAR3.4 million). 
To improve efficiencies, a training shift was introduced, 
dedicated to improving employees’ know-how and safety 
awareness. In addition, Saturday work hours were introduced 
for the engineering team to reduce plant downtime.
Only six shifts were lost in the past year due to absenteeism 
and sick leave.
Salary scales in the Rustenburg/Brits mining region were 
benchmarked and employee salaries adjusted accordingly. The 
current workforce is not unionised.

Scope of report
The following abridged information has been extracted from 
the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Report 2013, 
which is available at http://www.panafricanresources.com. 
The Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Report 2013 is 
a key component of the Pan African Resources suite of 2013 
annual reports produced to record the Group’s performance 
regarding its finances, operations and sustainability activities for 
the year ended 30 June 2013. 
This report conforms to the standards described by the South 
African Code for the Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral 
Resources and Mineral Reserves (the SAMREC Code, 2007 
edition). Pan African Resources asserts its legal entitlement to 
the Mineral Resources and Reserves reported on here. 
The Mineral Resource is inclusive of the Mineral Reserve 
component. Information is presented either by operation, 
mine or project. The following tables and graphs are used

Group Mineral Resource  
and Reserve strategy
Pan African Resources intends to realise its vision through 
the strategic acquisition and development of precious metal 
assets close to or in production, that:
 Are profitable – significant grade margin and a low cash 
cost profile.
 Are sustainable – a long production life.
 Show growth – potential to grow organically.
 Benefit stakeholders – a significant socio-economic win.
Pan African Resources’ Mineral Resource Management (MRM) 
philosophy is that a detailed understanding of the mineral 
asset undoubtedly contributes to its optimal extraction. From 
this standpoint, it is clear that the ‘orebody dictates’ through 
its various characteristics and, when aligned effectively to the 
business model, can yield significant returns.
Profitable – Pan African Resources’ mineral assets are located 
in geological terrains that are described as world-class quality 
mineral assets with high grade and significant tonnage profiles. 
Barberton Mines is located in the Barberton Greenstone 
Belt, a unique ancient geological setting that hosts economic 
shear gold that is among the most consistent high grade gold 
deposits globally (2013: 9.64 g/t recovered grade). Evander 
Mines is located in the Witwatersrand Basin, the world’s most 
renowned gold-producing region. Evander Mines is one of the 
substantial, remaining Mineral Resources that is untapped in 
the basin (2013: 31.61 Moz Mineral Resource and 8.01 Moz 
Mineral Reserve). The Phoenix Platinum operation re-treats 
tailings from ore derived from the famous Bushveld Igneous 
Complex, the largest mineral resource of PGMs in the world. 
Within the accepted MRM framework of survey, geology, 
resource estimation and mine planning, functions on the 
operations are focused towards maximising and optimising 
the value of the residing mineral assets. The key operational 
focus is to integrate all intellectual capital and technical data 
to enhance the Mineral Resource confidence in relation to 
volume and grade. Efficient and effective LOM plans are 
designed to execute mining methods that are safe and low 
cost. The low cost base allows the orebody to be extracted 
at optimal cut-off grades to yield the desired financial margins.

Sustainable – MRM at Barberton Mines, Evander Mines and 
Phoenix Platinum has the strategic role of applying best 
practices in identifying, optimising and realising the value of 
the mineral asset through converting it from an initial inferred 
Resource at the exploration phase through to a proved 
Reserve at the production stage, and ultimately to a saleable 
product. The diligent application of this methodology allows 
for greenfield, brownfield, near mine and organic growth 
projects to be realised and economic value added to deliver a 
sustainable business model, see figure below.
Growth – Pan African Resources strives to create value by 
growing its major asset – the Mineral Resource and Mineral 
Reserve of the Company. This drive is based on an active 
acquisition strategy, a well-defined exploration programme, 
innovation in both geological/Resource modelling, optimal 
mine planning, and continual optimisation of the asset portfolio.
The acquisition of Evander Mines has propelled Pan African 
Resources into a mid-tier status. The Group has increased its 
mineral asset significantly, as outlined in this report. The mineral 
assets of Evander Mines comprise an operating mine and a 
set of organic and brownfield projects – ETRP , Evander Mines  
No 7 Shaft No 3 Decline, Rolspruit, Evander South, Poplar 
and Libra – that are at an advanced confidence and economic 
value, see figure on page 69. This enables Pan African Resources 
to grow organically and sustainably, benefiting all stakeholders.
The successful commissioning of the BTRP in June 2013 is 
a testament to the leadership at Pan African Resources in 
creating value from its mineral assets. This organic growth 
project will add 20,000 oz/annum of production ounces.
Stakeholder – Pan African Resources is pleased to note that 
there were no production stoppages due to labour issues 
during the year under review. This had a positive impact on 
realising the targeted grade tonnage profiles for each of the 
operations, resulting in excellent quantities of ounces being 
produced.
The Group is committed to complying with the MPRDA and 
achieving the objectives of the Mining Charter. In this regard, 
it continues to engage with stakeholders, both within and 
outside the Group.

Barberton Mines
Barberton Mines is situated in the Magisterial District of 
Barberton, Mpumalanga, Republic of South Africa, some 
370 km east of Johannesburg and 47 km south-east of 
Nelspruit. The mineralisation at Barberton Mines is classified 
as Achaean epigenetic hydrothermal lode gold deposits 
within a granite greenstone terrain. The grade and the 
structure in the ore shoots are highly erratic in nature and 
most of the data for evaluating Resource blocks are derived 
from development adjacent to the mining blocks and from 
the position of the present mining areas. The tectonic 
structure and orebody geometry are modelled using the  
Lynx orebody modelling system.
Barberton Mines has continued with the application of semi-
mechanised cut and fill mining method. The mineral rights 
pertaining to Barberton Mines were issued by the DMR in 
terms of Item 7 of Schedule II of the Minerals and Petroleum 
Resources Development Act, 2002 (No 28 of 2002) (MPRDA). 
Mineral rights to Barberton Mines comprise of three separate 
mining rights for the three different mining operations. All 
three operations’ old order rights were converted to the sole 
and exclusive “new order” right to mine on 28 April 2011. Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 73

Evander Mines
Evander Mines is located approximately 120 km south-east 
from Johannesburg in Mpumalanga Province. Evander Mines’ 
mineral asset comprises a set of Mineral Resources ranging 
from early prefeasibility studies to a production mine. 
The current revenue streams for Evander Mines are 
generated from the Evander Mines No 8 Shaft and surface 
sources. The principal economical horizon mined at Evander 
Mines is the Kimberley Reef, which was deposited in the 
Witwatersrand sedimentary basin, ca 2,300 million years ago. 
Evander Mines No 8 Shaft is situated in the distal part of the 
Evander Basin. The Kimberley Reef is the only economical 
horizon that is mined and is developed as the Kinross 
Payshoot, illustrated in Figure 4 below.
Evander Mines No. 8 Shaft mining method is footwall 
development to reef horizon and then developing on reef 
horizon (raise). The mining follows an upside-down Christmas 
tree sequence to extract the reef horizon. Old areas of the 
mine are also cleaned up by means of vamping activities.
The mineral rights pertaining to Evander Mines were issued 
by the DMR in terms of Item 7 of Schedule II of the MPRDA, 
and were registered on 15 October 2010.

Phoenix Platinum
The concept of recovering the PGM 6Es from tailings was pioneered by Phoenix Platinum through an antecedent company  
GB Mining (Pty) Ltd which, together with Aquarius Platinum Limited, built the RK1 floatation plant in the Kroondal area.
Pan African Resources acquired 100% of Phoenix Platinum from Metorex on 21 May 2009. Phoenix Platinum recovers  
PGM 6Es from old tailings and current arisings through mineral rights agreements from the IFM Lesedi Mine dams and current 
arisings, the Elandskraal dumps and pits, and the Kroondal dump. These tailings are covered through various agreements with 
Phoenix Platinum to be the feed source for a 240 ktpa CTRP .

The Buffelsfontein, Elandskraal and Kroondal Mineral Resource originates from the mining of the chromitite layers of the Bushveld 
Igneous Complex. The chromitite layers in the western limb of the Bushveld Igneous Complex are confined to the critical zone 
of the layered complex and are grouped from the bottom upwards, into lower, middle and upper groups.
The middle group consists of four chromitite seams of which the sixth seam, numbered from bottom (MG1) to top (MG4) is 
being mined. The mining that took place at Elandskraal and at Buffelsfontein (IFM Lesedi Mine) are from the MG1 and MG2 seams. 
The MG1 seams sits in the Lower Critical Zone of the Bushveld Complex, whereas MG2 is in the Upper Critical Zone of the 
Bushveld Complex.

ABRIDGED MINERAL RESOURCES AND MINERAL 
RESERVES REPORT
continued
Pan African Resources uses the SAMREC Code, which sets 
out the internationally recognised procedures and standards 
for reporting Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves in 
South Africa. This code was developed by the South African 
Institute of Mining and Metallurgy and is the recommended 
guideline for Reserve and Resource reporting for companies 
listed on the JSE Limited. In reporting Resources and Reserves, 
distinct cognisance has also been taken to comply with AIM 
Rules for Mining and Oil and Gas Companies of the London 
Stock Exchange.
Definitions as per  
the SAMREC Code
The definitions of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve, as 
contained in the 2007 edition of the SAMREC Code, are as 
follows:
A ‘Mineral Resource’ is a concentration or occurrence of 
material of economic interest in or on the Earth’s crust in 
such form, quality and quantity that there are reasonable 
and realistic prospects for eventual economic extraction. 
The location, quantity, grade, continuity and other geological 
characteristics of a Mineral Resource are known, or estimated 
from specific geological evidence, sampling and knowledge 
interpreted from an appropriately constrained and portrayed 
geological model. Mineral Resources are subdivided, and must 
so be reported, in order of increasing confidence in respect 
of geo-scientific evidence, into Inferred, Indicated or Measured 
categories.
An ‘Inferred Mineral Resource’ is that part of a Mineral 
Resource for which volume or tonnage, grade and mineral 
content can be estimated with only a low level of confidence. 
It is inferred from geological evidence and sampling and 
assumed but not verified geologically or through analysis of 
grade continuity. It is based on information gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, 
trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that may be limited in 
scope or of uncertain quality and reliability.
An ‘Indicated Mineral Resource’ is that part of a Mineral 
Resource for which tonnage, densities, shape, physical 
characteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated 
with a reasonable level of confidence. It is based on information 
from exploration, sampling and testing of material gathered 
from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and 
drill holes. The locations are too widely or inappropriately 
spaced to confirm geological or grade continuity but are 
spaced closely enough for continuity to be assumed.
A ‘Measured Mineral Resource’ is that part of a Mineral 
Resource for which tonnage, densities, shape, physical 
characteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated 
with a high level of confidence. It is based on detailed and 
reliable information from exploration, sampling and testing 
of material from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, 
workings and drill holes. The locations are spaced closely 
enough to confirm geological and grade continuity.
A ‘Mineral Reserve’ is the economically mineable material 
derived from a Measured or Indicated Mineral Resource 
or both. It includes diluting and contaminating materials 
and allows for losses that are expected to occur when the 
material is mined. Appropriate assessments to a minimum 
of a Pre-Feasibility Study for a project and a Life of Mine 
Plan for an operation must have been completed, including 
consideration of, and modification by, realistically assumed 
mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, 
social and governmental factors (the modifying factors). Such 
modifying factors must be disclosed.
A ‘Probable Mineral Reserve’ is the economically mineable 
material derived from a Measured or Indicated Mineral 
Resource or both. It is estimated with a lower level of 
confidence than a Proved Mineral Reserve. It includes diluting 
and contaminating materials and allows for losses that are 
expected to occur when the material is mined. Appropriate 
assessments to a minimum of a Pre-Feasibility Study for a 
project or a Life of Mine Plan for an operation must have 
been carried out, including consideration of, and modification 
by, realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, 
marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental 
factors. Such modifying factors must be disclosed.
A ‘Proved Mineral Reserve’ is the economically mineable 
material derived from a Measured Mineral Resource. It is 
estimated with a high level of confidence. It includes diluting 
and contaminating materials and allows for losses that are 
expected to occur when the material is mined. Appropriate 
assessments to a minimum of a Pre-Feasibility Study for a 
project or a Life of Mine Plan for an operation must have 
been carried out, including consideration of, and modification 
by, realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, 
marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental 
factors. Such modifying factors must be disclosed. Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 85
COMPANY OVERVIEW LEADERSHIP STATEMENTS OUR BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Pan African Resources’ reporting in 
compliance with SAMREC
To meet the requirements of the SAMREC Code that 
the material reported as a Mineral Resource should have 
“reasonable and realistic prospects for eventual economic 
extraction”, Pan African Resources has determined an 
appropriate cut-off grade, which has been applied to 
the quantified mineralised body according to a process 
incorporating a long-term view on future economic modifying 
factors. In applying this process, Pan African Resources uses 
a gold price of ZAR550,000/kg to derive a cut-off grade to 
determine the Mineral Resources at each of its underground 
operations.
Barberton Mines employs a weighted arithmetic mean and an 
inverse distance estimation technique, while Evander Mines 
uses a kriging estimation method to create an estimated grade 
model. The in-house developed Mineral Resource optimiser 
tool was applied to the Mineral Resource inventory. At the 
underground mines, this is done by defining the optimal cut-
off as the lowest grade at which an orebody can be mined 
such that the total profits, under a specified set of mining 
parameters, are maximised.
The Mineral Resource is converted to Mineral Reserve, 
using the modifying factors listed below. Cut-off grades are 
determined using the optimiser programme.
 The database inventory of all Mineral Resource blocks, 
 an assumed gold price – ZAR490,000/kg, 
 planned production rates for each mine, 
 mine call factor (MCF),
 plant recovery,
  planned cash operating costs and other efficiency factors 
are calculated using historical achievements as a baseline. 
The Mineral Reserves represent that portion of the measured 
and indicated Resources above cut-off in the LOM plan 
and have been estimated after consideration of the factors 
affecting extraction, including mining, metallurgical, economic, 
marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental 
factors. A range of disciplines, including geology, survey, 
planning, mining engineering, rock engineering, metallurgy, 
financial management, human resources management and 
environmental management, has been involved at each mine 
in the LOM planning process and the conversion of Resources 
into Reserves.
The modifying factors related to the ore flow that are used 
to convert the Mineral Resources to Mineral Reserves 
through the LOM planning process are stated for each shaft 
in the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Report 2013. 
For these factors, historical information was used.
Phoenix Platinum and BTRP are optimised on a 100% 
extraction plan on their Mineral Reserves. No selectivity 
is applied on tonnages, and thus no cut-off grades are 
determined. Modifying factors for these projects are detailed 
in the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Report 2013. Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 86
SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW 
Ensuring a healthy and safe workplace
The full sustainability report can be found on the Company 
website, www.panafricanresources.com.
Approach
We consider safe and healthy working conditions to be vital 
to the sustainability of our operations, and we are committed 
to fostering an environment where employees at all levels are 
empowered and engage freely around safety , health, environment, 
quality and community (SHEQC) matters. During the past year, 
we have updated the Group’s SHEQC Charter and Policy to 
reflect our ongoing objectives of zero injuries and continually 
improving the culture of health and safety at our operations.
In terms of this charter, we strive for world-class health 
and safety performance and aim to prevent all incidents 
and accidents at our operations in a reasonably practicable 
manner. We also strive to minimise hazards inherent in the 
working environment. 
Specifically, the Occupational Health and Safety Policy 
embedded in the charter commits Pan African Resources to:
 Continually improving occupational health and safety 
performance through the setting and achievement of goals,
 providing a working environment that is conducive to 
good health and safety,
 managing risks in the workplace and ensuring that there is 
adequate surveillance of workplaces and employees,
 complying with applicable legal requirements and with 
other requirements to which the organisation subscribes; 
in the absence of relevant occupational health and safety 
laws, the Company will apply best practice standards 
and procedures,
 ensuring that appropriate resources, training and 
personal protective equipment are provided to improve 
occupational health and safety,
 ensuring that employees and contractors have the 
relevant skills to perform work-related tasks in a safe 
manner and that they are aware of their individual health 
and safety obligations and rights.
Employees and contractors working at our operations play 
an essential role in achieving occupational health and safety 
objectives through:
 Taking ownership of, and participating in, occupational 
health and safety management programmes and initiatives 
and complying with standards and procedures,
 exercising their right to work in a healthy and safe 
environment and their responsibility to withdraw from an 
unhealthy or dangerous situation.
All Pan African Resources operations comply with the Mine 
Health and Safety Act (Act 29 of 1996).
The year in numbers
Consolidated performance figures are not presented due to 
the acquisition of Evander Mines, which has only four months 
effective reporting within the Group. Please refer to the GRI 
content index on our website www.panafricanresources.com 
for relevant figures. 
Safety
A constant awareness of and commitment to safety underpins 
all our operations. We are committed to implementing and 
complying with legal and other safety requirements, and 
continually work towards world-class health and safety 
standards for all our employees.
It is with regret that we have to report two fatalities which 
occurred at Barberton Mines.  On 17 November 2012, a 
truck left the road, overturned and rolled down a hill at Sheba 
Mine, fatally injuring the driver. On 7 March 2013, a welder 
was fatally electrocuted whilst working underground. The  
board and management of Pan African Resources extend 
their deepest condolences to the family, friends and colleagues 
of Gert Fourie and  Velly Malumane.
Subsequent to these accidents, employees were counselled 
and engaged as to possible causes and remedial actions to 
prevent similar accidents happening in the future. T o encourage 
them to work safe, each employee, supervisor and manager 
also signed a commitment pledge.
Barberton Mines regrets to report two fatalities at its Barberton 
Mines operation during July 2013.
Barberton Mines 
In the 2013 financial year, Barberton Mines’ total recordable 
injury frequency rate (TRIFR) improved from 25.10 to 19.22 
per million man hours worked, and the lost time injury 
frequency rate (LTIFR) improved from 3.26 to 2.57 per million 
man hours worked. Due to two fatalities at the operation, 
the reportable injury frequency rate (RIFR) has shown a 
regression from 0.74 to 1.51 per million man hours worked. Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 87

Phoenix Platinum
Phoenix Platinum recorded a zero LTIFR and RIFR for the 
reporting year – a sound demonstration of our zero tolerance 
safety record.
The Phoenix Platinum team strives to eliminate potential 
hazards, thus ensuring a safe workplace for its employees 
by constantly mitigating day-to-day operational risks, 
communicating identified challenges and training accordingly, 
and through visible leadership.
General
Apart from the challenges of improving and maintaining safety 
at our operations, following the Evander Mines’ acquisition the 
board restructured the corporate office, among other things by 
appointing Mandla Ndlozi as Group SHEQC Manager to drive 
and standardise safety programmes across the Group operations.
We continue to pursue improvements in the health and safety 
of our workforce, and review our procedures regularly as 
part of our focus on a behavioural-based safety approach. An 
example of this is Evander Mines’ Vuka Sizwe safety programme, 
which is now entering its third phase of implementation.
A major initiative at our operations is a fall-of-ground 
identification system that concentrates on early morning 
examinations by the teams and, if necessary, triggers an action 
response programme.
Key safety efforts and achievements
Evander Mines
The metallurgical plant achieved 365 white flag (injury-free) 
days on 13 June 2013.

THE GOVERNANCE
OF OUR BUSINESS
Approach
The board of directors recognises that corporate 
governance is essential to protect the interests of all 
stakeholders. It remains committed to compliance with all 
legal requirements and the application of sound corporate 
governance principles. 
The board of directors ensures that the business of the Group 
is conducted with openness, integrity and accountability. 
Statement of compliance
Pan African Resources complies with the UK Companies Act, 
AIM rules and the JSE Listings Requirements. 
The board of directors acknowledges the valuable 
contribution that the application of the King Code of 
Governance for South Africa, 2009 (King III) has with 
regard to good corporate governance. Wherever practical, 
the board of directors applies the recommendations 
contained within King III. In the Company’s 2012 Annual 
Report, the board of directors identified five areas where 
it believed it was deficient with regard to the application 
of the King III principles, and has worked hard to rectify 
these shortcomings. To formalise the management of 
its application of King III, the Company has adopted the 
Institute of Directors of South Africa (IoDSA) Governance 
Assessment Instrument (GAI), allowing for the maintenance 
of a register of its progress in applying the principles of  
King III and the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited.
The IoDSA, GAI register can be found on the Company’s 
website (www.panafricanresources.com).
The overall score rating as per the GAI was AAA, highligting 
the highest application of King III.
The Group complies with the mandatory principles of King III: 
in terms of paragraph 3.84 of the JSE Listings Requirements.
Structures
The Pan African Resources board has a unitary structure, 
comprising three independent non-executive directors, two non-
executive directors and two executive directors. The Chairman 
of the board is an independent non-executive director. 
According to the Company’s Articles of Association, the 
board may consist of not less than four and not more than 
eight members. At the end of the financial year under review, 
the board consisted of six members, details of whom appear 
on page 14. The board is required to meet at least once every 
quarter in terms of the Company’s Articles of Association.
On 28 February 2013, Jan Nelson resigned from the board 
and as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) to pursue other 
opportunities. Cobus Loots and Ron Holding were appointed 
as Joint Interim CEOs, with effect from 1 March 2013.  
Ron Holding was appointed to the board on 9 September 
2013 as the CEO and Cobus Loots as the Financial director 
with effect from 1 October 2013. Busi Sitole resigned as the 
Financial director with effect from 30 September 2013.
The Board Charter details the manner in which business is to 
be conducted by the board in accordance with the principles 
of sound corporate governance, and is reviewed by the board 
on an annual basis. A copy of the Board Charter is available 
from the Group Company Secretary on request.
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, a 
director appointed since the last annual general meeting (AGM) 
is required to be re-elected at the next AGM of the Company. 
The appointment of directors is a formal and transparent 
process and is a matter for the entire board, assisted by the 
nominations committee, which is tasked with identifying and 
recommending directors who will add the appropriate balance 
of skills and experience to the board. In addition, the Articles of 
Association require that at least one third of the directors are 
subject to retirement by rotation every year. The nominations 
committee, having assessed the performance of those directors 
who are due for re-election, makes a formal recommendation 
for re-election to the board and shareholders. In this regard, 
the nominations committee, having concluded its assessment, 
recommends the re-election of the retiring directors, as detailed 
in the Notice of the AGM on page 163.
On appointment, all directors are provided with information 
aimed at broadening their understanding of their fiduciary 
duties and responsibilities, the regulatory, statutory and 
governance framework, the Group, and the business 
environment and markets in which it operates. All directors 
are expected to keep abreast of changes and trends in the 
Group’s business and markets. 
The role of non-executive directors, who are independent of 
management, are to protect shareholders’ interests, including 
those of minority shareholders. Non-executive directors 
are also responsible for ensuring that individual directors or 
groups of directors are subject to appropriate scrutiny in their 
decision-making. Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 93

(NOMAD) and joint broker, together with finnCap Limited 
in the UK. The duty of the NOMAD and joint broker is to 
advise the Group on compliance concerning the AIM Rules 
and continuing obligations as an AIM quoted company. 
The board has established various committees, on which 
non-executive directors play important roles. Terms of 
reference are in place for all these committees, and these 
were reviewed during the year. The terms of reference of the 
committees are available from the Group Company Secretary 
on request. All committees are chaired by independent 
non-executive directors except for the Remuneration 
Committee. The formation of these committees does not in 
any way absolve the board of its overall responsibility to the 
shareholders and the Company. As such, each committee is 
required to report back to the board at each board meeting.
In addition to regularly attending board and board committee 
meetings, the executive directors and senior management 
review both the mining operations and the exploration 
projects on a formal basis each month. This includes a detailed 
review of technical and financial parameters, as well as capital 
requirements and expenditure. 
All parameters are measured against the strategic plans, and 
any variations are discussed and action plans put in place to 
rectify such deviations. Investment and technical decisions 
form part of the board’s responsibilities.
Details of the membership of the board and committees, 
attendance at meetings, and a summary of responsibilities are 
set out in the table below.

Monitoring of performance
In accordance with the Board Charter, an evaluation of the 
board, its committees and individual directors, including 
the Chairman, is in the process of being implemented. The 
nominations committee assesses the independence of non-
executive directors annually. 
In 2013, an assessment of the performance of the board and 
its committees was conducted by the board, in line with the 
latest recommendations of King III (released in the form of 
practice notes). The assessments found the structures and 
processes governing the board and its committees were well 
established and functioning satisfactorily. It also found that 
the board had fulfilled its role and responsibilities and had 
discharged its responsibility to the Company, shareholders 
and other stakeholders.
Codes of conduct
The directors, management and staff of Pan African Resources 
are committed to the following code of ethics:
“As leaders and employees of Pan African Resources, we 
hereby commit ourselves to the highest ethical conduct and 
agree to:
 Respect the laws of the Republic of South Africa and of 
any other country in which we may operate or visit.
 Live the principle of integrity in all our activities and 
refrain from any behaviour, overt and otherwise, that may 
damage the organisation’s image and or performance of 
whatever nature.
 Treat our employees and any other person with 
dignity, respect and in a just manner irrespective of 
race, religion, gender, disability, age or nationality or any 
other characteristic.
 Be honest in all our dealings and undertake to distance 
ourselves from any activity that has the potential of being 
regarded as inconsistent with what is expected of a 
responsible Company and individual.
 Avoid any potential conflict of interest and when it may 
exist, disclose it to affected parties without any delay.
 Reject any form of bribery and act upon any non-
compliance as strongly as possible.
 Accept the full responsibility and ultimate accountability 
when we make decisions that may impact on the health 
and safety of our employees and the communities in 
which we operate, and take full responsibility for the 
environment and the well-being of the communities.
 Assist in developing our colleagues and teams to 
become worthy team players and responsible South 
African citizens. 
The board has introduced a Bribery and Corruption Policy 
and has adopted a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and 
corruption, and will uphold all laws relevant to countering 
bribery and corruption in all jurisdictions in which the Group 
operates. This policy has been communicated to all employees 
and contractors.
All directors and employees are prohibited from dealing in 
shares during any period in which price-sensitive information 
is available. The CEO distributes memoranda informing the 
affected parties of these periods. Should a senior employee 
or director wish to trade Pan African Resources shares, 
written permission must be obtained from either the CEO 
or Financial director.
A register of directors’ interests is maintained and updated at 
board meetings.
Board statement
The board considers that this integrated annual report 
complies in all material respects with the relevant statutory 
requirements of the various regulations governing disclosure 
and reporting by Pan African Resources, and that the annual 
financial statements comply in all material respects with the 
UK’s companies acts as well as with IFRS. As such, the board 
approves the content of the Integrated Annual Report 2013, 
including the annual financial statements. Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 96
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
AND OUR RESPONSE
Approach and principles
The Group defines stakeholders as people, groups or 
organisations that have a direct interest in Pan African 
Resources in that they can affect – or be affected by – its 
operations, policies and procedures. Stakeholders are 
identified at both an operations level and by the various 
governance structures of the Group. Identified stakeholders 
include: shareholders, prospective shareholders, investment 
analysts and lenders (investors); employees, unions and 
contractors (employees); communities; suppliers; government, 
regulatory authorities and civil society (society). 
Proactive and sincere stakeholder engagement is fundamental 
to the Group preserving and building on its social and 
relationship capital and moving it further along the road to 
achieving its goal of a profitable and sustainable business. 
Stakeholder engagement is undertaken at all levels of the 
enterprise following the principles of inclusiveness, materiality 
and responsiveness. As such, stakeholders participate in 
outlining key elements of the Group’s response to material 
economic, social and environmental issues, and the Group’s 
business is conducted at the intersection of the interests 
of its dominant, definitive and dependent stakeholders. 
This approach ensures that there exists a common 
understanding and frequent communication at the core of 
the collective interest.
Stakeholder engagement can be conducted in one of two 
ways: direct engagement involving verbal, direct written or 
visual communication with targeted stakeholder groupings; 
or indirect engagement, represented by compliance with 
regulations and standards expected to deliver on stakeholder 
issues and concerns. 
Direct engagement is the approach used for investors 
through regular presentations and roadshows, including 
operational visits; communication through the London 
Stock Exchange and JSE news services; one-on-one 
communication with executive management and members 
of the board; the publication of interim and full-year financial 
results and an annual integrated report; and the provision of 
financial information demonstrating conformance with debt 
covenants. 
Direct engagement with the employee stakeholder grouping 
is conducted through various structures including bargaining 
council forums; shaft committees; health and safety 
structures; and supervisory and disciplinary structures. The 
methods of communication involved scheduled meetings, 
briefings, emails and posters, standard policy and procedures 
documents, one-on-one supervision and instruction, contract 
negotiations, and performance discussions. 
Direct community engagement frequently takes place at 
operational level where operational management, community 
liaison officers and the community social investment 
department engage with ward councillors, the IDP and 
LED offices and the communities themselves at scheduled 
community meetings. Various media communication 
channels are used to inform the communities and their 
representatives.
Indirect engagement with a variety of stakeholders – in 
particular, those in the society and community groupings – 
is achieved through compliance with a range of regulations 
and guidelines, including: the Mining Charter, the Mine Health 
and Safety Act, environmental and water management acts, 
the UK and South African companies’ acts, and the listing 
requirements of AIM and the JSE. Achieving compliance 
and informing regulators requires regular and frequent 
communication with the departments of Mineral Resources, 
Labour, Water Affairs, Education and Public Works, and local 
municipalities and IDP and LED offices.
Company well-being is 
only sustainable if all 
stakeholders share and 
buy into the Company

THE MANAGEMENT
OF RISK
The management of risk 
The board of directors, supported by the work of the audit 
committee, is ultimately responsible for the management and 
mitigation of risks that impact upon the Group’s operations, 
its employees and the environment and communities in which 
it operates. The Group follows a formal risk management 
programme, engaging with employees, assurance service 
providers, insurers, regulatory bodies, local communities 
and specialist risk advisors. The culture of the Group is 
that everyone associated with it assumes responsibility for 
conducting themselves in conformance with established 
policies and procedures, to minimise the potential occurrence 
of any risk event and constantly to seek opportunities to 
improve performance and efficiencies.
The identification of risks is informed by the external 
environment, described on pages 40 to 42, and the nature of 
the individual operations’ activities. At first glance, risks could 
be described as either strategic or operational. However, 
so many of the strategic risks require mitigating strategies 
to be implemented at the operations, the Group does not 
distinguish between the types of risk. Risks can be identified at 
an operational level, during risk workshops, and through the 
strategy-setting process. 
Initiatives to mitigate risks at the operational level are designed 
to ensure continuous, safe and responsible production of gold 
and PGMs. Each of the Group’s operations maintains a risk 
register, which includes risk identification, risk mitigating factors 
and responsibilities. 
The board regularly reviews the risk reports from the 
operations, thus ensuring that the appropriate risk 
management programmes are implemented, and monitoring 
progress against key risk indicators such as safety statistics. 
The board, together with executive management, is also 
responsible for the identification of strategic risks and 
opportunities. Strategic workshops are conducted to evaluate 
risks and opportunities, confirm or amend Group strategy and 
establish strategic actions for the forthcoming period. Controls 
and actions to mitigate strategic risks can be implemented at 
the individual operations, across a Group discipline (human 
resources, for example) or at executive management level.
Risks and our achievements
The board and executive management believe that within 
every risk lies an opportunity for Pan African Resources 
to improve its financial, operational or social performance, 
enhance its reputation, strengthen its team and create value 
for all its stakeholders in the short, medium and long term. As 
such, the risks described below are also seen as key areas of 
opportunity for the Group. Specific identified opportunities 
relating to the exploitation of Mineral Resources and Mineral 
Reserves are discussed in more detail on pages 67 to 85. Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 100

 Risk Mitigation strategies Outcomes
The profitability of the 
Group’s operations and 
the cash flows generated 
are significantly affected by 
changes in precious metal 
prices and the Group’s cost 
of production
 Historically, the Group has sold its gold at prevailing 
market prices and has not entered into any price 
hedging arrangements to establish a price in advance 
for the sale of future gold production. Such hedging 
opportunities, together with economic indicators 
and an informed outlook for the price of gold, are 
considered on a regular basis by both the executive 
management and the board.
 The Group is committed to being a high-grade, low 
cash cost gold producer. Appropriate mineral resource 
management ensures optimum grade tonnage profiles 
are achieved on a sustainable basis.
 all costs are monitored and addressed in detail to 
ensure sufficient cash flows are available to meet all 
stakeholder requirements.
 Capital and management resources are applied to 
improve underground working conditions, enhancing 
productivity and controlling costs.
 Should the gold price fall to a level approaching the 
Group’s all-in cost of production for any sustained 
period, a review of all projects, capital expenditure 
and costs would be performed to focus on 
cash preservation.
 The Group is managed by experienced teams at the 
operations and supported by a lean and experienced 
executive team.
The average price of gold 
realised during the period 
resulted in positive margins 
achieved.
Management of costs remained 
in line with expectations and 
increases operational all-in cost 
of production was a result of
– wage rate increases
– electricity increases
– BTRP capital expenditure

The Group’s results of 
operations and financial 
condition may be materially 
adversely affected by 
appreciation in the value of 
the ZAR against the USD 
and GBP .
 The Group’s policy is not to hedge its exposure to 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
 Exchange rates are monitored daily.
 The Group focuses on cost control to maximise 
profitability per production unit.
The average USD/ZAR 
exchange rate was 13.9% 
weaker, at ZAR8.83:1, compared 
to the previous year (2012: 
ZAR7.75:1).
The average ZAR/GBP exchange 
rate was 12.8% weaker at 
ZAR13.84:1 compared to 
the previous year (2012: 
ZAR12.27:1). Therefore Group 
results in GBP would be 
materially affected by a 12.8%

REMUNERATION
Remuneration – Rewarding effort
All the executive directors have employment contracts with 
the Company and are remunerated by the Company for 
services performed. 
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, 
non-executive directors are entitled to directors’ fees (refer 
to annual financial statements note 32. These fees are paid 
quarterly in arrears.
The remuneration committee comprises one independent 
non-executive director and one non-executive director. 
The invitees of the remuneration committee are the Group 
CEO, the Financial director and the Executive: Human 
Resources, all of whom are are excluded from the meeting 
in the event that their remuneration and/or benefits are 
discussed. The remuneration committee meets at least twice 
a year. It reviews the performance of the CEO, executives and 
senior management and sets the scale, structure and basis of 
their remuneration and the terms of their service agreements 
with due regard to the interest of all stakeholders and the 
performance of the Company.
Basic salary and benefits are reviewed annually against 
competitive market data and analysis (PwC Remchannel 
Survey). 
Short-term incentives paid annually are based on the 
Company’s performance. The collective key performance 
areas (KPAs) account for 80% and are based on gold sold 
ounces, costs of production and safety targets, whereas the 
individual KPAs account for 20% and are specific to the person 
concerned. These are objective measurements based on the 
Company’s actual achievements versus the set business plan 
for the financial year.
Share options
The Equity Share Option Plan was discontinued (2008) and 
has been replaced with the Pan African Resources Group 
Share Appreciation Bonus Plan. The main objective of the 
Group Share Appreciation Bonus Plan is to give appropriate 
incentives to selected employees who are employed at a 
managerial level within the Group to ensure retention of key

AUDIT
COMMITTEE REPORT
Financial statements
The committee has evaluated the Group financial statements 
for the year ended 30 June 2013 and, based on the information 
provided to the committee, considers that the Group complies, in 
all material respects, with the requirements of the Companies Act 
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
The requirements from King III are continuously being assessed and 
improved on with significant issues resolved.
External auditor
The committee nominated the South African and UK firm of 
Deloitte & Touche for reappointment as external auditors of the 
Pan African Group.
The committee satisfied itself through enquiry that the external 
auditors are independent as defined by the Companies Act and as 
per the standards stipulated by the auditing profession.
The Audit Committee, in consultation with executive management, 
agreed to the terms of engagement. The audit fee for the external 
audit has been considered and approved for the 2013 financial 
year-end, taking into consideration such factors as the timing of the 
audit, the extent of the work required and the scope.
The committee approved a non-audit services policy which 
determines the nature and extent of any non-audit services 
which Deloitte & Touche may provide to the Company. The policy 
allows for limited tax and corporate governance advice as well as 
the provision of reporting accountant services in relation to capital 
market transactions.
Financial Director
During the financial year, Financial Director Busi Sitole was on 
maternity leave for a four-month period. Neal Reynolds, Group 
Financial Manager, acted in Busi Sitole’s stead during this period.
Busi Sitole resigned as Financial Director effective 30 September 
2013, and is replaced by Cobus Loots effective 1 October 2013.
The directors have considered the functioning of Pan African 
Resources financial department and believe that it functions 
effectively, with the required controls and systems in place.
The committee has assessed and is satisfied that the new Financial 
Director, Cobus Loots, has the appropriate skill, expertise and 
experience as required by the JSE Listings Requirement 3.84(h).
Internal auditor
The committee plays an oversight role of internal audit by approval 
of the internal audit plan and review of the reporting of any findings 
on a regular basis. The committee satisfied itself that the internal audit 
function is independent and has the necessary resources, standing 
and authority to discharge its duties. The Head of Internal Audit has 
direct access to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and internal 
audit are invited to attend each Audit Committee meeting.
Accounting practices  
and internal control
Based on the available and communicated information, together 
with discussions with the independent external auditor, the 
committee is satisfied that there was no material breakdown in 
the internal accounting controls during the financial year under 
review. The committee reviewed the auditor’s report to those 
charged with governance and can report that there were no 
material issues requiring immediate additional attention. The value- 
added issues raised are receiving the appropriate attention to 
ensure increased effectiveness in all areas of financial and business 
systems and controls.

COMPANY OVERVIEW LEADERSHIP STATEMENTS OUR BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The directors present their annual report and the audited financial 
statements for the year ended 30 June 2013.
Principal activities
The Group’s principal activity during the year was gold and platinum 
mining. A full review of the activities of the business and of future 
prospects is contained in the Chief Executive Officer’s report that 
accompanies these financial statements, with financial and non-
financial key performance indicators shown on page 16.
Results and dividends
The results for the year are disclosed in the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income on page 114. The salient features of 
these results can be found on page 5.
The Pan African Resources board of directors previously stated the 
Company’s policy is to pay an annual dividend, subject to the capital 
requirements of the Company. Following the successful acquisition 
of Evander Mines, the board of directors has therefore proposed 
to declare a dividend in respect of the 2013 financial year subject to 
the approval of the shareholders at the next AGM. Currently, with 
the satisfactory results from Barberton Mines and Evander Mines, 
the board of directors remains committed to continue with the 
Company’s dividend policy and has resumed the dividend payment 
in the 2013 financial year.
The board of directors proposes a final dividend for the year ended 
30 June 2013 of ZAR240 million (GBP15.2
1
 million). The proposed 
final dividend is calculated on 1,825,834,263 issued shares currently 
outstanding, equating to ZAR0.1314 per share or approximately 
0.83
1
 pence per share (2012: Nil), and is to be approved by 
shareholders at the forthcoming AGM of the Company.
Note 1:  The dividend in GBP is based on an exchange rate on 13 September 2013 of 
ZAR15.76:1, and approximates GBP15.2 million. The final exchange rate will 
be communicated upon final approval at the AGM.
Policy for payment of creditors
It is the Company’s policy to settle all agreed transactions within 
the terms established with suppliers. The Company’s target credit 
days are 60 days.
Risk management
The key business risks to which the Company is exposed have 
been considered and addressed under the operational review of 
each business segment. Refer to page 52 for gold operations and 
page 64 for platinum operations.
A separate risk committee is not considered necessary, as this 
role is fulfilled by the board, its sub-committees and executive 
management. The identification and management of critical risks is 
a strategic focus area for executive management, reviewed on a 
monthly basis and, together with action plans, reported regularly 
to the board. Executive management has the ability to call for 
emergency board meetings, should the need arise. Risk registers 
for each business segment are in place. The board has reviewed the 
current risks to the business and, at the time of reporting, believes 
that the current business risks do not exceed the risk appetite of 
the Group.
Residual risks include the current South African labour market and 
associated union rivalry, USD gold price, USD/ZAR exchange rate, 
and government and regulatory frameworks, as well as unforeseen 
natural disasters.
The board believes that the current processes of identifying and 
dealing with risks are effective.
Internal control
The board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of 
internal controls to safeguard shareholders’ investment and Group 
assets. The directors monitor the operation of internal controls. 
The objective of the system is to safeguard Group assets, ensure 
proper accounting records are maintained and that the financial 
information used within the business and for publication is reliable. 
Any such system of internal control can only provide reasonable 
but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Internal financial control procedures undertaken by the board 
include:
 Review of monthly financial reports and 
monitoring performance.
 Review of internal audit reports and follow-up action of 
weaknesses identified by these reports.
 Review of competency and experience of senior 
management staff.
 Prior approval of all significant expenditure, including all major 
investment decisions.
 Review and debate of treasury and other policies.
The board has reviewed the operation and effectiveness of 
the Group’s system of internal control for the financial year and 
the period up to the date of approval of the financial statements.
Going concern
The board confirms that the business is a going concern and that 
it has reviewed the business’s working capital requirements in 
conjunction with its future funding capabilities for at least the next 
12 months, and has found them to be adequate. The Group has 
secured a ZAR600 million RCF with Nedbank Limited and ABSA 
Limited. The Group utilised ZAR350 million (GBP23.3 million) of 
the RCF to fund the Evander Mines acquisition and has since been 
able to further settle ZAR185 million (GBP12.3 million), resulting in 
a closing balance of ZAR165 million (GBP11.0 million) at year-end.
Management is not aware of any material uncertainties that may 
cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. Should the need arise, the Group can cease most 
exploration and capital activities, and by doing so conserve cash.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
UNITED KINGDOM
 
T o the members of Pan African Resources PLC
We have audited the financial statements of Pan African Resources PLC for the year ended 30 June 2013 which comprise the Group and 
Parent Company Statements of Comprehensive Income, the Group and Parent Company Statements of Financial Position, the Group and 
Parent Company Cash Flow Statements, the Group and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity and the related notes 1 to 39. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.  This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we 
read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If 
we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 30 June 2013 and 
of the Group’s profit and the parent company’s loss for the year then ended;
 the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union; and
 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
 the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
SOUTH AFRICA
 
T o the shareholders of Pan African Resources PLC
We have audited the consolidated and separate financial statements of Pan African Resources PLC set out on pages 114 to 162, which comprise 
the statements of financial position as at 30 June 2013, and the statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and 
statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and the notes, comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory 
information. 
Directors’ responsibility for the consolidated financial statements
The Company’s directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated and separate financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of consolidated and separate financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated and separate financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit 
in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated and separate financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The 
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s 
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but 
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the 
overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated and separate financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated and separate financial 
position of Pan African Resources PLC as at 30 June 2013, and its consolidated and separate financial performance and consolidated and 
separate cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: ACCOUNTING
POLICIES AND FINANCIAL REPORTING 
TERMS
for the year ended 30 June 2013
1 GENERAL INFORMATION 
  Pan African is a Company incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006. The Company has a dual primary listing 
on the AIM Market (‘AIM’) of the London Stock Exchange and JSE Limited (JSE). The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal 
activities relate to gold and PGE mining and exploration activities. The financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling. Foreign 
operations are included in accordance with the policies set out below. The individual financial results of each Group Company are 
maintained in their functional currencies, which are determined by reference to the primary economic environment in which it operates.
  For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group Company is expressed in 
Pounds Sterling. The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. 
  The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by 
the European Union and South Africa.
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 Basis of preparation and general information 
  The annual financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments which are 
stated at fair value. The principal accounting policies are set out below and are consistent in all material respects with those applied in the 
previous year, except where otherwise indicated. 
 Historic reverse acquisition
  On 31 July 2007 the Company acquired 74% of Barberton Mines (Pty) Ltd (Barberton) in a share-for-share transaction. IFRS 3 ‘Business 
Combinations’ defines the acquirer in a business combination as the entity that obtains control. Accordingly, the combination was 
accounted for as a reverse acquisition.
 Going concern 
  The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position are described in these financial statements. In addition, note 29 
to the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management 
objectives; details of its financial instruments and its exposure to credit, foreign currency, commodity price, interest rate and liquidity risk.
  Management is not aware of any material uncertainties which may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern. Based on the current status of the Group’s finances, the directors have formed a judgement, at the time of approving the 
Financial Statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has, or will have, adequate resources to enable the Group to 
continue to meet its financial commitments for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the directors continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements. Further details are provided in the going concern section of the Directors’ Report.
 New and revised International Financial Reporting Standards not yet adopted
  The Group applies all applicable IFRS in preparation of the financial statements. Consequently, all IFRS statements adopted by the 
European Union that were effective at 30 June 2013 and are relevant to its operations have been applied.
  At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations, which have been applied in these 
financial statements, for the first time, were in issue and effective as at 30 June 2013:

  The impact of the adoption of the above standards and interpretations still needs to be considered, but is not expected to have a material 
impact on the financial results.
 Basis of consolidation 
  The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its 
subsidiaries) to 30 June each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies 
of an investee enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The results of the subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year 
are included in the consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date 
of disposal, as appropriate. Inter-company transactions and balances between Group entities are eliminated on consolidation. 
  Business combinations
   Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of a business combination is measured 
as the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued 
by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the 
conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date, except for non-
current assets (or disposal Groups) that are classified as held-for-sale in accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non-current Assets Held-for-Sale and 
Discontinued Operations’, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs-to-sell.
  Goodwill arising on acquisitions is recognised as an asset, and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business 
combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, after 
reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the 
cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase consideration. The interest 
of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minority’s proportion of net fair value of the assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities recognised.

COMPANY OVERVIEW LEADERSHIP STATEMENTS OUR BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 Change in ownership interest
  In terms of IAS 27, changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as 
equity transactions.
  Investment in associate
  An associate is an entity over which the group and the company have significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest 
in a joint venture. 
  In the Company’s separate financial statements, an investment in associate is stated at fair value less impairment losses, if any. An 
investment in associate is accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. The investment 
in associate in the consolidated balance sheet is initially recognised at fair value and adjusted thereafter for the post acquisition change in 
the group’s share of net assets of the investment.
 Property, plant and equipment
 Mining assets 
  Mining assets, including mine development costs and mine plant facilities, are recorded at cost less provision for impairment and 
accumulated depreciation. 
  Expenditure incurred after feasibility stage to develop new ore bodies, to define mineralisation in existing ore bodies, to establish or 
expand productive capacity and expenditure designed to maintain productive capacities, is capitalised within capital under construction 
until commercial levels of production are achieved. Capital under construction is not depreciated. All revenue generated during the 
commissioning phase is capitalised back to the property, plant and equipment as per IAS16.
 Mineral and surface rights 
  Mineral and surface rights are recorded at cost less provision for impairment and accumulated depreciation. 
  Land 
 Land is shown at cost and is not depreciated.  
 Gain or loss on disposal or retirement of assets 
  The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference 
between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss. 
 Depreciation 
  Mining assets, mineral and surface rights mining assets, mine development costs, mineral and surface rights and plant mine facilities are 
depreciated over the estimated life of mine (‘LOM’) to their residual values using the units-of-production method linked to the reserves 
and resources on a straight line basis. 
 Other mining plant and equipment is depreciated on the straight-line basis over the shorter of the LOM or their estimated useful lives. 
 Depreciation of non-mining assets 
  Buildings and other non-mining assets are recorded at cost and depreciated on the straight-line basis over their expected useful lives, 
which vary between three to ten years. 
  Research, development, mineral exploration and evaluation costs
  Research, development, mineral exploration and evaluation costs are expensed in the year in which they are incurred until they result in 
projects that the Group:
  Evaluate as being technically or commercially feasible,
  has sufficient resources to complete development,
  can demonstrate will generate future economic benefits. Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 122
  Once these criteria are met, all directly attributable development costs and ongoing mineral exploration and evaluation costs are 
capitalised within other intangible assets. Capitalisation of pre-production expenditure ceases when the mining property is capable of 
commercial production.
 Capitalised pre-production expenditure is assessed for impairment in accordance with the Group accounting policy stated below:
 Impairment (except for goodwill) 
  At each Statement of Financial Position date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of 
the asset being the higher of fair value less costs to sell or value in use is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment 
loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit (‘CGU’) to which the asset belongs. Impairment losses are immediately recognised as an expense. 
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.  
 Goodwill 
  Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly-controlled entity at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognised 
as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
  For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the 
combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when 
there is an indication that the CGU may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the CGU, 
the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets 
of the CGU, pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not 
reversed in a subsequent period. On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly-controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is 
included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal. 
 Taxation 
  The charge for current tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which are non-deductible or disallowed. It is calculated 
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Statement of Financial Position date. 
  Deferred tax is accounted for using the liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit. 
In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets 
and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction, which affects neither tax nor accounting profit. 
  Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based 
on tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Statement of Financial Position date. The measurement 
of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the 
reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is charged or credited to the Statement 
of Comprehensive Income, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also 
recorded within equity, or where they arise from the initial accounting for a business combination. In a business combination, the tax effect 
is taken into account in calculating goodwill or in determining the excess of the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of the business combination. 
  The carrying amount of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each Statement of Financial Position date and reduced to the extent that it 
is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or parts of the assets to be recovered.
  Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated VAT, unless VAT incurred is not recoverable from the 
taxation authority. In this case it is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense. Receivables and 
payables are stated inclusive of the amount of VAT receivable or payable. The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the 
taxation authority is included with other receivables or payables in the consolidated statement of financial position.

COMPANY OVERVIEW LEADERSHIP STATEMENTS OUR BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 Provisions
  Provisions are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation resulting from past events, it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount 
of the obligation. 
  The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the Statement 
of Financial Position date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. 
  When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be received from a third party, the receivable 
is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured 
reliably. 
 Lease assets
  The Group leases certain property, plant and equipment. A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and 
rewards incidental to ownership to the Group. Other leases are classified as operating leases.
  Finance lease assets are capitalised at the lease’s commencement at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present 
value of the minimum lease payments. 
 Operating leases
  Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The difference between the amounts 
recognised as an expense and the contractual payments are recognised as an operating lease liability.
 Foreign currencies 
  Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary are initially recorded at the rates of exchange 
ruling on the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in such other currencies are translated at the rates 
ruling at the Statement of Financial Position date. Profits and losses arising on exchange are recorded in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income. In order to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risks, the Group may enter into forward contracts. On consolidation, the 
assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated into Pounds Sterling at exchange rates ruling at the Statement of 
Financial Position date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences 
arising from the translation of foreign operations are classified as equity and are recognised as income or expenses in the period in which 
the operation is disposed of. Translation differences on foreign loans to subsidiaries which are classified as equity loans are also accounted 
for as equity. 
 Inventories
 Inventories include the gold bullion on hand, 6PGE concentrate, gold or 6PGE in process and consumable stores.
  Bullion on hand and 6PGE concentrate are valued at the lower of cost, determined on a weighted-average basis, and net realisable value. 
Costs include direct mining costs and mine overheads.
  Gold or 6PGE in process inventories represent materials that are currently in the process of being converted to a saleable gold or 6PGE 
product. The gold or 6PGE in process inventories are valued only if they are reliably measurable and are valued at the average cost of the 
material fed to process plus the in-process conversion costs.
  Consumable stores are valued at the lower of cost, determined on a weighted average basis, and estimated net realisable value. Net 
realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling 
and distribution. Obsolete and slow-moving consumable stores are identified and are written down to their economic or realisable values. 
 Retirement and pension benefits 
  Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to state-managed 
schemes are dealt with as defined contribution plans where the Group’s obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in 
a defined contribution retirement benefit plan and are charged as an expense as they fall due.
 Post-retirement benefits other than pension
  Historically Barberton Mines and Evander Mines provided retirement benefits by way of medical-aid scheme contributions for certain 
employees. The practice has been discontinued for some years. The net present value of estimated future costs of Company contributions  Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 124
towards medical aid schemes for these retirees is recorded as a provision on the Group Statement of Financial Position. The provision is 
reviewed annually with movements in the provision recorded in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
 Equity participation plan 
  Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. The fair 
value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each Statement of Financial Position date, the 
Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, 
if any, is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with 
corresponding adjustments to the equity-settled employee benefits reserve. 
 Cash participation plan 
  Cash-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the cash instruments at the grant date. The fair 
value determined at the grant date of the cash-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on the Company’s estimate of cash instruments that will eventually vest. At each Statement of Financial Position date, the 
Company revises its estimate of the number of cash instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, 
if any, is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with 
corresponding adjustments to the cash-settled employee benefits liability. 
 Provision for environmental rehabilitation costs 
  Long-term environmental obligations are based on Barberton Mines, Evander Mines and Phoenix Platinum environmental plans, in 
compliance with current environmental and regulatory requirements. The provision is based on the net present value of the estimated cost 
of restoring the environmental disturbance that has occurred up to the Statement of Financial Position date. Increases due to additional 
environmental disturbances are capitalised and amortised over the remaining lives of the mines. The estimated cost of rehabilitation is 
reviewed annually and adjusted as appropriate for changes in legislation or technology. Cost estimates are not reduced by the potential 
proceeds from the sale of assets or from plant clean up at closure. 
 Contributions to rehabilitation trust
  Contributions are made to a dedicated environmental rehabilitation trust to fund the estimated cost of rehabilitation during and at the 
end of the life of the Group’s mines. The trust’s assets are recognised separately on the balance sheet as non-current assets at fair value. 
Interest earned on funds invested in the environmental rehabilitation trust is accrued on a time : proportion basis and credited to the 
provision for environmental rehabilitation costs.
 Provision for decommissioning costs 
  The Group provides for decommissioning costs, other than rehabilitation costs, if any, when the directors have prepared a detailed plan 
for closure of the particular operation, the remaining life of which is such that significant changes to the plan are unlikely, and the directors 
have raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the closure by starting to implement that plan or announcing its 
main features to those affected by it. 
 Revenue recognition 
  Sales represents the value of minerals sold, excluding value-added tax, and is recognised when goods are delivered and risk and reward 
has passed, and is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, 
by reference to the principal outstanding and at the interest rates applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future 
cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount. Dividend income from investments is 
recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established. Revenue is recognised when the buyer takes title, 
provided that: 
 It is probable that delivery will be made, 
 the item is on hand, identified and ready for delivery to the buyer at the time the sale is recognised,
 the buyer specifically acknowledges the deferred delivery instructions, 
 the usual payment terms apply. 
 Loans and receivables 
  Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments and that are not quoted in an active market 
are classed as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less

impairment if necessary. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables, when the 
recognition of interest would be immaterial. 
 Impairment of financial assets 
  Financial assets, other than those at Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (‘FVTPL’), are assessed for indicators of impairment at each 
Statement of Financial Position date. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events 
that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have been negatively 
impacted. 
 Derecognition of financial assets 
  The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers 
the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownerships of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers 
nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises 
its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a 
collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received. 
 Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group 
 Classification as debt or equity 
  Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual 
arrangement. 
 Equity instruments
  An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity 
instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
 Financial liabilities
  Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at FVTPL or “other financial liabilities”. 
 Financial liabilities at FVTPL 
 Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL where the financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL. 
  A financial liability is classified as held for trading if:
  It has been incurred principally for the purpose of repurchasing in the near future;
   it is part of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual pattern of 
short-term profit-taking;
  it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument. 
 A financial liability other than a financial liability held for trading may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if:
 Such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise;
 the financial liability forms part of a Group of financial assets or financial liabilities or both, which is managed and its performance 
is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Group’s documented risk management or investment strategy, and 
information about the Grouping is provided internally on that basis;
  it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives, and IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’ permits the entire combined contract (asset or liability) to be designated as at FVTPL.
  Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss 
recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability. The Group has no financial liabilities classified as FVTPL. 
 Other financial liabilities
  Other financial liabilities are initially valued at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
with interest recognised on an effective yield basis.  Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 126
  The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over 
the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash payments through the expected life of 
the financial liability or, where appropriate, a shorter period. 
 Derecognition of financial liabilities 
  The Group derecognises financial liabilities only when the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire. 
 Derivative financial instruments 
  In the ordinary course of its operations, the Group may enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to 
commodity prices, volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rate risk.
  Derivatives are initially recognised at cost at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their 
fair value at each Statement of Financial Position date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in Statement of Comprehensive Income 
immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in 
Statement of Comprehensive Income depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset 
or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or 
settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities. 
 Hedge accounting 
  The Group may designate certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, embedded derivatives and non-derivatives in respect 
of foreign currency risk, as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. Hedges of 
foreign exchange risk or firm commitments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity 
documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its 
strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group 
documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash 
flows of the hedged item. 
 Fair value hedge 
  Changes in the fair value of any derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in profit or loss immediately, 
together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk. The change in the fair value of 
the hedging instrument and the change in the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in the line of the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income relating to the hedged item. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, 
the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. The adjustment to the 
carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised to profit or loss from that date. 
 Cash flow hedge 
  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of any derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in 
equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss, and is included in the “other gains and 
losses” line of the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in profit or loss in the periods when 
the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, in the same line of the Statement of Comprehensive Income as the recognised hedged 
item. However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, 
the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the 
asset or liability. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationships, the hedging instrument expires or 
is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time 
remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is 
no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
 Cash and cash equivalents
  Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash-on-hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly-liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

COMPANY OVERVIEW LEADERSHIP STATEMENTS OUR BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 Non-current assets held-for-sale
  A non-current asset is designated as held-for-sale when its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather 
than through continuing use and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is highly probable. A sale is 
considered highly probable if management is committed to a plan to sell the non-current asset, an active divestiture programme has been 
initiated, the non-current assets is marketed at a price reasonable to its fair value and the disposal is expected to be completed within 
one year from classification. Non-current assets held-for-sale are stated at lower of carrying value and fair value less cost to sell and are 
reviewed for impairment at each subsequent reporting date.
  At the time of classification as held for sale, these assets are reviewed for impairment. The impairment charged to the income statement 
is the excess of the carrying value of the non-current asset and its expected net selling price (fair value less costs to sell). At each 
subsequent reporting date, the carrying values are reassessed for possible impairment. A reversal of impairment is recognised for any 
subsequent increase in net selling price but not in excess of the cumulative impairment loss already recognised. No depreciation is 
provided on non-current assets from the date they are classified as held-for-sale. 
 Segment reporting
  Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker . The 
chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been 
identified as the Pan African Resources Executive Committee. Management has determined the operating segments of the Group based 
on the reports reviewed by the Executive Committee that are used to make strategic decisions. The Executive Committee considers the 
business principally according to the nature of the products and service provided, with the segment representing a strategic business unit. 
The reportable operating segments derive their revenue primarily from mining, extraction, production and selling of gold and 6PGEs.
3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMA TES AND JUDGEMENTS 
  In preparing the annual financial statements in terms of IFRS, the Group’s management is required to make certain judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that may materially affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported 
amounts of revenue and expense during the reported year and the related disclosures. The estimates and judgements are based on historical 
experience, current and expected future economic conditions and other factors. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 Critical accounting estimates and judgements made by management
  The following judgements, that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements, have been made 
by management in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies:
  Estimates made in determining the present obligation of environmental provisions including decommissioning and rehabilitation (this 
includes the scope and timing of work required, the related costs and the discount rate used). 
  Estimates made in determining the recoverable amount of assets, this includes the estimation of cash flows and the discount rates 
used (including future production levels, commodity price and costs). 
 Estimates made in determining the life of the mines:
  –  the Life of Mine is determined from development plans based on mine management’s estimates and includes total mineral reserve 
and a portion of the mineral resource. These plans are updated from time to time and take into consideration the actual current 
cost of extraction, as well as certain forward projections. These projections are reviewed by the board,
  –  estimates made of legal or constructive obligations resulting in the raising of provisions, and the expected date of probable outflow 
of economic benefits to assess whether the provision should be discounted,
  –  estimates of mineral resources and ore reserves in accordance with the SAMREC Code (2000) for South African properties. Such 
estimates relate to the category for the resource (measured, indicated or inferred), the quantum and the grade.
 Estimates of the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets. 
 Estimates involved in feasibility studies related to exploration and growth projects and hence the recoverability of any related capital 
expenditure. 
 Estimates made in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities at acquisition in terms of IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, 
together with any resulting goodwill or gains on bargain purchase considerations. Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 128

There are no significant unrecognised temporary differences associated with undistributed profits of overseas subsidiaries. South African 
income tax on mining income is determined according to a formula which takes into account the profit and revenue from mining 
operations. South African mining taxable income is determined after the deduction of all mining capital expenditure, with the proviso that 
these deductions cannot result in an assessed loss. Capital expenditure amounts not deducted are carried forward as unredeemed capital 
expenditure, to be deducted from future mining income. At year-end the Group has £8,875,902 (2012: £11,999,313) of unredeemed 
capital expenditure carried forward and deductible against future profits, held within Phoenix Platinum. No deferred tax asset has been 
recognised in relation to this, as there is insufficient evidence of future taxable profits.

15 DIVIDENDS
  The board of directors has proposed a dividend of approximately ZAR240,000,000 million (£15,228,426
1
) for the 2013 year, equating 
to ZAR0.1314 per share (0.83p per share
1
), resulting in a dividend cover of 2.3 times. Because of the anticipated cash flow associated 
with the acquisition of Evander Mines, the board did not propose a dividend for the year ended 30 June 2012. 
 Note 1:   The GBP proposed dividend was calculated based on 13 September 2013 closing exchange rate of ZAR15.76:1. The UK shareholders are to note that a revised 
exchange rate will be communicated prior to final approval at the AGM. Therefore the proposed dividend is approximately 0.83p.

 ****  The direct mining depreciation, excluding other non-mining depreciation, totals £5,998,267 (this includes a depreciation charge of £136,153 in note 17) (2012: 
£3,259,010) as disclosed in the statement of comprehensive income. Other non-mining depreciation of £41,197 (2011: £57,617), is disclosed in other (expenses)/
income in note 8.
 *****  Capitalisation of Phoenix Platinum on 1 July 2012 due to reaching steady state production.
 ******  During the year, as a result of falling commodity prices and operational problems arising since first production, the Group recorded an impairment charge of 
£6,662,225 in respect of Phoenix Platinum. The impairment was based on its estimated fair value (less cost to sell), using a post-tax real discount rate of 16.25% 
applied to estimated post-tax cash flows. The assumed long-term PGM 6E basket price was USD1,040/oz. It has been allocated between Phoenix Platinum 
(£2,495,480) and Corporate and Growth Projects (£4,166,745) segments.
  Mineral rights and mining property are depreciated over the life of mine (Barberton Mines, 17 years (2012: 17 years), Evander Mines, 
14 years (2012: nil) and Phoenix Platinum, 20 years (2012: 17 years)). Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 136

  The Group tests the Barberton Mines goodwill carrying amount annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that 
goodwill may be impaired. The goodwill carrying amount is not considered to be impaired and the review was performed in accordance 
with the Group’s accounting policies.
  The recoverable amounts of the CGU’s are determined from value-in-use calculations. The key assumptions for the value-in-use 
calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the year. 
Management estimates the discount rate using post-tax rate of 11.00% (2012:11.88%) for Barberton Mines, which reflect the current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU to the extent not already reflected in the cash flows 
being discounted, an average gold price of ZAR400,000/kg ($1,261/oz) over the life of projects. The life of project was estimated at 
17 years for Barberton Mines. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in 
the market.

 * Funding Company was established for the purpose of providing funding for the Group’s activities.
 **  Emerald Panther is a company acquired to facilitate the acquisition of Evander Mines from Harmony, and therefore holds the investment in Evander Mines (refer to 
note 38). Emerald Panther holds 100% of Evander Gold Mines Ltd and Evander Gold Mining (Pty) Ltd, which are both incorporated in South Africa, and operate in mining.
 ***  During the year the Group disposed of its investment in the Manica exploration project to Auroch. The consideration (refer to note 35) partly comprised a 42% shareholding 
in Auroch which was recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, and has been subsequently treated as an investment in associate. The transaction triggered a loss on 
disposal of £586,138 which took into consideration the Group’s best estimate of the fair value of the related deferred consideration of £7,024,203 (refer to note 35), 
recorded as a non-current financial asset. At year-end the Group re-measured the recoverability of both its 42% shareholding and the deferred consideration and, due to 
a significant fall in the gold price and related challenges in the mining environment, recorded a £3,167,209 impairment against the carrying value of its direct shareholding 
(based on Auroch’s year-end share price, being the best estimate of its fair value) and also fully impaired the £7,024,203 financial asset. The resulting total impairment 
charge (after exchange rate movements), was £9,481,379. Further details of the financial asset are included in note 29. Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 138

purchase price as per the acquisition agreement, on 28 February 2013.
  The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the statement of financial position are 
net of allowances for doubtful receivables of £36,051 (2012: £16,763) relating to other receivables, estimated by the Group’s management 
based on the current economic environment and individual debtor circumstance. The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the 
counterparties are dealt with in accordance with the Group’s credit policy. Rand Refinery (Pty) Ltd is the one major customer that 
represents more than 5% of the trade receivables balance for the individual companies (Barberton Mines and Evander Mines), and 
Western Platinum Limited (subsidiary of Lonmin PLC) is the one major customer that represents more than 5% of the trade receivables 
balance of Phoenix Platinum.
Group
30 June 2013 30 June 2012
The average credit period is:
Number of days 30 15
The ageing of trade receivables increased due to the acquisition of Evander Mines and Phoenix Platinum reaching steady state production.
 No interest is charged on trade receivables.
  Before accepting any new customers, the Group uses a credit bureau or performs a credit assessment to assess the potential customer’s 
credit limit and credit quality. The Group only transacts with credit-worthy customers and large institutions within South Africa.
  The fair value of trade receivables is not materially different from the carrying value presented. No receivables have been pledged as 
security.

Rehabilitation provision
The provision includes the estimate of the costs of decommissioning and the cost of environmental and other remedial work such as 
reclamation costs, close down and restoration and pollution control. Estimates are made on an annual basis, based on the estimated life 
of the mine, following which payments are made to a rehabilitation trust set up as required by South African laws and regulations. The 
provision represents the net present value of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation to decommission and 
rehabilitate environmental disturbances caused by mining operations. These costs are expected to be incurred over the life of mine, which 
is estimated at 17 years for Barberton Mines and 14 years for Evander Mines.
The following rates were used in the calculation of the rehabilitation provision for the Group (includes, Barberton Mines, Evander Mines

 *  On 9 May 2011, the Company established a cash-settled share appreciation right programme entitling selected executives and employees of the Group, as approved by 
the board of directors of the Company, to be allocated notional shares in the Group. These notional shares confer the conditional right on the participant to be paid a cash 
settlement equal to the appreciation in the Company share price from the date of allocation to the date of surrender or deemed surrender of notional shares. Participation 
in the share appreciation programme is subject to the agreement of a selected participant and acceptance by said participant of the rules and regulations governing the 
share appreciation programme.
 Group cash-settled share options
  The share appreciation settlement is determined no later than the sixth anniversary of the date that the notional shares are allocated. 
However, the participant can elect, subject to approval by the Companies Remuneration Committee (Remco), to surrender his/her 
notional shares and receive the share appreciation settlement at a date prior to the sixth anniversary date.
  The share appreciation settlement is regarded as remuneration for income tax purposes and thus subject to the deduction of PAYE and 
all other taxes and contributions via the payroll of the relevant subsidiary. These taxes are for the account of the participant.
  No share appreciation rights settlements can be made until after the period, calculated from the date the notional shares were allocated, 
until:
 Two years has elapsed, in which event not more than 25% of the total number of notional shares allocated,
 three years has elapsed, in which event not more than 50% of the total number of notional shares allocated,
 four years has elapsed, in which event all of the notional shares allocated,
 or any lesser amount of notional shares may be surrendered. Notional shares which a participant is entitled to surrender are referred 
to as “surrenderable notional shares”.
  Remco may, by resolution, amend and postpone any of these vesting periods, with the consent of the participant concerned.
  The participant is entitled, within a period of 60 days after the date of resignation, to surrender all his/her surrenderable notional shares 
and request the payment of the share appreciation bonus in respect thereof. If the participant is subject to retirement (including early 
retirement approved by the Company after the age of 55 in terms of Company policy), retrenchment, death or permanent disability, the 
participant or the participant’s estate is entitled, within a period of six months after the termination date, to surrender all his/her 
surrenderable notional shares and request the payment of the share appreciation settlement in respect thereof.

29 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
 Financial risk management objectives
  The Group seeks to minimise the effects of financial risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge risk exposures where 
appropriate. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies, approved by the board of directors which provide written 
principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments, 
and the investment of excess liquidity. Compliance with the policies and exposure limits is reviewed on a continuous basis. The Group 
does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative use.
 Credit risk
  Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. 
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral, where appropriate, 
as a means of mitigating the risk.
  The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the statement of financial position are 
net of allowances for doubtful receivables of £36,051 (2012: £16,763) relating to other receivables, estimated by the Group’s management 
based on the current economic environment and individual debtor circumstance. The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the 
counterparties are dealt with in accordance with the Group’s credit policy. Rand Refinery (Pty) Ltd is the one major customer that 
represents more than 5% of the trade receivables balance for the individual companies (Barberton Mines and Evander Mines), and 
Western Platinum Limited (subsidiary of Lonmin PLC) is the one major customer that represents more than 5% of the trade receivables 
balance of Phoenix Platinum.

 Market risk
  The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the gold price. Where 
appropriate, the Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk and 
the commodity price risk. Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis.
 Foreign currency risk
  The Group undertakes certain transactions in foreign currencies. Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuation arise. Exchange rate 
exposures are managed within approved policy parameters. The Group specifically ensure USD receipts are converted into ZAR as 
quickly and economically as possible.
 Commodity price risk
  The Group may enter into forward contracts to hedge their exposure to fluctuations in gold prices and exchange rates on specific 
transactions. The contracts are matched with anticipated future cash flows from gold sales receipts.
 Interest rate and liquidity risk
  Fluctuations in interest rates impact on short-term investment and financing activities, giving rise to interest rate risk. In the ordinary 
course of business, the Group receives cash proceeds from its operations and is required to fund working capital and capital expenditure 
requirements. Cash is managed to ensure that surplus funds are invested to maximise returns whilst ensuring that capital is safeguarded 
to the maximum extent by only investing with reputable financial institutions. Contractual arrangements for committed borrowing 
facilities are maintained to meet the Group’s normal and contingent funding needs.

 Interest rate risk
  The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities within the Group borrow and invest funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
 Interest rate sensitivity
  Based on the low level of interest-bearing balances on the statement of financial position, an interest rate sensitivity is not performed as 
the interest rate exposure for the Group is immaterial.
 Liquidity risk
  Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk 
management framework for the management of the Group’s short-term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Group 
manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowings facilities, by continually monitoring 
forecasts and actual cash flows and matching maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
  The Group has access to financing facilities at Barberton Mines and its Funding company, of which the total unutilised portion as at 
30 June 2013 is £28,980,680 (2012: £11,615,841) (refer to note 23). The Group expects to meet its other obligations from operating 
cash flows and proceeds of maturing financial assets.

33 EQUITY -SETTLED SHARE OPTIONS
  On 1 September 2005, the Company established a share option programme relating to equity-settled share options entitling specific 
employees, officers, directors and qualifying consultants as approved by the board of directors of the Company and its subsidiaries to 
purchase shares in the Company. The share option exercise price is determined using the closing price at which shares are traded on the 
JSE or AIM (as determined by the board of directors), on the trading date immediately preceding the date upon which the board 
authorised the grant of the opportunity to acquire the relevant share options, as the case may be to a participant. Pursuant to resolutions 
of the board passed in accordance with the rules of the share option programme, share options may be released from the share option 
programme to participants, share options may be exercised by participants and allocation shares may be, delivered to participants as 
follows for allocations prior to 21 July 2008:
 33.33% of the total number of shares allocated after one year has elapsed from the grant date by the participant of the grant,
 up to 66.67% of the total number of shares allocated after two years have elapsed from the grant date by the participant of the grant,
 the balance of the shares allocated after three years have elapsed from the grant date by the participant of the grant,
 and for allocations subsequent to 21 July 2008 as follows:
 25% of the total number of shares allocated after one year has elapsed from the grant date by the participant of the grant,
 up to 50% of the total number of shares allocated after two years have elapsed from the grant date by the participant of the grant,
 up to 75% of the total number of shares allocated after three years have elapsed from the grant date by the participant of the grant,
 the balance of the shares after four years have elapsed from the grant date by the participant of the grant; provided that the board may, 
at its discretion, anticipate or postpone such dates.
  An option holder may not exercise a share option under the share option programme by later than the end of the year preceding the 
tenth anniversary of the grant date. Upon death of an option holder the estate would be entitled to exercise the options vested to date 
within 12 months of the date of death, if the options are not exercised the total available share options would lapse. The directors have 
the discretion to approve the vesting of the deceased total number of unvested share options.
  The number of vested share options to which an option holder is entitled to expires after a period of six months due to resignation, 
retirement, redundancy or disability of the option holder.
 The number and weighted average exercise price of share options is as follows:

33 EQUITY -SETTLED SHARE OPTIONS (continued)
  A Company dividend rate has not been determined and therefore is not taken into account in option fair value calculations. The 
volatility of the Company’s share price on each date of grant was calculated as the average of volatilities of share prices of the 
Company on the corresponding dates. The volatility of share price of the Company was calculated as the average of annualised 
standard deviations of daily continuously compounded returns on the Company’s stock, calculated over 1 to 4 years back from the 
date of grant. Therefore, volatility of the Company’s share prices was calculated over the period commensurate with the expected life 
of the options under consideration, giving more weight to more recent historical data to account for volatility persistence.
 There are no market conditions attached to the exercise of the share options.
  The Group recognised total expenses of £127,053 (2012: £43,452) related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions during 
the reporting period.
 Participation in share-based and other long-term incentive schemes is restricted to employees and directors.

38 ACQUISITION OF EVANDER MINES
  On 28 February 2013, the Group acquired 100% of the recorded voting shares of Evander Mines, thus obtaining control of Evander 
Mines. Cash consideration paid for the acquisition was ZAR1,313,104,110. It was determined that this transaction represents a business 
combination with Emerald Panther identified as the acquirer. The Group began consolidating the operating results, cash flows and net 
assets of Evander Mines from 1 March 2013. Evander Mine was a public unlisted mining company that was wholly owned by Harmony. 
The tables below present the purchase cost and our provisional allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired. This 
allocation was calculated as at the date of acquisition to reflect the provisional determination of the fair values of the assets and liabilities 
acquired. The significant adjustments were to increase property, plant and equipment by ZAR1,057,772,388 and deferred income taxes 
by ZAR464,741,606, with a corresponding bargain purchase gain of ZAR322,443,757 recognised in the consolidated results. There were 
no significant adjustments made to the consolidated statements of comprehensive income after applying these adjustments retroactively 
to the acquisition date.

any prior understanding or arrangement between 
the Company and a counterparty, unless the JSE 
otherwise permits,

Articles of Association to acquire such shares,

10% above the weighted average market price at 
which the Company’s shares traded on the JSE over 
the five business days immediately preceding the date 
on which the transaction is effected,
NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL
MEETING

was taken authorising such repurchases, confirming 
that the company and its subsidiaries engaged in such 
repurchases have passed solvency and liquidity test 
and confirming that since such tests were performed 
there have been no material adverse changes to the 
financial position of the Group,
 such repurchases are not conducted during prohibited 
periods as defined by the Listings Requirements, unless 
the company has complied with the conditions set out 
in paragraph 5.72(h) of the Listings Requirements.
   The other general information referred to in paragraph 
11.26(b) of the Listings Requirements regarding the 
company is contained elsewhere in this notice of annual 
general meeting, as follows:

any legal or arbitration proceedings, nor are any such proceedings 
pending or threatened, that may have or have had any material effect 
on the Group’s financial position.
Directors’ responsibility statement
The directors of the Company, whose names are given on page 4 
of the Group’s Integrated Annual Report in which this notice is 
incorporated, collectively and individually accept full responsibility for 
the accuracy of the information given in this notice, and certify that 
to the best of their knowledge and belief there are no facts that have 
been omitted which would make any statement false or misleading, 
and that all reasonable enquiries to ascertain such facts have been 
made and that this notice contains all information required by the 
Listings Requirements.

material change in the financial or trading position of the Company 
and its subsidiaries that has occurred since the end of the last 
financial period.
The intention of the directors is that the repurchase of the Company’s 
shares will be effected within the parameters laid down by this

Company and its subsidiaries engaged in such repurchases have 
passed the solvency and liquidity test and confirming that since such 
tests were performed there have been no material adverse changes

Group respectively, such assets and liabilities being fairly valued 
and recognised and measured in accordance with the accounting 
policies used in the 2013 audited Annual Financial Statements of 
the company and the Group.
 The issued capital and reserves of the Company and the Group 
would be adequate for the purposes of the company and the 
Group’s ordinary business.
 The company and the Group’s working capital would be 
adequate for ordinary business purposes.
Notes:
(i)  The Company will publish an announcement complying with 
the Listings Requirements if and when an initial and successive 
3% tranche(s) of its shares have been repurchased in terms of 
the aforementioned general authority.
(ii)  The Company’s sponsor will provide a letter to the JSE, 
regarding the directors’ statement as to the adequacy of the 
Group’s working capital, before the company commences

hereby sought.

The Company specifies that only those members registered on the

above, you are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of 
your rights to attend, speak and vote at the AGM and you should 
have received a proxy form with this notice of meeting.

appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. You may 
not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any 
one share. To appoint more than one proxy, you may photocopy 
this form.
A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote 
will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the 
resolution. If you either select the “Discretionary” option or if no 
voting indication is given, your proxy will vote or abstain from voting 
at his or her discretion. Y our proxy will vote (or abstain from voting) 
as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put 
before the AGM.

proxy form is signed (or a duly certified copy of such power or

 In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders 
purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment submitted by 
the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined 
by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the 
Company’s register of members in respect of the joint holding (the 
first-named being the most senior).
Changing proxy instructions
 To change your proxy instructions simply submit a new proxy 
appointment using the methods set out above. Note that the cut-off 
time for receipt of proxy appointments (see above) also applies in

appointment will remain valid. Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 167
COMPANY OVERVIEW LEADERSHIP STATEMENTS OUR BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 Appointment of a proxy does not preclude you from attending the 
AGM and voting in person. If you have appointed a proxy and attend 
the AGM in person, your proxy appointment will automatically be 
terminated.
Issued shares and total voting rights
As at 18:00 on 22 October 2013, the Company’s issued share 
capital comprised 1,827,897,263 ordinary shares of 1p each. Each 
ordinary share carries the right to one vote at a general meeting 
of the Company and, therefore, the total number of voting rights in 
the Company as at 18:00 on 22 October 2013 was 1,827,897,263.
Directors’ interests and documents on 
display
A statement or summary of transactions of directors (and their family 
interests) in the share capital of the Company and copies of their 
service contracts will be available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office during normal business hours (Saturdays and public 
holidays excepted) from the date of this notice until the conclusion 
of the AGM and will also be available for inspection at the place of 
the AGM for at least 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting.
CREST
 CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through 
the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the 
meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures 
described in the CREST manual. CREST personal members or other 
CREST sponsored members and those CREST members who have 
appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST 
sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the 
appropriate action on their behalf.
 In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the 
CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a 
“CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in 
accordance with Euroclear’s specifications and must contain the 
information required for such instructions, as described in the 
CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes 
the appointment of a proxy or to an amendment to the instruction 
given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be 
transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID: RA10) 
by 10:00 on 20 November 2013 (or 48 hours preceding the date 
and time for any adjourned meeting). For this purpose, the time 
of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the 
timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) 
from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message enquiry 
to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any 
change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should 
be communicated to the appointee through other means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or 
voting service providers should note that Euroclear does not make 
available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. 
Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation 
to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of 
the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is 
a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed 
a voting service provider(s) to procure that his CREST sponsor or 
voting service provider(s) take(s) such action as shall be necessary to 
ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system 
by any particular time). In this connection, CREST members and, 
where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers 
are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST manual 
concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. Pan African Resources PLC Integrated Annual Report 2013 168

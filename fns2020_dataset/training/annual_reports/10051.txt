Smart engineering is second nature to us
High pressure air travelling through the 
geometry of bleed air valves cast or 
machined in the traditional way is 
extremely noisy, something that will be 
familiar to those who live near airports. 
In future, air could flow more quietly 
through a radical new concept from 
Meggitt based on a fir-cone design, an 
organic structure made possible through 
additive layer manufacturing. The bold use 
of innovative processes forms part of 
Meggitt’s centrally coordinated and highly 
focused technology strategy.
93987_Cover.indd   2 04/03/2015   16:10 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE REPORTS STRATEGIC REPORT 1
Meggitt’s smart engineering for 
extreme environments attracted  
an unprecedented number of 
programme wins in the current civil 
aerospace cycle of new platform 
launches, making 2014 a year of 
accelerating new product 
introduction ready to meet the 
manufacturing ramp-up that will 
drive financial returns for the next 
decade and more.
We will continue to focus on the industrialisation of 
new products in 2015, supported by the widening 
implementation of the Meggitt Production System 
(MPS). This combination of tried-and-tested 
business improvement methodologies tailored to 
Meggitt is fundamental to defining how we work 
throughout the Group.   
The system consists of six demanding phases, with 
the final Silver and Gold certifications delineating 
operations excellence as a defining, sustainable 
competitive advantage. While achieving gains in 
productivity and employee engagement wherever 
MPS has been introduced, we are at the beginning 
of a journey that will extend from the factory floor 
into every function and that will touch every  
Meggitt employee. 
Operations excellence at the core
Across the Group, MPS has strengthened the 
foundations for greater operations excellence, 
giving us a comprehensive but flexible framework 
for continuous improvement. On-time-delivery and 
quality are up in many of our businesses as a result. 
MPS’ new global standards make our core stronger, 
creating a secure platform for growth. (See page 18).
Making more of our talent
MPS is also reshaping our culture. Our new 
operating system has renewed employee 
confidence and commitment. Increasing numbers 
of operators, supervisors and managers have the 
tools and processes they need to make a very 
personal contribution to improving the business 
and leaders now have more time to lead, spotting 
opportunities for growth and innovation.  
(See page 20).
A new wave of technology
The operational savings and productivity 
improvements won by MPS will allow us 
to invest more in innovation—what we make  
and how we make it.
We’re looking ahead not only to product 
innovation but advances in how we make products. 
We are already investigating a new approach to 
manufacturing engineering, taking the first steps 
toward developing the factories of the future.

93987_p01-04.indd   4 04/03/2015   16:21 Chairman’s statement
Growing the Group
It’s been over a decade since I joined 
Meggitt as a non-executive director, 
becoming Chairman in 2004. During that 
time, Meggitt has evolved from a group 
of individually-run industrial businesses 
into an increasingly integrated 
international enterprise focusing 
on aerospace, defence and energy.  
We have grown revenue threefold, 
organically and by acquisition, increased 
our market capitalisation five-fold and 
doubled our workforce to over 10,500. 
A brand-new braking systems business 
has emerged from two significant 
acquisitions, both of which also boosted 
our existing thermal management and 
polymers and composites capabilities. 
An industry leader in aircraft fire protection 
and control emerged from another. 
In 2009, we restructured our business  
into capability-based divisions with 
streamlined management that made us 
easier to do business with. In 2013, we 
launched our continuous improvement 
initiative, the Meggitt Production System 
(MPS), which is already having a marked 
impact on our operational performance 
with much more to come.   
Talent
Meggitt has a strong focus on talent 
development, sponsoring aspiring 
engineers through successive Arkwright 
Scholarship Trust awards; entering into 
a long-term partnership with the 
Institution of Mechanical Engineers to 
provide training, management and 
leadership development for Meggitt 
engineers; appointing technical fellows; 
and creating a world-class biannual 
executive training programme with Oxford 
University’s Saïd Business School. 
In the last three years we have launched  
a hugely successful graduate training 
programme. We have attracted the best 
recruits from leading engineering 
faculties worldwide. Participants have 
been given the time and resources to 
focus on specific projects with excellent 
results, exemplified most recently by 
development work on a critical component 
for a major engine manufacturer using 
Meggitt’s growing capability in additive 
layer manufacturing.
Doing business the right way
Meggitt’s growth has been based on fair 
and impartial conduct of business, fully 
compliant with applicable laws and 
regulations worldwide and integrity in 
every business relationship. 
Meggitt was one of the first UK companies 
to commit to comprehensive ethics 
policies, programmes and practice when 
we signed the Statement of Adherence to 
the Global Principles of Business Ethics 
for the Aerospace and Defense Industry. 
As Chairman of the Group’s Ethics and 
Trade Compliance Committee, I take great 
pride in the strength of our programmes.
Capital deployment 
Meggitt’s capital allocation policy focuses 
on investing in organic growth, increasing 
ordinary dividends in line with earnings 
through the cycle and, where appropriate, 
enhancing capability in its core markets 
through targeted, accretive acquisitions. 
As the year closed, we acquired Precision 
Engine Controls Corporation (PECC). This 
leading supplier of actuation systems and 
fuel metering valves to manufacturers of 
small-frame gas turbines complements 
Meggitt Control Systems’ capability, further 
extending its reach in the oil and gas and 
power generation sectors.      
Demonstrating our commitment to 
maintaining an efficient balance sheet, 
we launched a share buyback programme 
for the first time in 2014. This is already 
improving shareholder returns and will 
deliver gearing at or slightly above  
1.5 times net debt to EBITDA (earnings 
before interest, taxes, depreciation and 
amortisation) by the end of 2015. 
Board of directors 
Alison Goligher was appointed non-executive 
director to the Board in October. Alison, an 
Executive Vice President in Shell’s Upstream 
International Division, brings a wealth of 
experience in technology deployment and 
integrated project management in the 
energy sector.   
In December, non-executive director, 
Philip Cox resigned to take up a new role 
as chairman of Drax Group plc. We thank 
Philip for his outstanding contribution to 
the Board. 
I will be retiring at April’s AGM and will  
be succeeded by Sir Nigel Rudd, whose 
extensive international business and 
boardroom experience spans many 
industries including those in which 
we specialise. 
I have enjoyed my time at Meggitt 
immensely and I am proud to have played 
my part in its transformation into a 
FTSE-100 global engineering group 
delivering critical products and solutions 
in its chosen markets. I look forward to 
seeing even greater success as Meggitt 
continues to evolve and grow. 
I would like to take this opportunity to extend 
my heartfelt thanks to all Meggitt employees 
for their outstanding work during my tenure 
as Chairman, particularly after a challenging 
year in some of our key markets.
Sir Colin Terry  Chairman
Meggitt was one of the first UK 
companies to commit to 
comprehensive ethics policies. 
As Chairman of the Group’s 
Ethics and Trade Compliance 
Committee, I take great pride in 
the strength of our programmes.

6 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
Superior performance, 
defined by quality, cost 
and on-time delivery, is 
key to realising our 
growth potential and we 
are determined to make 
operations excellence  
a core competitive 
strength.
Group strategy
Meggitt aims to be a leading provider  
of smart engineering for extreme 
environments. We invest in developing 
high-technology components and sub-
systems which play mission or safety-
critical roles over long operating lives. 
We seek to improve our operational 
performance continuously to offer 
industry-leading levels of quality, 
on-time delivery and competitiveness, 
enabling us to reinvest in new capabilities 
and technologies while generating 
attractive returns for shareholders.
Technology 
We focus on targeted investment to 
drive future growth. We seek to grow 
organically by investing in the product 
and manufacturing technologies 
that count across a broad range of 
platforms and customers. To secure 
positions on specific platforms, we 
align our development focus with our 
customers’ technology roadmaps. 
We look to supplement organic growth 
with acquisitions that enhance our 
capabilities and routes to market. 
In 2014, we continued to refine our 
complete ATA26 fire protection 
systems for aircraft as we progressed 
our development of innovative 
environmentally-sound suppression 
technology. We continued to invest in fluid 
control and thermal management products 
capable of operating at the ever-higher 
temperatures required to enable the latest 
generation of jet engines to deliver the 
efficiencies demanded by their operators. 
To deliver these and many other 
capabilities competitively, we maintained 
our investment in cutting-edge 
manufacturing technologies such as 
additive layer manufacturing, which we 
now employ in the production of some 
in-service components, and Meggitt 
Modular Modifiable Manufacturing (M
4
), 
our pioneering approach to the factories 
of the future. M
4
 is designed to enable 
operators to manufacture a broader 
range of low-volume, highly complex 
components through greater deployment 
of technology through the factory. This 
includes the real-time monitoring of  
key parameters including product weight 
and touch-time and the provision of 
instant-access support to the operator 
if required. The result is greater 
optimisation of all aspects of the 
manufacturing process from machining 
and assembly to machine utilisation and 
traceability, enabling our businesses to 
invest in state-of-the-art equipment in 
the knowledge that it will be fully utilised 
in ‘smart’ facilities. 
Our acquisition of Precision Engine 
Controls Corporation (PECC) in December 
2014 exemplifies targeted, value-added 
portfolio enhancement. PECC, now 
a Meggitt Control Systems product range, 
builds on our existing thermal management 
and fluid control capabilities in the 
aero-derivative gas turbine market, 
broadening our reach into small-frame 
gas turbines in the 1-30MW power range 
and widening our actuation technology 
offering for the combined customer base. 
Operations excellence
Superior performance, defined by quality, 
cost and on-time delivery, is another key 
to realising our growth potential and we 
are determined to make operations 
excellence a core competitive strength. 
With meaningful improvements in 
operating performance such as Defective 
Parts Per Million down 84% and on-time 
delivery up 10%, the Meggitt Production 
System—our single, global approach to 
continuous improvement—has progressed 
well since its inception. We have launched 
the system across two thirds of our 
manufacturing estate and expect to see 
it adopted at all primary sites by the end of 
2015. Several sites have entered the second 
phase in the six-phase programme, 
extending the reach of the system beyond 
the factory floor and supply chain into 
functions and leadership. 
We have undertaken considerable work 
optimising our manufacturing footprint 
over the last few years, consolidating six 
sites into three and investing in low-cost 
manufacturing centres in China, Vietnam 
and Mexico. In 2014, we made good 
progress in enhancing the level of 
manufacturing capability of our facility 
in Querétaro, Mexico, with the start of 
a substantial transfer of product lines 
from our Control Systems businesses 
in North America. In China, we increased 
the scope of our Xiamen facility, 
responding to customers’ global sourcing 
requirements with the successful 
replication of a high-tech process from 
one of our European facilities involving 
the printing of sensors onto printed 
circuit boards. We will continue to evolve 
our manufacturing estate in response to 
the requirements of our customer base.
Chief Executive’s review
93987_p06-07.indd   6 04/03/2015   16:52 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE REPORTS STRATEGIC REPORT 7
Renewing our customer focus
Making ourselves easy to do business 
with while responding to the dynamic 
markets in which we operate is core to 
our business philosophy for original 
equipment (OE) and aftermarket 
customers alike. To enhance our 
customer focus, we have recently 
appointed two senior executives 
dedicated to the requirements of our  
OE customers and the aftermarket 
respectively. 
The manufacturers of aircraft and 
engines will see a renewed focus on their 
interests as we strengthen key account 
relationship management and bring 
together cross-group product packages 
that simplify their supply chains. 
The aftermarket is central to the Meggitt 
business model. We will improve service 
through the Meggitt Production System 
and focus on the development of innovative 
support solutions for our OE customers 
as they seek to maintain more of their 
products in service. 
Cradle-to-grave programme 
management underpins Original 
equipment manufacturer (OEM) and 
aftermarket relationships. We are 
strengthening this function, shortening 
the lines of communication between 
OEMs and operators, championing their 
interests inside Meggitt and allowing 
closer collaboration than ever before. 
This is how we will achieve specific 
programme success, insights into 
customer’s technology aspirations over 
the longer term and opportunities to 
create better products from our  
existing portfolio. 
Performance in 2014
Performance in our end-markets was 
mixed. Good growth in civil aerospace 
was driven by a rise in aircraft deliveries 
from the major manufacturers, greater 
Meggitt content on newer platforms 
and a continued recovery in 
aftermarket revenues.
There were, however, challenges in our 
military market, particularly during the 
first half of the year. The effect of the US 
military drawdown from Afghanistan was 
compounded by the completion of two 
large retrofit contracts in the first half 
of the prior year. Both issues constituted 
a significant headwind to military 
aftermarket performance, although our 
overall military revenues stabilised on an 
organic basis in the second half of 2014. 
In energy, we continued to make good 
progress on the issue highlighted in 2013 
concerning the lack of availability of 
tourmaline, a key raw material. This is 
now behind us—we have migrated a 
number of customers onto alternative 
in-house materials and we are receiving 
positive customer feedback on product 
performance. Energy performance in the 
second half was hampered by lower 
revenues at Heatric, our printed circuit 
heat exchanger business. Its local content 
provider in Brazil is experiencing financial 
challenges, causing revenue to be 
deferred from 2014. 
Against this background, we have 
delivered flat organic revenues in 2014, 
with a decrease in underlying earnings 
per share of 5.1p to 32.4p reflecting 
currency movements, business mix, 
disposals and the investment being made 
in new aircraft programmes. Net debt to 
EBITDA at the end of the year was 1.2x. 
In November we announced a share 
buyback with the intention of increasing 
this ratio to 1.5x by the end of 2015 to 
maintain an efficient balance sheet. 
Outlook
The outlook for our civil aerospace 
markets remains encouraging. 
Production rates of large jets are 
expected to continue to grow and the 
relatively high shipset values we enjoy 
on the latest generation of widebody 
aircraft, together with our positions on 
the re-engined narrowbodies, should 
underpin organic civil OE revenue growth 
of 7 to 8% over the medium term. 
Reflecting recent inventory build at 
aircraft manufacturers ahead of new 
product launches and production rate 
increases, 2015 will be moderately 
below this level. 
Available seat kilometres, the key driver 
of our large and regional jet aftermarket, 
are growing at above the long-term trend, 
and lower oil prices should see this 
continue. However, we are seeing 
month-to-month volatility in revenues 
and a continuing impact from surplus 
parts. We therefore expect civil 
aftermarket growth in mid-single 
digits for 2015.
In the military market, we look to be 
entering a more benign phase, with 
military budgets seeing lower rates of 
decline than in recent years and even 
some suggestion of growth in the 
all-important US budget from 2016. 
Order intake in 2014 has been strong, with 
book to bill of 1.03 covering a number of 
short-term and multi-year contracts. 
On this basis we expect a return to 
modest growth in 2015 driven by good 
growth in military training, partially 
offset by a decline in MABS following the 
completion of the B1-B and Taiwanese 
upgrade programmes. We maintain our 
medium-term expectation of an average 
of 2% growth per annum excluding the 
effects of sequestration. 
Our energy businesses, driven by 
heightened demand for our printed circuit 
heat exchangers and increasing market 
share in condition-monitoring equipment, 
should continue to deliver revenue growth 
averaging greater than 10% over the 
medium term. However, in 2015 we expect 
good organic growth in energy control 
valves and condition monitoring to be 
largely offset by a decline at Heatric 
reflecting the impact of capital 
expenditure deferrals by our major 
oil and gas customers. 
On the basis of the above, the 
Group continues to expect organic 
revenue growth in 2015 of low to 
mid-single digit percentage points, 
in line with the guidance given in our 
interim management statement in 
November 2014.

Group strategy
Strategy
 
We select high-growth markets where we can deploy our smart engineering 
for extreme environments and ability to navigate the complex regulatory and 
certification environment associated with safety- and mission-critical 
products. These markets must deliver long-term, predictable revenue 
streams in line with our business model.    
We set strategic priorities according to the dynamics of this business model. 
Today, we are addressing core technology, consolidating our resources and 
sharpening our focus to extend our intellectual property; operations 
excellence from the factory floor to every function based on the Meggitt 
Production System; and renewed focus on customers, with dedicated 
management responsibility for OEM and aftermarket customer relations, 
underpinned by strong programme management.
Meggitt’s strategy by market and capability is outlined in the Market review 
(see page 10) and under Meggitt divisions (see page 13). 
Business model
We deliver strong and sustainable 
shareholder returns through leading 
positions in aerospace, defence and 
energy markets.  
Throughout the business cycle, revenue 
comes from successfully executing 
original equipment programmes (often 
sole-source) and the aftermarket that 
flows from them. Aftermarket demand  
is driven by condition-based demand 
caused by the wear and tear associated 
with the harsh environments in which  
our products operate.    
Airframers, turbine manufacturers, oil and 
gas platforms and processing vessels— 
60,000-plus platforms carry Meggitt products
Airlines, militaries, distributors, MRO integrators
Supporting end-users through sales of spares 
and repairs for the life of programmes is a 
significant driver of returns.

Investment cycle
We develop technology for applications involving product  
life-cycles measured in decades. Products must perform  
without fail in environmental extremes, requiring replacement  
or overhaul, generating strong returns from our initial investment 
over many years.
Our business model requires significant cash investment in the 
development phase of programmes. For our wheels and brakes 
business, this includes production. We make strong positive 
cashflow within our civil aerospace and military end-markets  
during the in-service phase, resulting in cash break-even between  
years 11 and 18 typically, with a shorter cash break-even in the 
energy market.  
As our products are developed in line with our customers’ 
technology goals, we have performed strongly in recent bid cycles, 
securing positions on key platforms and refreshing the long-term 
aftermarket pipeline.
Our near-term business is weighted therefore towards investment 
in new development programmes and the transition of new products 
to full run-rate manufacturing, the source of sustainable growth 
over the long term.

Market review 
Meggitt’s core civil aerospace, military  
and energy markets share a common 
requirement for smart engineering for 
extreme environments: mission- and 
safety-critical components and sub-systems 
that function without fail for many years in 
highly demanding operating conditions,  
from suppliers capable of meeting rigorous 
certification requirements. 
Civil aerospace 
Civil aerospace accounts for 48% of Group 
revenue, with products and sub-systems 
installed on almost every jet airliner, 
regional aircraft and business jet in 
service. This fleet has grown recently, 
totalling over 43,000 aircraft today versus 
31,000 a decade ago. New aircraft 
deliveries drive sales of original equipment 
(OE) and aircraft utilisation generates 
demand for spare parts and repairs over 
many decades, so the growth of our fleet is 
a strong indication of future aftermarket 
revenue growth. 
Original equipment 
We classify civil aircraft deliveries by seat 
capacity: large jets (>100 seats), regional 
aircraft (<100 seats) and business jets. 
Large jet deliveries in 2014 stood at a 
record 1,380, 8% higher than in 2013. 
Growth is underpinned by the order books 
of Boeing and Airbus, the two major civil 
aircraft manufacturers, which extend over 
seven years at current production levels, 
plus other manufacturers investing in the 
large jet market including Bombardier, 
Sukhoi and AVIC. The high level of demand 
for new aircraft deliveries in recent years 
has been driven primarily by high oil prices, 
the relatively low cost of debt and the wave 
of newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft coming 
to market including Boeing’s 787 and 
737MAX and Airbus’ A350XWB and 
A320neo. Despite the recent decrease in oil 
prices, we expect no significant changes to 
new aircraft demand in the short term. 
Regional aircraft deliveries of 269 in 2014 
represented a 2% increase on 2013, with 
growth driven by 70-plus seat aircraft. 
Growth looks set to continue over the 
medium term, mirroring the increasing 
internationalisation of the regional 
aircraft fleet. Regional fleets outside 
North America account for 55% of the 
global fleet, up from 44% a decade ago. 
Business jet deliveries totalled 675, a 6% 
increase on 2013, although deliveries 
remain around 40% below the peak in 
2008. Inventories are continuing to decline, 
however, and rising corporate profitability, 
a good driver of business jet demand 
historically, is forecast to continue. As with 
regional aircraft, the fleet is becoming 
increasingly global—customers in the 
Americas currently comprise 75% of 
the global business jet fleet but order 
trends suggest this will move to around 
60% over the next decade. Ten years 
ago, the Americas represented 85% of 
the global fleet. Over the medium term, 
we see deliveries continuing to recover, 
particularly at the smaller end of the 
market, driven by an improved economic 
growth outlook in developed economies and 
the large number of new aircraft models. 
Meggitt performance
Meggitt’s OE revenue grew organically by 
6% in 2014, with significant contributions 
from the ramp-up of the Boeing 787 and 
initial production revenue from the 
A350XWB. Large jet deliveries drive the 
majority of our OE revenues, involving the 
supply of products and sub-systems on 
engines and airframes covering thermal 
management and fluid control, fire 
protection, condition-monitoring and 
high-integrity electronics. Our largest 
exposure to regional aircraft and 
business jets is through our wheels and 
brakes business, which provides most 
original equipment free of charge to civil 
aircraft manufacturers. Strong OE 
performance is also driven by higher 
shipset values on new aircraft 
programmes, whose order books and 
delivery forecasts lend confidence in 
growth prospects averaging 7 to 8%  
per annum for the medium term. 
Market matrix
Meggitt benefits from a balanced portfolio. Capability-based business units deploy 
technological know-how and intellectual property across all our markets so we are not 
dependent on single customers, individual programmes or market segments.

93987_p10-12.indd   10 04/03/2015   16:24 Aftermarket
The civil aerospace aftermarket is driven 
primarily by aircraft utilisation which,  
for large jets and regional aircraft, is 
measured using available seat kilometres 
(ASKs). We use take-offs and landings 
as a proxy for business jet utilisation. 
ASKs in the commercial aircraft fleet 
grew 5.5% in 2014, above the 5% long-
term average. The Middle East and Asia 
saw particularly strong growth, with the 
US market showing a steady recovery. 
Regional aircraft utilisation picked up 
noticeably driven by the recovery in  
North America. Business jet utilisation 
in the US and Europe continued to exhibit 
the gradual improvement seen for the 
last two years, with take-offs and 
landings in 2014 up 3% versus 2013.  
We would normally expect our 
aftermarket revenues to follow these 
leading indicators after a lag of a few 
months. However, revenue can be 
impacted by short-term perturbations 
including destocking or restocking cycles 
and excess spare part inventory arising 
from the retirement of old aircraft and 
subsequent harvesting of serviceable 
components from these aircraft. 
Meggitt performance
Meggitt’s organic aftermarket revenue 
was up 5% for the year, with 2% growth in 
the first half accelerating to 7% growth in 
the second half. The growth rate in the final 
quarter was 10%, above our medium-term 
expectation of 8 to 9%. Air traffic was good 
given the previously referenced 5.5% ASK 
growth. However, aftermarket revenue 
growth overall was held back to a degree by 
the parting out of old aircraft resulting from 
the high delivery rates of new, more 
fuel-efficient aircraft. 
Regional aircraft and business jets 
are important contributors to the Group’s 
aftermarket revenue. The continued 
increase in fleet size and recovery in 
regional aircraft utilisation in 2014 
boosted overall aftermarket growth. 
Our regional aircraft aftermarket grew 
4% in the year, with business jet aircraft 
up an impressive 13%.
Aircraft utilisation remains very 
encouraging, with ASKs now tracking above 
the long-term average. A reduction in some 
of the current cyclical factors such as 
retirement rates and the subsequent parting 
out of aircraft would drive confidence in our 
medium-term aftermarket revenue growth 
expectation of 8 to 9% on average. 
Military 
Military accounts for 34% of Group 
revenue. Meggitt has equipment on over 
20,000 aircraft and a variety of ground 
vehicles, naval vessels and training 
installations worldwide.  
Defence budgets in some key markets 
remained under pressure in 2014, 
notably in the US where the effect of 
the drawdown from Afghanistan and 
absence of equipment reset affected

spending levels and the Continuing 
Resolution in the early part of the year 
impacted the timing and size of orders. 
However, European markets were stable 
and parts of the Middle East and Asia 
saw budget growth. The US defence 
budget remains subject to ongoing fiscal 
pressures, although industry forecasts 
suggest we are moving into a more 
benign budgetary environment in US and 
international markets. 
While we do not expect significant growth 
in military expenditure in the near term, 
opportunities remain for the reset and 
upgrade of repatriated equipment and the 
supply of new products as a significant 
tranche of military assets reach the end 
of their service lives. 
Meggitt performance 
Meggitt’s military revenue declined 
organically by 7% in 2014. The first half 
decline was particularly affected by the 
completion of two substantial retrofit 
programmes in 2013 and a reduction in 
the sale of spares and repairs on some 
helicopter and heavy-lift platforms 
following the withdrawal of US equipment 
from Afghanistan. Military revenues were 
flat in the second half. 
Our exposure to a broad range of fixed 
and rotary wing aircraft, ground vehicles, 
training facilities and naval vessels 
across original equipment and 
aftermarket spares and repairs has 
enabled us to demonstrate resilience in 
a challenging environment over the last 
few years. We expect to continue to do so 
over the medium term. We have enjoyed 
considerable success, for example, 
securing retrofit programmes for 
blast-proof fuel tanks for the Bradley 
fighting vehicle fleet and fuel bladders 
for the KC135 tanker aircraft. While we 
have now completed these retrofit 
programmes, further opportunities exist 
in the reset of recently repatriated 
equipment from Afghanistan, and we are 
engaged with US military customers on 
further ground vehicle fuel tank retrofits. 
Further revenue growth is supported by 
continuing expansion of the fleet of 
platforms on which we have good content 
such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and 
A400M. Accordingly, we are targeting an 
average of 2% per annum organic 
revenue growth in the medium term, 
excluding the impact of sequestration. 
Energy 
Our energy business accounted for 11% 
of Group revenue in 2014. We target 
power generation and oil and gas markets 
with condition-monitoring hardware and 
software, control valves and printed 
circuit heat exchanger technology. 
The market for condition monitoring 
and control valves has continued to 
grow, as high input costs, particularly 
in the first half of 2014, drove operators 
to extract greater efficiency from 
their assets. As newer, more capable 
monitoring technologies come to market, 
operators will maximise their asset 
utilisation and minimise unplanned 
downtime by retrofitting new condition-
monitoring systems onto existing plant 
and machinery. 
The oil and gas heat transfer market 
remained robust through 2014. 
Exploration and production companies 
have been increasingly turning to 
extraction sites which are further offshore 
and in deeper water, necessitating the 
commissioning of new equipment designed 
to operate in these increasingly harsh 
environments. These factors have 
resulted in good growth in demand for 
floating, production, storage and offload 
(FPSO) and floating liquefied natural gas 
(FLNG) vessels. However, the sharp 
decline in the global oil price over the last 
few months of the year is likely to 
significantly dampen oil producers’ 
appetite for new capital projects in the 
short term, resulting in the deferral and 
possible cancellation of projects. 
Meggitt performance 
Meggitt’s energy revenue declined 3% 
on an organic basis in 2014. Sales to 
power generation customers declined 
modestly, particularly in the first half 
of the year, as a shortage of tourmaline 
impacted our ability to fulfil customer 
requirements. We have, however, seen 
a considerable improvement as a result 
of migrating customers onto alternative 
technologies and we anticipate a return 
to growth from 2015. Revenue at our 
Heatric printed circuit heat exchanger 
business also declined as a result of the 
deferral of revenue out of 2014 driven by 
financial difficulties at our local content 
provider in Brazil. 
Heightened demand for our printed circuit 
heat exchangers from an identified project 
pipeline totalling nearly £600 million and 
increasing market share in condition-
monitoring equipment should continue to 
deliver revenue growth averaging greater 
than 10% over the medium term. 
However, in the short term we anticipate 
good growth in energy control valves and 
condition monitoring to be largely offset 
by a decline at Heatric, reflecting the 
impact of project deferrals resulting 
from the recent decline in the oil price.

training through technology. Meggitt’s significant 
investment in software architecture and military 
training expertise provides a virtual product that  
will not only improve the quality of training to  
soldiers but the efficiency and effectiveness of 
training instructors.  
93987_p13-17.indd   17 04/03/2015   16:28 The aim of the Meggitt Production System (MPS) 
is to transform performance at our sites around 
the world, day in, day out. New global standards 
of excellence will strengthen our core, creating  
a solid platform for growth and innovation. 
Individual improvements are sometimes small. 
Together, however, they will reshape our future. 
Singapore: outpacing the 
industry 
With a brand-new facility designed on 
Lean manufacturing principles, Meggitt 
Aerospace Asia Pacific (MAAP) already 
had very high standards of operational 
performance. In the seven months it took 
to implement the first stage of the MPS, 
however, standards rose even higher.
“We believe MPS is leading the industry,” 
says James Mariadass, Director of 
Operations & Continuous Improvement in 
Singapore. “And it looks like the industry 
does too: we won Silver in the ‘Singapore 
Aerospace Industry Excellence Award’ for 
outpacing the industry. Now we’re aiming 
for Gold next time round.”
Everyone accountable, every day 
Daily Layered Accountability is a key 
concept within the MPS. It starts with 
factory floor meetings that take place 
at the same time every day. Issues that 
cannot be solved by operators or 
supervisors are escalated same day to 
functional leaders, site leaders, general 
managers and even divisional presidents. 
Issues are visited daily through this 
process until they are solved.

n 2013 the main cause of internal scrap 
at Meggitt Control Systems’ Corona site 
was stator failure on a motor production 
line. About two a week were failing the 
final test, amounting to a loss of about 
US$50,000 a year.
A cross-functional team ran a root cause 
investigation using a range of MPS tools, 
revealing that shorting thermostats were 
a major cause of stator failure. Based on 
an idea from Judy Bunch, leader of the 
motor-winding cell, one of the engineers 
on the line solved the problem by 
pre-impregnating the thermostats.
Judy also observed that when the 
stators were fitted into the motor 
housing, the wires would occasionally 
get damaged and later short. Working 
with her, a manufacturing engineer 
developed a replica of the motor housing. 
Assemblers now check for clearance 
issues without damaging the wires prior 
to fitting. The failure rate has dropped 
to zero.
“These are typical examples of how more 
ideas are coming up from the floor,” says 
Site Operations Director, Garret Mertz. 
“With MPS, we start the day with a set of 
short, interlocking meetings which 
cascade information up and down the 
business, escalating problems and 
potential solutions so they get the 
attention they need.”
“It’s not ‘Get it done’ anymore,” says Judy. 
“It’s ‘How can we help you get it done’. 
That’s a huge difference.”
Switzerland: better planning 
means higher productivity, 
lower inventory
F
or the last 18 months, Helge 
Huerkamp, General Manager, Meggitt 
Sensing Systems Switzerland, has 
been using MPS to drive more accurate 
sales, inventory and operations planning. 
As well as driving efficiencies throughout 
the business cycle, the revamped process 
allows managers to simulate the impact of 
new business more accurately.
At the end of 2014, a key customer asked 
for 120 additional engine monitoring 
units, each one consisting of thousands  
of components. Running the data through 
a more reliable planning and simulation 
model highlighted potential bottlenecks. 
But just as important, because key people 
are now used to a more rigorous step-by-
step process of discussion, forecasting 
and sign-off, there’s a much more 
accurate picture of what new business 
can be taken on and when.
“That information is invaluable in 
customer discussions,” says Helge. 
“We know we can trust it and, of course, 
the customer picks up on that too. 
We were able to confirm this additional 
order, plus we’ve been able to ramp up 
production in other areas: productivity has 
increased by 8% over the last two years 
and inventory has improved by 10 days.”
Model planning:  
Helge Huerkamp, General 
Manager, Meggitt Sensing

has confidence in data 
run through MPS’s more 
reliable planning and 
simulation models.

93987_p18-23.indd   19 04/03/2015   16:33 To be the best in your field, you need the  
best people.
Our senior leadership programme ensures 
we have a strong global leadership team.
Our graduate programme attracts talent from 
the world’s top universities, adding cutting-edge 
technical knowledge to the Group today and 
engaging technology thinking for the longer term
We continue to broaden the range of training  
for all employees. A recent Meggitt Production 
System (MPS) initiative, for example, funnels 
expertise right through the business via 
a network of subject matter experts. 
Flying higher 
E
nsuring we have the right talent to 
lead the organisation today and 
tomorrow is a key priority. 
MPS continues to strengthen training at 
site level with leadership ‘standard work’ 
and a set of four competencies, such as 
leading by example and coaching. Daily, 
weekly and monthly, leaders are held 
accountable for ensuring their people  
are equipped to hit performance goals. 
We have also developed a bespoke 
executive leadership programme with 
Oxford University’s Saïd Business 
School. Taught by external experts 
from academia and business, the one-
year Oxford Leadership Programme 
focuses on strategy, operations and 
personal skills.
“Since 2008, it’s helped our brightest and 
best develop a greater understanding of 
Meggitt as a whole, helping them to 
develop systemic thinking beyond their 
functional areas,” explains Robin Young, 
Group Organisation & Development 
Director.
Participants attend three off-site 
intensives, carrying out assignments  
in between on live strategic issues. 
Participants develop their ideas in small 
teams, presenting recommendations  
and implementation plans to our 
Executive Board.
“Each year the programme brings 
together a peer group of very diverse 
talent, new joiners and old Meggitt hands. 
It’s a powerful networking tool,” says 
Young. The people who have taken the 
programme so far create the core of 
a strong global leadership team, with 
a shared sense of priorities and values. 
We gather round and help should the going 
get tough and we make sure everyone in 
our respective teams understands their 
role in the bigger picture.”
The next generation 
N
ow in its third year, the Meggitt 
Graduate Programme has a dual 
purpose; creating a group of 
future leaders in the key disciplines of 
engineering, operations and procurement; 
and bringing new insight into cutting-
edge technology from the world’s 
leading universities.
“A lot of research into areas such as 
additive layer manufacturing and 
nanotechnology is happening at places 
like Georgia Tech, Cal Tech and MIT,” says 
Chief Technology Officer, Keith Jackson. 
“The best graduates are ready to apply that 
knowledge to new and existing products.”
In his first assignment, Blaise Guélat, who 
has a PhD in microsystems, was part of the 
team who produced a prototype for a next 
generation inclinometer. It replaces 
electromechanical technology with a 
micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) 
sensor. In his second assignment, he is 
developing a new algorithm for secondary 
flight displays to improve attitude and 
heading accuracy. 
“It uses a statistical approach known 
as Kalman filtering to generate a more 
accurate estimate than you get with 
a single measurement,” explains Blaise. 
“And it’ll be able to use other data sources 
such as magnetic data and GPS when 
they come online.” 
Elsewhere, we have been working with 
local schools and universities to develop 
skills and create a pipeline of talent for 
tomorrow. In the UK, Meggitt sponsored 
Sheffield University’s Formula Student 
team. Thousands of young engineers 
from more than 100 universities all 
over the world compete to design and 
manufacture a single-seat racing car 
to run at Silverstone. 
“It gets our name as a top graduate choice 
out into the fast lane,” says Jackson, 
“And it helps us get a good look at talent 
from all over the world.”
Learn, teach, learn, teach—
the smart way to embed 
new knowledge
A
s part of the second phase of MPS 
implementation, subject matter 
experts in many of our sites around 
the world are training to become experts in 
one of 10 critical subjects, from statistical 
analysis to project leadership. Engineer 
Paul Thomson has spent this year becoming 
one of the first 2 problem-solving experts at 
Securaplane, our aircraft security and 
battery specialists in Tucson, Arizona.

93987_p18-23.indd   20 04/03/2015   16:33 “We started with offsite training in Six 
Sigma and presentation skills—you need 
to get people on your side when it comes to 
solving complex problems,” he says. “After 
that came two assignments designed to 
put what we’d learned into practice.” 
The first assignment focused on quality 
issues with an emergency lighting 
system. Some 30 possible issues were 
revealed, 80% of recommendations were 
implemented within two weeks and after 
one month, there was a 30% improvement 
in the First Pass Yield (FPY). FPY shows 
how well standard work is undertaken, 
minimising deviation from plans and 
the introduction of rework into our 
production processes. 
Paul is now passing on his learning in a 
train-the-trainer programme that will take 
all 180 people at the site up to the first tier of 
expertise in the subject by the end of 2015. 
“We start with around six people, they train 
up another four or five and on it goes.” 
Once the training is complete, Meggitt 
experts continuously develop their own 
understanding, sharing best practice 
and benchmarking across the sector 
in order to champion their subject 
within the business.

93987_p18-23.indd   21 04/03/2015   16:33 To continue leading the world in our chosen 
fields, we must become even better innovators. 
By empowering people at every level to drive 
change themselves, the Meggitt Production 
System (MPS) is improving the way we innovate, 
freeing up capital to reinvest in technology.
We are not only focusing on developing greater 
maturity in next generation technologies, we 
are looking at the advanced manufacturing 
capabilities needed to industrialise them. 
Factories of the future
Our focus on manufacturing high-value 
complex parts requires great expertise  
in assembling sub-components. That 
makes conventional automation difficult. 
But, as the volume, variety and complexity 
of these parts grows, we need to take 
performance optimisation up to the  
next level.
Our pioneering approach, known  
as Meggitt Modular Modifiable 
Manufacturing (M4), will do just that, 
giving operators the right tools, parts, 
and information at the right time so they 
can radically improve performance. At 
site level, it will enable us to reconfigure 
our factories in real time, adjusting plans 
to satisfy customer requirements and 
optimise inventory. 
In 2014, we started this journey in 
partnership with the UK’s Advanced 
Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC), 
creating a prototype workstation. Laser 
and video projected guides, plus sensor-
enabled smart assembly fixtures, allow 
operators to build a wider variety of 
products, faster and more accurately. 
Automatic cameras keep detailed records 
throughout, enhancing traceability, while 
capturing ideas for improvement.
Starting in 2015, we will develop the other 
technologies M4 requires in partnership 
with the AMRC, the Manufacturing 
Technology Centre (MTC) and a leading 
software provider. We have also attracted 
significant interest from Innovate UK,  
the UK’s innovation agency and Britain’s 
Aerospace Technology Institute.
“M4 will optimise factory performance by 
responding to changes at the micro level, 
such as late customer demand, and at the 
macro level, such as buying more efficient 
equipment,” says Steve Parker, Director 
of Engineering. “It supports investment in 
people and equipment by maximising our 
resources: advanced workstations 
enable individual operators to work 
on the widest range of products.” 
Although the full programme will 
take three years, M
4
 will initially run 
alongside existing factory operations, 
using a combination of simulated and 
actual environments. 
“We’re already looking at introducing 
findings from the scoping phase to some 
of our other facilities and that will continue 
throughout the programme,” says Parker. 
“M
4
 isn’t just a one-off improvement. 
It’s giving us the tools we need to drive 
improvements, year on year.” 
Lighter, quieter, more reliable 
and faster to manufacture
New manufacturing techniques are 
enabling us to improve existing product 
designs and create totally new ones. 
Take compressor bleed valves, for 
example. They’re used to prevent stalling 
by controlling engine pressure. High 
pressure air makes a huge amount of 
noise as it travels through the valve 
geometry that has been cast or machined 
in a traditional way. 
A team of Meggitt engineers on our Group 
graduate programme have used additive 
layer manufacturing (ALM) to create a 
radical new component design for our 
engine customers. 
The valve will significantly cut noise over 
residential areas surrounding major 
airports, an important regulatory 
requirement for almost all existing 
jet-engined planes. 
Scott Lathrope, Matt Scovell and David 
Skolnik, have led work on the new control 
valve concept which aims to be 25% 
lighter as well as quieter, more reliable 
and quicker to manufacture. 
“Air flows much more quietly around the 
kind of organic designs you can create 
with ALM,” explains Lathrope. “And our 
model is simpler to assemble as there are 
fewer parts. That means less potential 
error and an increase in reliability.”
Group Engineering and Strategy Director, 
Chris Allen says, “We hope to use 
optimisation techniques developed on  
this project to create a wide range 
of advanced components for next-
generation aero platforms, as well 
as products for the medical and 
energy sectors.”

Principal risks and uncertainties
Types of risk
We monitor risk across strategic, 
operational, business environment  
and financial categories.  
•	 Strategic  
Includes, for example, risk arising  
from making poor business decisions 
or sub-standard execution of 
business objectives.
•	 Operational  
Covers business processes and  
the technical, quality and project 
management or organisational risk 
associated with programmes. 
•	 Business environment  
Arises when external forces could 
significantly change the fundamentals 
driving our overall objectives 
and strategies. 
•	 Financial  
Encompasses key financial functions 
including the provision of adequate 
liquidity to meet our obligations and 
management of currency, interest rate, 
credit and other financial risks.  
Risk disclosure
In accordance with the Group’s enhanced 
risk management policy and process, we 
have evaluated our risk disclosure and 
focused this report on our most significant 
risks. General financial risks including 
foreign exchange and tax risks are not 
disclosed here but are described in the 
Chief Financial Officer’s review on 
pages 31 to 37. 
The risks outlined overleaf, which are not 
presented in order of priority, are those the 
Group believes are the principal ones it 
currently faces. However, additional risks, 
of which the Group is unaware, or risks the 
Group currently considers to be less 
significant, could have an adverse impact. 
The process requires each risk to have an 
individual owner who is responsible for 
regular review of that risk (and 
consideration of new risks in that area). 
Risk identification is embedded in other 
processes, for example project and 
programme management, bid approvals 
and other operational activities. 
After identification, each risk is reviewed 
at a site level and then aggregated and 
reviewed at divisional and functional level, 
and during the business review process. 
At the end of this process there is a detailed 
review and discussion of the Group Risk 
Register at the Executive Board. The Board 
of Directors review the output of this 
process. The senior executives also meet 
to discuss risks which may not have been 
identified through the normal channels.
Meggitt’s risk management framework includes  
a formal process for identifying, assessing and 
responding to risk, supporting the delivery of  
the Group’s strategy and business objectives. 
Risk management operates at all levels 
throughout Meggitt. However, the Board takes 
overall responsibility, determining the nature and 
extent of the principal risks it is willing to take in 
achieving Meggitt’s strategic objectives, and 
maintaining the Group’s risk governance structure 
and an appropriate internal control framework. 
Willis Risk Advisory Services, supported by Alvarez 
& Marsal, have been assisting in the implementation 
of the Group’s risk management framework.   
During 2013, the Board approved an updated Risk 
Management Policy, a Group risk management 
strategy and updated formats for regular Board 
reports and the Group Risk Register. This was 
supported by process and guidance documentation 
detailing the revised Group-wide framework.   
These processes were in place throughout 2014.
During 2014, we enhanced our risk management 
process further. The Board approved a Group risk 
appetite statement and related financial risk 
tolerances to ensure that identified risks are 
managed within acceptable limits. These risk 
tolerance levels are flowed down to divisional and 
functional levels for incorporation in the process 
described below. We started a risk maturity exercise 
to capture the improvements which had been made 
to the Group’s risk management culture following 
the implementation of the new processes.

93987_p24-26.indd   26 04/03/2015   16:36 The Group uses a mix of financial and non-financial key 
performance indicators (KPIs) to measure execution against its 
strategic objectives. To ensure we deliver value to our 
shareholders over the cycle, financial KPIs balance short-term 
measures (underlying profit before tax and free cash flow in the 
year) with longer-term measures (organic revenue growth, 
return on trading assets and underlying EPS growth). Non-
financial KPIs focus on investment in R&D to drive future 
revenues, the health and safety of our employees and raising 
standards of operational performance to satisfy our customers. 
There have been no changes to the KPIs used in the year or to 
how they are calculated.

Strategic objectives  
  
Organic revenue growth Definition and basis of calculation 
Revenue growth calculated by measuring current and prior year revenue at constant 
currency, excluding revenue from any businesses acquired or disposed of in those 
periods. To measure revenue at constant currency, current year revenue is restated 
using translation and transaction exchange rates prevailing in the prior year. 
See page 32 for a reconciliation of organic revenue to statutory revenue. 
Target 
Low to mid-single digit in 2015. 6 to 7% over the medium term.
Result 
2014: 0.0% (2013: 1.4%). Average achieved over last five years: 3.6%. Average achieved 
over four years since target was set: 4.8%. See page 31 for details.
Directors’ incentive plans 
Organic revenue growth is a performance measure for the 2014 and 2015 Long Term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP). See pages 68 and 71 for details.
  
Underlying PBT Definition and basis of calculation 
Underlying PBT is reconciled to statutory measures in note 10 of the Group 
consolidated financial statements on page 103. 
Target 
We do not publish profit targets. 
Result 
2014: £328.7 million (2013: £377.8 million). See page 32 for details.
Directors’ incentive plans 
Underlying PBT is a performance measure in the 2014 Short Term Incentive Plan 
(STIP). For the purpose of this plan, underlying PBT is measured at constant currency. 
See page 66 for details. Underlying operating profit is the new profit measure to be 
used in the 2015 STIP, for the reasons described on page 71. In 2015, the Group will 
therefore replace the existing KPI based on underlying PBT with one based on 
underlying operating profit.

Return on trading assets Definition and basis of calculation
Underlying operating profit after tax expressed as a percentage of average trading 
assets. Underlying operating profit is defined and reconciled to statutory measures 
in note 10 of the Group consolidated financial statements on page 103. Underlying 
operating profit after tax applies the Group’s underlying tax rate to underlying 
operating profit.
Trading assets are defined as net assets adjusted to exclude goodwill, other intangible 
assets arising on the acquisition of businesses, net debt, share buyback commitment, 
retirement benefit obligations, derivative financial instruments and deferred tax. 
Average trading assets are calculated as the average of trading assets at the start 
and end of the year. 
Return on trading assets measures performance by linking operating performance 
to the amount of operating capital deployed.
Target
Target is to achieve an average return on trading assets of 25.4% over the next three 
years. The target has been reduced from that set in prior years, recognising the need 
to continue to invest in trading assets during this elevated investment period in the 
aerospace cycle. 
Result
2014: 26.5% (2013: 36.0%). Average achieved over last five years: 35.6%. See page 32 
for details of the Group’s operating profit performance in the year. See page 34 for 
details of the current high levels of investment to support future growth.
Directors’ incentive plans
Return on trading assets is a performance measure for the 2014 and 2015 LTIP. For the 
purpose of these plans, underlying operating profit after tax and trading assets are 
measured at constant currency. See pages 68 and 71 for details. 
  
Underlying EPS growth Definition and basis of calculation
The percentage change in underlying earnings per share (EPS) from the previous year. 
Underlying EPS is reconciled to statutory measures in note 15 of the Group 
consolidated financial statements on page 106. 
Target
We do not publish profit targets. However, the proposed 2015 LTIP includes EPS targets 
equivalent to growth ranging from 5.5 to 10.0% per annum over the next three years.
Result
2014: -13.6% (2013: 2.7%). Average achieved over last five years: 4.7%. See page 34  
for details. 
Directors’ incentive plans
Underlying EPS is a performance measure for the 2014 and 2015 LTIP. For the purpose 
of these plans, underlying EPS is adjusted to exclude the impact of any scrip dividends. 
See pages 68 and 71 for details.

Free cash flow Definition and basis of calculation 
Cash generated excluding amounts in respect of acquisition of businesses, disposal 
of businesses and paid to shareholders. See page 35 for a reconciliation of free cash 
flow to statutory measures.
Target 
We do not publish free cash flow targets. 
Result 
2014: £146.8 million (2013: £110.4 million). See page 35 for details.
Directors’ incentive plans 
Free cash flow is a performance measure in the 2014 and 2015 STIP. For the purpose of 
these plans, actual and target free cash flow figures are measured at constant currency. 
See pages 66 and 71 for details. 
  
R&D investment Definition and basis of calculation 
Investment in research and development (R&D) expressed as a percentage of revenue. 
Investment is measured as total expenditure in the year and is not adjusted for 
amounts capitalised or amortised. Investment is measured gross of funding 
received from customers. 
Target 
Investment of 6 to 8% per annum. This range reflects typical investment fluctuation 
within the industry cycle.
Result 
2014: 9.5% (2013: 8.2%). Average achieved over last five years: 8.0%. See page 34  
for details.
Directors’ incentive plans 
R&D investment is not a specific measure used in directors’ incentive plans. 
However, the 2014 and 2015 LTIP include measures focused on delivery of R&D 
programmes. See pages 68 and 71 for details.
  
Accident/incident rate Definition and basis of calculation
The number of injuries reportable under local laws and regulations multiplied 
by 100,000 and then divided by the average employee headcount during the year. 
Target
Year-on-year improvement with an ultimate goal of nil. 
Result
2014: 337 (2013: 317). See page 40 for details.
Directors’ incentive plans
Health and safety performance is included in the personal objectives of the 
Chief Executive.

Reduction in defective  
parts per million (DPPM)
Definition and basis of calculation
Defective parts per million (DPPM) for the year expressed as a percentage 
improvement from that achieved at 31 December 2011, the date at which the Meggitt 
Production System introduced this consistent method of measurement. DPPM is 
defined as the number of defective parts returned by customers in the year multiplied 
by 1,000,000 and then divided by the total number of parts delivered. 
Figures include the results of disposed businesses up to the date of sale and include 
the results of acquired businesses from the later of the start of the financial year 
following acquisition and the date the information is first available.
This KPI monitors the success of the Meggitt Production System.
Target
To achieve the levels of performance excellence (e.g. sometimes referred to as 
‘Supplier Gold’) expected by our customers. We use simple on-time delivery and 
DPPM measures, aggregated at a Group level, to track overall progress towards these 
objectives. Given the complexity and variety of customer metrics, driven by the large 
number of customers we serve, we also track performance as reported by our 
customers through their own supplier scorecards.
Result
Cumulative improvement since 31 December 2011: 84% (2013: 54%). See page 34  
for details. 
Directors’ incentive plans
DPPM is a performance measure for the 2014 and 2015 LTIP. For the purpose of these 
plans, it is measured by reference to the number of sites achieving individual targeted 
reductions in DPPM. See pages 68 and 71 for details. 
    
On-time delivery  
improvement
Definition and basis of calculation
Average on-time delivery achieved in the year expressed as a percentage improvement 
from that achieved at 31 December 2011, the date at which the Meggitt Production 
System introduced this consistent method of measurement. Calculated as the 
12-month average of the number of parts delivered on delivery dates agreed with 
customers, divided by the total number of parts delivered. 
Figures include the results of disposed businesses up to the date of sale and include 
the results of acquired businesses from the later of the start of the financial year 
following acquisition and the date the information is first available.
This KPI monitors the success of the Meggitt Production System.

Overall performance
Good growth in civil aerospace original equipment (OE) 
and the accelerating recovery in civil aftermarket (AM) 
was tempered by softness in military and energy 
markets. Organic revenue was flat, and underlying profit 
before tax decreased by 11% resulting in a 14% decrease 
in underlying EPS to 32.4 pence. However, with a strong 
order book and 3% organic revenue growth in the second 
half of the year, there is good momentum going into 2015.

Chief Financial Officer’s review
Revenue 
Reported revenue declined by 5% 
to £1,553.7 million. Table 2 details the 
revenue performance by end market. 
As expected, currency and disposals had 
a significant adverse impact on revenue. 
Currency movements, reflecting the 
strength of Sterling against the Group’s 
major operating currencies of US Dollar, 
Swiss Franc and Euro, contributed  
£57 million, or 3% to the decline, of  
which £43 million is attributable to 
Sterling/US Dollar. Net disposals 
represented an additional net headwind of 
£26 million, primarily reflecting the 2013 
disposals of the Addison and Sunbank 
businesses. Good organic growth in 
civil in 2014 was offset by declines in 
military and energy, resulting in a flat 
overall organic revenue performance. 
Encouragingly, the trajectory within the 
year was positive with second half organic 
revenue growth of 3%.
Total civil aerospace revenues grew 
6% on an organic basis. Large jet OE, 
the most significant driver of our OE 
revenues, grew 7% driven principally 
by the 787 ramp-up and some initial 
A350XWB revenues, with regional aircraft 
up 10% and business jets up 4%. The 
aftermarket recovery seen in the latter 
half of 2013 continued through 2014, 
although we still experienced significant 
monthly variations. Nevertheless, 
the trend was positive with total civil 
aftermarket growing 5% organically for 
the full year and 7% in the second half. 
Business jets were the most significant 
contributor to the overall aftermarket 
performance, delivering growth of 13% 
for the year, while large jet grew 3% and 
regional aircraft grew 4%. The parting out 
of older aircraft continued, fuelled by the 
increased retirement rate in recent years, 
although quantification of the impact is 
difficult. Aftermarket order intake was 
positive, with orders for the year up  
13% on an organic basis and a book 
to bill of 1.08.
Military revenues declined by 7% on an 
organic basis, with a substantial decline 
in the first half of the year contrasting 
with a flat performance in the second 
half. The full-year decline was in part due 
to the previously announced wind-down 
of two retrofit programmes in the first 
half of 2013, with the remainder driven 
by the larger than expected impact of 
the drawdown in Afghanistan on 
military spares sales.
93987_p31-37.indd   31 04/03/2015   16:38 Chief Financial Officer’s review continued
32 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
Energy revenue declined by 3% on an 
organic basis. The tourmaline shortage 
impacted growth in our condition 
monitoring business for the majority of 
the year, although the situation is now 
resolved and we expect a return to growth 
in 2015. Heatric, our printed circuit heat 
exchanger business, saw a modest 
revenue decline largely due to the 
financial difficulties being experienced by 
our local content provider in Brazil which 
resulted in the deferral of revenue from 
2014. We continue to anticipate headwinds 
in this business in the short term, largely 
driven by the decline in the oil price which 
is causing a number of our customers to 
delay capital expenditure on new gas 
projects. Some contracts we expected to 
be awarded in 2015 have been deferred for 
a year, and it is possible that we will see 
further deferrals in the near future, 
though we have not seen any 
project cancellations.
Meggitt’s other specialist markets saw 
organic growth of 5%, with growth in 
medical and automotive products 
offsetting weakness in the test and 
measurement market.

Profit 
The Board’s preferred measure of the 
Group’s trading performance is 
underlying profit. Underlying operating 
profit for the year was £346.0 million 
(2013: £397.2 million), representing a 
margin of 22.3% (2013: 24.3%). The 
principal drivers included adverse mix, 
with OE growth outpacing that of 
aftermarket in both civil and military 
markets, combined with a further 
increase in investment in research  
and development and new product 
introduction and the previously  
disclosed lower profitability on legacy 
contracts, partially offset by operational 
improvements and a one-time benefit  
of a new arrangement for our US retiree 
healthcare provision. We also took  
a £6 million provision against our 
investment on the Learjet 85 following 
Bombardier’s announcement in 
January 2015 that they were pausing 
the development programme.
Underlying net finance costs decreased 
to £17.3 million (2013: £19.4 million) as 
a result of lower average debt and lower 
interest rates following the repayment 
of $180 million of US private placement 
debt in June 2013, partly offset by 
a non-recurring £1.8 million charge 
relating to the cost of refinancing the 
Group’s debt in September.
Underlying profit before tax was  
£328.7 million (2013: £377.8 million).
The underlying tax rate was 21% (2013: 
21%), lower than our forecast 22% due to 
a change in the geographical mix of profit 
delivery. Underlying earnings per share 
was 32.4 pence (2013: 37.5 pence).
On a statutory basis, profit before tax was 
£208.9 million (2013: £269.4 million), with 
the year-on-year decline driven by the fall 
in underlying operating profit and the 
marking to market of forward currency 
contracts. Earnings per share was  
22.0 pence (2013: 29.4 pence).
Operational performance
Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems (MABS) 
provides wheels, brakes and brake control 
systems for over 34,000 in-service aircraft. 
It continues to develop innovative technology 
for new programmes allowing the business 
to retain its leading position in its target 
markets, underscored by the recent 
programme awards on the Dassault Falcon 
8X business jet and Gulfstream 500/600 
family of aircraft. The division targets 
sole-source programmes and is particularly 
strong in regional aircraft, large business 
jets and military aircraft. The division 
represents 21% of Group revenue, 
generating 86% of its revenue from the 
aftermarket and 14% from OE sales.
MABS’ revenue grew by 3% on an organic 
basis, with growth in civil aftermarket and 
military. Regional aftermarket grew 4% 
driven by increases in fleet size and 
utilisation, and business jet aftermarket 
grew by 7%. These were partially offset by 
a 9% decline in large jet aftermarket. Total 
military revenue grew 8% with aftermarket 
benefiting from upgrade contracts for the 
US B1-B fleet and the Taiwanese Air Force 
which were completed at the end of the 
year. Operating margins grew from 37.0% 
to 39.0%, benefiting from positive mix and 
operating efficiencies.
Meggitt Control Systems (MCS) designs 
and manufactures products which manage 
the flow of liquids and gases around aero 
and industrial turbines, and control the 
temperature of oil, fuel and air in aircraft 
engines. The division, which also provides 
fire protection equipment to engines and 
airframes, represents 22% of Group 
revenue, generating 46% of its revenue from 
OE and 54% from the aftermarket. 
For MCS, revenue was up 1% on an organic 
basis, with 7% growth in civil aerospace, 
spread across both OE and aftermarket, 
being partly offset by an 11% decline in 
military, primarily aftermarket. The most 
significant contributor to the military 
performance was a marked reduction in 
military spares, largely related to the 
drawdown from Afghanistan. Unfavourable 
mix within military, the provision against our 
investment in the Learjet 85 programme 
and increased costs related to new product 
introduction saw operating margins 
decrease from 29.6% to 26.3%. PECC will  
be reported as part of MCS in 2015.
93987_p31-37.indd   32 04/03/2015   16:38 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE REPORTS STRATEGIC REPORT 33
Meggitt Polymers & Composites (MPC) 
has a bias towards military, representing 
54% of its revenue. It supplies flexible 
bladder fuel tanks, ice protection 
products and composite assemblies for 
a range of fixed wing and rotorcraft 
platforms and complex seals packages 
for civil and military platforms. These 
products are linked by their dependence 
on similar materials technology and 
manufacturing processes. It supplies 
over 80% of the US military requirements 
for fuel bladders and ballistically-
resistant and crashworthy fuel tanks. 
MPC represents 11% of Group revenue 
and generated 55% of its revenue from 
OE and 45% from the aftermarket. 
MPC revenue declined by 7% on an 
organic basis, largely reflecting the 
impact of the Bradley and KC135 retrofit 
programmes completed in 2013. Overall 
military revenue reduced by 17%, partially 
offset by growth in civil aerospace of 9%. 
Operating margins declined from 16.7% 
to 12.4% due to lower volumes in the fuel 
bladder facility and high levels of up-front 
new product introduction costs ahead of 
production ramp-up on upcoming aircraft 
programmes over the next few years.
Meggitt Sensing Systems (MSS) designs 
and manufactures highly engineered 
sensors to measure a variety of 
parameters such as vibration, 
temperature, pressure, fluid level and 
flow as well as power storage, conversion 
and distribution systems for aerospace 
applications. Its products are designed 
to operate effectively in the extreme 
conditions of temperature, vibration and 
contamination that exist in an aircraft or 
ground-based turbine engine. Sensors 
are combined into broader electronics 
packages, providing condition data to 
operators and maintainers of engines, 
contributing to improved safety and lower 
operating costs. MSS has migrated these 
products into other specialist markets 
requiring similar capabilities, such as test 
and measurement, automotive crash test 
and medical. Combining its capabilities 
with MABS, it is currently developing a 
number of civil aerospace tyre pressure 
monitoring systems, having secured 
positions for this technology on 10 aircraft 
platforms. MSS represents 26% of Group 
revenue and generated 81% of its revenue 
from OE and 19% from the aftermarket. 
MSS revenue grew 4% on an organic 
basis, with 8% growth in civil offsetting 
a 6% decline in military, largely 
aftermarket, and a 3% decline in energy. 
The military decline reflected the 
Afghanistan drawdown and disruption 
linked to the US site consolidation in 2013, 
as well as the shortage of tourmaline 
which impacted both military and energy 
growth. Operating margins decreased 
from 17.6% to 14.7% reflecting adverse 
mix in the lower margin civil OE revenue 
stream and additional costs incurred as 
a result of the tourmaline shortage, 
offset by the renegotiation of a loss-
making contract against which provision 
had previously been held. Operating 
margin in  the second half showed good 
improvement versus the first half.
Meggitt Equipment Group (MEG) 
comprises principally our avionics, 
non-engine actuation, dedicated military 
and Heatric businesses. The division 
represents 20% of Group revenue and 
generates 81% of its revenue from OE and 
19% from the aftermarket. With effect 
from 1 January 2015, Meggitt Avionics 
will be reported as part of Meggitt 
Sensing Systems.
Revenue in MEG declined by 3% on an 
organic basis. Good growth in civil, 
largely avionics, was more than offset by 
a modest decline in Heatric revenue and 
strong comparators in our training 
business. Operating margins decreased 
from 18.4% to 15.1% driven by lower 
volumes, adverse mix and the provision 
against our investment in the Learjet 85 
programme, in addition to the previously 
disclosed investment in the Heatric 
business for future growth and lower 
profitability on three contracts.
Taxation
Meggitt’s underlying tax rate remained at 
21% (2013: 21%), lower than our forecast 
22% due to a change in the mix of profit 
delivery. Our medium-term guidance is 
unchanged at 22%, based on our current 
business mix and barring any material 
changes in the tax legislation in the main 
countries in which we operate. Cash tax 
paid as a percentage of underlying profit 
was 6% (2013: 12%). The rate of cash tax 
paid is typically lower than our underlying 
tax rate due to tax deductible items which 
do not affect underlying profit, including 
goodwill amortisation and tax relief on 
retirement benefit deficit reduction 
payments. It is lower than normal in 
2014 due to excess payments on account 
in prior years. 
Our statutory tax rate, which includes 
items reported below underlying profit 
before tax, was 15% (2013: 14%). Cash tax 
paid as a percentage of statutory profit 
was 9% (2013: 16%) and is lower than 
normal for 2014 for the reasons 
described above.
The Group is committed to complying 
fully with the laws in the countries in 
which it operates. It seeks to achieve 
a competitive tax rate by maintaining 
appropriate levels of debt in high tax 
jurisdictions, claiming available tax 
credits and incentives and utilising 
common financing structures where 
appropriate. We are rated as low risk 
by HM Revenue and Customs. As for all 
companies, the Group is exposed to 
changing tax legislation in the territories 
in which we operate, including as an 
international business changes that may 
arise due to local legislation arising from 
the OECD’s current Base Erosion and 
Operational performance (Table 4)

34 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
Profit Shifting project. We manage  
these risks by monitoring international 
developments, participating in  
pre-legislative consultations where 
appropriate and adapting our approach 
where necessary and practical. 
Earnings per share (EPS)
Underlying EPS declined by 14% to  
32.4 pence (2013: 37.5 pence). An increase 
in shares in issue, which includes the 51% 
take up of scrip dividend on 2014 dividend 
payments, resulted in the EPS reduction 
being slightly greater than the reduction  
in underlying profit before tax. 
The timing of the commencement of the 
share buyback programme in November 
2014 meant it had no significant impact on 
reported underlying EPS this year but the 
programme will be accretive in 2015 as 
the issued share capital reduces. 
In 2015, the scrip dividend plan will be 
replaced by a dividend reinvestment plan. 
The dividend reinvestment plan provides 
an efficient reinvestment option for 
shareholders, without the need for 
new shares to be issued.
Statutory EPS declined by 25% to  
22.0 pence (2013: 29.4 pence). The decline 
is higher than in statutory profit before  
tax due to the increase in statutory tax 
rate and the higher issued share capital. 
Dividends
The Board has recommended a final 
dividend of 9.50 pence (2013: 8.80 pence) 
which would result in an 8% increase in 
the full-year dividend to 13.75 pence  
(2013: 12.75 pence).
The Company has a balance on its profit 
and loss reserve at 31 December 2014 of 
£1.2 billion, the substantial majority of 
which relates to reserves which can be 
distributed as a dividend or used for share 
buybacks, and accordingly we have a 
comfortable level of headroom. We are 
monitoring the FRC’s Financial Reporting 
Lab project on dividend policy and 
capacity and will consider their final 
recommendations on future disclosures 
in this area.
Investing for the future
Targeted investment in technology 
development remains critical to our 
long-term organic growth. Total R&D 
expenditure in 2014 of £148.3 million was 
9.5% of revenues (2013: £134.9 million, 
8.2%), of which 19% (2013: 18%) was 
funded by customers. The net charge to 
operating costs including amortisation 
and impairment increased by 5% on  
an organic basis to £58.5 million  
(2013: £57.1 million).
Growth in R&D largely reflects our 
impressive win rate on new programmes, 
as well as our ongoing investment in new 
technology aligned to our customers’ 
future technology requirements. About 
30% of the expenditure was on new 
wheels and brakes programmes and over 
50% focused on products for engines and 
engine accessories, including working 
towards meeting the long-term 
requirement of the aerospace industry to 
eliminate the use of halon gas in on-board 
fire protection systems. The balance was 
spread across a range of civil, military and 
energy applications including the initial 
investment resulting from the strong 
order intake in the period, notably in 
military training. This investment in R&D 
supports our medium-term revenue 
growth assumptions and increases 
revenue security, particularly as the 
majority of the investment is on platforms 
where we have won sole-source positions. 
The record number of programmes 
entering service in the next few years will 
also drive new product introduction costs 
higher. In 2014 we industrialised new 
products at three times our historical 
average rate, which is good for future 
revenues but which impacts profitability 
in the short term.
Our investment in programme 
participation costs including the supply of 
equipment free of charge to new aircraft, 
mostly in MABS, increased by 33% 
organically. The pace of deliveries on 
programmes equipped with our wheels 
and brakes including the Gulfstream 280 
and 650 platforms is expected to grow 
further over the medium term. These 
programmes will drive aftermarket 
revenue for decades. Our market share of 
wheels and brakes on the fleet of super-
mid size and large business jets in 2014 
was 64%, supportive of our expectation 
that we will have a market share on the 
overall fleet in excess of 70% by 2020.
Capital expenditure on property, plant and 
equipment and intangible assets was 
£42.2 million (2013: £66.9 million), with 
2013 expenditure inflated by site 
consolidations and expansions. We expect 
growth in expenditure in 2015 driven by 
increased investment in manufacturing 
equipment, including new carbon furnaces 
in MABS and further movement 
of production to low-cost 
manufacturing locations.

Driving organic growth through 
operational excellence
The Meggitt Production System (MPS), 
our single, global approach to continuous 
improvement, was launched during 2013. 
MPS will create the sustainable quality and 
delivery culture that confers competitive 
advantage beyond our technical expertise, 
enabling the Group to deliver a higher rate 
of organic growth over the long term. It 
will also enable us to become more cost 
competitive through the reduction of 
working capital and the elimination of the 
cost of poor quality. MPS, a six-phase 
programme which will take five to seven 
years to become fully embedded, has been 
launched at 29 sites in total, representing 
71% of our manufacturing footprint, with 
sixteen sites having successfully exited the 
first phase and one site having exited the 
second, more demanding phase. The 
launch of the programme at the remainder 
of the Group’s primary facilities will be 
complete by the end of 2015. 
We have already seen some significant 
improvements in quality and delivery 
since inception, with defective parts per 
million down 84% and on-time delivery up 
by 10%. The quality performance in the 
year improved significantly, and the stable 
year-on-year on-time delivery metric 
reflects good underlying performance in 
reducing production arrears. Given the 
demonstrable success we have seen 
internally, we have accelerated the 
planned deployment of the key tools and 
competencies to long-term partners in 
our supply chain.
Our culture of continuous improvement 
has resulted in the expansion of our 
footprint in low-cost manufacturing 
locations, notably a 30% increase in 
activity in our Mexican operations and an 
8% increase in our Chinese facility in 2014. 
93987_p31-37.indd   34 04/03/2015   16:38 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE REPORTS STRATEGIC REPORT 35
These activities will drive consistently 
high levels of quality and delivery 
performance across all of our 
businesses, while retaining our focus on 
cost control. In turn, this will help us fund 
future technology development 
programmes and respond to changing 
customer requirements.
Cash flow and borrowings
Free cash flow of £146.8 million (2013: 
£110.4 million) represents a substantial 
year-on-year improvement despite the 
reduction in profit and continued high 
levels of investment to support future 
growth. This was driven by better working 
capital management and lower tax 
payments reflecting the unwinding 
of excess payments on account in 
prior years. 
Net cash flow reduced to £21.1 million 
(2013: £63.2 million), largely driven by the 
£28.3 million acquisition of Precision 
Engine Controls Corporation (PECC) and a 
£33.7 million outflow (2013: Nil) from the 
purchase of shares as part of the share 
buyback programme implemented in 
November 2014. Dividend payments for 
the year reduced to £51.4 million (2013: 
£75.6 million) as a result of higher 
take-up of the scrip dividend. The scrip 
dividend option has been replaced by 
a dividend reinvestment plan for future 
dividend payments. 
Debt structure and financing
The Group’s borrowings comprise a 
combination of US private placement debt 
and syndicated bank credit facilities. 
During the year, the Group took the 
opportunity to refinance its bank 
facilities, agreeing a new USD900 million 
committed revolving credit facility, from 
13 international banks. 
The new facility has a five year term with 
one-year extension options at the end of 
the first and second years. It replaces 
existing facilities of USD700 million and 
USD400 million which were due to expire 
in 2016 and 2017 respectively. The early 
refinancing resulted in £1.8 million 
accelerated amortisation of debt issue 
costs, relating to the old facilities, being 
recorded within finance costs in 2014.
The terms of the new facility are 
substantially unchanged from those which 
it replaced, except for a relaxation of the 
net debt/EBITDA covenant to allow it to 
rise to 4.0x for two six month reporting 
periods after a significant acquisition. 
There were no other changes in facilities 
available to the Group in the year. 
At 31 December, 2014, the Group had 
undrawn committed credit facilities of 
£431 million after taking account of 
surplus cash (2013: £504 million). 
With the exception of USD70 million 
private placement notes, which mature  
in June 2015 and will be repaid out of 
existing facilities, the Group has no 
committed facilities which expire  
before 2017.

Share buyback programme
The Group has a strong track record of 
cash generation and net debt reduction, 
even in periods of the aerospace cycle, as 
we are currently experiencing, that drive 
elevated organic investment. In addition 
to supporting our regular dividend, we 
seek to deploy this cash by investing in 
the acquisition of complementary 
businesses that will enhance our offering 
to customers, accelerate the Group’s 
growth and deliver good returns to 
shareholders. 
Whilst we continue to actively evaluate 
acquisition opportunities, there is 
currently a relative lack of sizeable 
acquisition opportunities meeting our 
strict investment criteria. 
The Board believes that in maintaining an 
efficient balance sheet, a net debt/
EBITDA ratio of between 1.5x and 2.5x is 
appropriate, whilst retaining the flexibility 
to move outside the range if appropriate. 
The Group had a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 
1.3x at 30 June 2014 and accordingly in 
November 2014, announced the 
introduction of a share buyback 
programme with the intention of 
delivering a net debt/EBITDA ratio at, or 
slightly above, 1.5x (as measured under 
the Group’s committed credit facilities) by 
the end of 2015. A share buyback 
programme was chosen as the most 
appropriate way to return excess capital 
to shareholders because the Board wish 
to retain flexibility to evaluate future 
organic growth and acquisition 
opportunities.
At 31 December 2014, the Group had 
purchased 6.8 million shares at an 
average share price of 490.49 pence  
and a cost of £33.7 million under the 
buyback programme. The programme 
has continued in 2015 with a further  
2.9 million shares purchased at an 
average share price of 522.64 pence  
and a cost of £15.2 million as at  
13 February 2015. These shares  
have all been cancelled.
Debt financing risks
The Group seeks to minimise debt 
financing risk as follows:

36 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
a.  Concentration of risk
We raise funds through private 
placement issuances and committed 
bank facilities to reduce reliance on any 
one market. Bank financing is sourced 
from 13 international institutions spread 
across North America, Europe and Asia. 
No single bank accounts for more than 6% 
of the Group’s total credit facilities and 
the credit rating of lenders is monitored 
by our treasury department. Our largest 
lenders are Bank of America, Bank of 
China, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Crédit 
Industriel et Commercial, HSBC,  
JP Morgan, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and 
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. 
We seek to maintain at least £200 million 
of undrawn committed facilities, net of 
cash, as a buffer.
b.  Set-off arrangements
The Group utilises set-off and netting 
arrangements where possible to reduce 
the potential effect of counterparty 
defaults. All treasury transactions are 
settled on a net basis where possible and 
surplus cash is generally deposited with 
our lenders up to the level of their 
current exposure to us.
c.  Refinancing risk
We seek to ensure the maturity of our 
facilities is staggered and any refinancing 
is concluded in good time, typically more 
than 12 months before expiry.
d.  Currency risk
To ensure we mitigate headroom erosion 
due to currency movements our credit 
facilities are denominated in US Dollars, 
the currency in which most of our 
borrowings are held.

Other (7.0) (9.9)
Net debt 575.5 564.6
 
e.  Covenant risk 
Our committed credit facilities contain 
two financial ratio covenants—interest 
cover and net debt to EBITDA. The 
covenant calculations are drafted to 
protect us from potential volatility caused 
by accounting standard changes, sudden 
movements in exchange rates and 
exceptional items. This is achieved by 
measuring EBITDA on a frozen GAAP 
basis, retranslating net debt and EBITDA 
at similar average exchange rates for the 
year and excluding exceptional items from 
the definition of EBITDA. We continue to 
have considerable headroom on both key 
financial covenant measures.

Net debt/EBITDA ≤3.5x

1.2x 1.2x
Interest cover ≥3.0x 20.8x 22.0x
1  
A ratio of 4.0x applies in the two six month reporting 
periods following a significant acquisition.
Interest risk
The Group seeks to reduce the volatility 
caused by interest rate fluctuations on net 
debt. Our US private placements are 
subject to fixed interest rates, whereas 
borrowings under our syndicated bank 
credit facilities are at floating rates. To 
manage interest rate volatility, we use 
interest rate derivatives to either convert 
floating rate interest into fixed rate or vice 
versa. Our policy is to maintain at least 
25% of net debt at fixed rates with a 
weighted average maturity of two years  
or more. At 31 December 2014, the 
percentage of net debt at fixed rates was 
48% (2013: 46%) and the weighted 
average period to maturity of the first 
25% was 4.5 years (2013: 5.4 years). 
Foreign exchange risk
The Group is exposed to both translation 
and transaction risk due to changes in 
foreign exchange rates. These risks 
principally relate to the US Dollar/
Sterling rate, although exposure also 
exists in relation to other currency pairs 
including translation risk for the Sterling/
Euro and Sterling/Swiss Franc and 
transaction risk for the US Dollar/Euro 
and US Dollar/Swiss Franc.

The results of overseas businesses are 
translated into Sterling at weighted 
average exchange rates. Compared to 
2013, the Group’s underlying profit before 
tax for the year was adversely affected by 
£9.6 million from currency translation, of 
which £7.8 million arose on US Dollar 
denominated profits with the balance on 
other currencies.

 As measured against the 2014 average translation 
rates against Sterling set out in Table 10.
The net assets of overseas businesses 
are translated into Sterling at year end 
exchange rates. The resultant exchange 
rate exposure is mitigated through holding 
our net debt in the currencies of those net 
assets, principally the US Dollar.
Transaction risk arises where revenues 
and/or costs of our businesses are 
denominated in a currency other than 
their own. We hedge known and some 
anticipated transaction currency 
exposures based on historical experience 
and projections. Our policy is to hedge 
at least 70% of the next 12 months’ 
anticipated exposure and to permit the 
placing of cover up to five years ahead. 
Compared to 2013, the Group’s underlying 
profit before tax for the year benefited by 
£4.5 million from currency transaction 
movements, including a favourable 
impact of £5.6 million relating to US 
Dollar/Sterling exposure and adverse 
impacts from other currency pairs. 
Each ten cent movement in the US Dollar 
against the average hedge rates achieved 
in 2014, would affect underlying profit 
before tax by approximately £8.0 million 
in respect of US Dollar/Sterling exposure, 
£3.0 million in respect of US Dollar/Euro 
exposure and £4.0 million in respect of  
US Dollar/Swiss Franc exposure.
At 31 December 2014, US Dollar/Sterling 
cover for our estimated 2015 exposure is 
96% hedged at an average rate of $1.57 
and we have covered approximately 80% 
of our exposure for the four subsequent 
years at an average rate of $1.54. We have 
93987_p31-37.indd   36 04/03/2015   16:38 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE REPORTS STRATEGIC REPORT 37
also hedged 96% of our estimated 2015  
US Dollar/Euro exposure at a rate of 1.36 
and 100% of our estimated 2015 US Dollar/
Swiss Franc exposure at a rate of 1.08. 
Further hedging of approximately 80% of 
our US Dollar/Euro exposure for the four 
subsequent years is in place at an average 
rate of 1.21. We do not have any hedging 
in place for 2016 or subsequent years 
in respect of US Dollar/Swiss 
Franc exposure. 
Post-retirement benefit schemes
The Group’s principal defined benefit 
pension schemes are in the UK and US 
and are closed to new members. 
Total pension scheme deficits increased 
to £271.0 million (2013: £189.8 million). 
The main drivers of the movement were:
•	 An increase in the deficit of  
£124.6 million (2013: Reduction of  
£10.6 million) due to remeasurement 
losses on scheme liabilities. The main 
cause of the increase was a significant 
reduction in the rates used to discount 
scheme liabilities. Accounting 
standards require these liabilities to be 
discounted using the yields on high 
quality AA corporate bonds, with a 
maturity that reflects the duration of 
the scheme liabilities. These yields, 
reflecting the falls seen in gilt 
markets, have reduced in 2014 by 100 
basis points in the UK and 70 basis 
points in the US to levels not seen in 
the last 10 years. There has also been 
a modest increase in US liabilities 
following the adoption of new life 
expectancy tables which were 
published during the year. 
•	 A reduction in the deficit of  
£30.9 million (2013: £25.5 million)  
due to remeasurement gains on 
scheme assets, principally driven  
by the continued global recovery in 
equity markets.
•	 Net deficit reduction payments of  
£27.8 million (2013: £26.7 million). 
Regulations in the UK and US require 
repayment of deficits over time. In the 
UK, the Group is making deficit 
payments in accordance with an 
agreement reached with the trustees 
following the last actuarial valuation in 
2012. This agreement provides for 
payments to gradually increase over 
the period to 2024. The next actuarial 
valuation date is April 2015. In the US, 
the level of deficit payments is 
principally driven by regulations. 
Amounts required to be paid in the 
US decreased slightly in the year 
reflecting the impact of new legislation 
regarding funding payments and are 
expected to reduce further in 2015 due 
to the full year impact of these 
changes. Overall, the Group expects 
deficit contributions to reduce to  
£25.7 million in 2015 based on the 
existing deficit reduction agreement 
with the UK trustees and absent 
further regulatory changes in the US.
Meggitt has two other principal post-
retirement benefit schemes providing 
medical and life assurance benefits to 
certain US employees. The Group’s 
exposure to increases in future medical 
costs provided under these plans is 
capped. Both schemes are unfunded and 
have a combined deficit of £46.8 million 
(2013: £48.3 million). Deficit payments 
during the year were £1.5 million (2013: 
£0.7 million). During the year, the Group 
made changes to the way in which medical 
benefits are provided. These changes, 
following which the Group continues to 
provide comparable benefits, resulted 
in a past service credit being recognised 
of £8.4 million (2013: Nil).
Going concern
The Group’s business activities are 
described on pages 10 to 17 which include 
those factors most likely to affect its 
future development, performance and 
position. The financial position of the 
Group is set out in this report and 
additional information is provided in the 
financial statements including note 3 
(Financial risk management), note 28 
(Bank and other borrowings) and note 30 
(Derivative financial instruments). 
Details of the principal risks and 
uncertainties to which the Group is 
exposed, and the mitigation plans in 
place, are set out on pages 24 to 26.
The Group describes in the Strategic 
Report on pages 8 to 9 its cash generative 
business model designed to deliver 
organic revenue growth of 6–7% in the 
medium-term and its resilience to one-off 
global shock events. 
The Group continues to be cash generative 
even at the current elevated level in the 
aerospace investment cycle, has 
considerable headroom against existing 
bank facilities and covenants and there is 
no material facility expiry before 2017. 
Accordingly, after making enquiries, the 
directors have formed a judgement, at  
the time of approving the financial 
statements, that there is a reasonable 
expectation that the Group and the 
Company have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason, the 
directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the Group  
and Company financial statements.

We recognise our responsibility to 
shareholders, employees, customers, 
suppliers and the wider community to 
conduct our operations in a safe, responsible 
and sustainable manner. We believe that our 
focus on corporate responsibility creates 
value for Meggitt and our stakeholders. 
It helps us manage our businesses more 
efficiently, which in turn helps us mitigate 
risks, reduce costs and protect the 
communities in which we operate. We are 
also committed to ensuring compliance with 
all relevant national laws and regulations 
and aim to continually improve our financial, 
social and environmental performance. 
Policy
We are committed to:
•	 Upholding sound corporate 
governance principles; 
•	 Providing a supportive, rewarding 
and safe working environment with 
modern operational practices; 
•	 Conducting business relationships in 
an ethical and responsible manner; 
•	 Minimising the environmental impact of 
products and processes and maintaining 
internationally-accredited environmental 
management systems; 
•	 Acting as a responsible supplier and 
encouraging our contractors and 
suppliers to do the same; 
•	 Independent audits in key 
compliance areas; 
•	 Supporting our local communities; and
•	 Professional and comprehensive 
employee training programmes.
Governance and compliance
Health, safety and environment (HSE), ethics 
and business conduct and trade compliance 
are managed by a highly experienced team 
of functional specialists, under the 
leadership of the Corporate Affairs Director. 
Divisional presidents and site directors are 
responsible for implementing policies and 
programmes locally. 
Board-approved policies on corporate 
responsibility, health and safety, 
environment, ethics and business conduct 
and trade compliance are published on the 
policies section of our website. 
The Board’s Ethics and Trade Compliance 
Committee meets quarterly to discuss these 
programmes in detail. HSE matters are 
reviewed and discussed at every 
Board meeting.
Sustainability
Meggitt appreciates the importance of 
conducting business in a sustainable 
manner and we will continue to incorporate 
this principle into the way we carry out 
our operations. During 2014, we held 
initial discussions with Business in 
the Community, a leading charitable 
organisation in this field, to help 
develop our thinking further.
Activity in 2014 
Environment
Meggitt strives to achieve high levels 
of environmental performance 
throughout our businesses based 
on standards and procedures set by 
Group leadership. To achieve the goals 
of our Environmental Policy, Meggitt’s 
environmental management programme 
includes setting environmental targets, 
communicating regulatory developments, 
training and information-sharing, data 
analysis and internal and external 
auditing of environmental management 
systems and practices. 
Our global environmental audit programme, 
supported by external consultants, includes 
a comprehensive review of applicable 
regulatory requirements and best 
practice standards at all manufacturing 
facilities every three years. In total, 
16 sites were audited in 2014. 
Some 86% of our manufacturing 
facilities had achieved ISO 14001 
standard certification by the end of 2014. 
The remaining facilities are targeting 
certification in 2015. 
Performance
Table 1 shows our performance for key 
environmental metrics and Table 2 
shows our progress on achieving 
internally set targets. 
Our performance is on track to meet 
targets for most metrics, but facility 
consolidations and increased production of 
carbon brakes has impacted our progress 
on electricity and waste recycled in 2014.
Although we had already achieved our 
five-year target on CO
2
 emissions relative 
to revenue as at the end of last year, our 
performance slipped in 2014 to a 7%  
reduction compared to our baseline year 
which means that we did not reach our 
five-year CO
2
 reduction target by the end of 
2014. The increase in CO
2
 emissions in 
2014 was primarily due to a significant 
increase in electricity and gas consumption 
in our US carbon manufacturing operations 
because of an increase in production as 
new aircraft programmes enter service. 
We recycle an estimated average of 87,000 
cubic metres of water each year through 
closed-loop water recycling systems 
installed at several facilities. Other water 
conservation measures include 
installation of thermostatically controlled 
water circulation systems on process 
tanks reducing evaporative losses. In 
2014, despite an increase in cooling water 
used in our carbon manufacturing 
operations, our closed-loop recycling 
systems and other water conservation 
efforts resulted in a decrease in absolute 
water consumption and consumption 
relative to revenue and we remain on track 
to meet our five-year target of reducing 
water consumption relative to revenue.
We were able to realise the benefits of 
integrating the waste minimisation ideals 
of the Meggitt Production System (MPS) by 
reducing the environmental impact of 
waste at many facilities within the Group 
and were able to decrease the absolute 
amount of waste generated by 13%. An 
example of the progress made in 2014 is at 
one of our US braking systems facilities, 
which found a way to recycle carbon dust 
from carbon brake disk machining into 
electrically conductive plastic. This facility 
also identified a recycling method for 
waste carbon insulation as an oxygen 
scavenger in third-party metal recovery

furnaces. In total, these efforts have 
resulted in the facility diverting 35 tonnes 
of waste away from landfill. Since 2007, 
we have been a participant in the Carbon 
Disclosure Project (CDP) detailing our 
approach and performance in managing 
climate change. In 2014, we increased our 
score by 60% and our submission can be 
viewed on the CDP website.
Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)
Table 3 shows the GHG emissions data for 
the Large and Medium-Sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulation 2013 (the Regulations). 
The sites reporting GHG data are the 
same as those consolidated in the 
Group’s financial statements. 
We had an absolute increase in our GHG 
emissions in 2014 and our GHG emissions 
relative to revenue increased slightly 
due to an increase in electricity and 
natural gas consumed in our US carbon 
manufacturing operations as described 
above. Notwithstanding, this increase was 
partially offset by reductions in electricity 
and gas consumption and associated 
GHG emissions elsewhere due to site 
consolidations and energy efficiency 
measures as well as an increase in carbon 
recycling and reuse under our carbon 
refurbishment initiative described below. 
To align the Group’s emissions targets 
with the Regulations, we will be setting 
new five-year GHG emission reduction 
targets from 2016 using 2015 as the 
baseline year. We will set separate GHG 
reduction targets for our carbon 
manufacturing operations due to the 
unique and complex process involved.
Saving energy 
In 2014, we achieved reductions in key 
sustainability metrics through investments 
in several energy efficiency projects. These 
are exemplified by upgrading compressed 
air plants, improving furnace controls and 
installing high efficiency lighting and 
controls at our facilities as follows: 
•	 Recladding of roofing insulation at  
a UK facility resulted in improved 
heating and cooling efficiencies. 
•	  Significant lighting upgrade projects  
at several facilities, saving around  
300 tonnes of CO
2
 per annum. 
•	 Replacement of fluorescent lighting with 
more efficient LED lighting and 
replacement of two inefficient boilers 
with higher efficiency rated gas boilers  
at another of our UK facilities saving  
25 tonnes of CO
2
 per annum. The same 
facility made insulation upgrades to 
improve heating and cooling efficiencies. 
•	 The carbon refurbishment programme 
at our braking systems facility in Akron, 
US continued to expand in 2014 with a 
59% increase in carbon discs recovered 
and refurbished from 2013. Reductions 
in processing time and associated 
energy consumption of around 81% 
resulted in savings of approximately 
2,300 tonnes of CO
2
 that would have 
otherwise been emitted in 2014.  
Meggitt UK facilities will be required 
to comply with the Energy Savings 
Opportunity Scheme (ESOS) in 2015. 
As a result, the facilities comprising at 
least 90% of our energy consumption in 
the UK will undergo energy assessments.  
Conducted by certified lead assessors, 
these will assist us in identifying additional 
energy conservation opportunities. The 
ESOS is derived from European Union (EU) 
legislation and it is likely that EU member 
countries will implement similar schemes 
requiring energy assessments for other 
EU Meggitt facilities. 
We recognise the need to reduce our 
dependence on fossil fuels and are 
actively investigating cleaner energy 
technologies including fuel cell power 
generation systems and solar energy 
throughout the Group.
REACH
Compliance with the European Community 
regulation on Registration, Evaluation, 
Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals 
(REACH) is managed by the Group’s REACH 
Steering Committee which continues to 
address the risks associated with the 
potential obsolescence of chemicals used 
by aerospace manufacturers. We 
continuously track substances regulated 
under REACH and work closely with our 
chemical suppliers to ensure substances 
are registered and will be approved for 
continued use, or a suitable alternative 
identified. We participate in an aerospace 
industry group involved in researching the 
replacement of hexavalent chromium used 
in common applications impacting 
aerospace manufacturing. 
Obsolescence
The Obsolescence Review Board (ORB) 
continued to identify and define a 
coordinated response to issues 
potentially affecting our business 
including conflict minerals, counterfeit 
and fraudulent materials and chemical 
obsolescence. Working with our 
customers and suppliers, we continue to 
strive for the reduction and substitution of 
materials and substances impacted by 
regulatory developments, performing 
material assessments, surveying our 
suppliers and undertaking reliability and 
qualification testing of alternatives. 
Health and safety
We want our employees to work in safe and 
secure environments and believe that 
occupational injuries and illnesses are

preventable. Our health and safety policy 
makes clear that we do not tolerate unsafe 
behaviours or conditions in our workplaces 
and that we seek to continuously improve 
our safety culture and performance with an 
ultimate goal of zero injuries and illnesses. 
In 2014, we continued to implement 
measures to improve safety in the 
workplace. These included: 
•	 Group-wide online health and safety 
awareness training for all employees; 
•	 Implementation of a behavioural 
health and safety programme at five 
facilities in 2014, with plans to roll it 
out at another ten facilities in 2015; 
•	 Development of a health and safety 
maturity index and a revision of the 
Meggitt Safety Star recognition 
programme to focus on proactive 
health and safety leading indicators. 
This will emphasise the importance 
of preventative actions to reduce 
incidents and injuries occurring 
in the workplace; 
•	 Integration of the reporting and 
investigation of near-miss accidents 
and unsafe conditions with MPS; 
•	 Continued dissemination of 
information and best practice through 
intra-Group HSE conferences, health 
and safety alerts and all-employee 
safety bulletins.
•	 Roll out of a further three new Meggitt 
health and safety procedures across 
the Group.
As a result of these measures we have 
made good progress on some of our 
safety metrics across the Group, 
most notably a 25% decrease in the 
US Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA) recordable 
frequency rate for our US operations 
compared to the prior year. However, due 
to a substantial increase in the number of 
reported incidents at a small number of 
our sites, the Group overall experienced 
a slight increase in reportable incidents 
and associated incident rates, as shown 
in Table 4. In 2014, 80% (2013: 80%) of our 
manufacturing facilities achieved at least 
a Bronze Meggitt Safety Star award 
reflecting a 25% improvement in health 
and safety performance over the three-
year average performance for years 2009 
to 2011. Of those, 23 facilities will receive 
a Platinum Safety Star award for 
outstanding performance in 2014. 
As reported in last year’s annual report, we 
continue to cooperate fully with regulatory 
authorities in the investigation of the fatal 
accident that occurred at our Rockmart, 
US facility last year and we expect the 
investigation to conclude in 2015. 
Ethics and business conduct  
and trade compliance
Our ethics and business conduct 
programme commits us to conducting 
business fairly, impartially and in 
compliance with laws and regulations 
and acting with integrity and honesty 
in our business relationships. 
In 2014, we provided training across the 
Group, on our Code of Conduct, ‘Reporting 
Concerns—Someone Else’s Problem’, and 
Global Anti-Corruption. We held two 
in-house ethics conferences, one in the UK 
and one in the USA, where facility-based 
ethics coordinators reviewed and provided 
feedback on the Ethics Programme. As a 
result of this feedback, we are redesigning 
our Ethics Guide, which will be available to 
all staff in printed form and on our website. 
Meggitt is a charter member of the 
International Forum on Business Ethical 
Conduct for the aerospace and defence 
industries and Barney Rosenberg, our Vice 
President, Ethics and Business Conduct, 
serves on the Steering Committee that 
runs this global organisation. 
The Board revised the Trade Compliance 
Policy (which is available on our website) 
in 2014. We have a highly-developed trade 
compliance programme, based on the 
Nunn-Wolfowitz Task Force Report of 2000 
(the influential report on export compliance 
best practice) and guidelines issued by 
the regulatory authorities. During 2014, 
we continued to implement our global 
trade management software solution to 
enhance our trade compliance programme, 
and continued implementation of our 
enhanced import compliance programme 
at a number of facilities in the US and the 
UK. We also implemented Phases 2 to 5 
of the US Government’s Export Control 
Reform programme. 
Local communities and 
charitable donations
We are committed to being good 
corporate citizens, and continue to 
support the communities in which we 
operate. Our businesses and employees 
give back to our communities through 
volunteerism, educational business 
partnerships and charitable donations  
as demonstrated by the following:
•	 Since 2007, we have continued to 
sponsor the Arkwright Engineering 
Scholarship Trust, an independent, 
charity that identifies, inspires and 
nurtures future leaders in engineering 
and technical design. The scholarship 
supports Science, Technology, 
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) 
initiatives that grant an annual financial 
award to young scholars and their 
schools. The 2014 scholar will benefit 
from mentoring by an experienced 
member of the Meggitt Global 
Engineering Group and valuable work 
experience over the next two years.  
•	 Meggitt US businesses and employees 
have donated over USD 1 million in the 
past five years to the United Way, a 
US-based non-profit organisation 
focusing on resolving local community 
issues through partnerships with local 
schools, government agencies and 
voluntary and neighbourhood 
associations. Several Meggitt US 
businesses hold annual United Way 
drives to encourage employee 
engagement in local community 
activities and initiatives designed to 
improve education, financial stability 
and health care for local families.
•	 Our McMinnville Oregon facility 
partnered with local businesses, 
community leaders and the 
McMinnville Economic Development 
Partnership to establish a 
manufacturing training programme at 
a local high school to address a 
shortage of skilled local labour. 
Meggitt donated equipment 
and materials for student training and 
assisted in developing the syllabus. 
Local congressional officials who 
visited the high school and Meggitt 
facility acknowledged the importance 
of innovative partnerships between the 
private sector and local schools to 
provide training leading to well-paid 
local manufacturing jobs. Some 260 
of the school’s 400 students enrolled.

Our employees
Learning, career development, employee 
engagement, strong leadership and 
effective teamwork are vital components 
of Meggitt’s performance culture. 
Various initiatives are underway, many 
of which have overt goals to improve or 
sustain engagement. Investment in 
learning and development is one. We 
continue to increase corporate training 
enabling employees from different 
businesses to learn together and create 
a common culture. The most significant 
investment is in MPS, our single, global 
approach to the application of ‘lean’ tools 
and other continuous improvement 
practices. The purpose of MPS is to 
ensure that everything we do and 
everyone who does it supports the 
front line of our business. 
Our very successful graduate training 
scheme continues with a third generation 
of graduates and post-graduates from 
some of the world’s best engineering 
institutions. Our next executive leadership 
programme begins in 2015, tailored for 
Meggitt by the Saïd Business School  
(see page 20). 
Equal opportunities 
The Group supports equal employment 
opportunities and opposes all forms 
of unlawful or unfair discrimination. 
It is Group policy to give full and fair 
consideration to job applications from 
disabled people, to provide opportunities 
for their training, career development 
and promotion and to continue 
wherever possible to employ staff 
who become disabled. 
We require all Meggitt employees, 
reinforced through our ethics training 
programme and its values, to treat all 
colleagues fairly and with respect. We 
recognise the value of diversity amongst 
our employees. Table 6 shows the number 
of women employed at all levels of the 
workforce. The Board’s approach to 
diversity is discussed in the Nominations 
Committee report (see page 54). 
Human rights
We confirm our commitment to the 
human rights of our employees in our 
Corporate Responsibility Policy, which 
we apply across all our businesses. 
Employee consultation 
The Group regards employee 
communication as a vital business 
function. Communication and consultation 
is carried out at facilities by operations 
directors and other line managers using 
a variety of forums including daily 
meetings on shop floors, monthly 
all-employee ‘Town Hall’ meetings, team 
briefings and works councils. We respect 
all employee relations regulations. 
Corporate communications take a variety 
of forms, including presentations from 
the Chief Executive via audio-visual 
media, global web-enabled conferences, 
publications such as the Meggitt Review 
and a variety of electronically-distributed 
newsletters. Results presentations are 
disseminated across the Group, which 
enhance our employees’ understanding of 
the financial and economic factors 
affecting its performance. 
The directors encourage employees to 
become shareholders to improve active 
participation in, and commitment to, the 
Group’s success. This policy has been 
pursued for all UK employees through the 
Share Incentive Plan and the 
Sharesave Scheme.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE REPORTS STRATEGIC REPORT 43
Chairman’s introduction
Throughout the financial year ended 31 December 2014 and to 
the date of this report, we have complied with the provisions set 
out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 2012 (the Code) 
published by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC). The 
Company has applied the main and supporting principles set out 
in the Code. An explanation of how the main principles have been 
applied is set out in this report and in the Audit Committee 
report, the Nominations Committee report (including a report 
from the Chairman Succession Sub-Committee) and in the 
Directors’ remuneration report. The FRC published a revised UK 
Corporate Governance Code on 17 September 2014, applicable to 
reporting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2014 (the 2014 
Code), although the Board has adopted some of the new 
provisions in the 2014 Code earlier than required.
The Board is committed to maintaining high standards of 
corporate governance, which are fundamental to discharging our 
responsibilities. As Chairman, I encourage open and transparent 
discussion and constructive challenge. It is my responsibility to 
ensure that Meggitt is governed and managed in the best 
interests of shareholders and wider stakeholders. In this report, 
we set out our governance framework and explain how sound 
and effective corporate governance practices support our 
strategy of creating long-term, sustainable shareholder value.
Leadership
At our AGM in May 2014, I announced my intention to retire 
following the appointment of a suitable successor, having had the 
privilege of chairing the Board of Directors for nearly 11 years. 
I have thoroughly enjoyed my time as the Chairman of Meggitt 
and am delighted to hand over to Sir Nigel Rudd, a highly 
experienced and successful director and chairman. With his 
prior role as a non-executive director of BAE Systems, and 
current exposure to the industry at BBA Aviation, Sir Nigel has 
exceptional knowledge of the aerospace sector. I know that his 
experience across a wide range of businesses will be of 
significant benefit to the Group.
In terms of other Board changes, in May 2014, David Robins 
retired from the Board and in October 2014 we appointed Alison 
Goligher as a non-executive director. Alison introduces specific 
oil and gas experience to our Board, which will be of great value 
to Meggitt’s energy businesses. At the same time, her technology 
management expertise and experience running a wide range of 
functions within globally significant corporations will benefit the 
Group as a whole.
In December 2014, we announced that as a result of the 
additional time commitments required for his new appointment 
as non-executive director and chairman designate of Drax Group 
plc, Phil Cox had decided to resign as a non-executive director 
with effect from 31 January 2015. On behalf of the Board I would 
like to thank David and Phil for their significant contributions to 
the Board and to wish them well for the future.
Effectiveness
As reported last year, the main findings from our 2013 internal 
evaluation were to enhance our strategy reviews and risk 
management process and continue to improve the annual Board 
schedule. In 2014, the Board engaged in additional strategy 
presentations and discussions and we continued to enhance our 
risk management process. We have since conducted our 2014 
internal evaluation and a report is included on page 49.
Accountability
The Board considered the 2014 Code, and assessed our current 
processes and reporting of risk management and internal 
control against the associated guidance issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council in September 2014. In 2015, we will start 
preparing for the new long-term viability statement which is first 
required for our 2015 Annual Report. Our shareholders can read 
about our most significant risks and uncertainties and our risk 
management process on pages 24 to 26.
The Board have confirmed that this Annual Report is fair, 
balanced and understandable, and you will find an explanation of 
the process we have used to make this determination on page 51.
Remuneration
At our AGM in 2014, we received 98.95% votes in favour of our 
Remuneration Policy. Shareholders also overwhelmingly 
approved our Directors’ remuneration report and a new 
long-term incentive plan. The Directors’ remuneration report 
(pages 55 to 75) provides a detailed review of the Remuneration 
Committee’s 2014 activities and bonus and share scheme 
performance in 2014. For ease of reference, we have also 
included the Remuneration Policy approved at our AGM in 2014 
(which is valid until the AGM held in 2017).

The Board approved the appointment of Ms Goligher as a non-
executive director and Sir Nigel Rudd as non-executive director 
and Deputy Chairman (to become Chairman at the conclusion of 
the AGM on 23 April 2015). The Board visited several facilities 
and received regular reports from executive management on 
strategy and business performance, financial performance 
(including treasury activity) and corporate affairs (including 
risk, legal and compliance). 
The Board implemented enhancements to its 2014 
programme as a result of the evaluation of the Board 
undertaken in 2013, including:
•	 An update and Board discussion on Group strategy, focusing 
on technology, aftermarket and operations;
The role of the Board 
The Board retains full and effective control of the Group and  
is collectively responsible for its success. It sets the Group’s 
strategy, ensures appropriate resources are in place to achieve 
the Group’s objectives and reviews performance regularly.
The Board is responsible for setting the Group’s values and 
standards and for ensuring obligations to shareholders, 
employees and other stakeholders are met. 
A Schedule of Matters Reserved for the Board (updated in 2012) 
sets out the matters on which the Board must make the final 
decisions. These include, for example, changes to the Group’s 
capital structure and capital allocation policy, acquisitions and 
disposals above a certain threshold and approval of results 
announcements, annual reports and dividends. If a decision is 
not reserved for the Board, authority lies, in accordance with 
authorisation policies and terms of reference, with a Board 
committee, a management committee, the Chief Executive or 
other executive director, Chief Operating Officer, divisional 
president or site director.

Corporate governance report continued
Each of these Committees’ written terms of reference were 
reviewed and updated in 2014 by the Board. These are available 
on our website. All Committee chairmen report orally on the 
proceedings of their Committees at the next meeting of the 
Board. Where appropriate, the Committee chairmen make 
recommendations to the Board on appropriate matters, for 
example, the fairness, balance and understandability of the 
Annual Report. Further details of the composition and operation 
of these Committees are set out in the Audit Committee, 
Nominations Committee and Directors’ remuneration reports. 
Appointments to the Board
There is a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the 
appointment of new directors. Full details of the process for 
appointments made during the year are available in the 
Nominations Committee report set out on page 54. 
Commitment
The letters of appointment for the Chairman and non-executive 
directors set out the expected time commitment required of 
them and are available for inspection during normal business 
hours at the Company’s registered office and at the AGM. 
Other significant commitments of the Chairman and non-
executive directors are disclosed on appointment and 
require approval thereafter.
In 2014, the Chairman became a non-executive director of 
Aveillant Limited. Sir Colin confirmed that he continues to have 
sufficient time to discharge his role as Chairman of the Board. 
Mr Philip Cox was appointed as non-executive director and 
chairman designate of Drax Group plc with effect from 1 January 
2015 and, as a result of the additional time commitments 
required, resigned as a non-executive director of the Company 
with effect from 31 January 2015.
Development
The Board is supplied with the information it needs to discharge 
its duties. 
In 2014, Ms Alison Goligher joined the Board and has since had 
meetings with other directors, senior management, auditors, 
brokers and other professional advisors, as well as site visits and 
a comprehensive induction pack. Sir Nigel Rudd will commence a 
similar induction process in March 2015 following his 
appointment to the Board. The Board will continue to enhance 
the induction process as feedback is received and incorporated 
from the recently recruited directors. The Company Secretary 
facilitates the induction of new directors and assists with 
professional development where required.
Directors are encouraged to update their skills regularly and 
their training needs are assessed as part of the Board evaluation 
process. Their knowledge and familiarity with the Group is 
facilitated by access to senior management, reports on the 
business and site visits. Resources are available to all directors 
for the purposes of developing and updating their knowledge 
and capabilities.
Information and support
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring the directors receive 
accurate, timely and clear information. The Company Secretary 
is responsible for ensuring good information flows within the

Effectiveness
Composition
The Board considers it has a good balance of executive  
and non-executive directors, is of an appropriate size and 
includes the independence, skills, experience and knowledge  
to enable the directors to discharge their respective duties and 
responsibilities effectively. All non-executive directors  
are considered independent under the Code.
All non-executive directors (other than the Chairman) are 
members of the Audit and Remuneration Committees on 
appointment. All non-executive directors are asked to join the 
Nominations Committee on appointment. Chairmanship of 
Committees is considered during discussions on composition and 
succession. No one other than Committee chairmen and 
members are entitled to attend the meetings, although others can 
be invited. Committee chairmen, members and regular meeting 
invitees are noted in the respective Committee reports below. 
93987_p46-54.indd   48 04/03/2015   17:02 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE REPORTS STRATEGIC REPORT 49
•	 Process controls—for example financial controls including 
the Group Financial Policies and Procedures Manual, bid 
approvals, programme management and execution, 
IT security and risk management. The risk management 
process enables the Group to identify, evaluate and manage 
the principal risks faced by the Group and this process was 
in place for 2014 and up to the date of approval of the Annual 
Report and has been regularly reviewed by the Board; and
•	 The forecasting, budget and strategic plan processes.
The Group has programmes for insurance and business 
continuity which form part of the risk management and 
internal control framework. 
The following features of the internal control framework allow 
the Group to monitor the effective implementation of policy and 
process controls by business units:
•	 A business performance review process (including financial, 
operational and compliance performance);
•	 Annual business unit and divisional sign-off of compliance 
with Group policies and processes;
•	 Compliance programmes and external audits (including trade 
compliance, ethics, anti-corruption, health, safety and 
environmental);
•	  An effective internal audit function which, primarily, performs 
business unit reviews by rotation (including finance, IT, HR, 
ethics and the bid process); and
•	 A whistleblowing line to enable employees to raise concerns.
The Board and Audit Committee applied the following 
processes in 2014 and up to the date of approval of the Annual 
Report in order to review the effectiveness of the system 
of internal controls:
•	 Reviews of the risk management process, risk register 
and risk appetite;
•	  Written and verbal reports to the Audit Committee from 
internal and external audit on progress with internal 
control activities, including:
 – reviews of business processes and activities, including 
action plans to address any identified control weaknesses 
and recommendations for improvements to controls 
or processes;
 – the results of internal audits;
 – internal control recommendations made by the 
external auditors; and 
 – follow-up actions from previous internal control 
recommendations; 
•	 Regular compliance reports from the Corporate Affairs 
Director; Regular reports on the state of the business 
from the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer;
•	  A presentation on IT security activities and plans;
•	  Strategy reviews, review of the ten year financial plan 
and review and approval of the 2015 budget;
•	  Written report to the Ethics and Trade Compliance Committee 
on the effectiveness of whistleblowing procedures; and
•	 Reports on insurance coverage and uninsured risks.
discussions about their information and support requirements, 
and are involved in setting the annual Board schedule.
The Board and its Committees have been provided with sufficient 
resources to undertake their duties. All directors have had 
access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary  
who is responsible to the Board for advising on all governance 
matters. The Board allows all directors to take external 
independent professional advice at the Group’s expense.
Board performance evaluation
In 2014, the Board evaluated its own effectiveness, together  
with the effectiveness of the Chairman, individual directors, its 
Committees, auditors and remuneration advisers and agreed  
its objectives for 2015. The effectiveness reviews covered 
strategy, risk management, the annual Board schedule, 
composition, succession, the appointment process, diversity, 
remuneration, audit and open channels of communication.
The 2014 evaluation of the Board and its Committees was 
undertaken internally, using questionnaires and group and 
individual discussions. The Board continues to be thoroughly 
engaged with the review process, and the main findings and 
recommendations of the 2014 evaluation relate to further 
developing our succession planning and administrative matters 
relating to the issue of papers. The Board noted that progress 
had been made in areas selected for improvement in 2013. 
It is anticipated that the 2015 evaluation will be 
externally facilitated.
Accountability 
Financial and business reporting
The financial statements contain an explanation of the directors’ 
responsibilities in preparing the Annual Report and the financial 
statements (pages 78 to 79) and a statement by the auditors 
concerning their responsibilities (page 84). The directors also 
report that the business is a going concern (page 37) and detail 
how the Group generates and preserves value over the longer 
term (the business model) and the Group’s strategy for delivering 
its objectives in the Strategic report (pages 1 to 41).
Risk management and internal control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
control and for maintaining and reviewing its financial and 
operational effectiveness. The Board has taken into account the 
guidance provided by the FRC on Risk Management, Internal 
Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting in 2014 in 
reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems. The system of internal control is 
designed to manage, but not to eliminate, the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and to provide reasonable, but not 
absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The Group’s functions are responsible for determining Group 
policies and processes, and businesses are responsible for 
implementing them, with internal and/or external audits to 
confirm business unit compliance. The key features of the risk 
management and internal control system are described below, 
including those relating to the financial reporting process, as 
required under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules:
•	 Group policies—key policies are approved by the Board and 
most other policies are approved by Group functions;

Corporate governance report continued
Constructive use of the Annual General Meeting
The Board uses the AGM to communicate with its shareholders.
Proxy appointment forms for each resolution provide 
shareholders with the option to direct their proxy to vote for or 
against resolutions or to withhold their vote. All proxy votes for, 
against and withheld are counted by the Company’s Registrars 
and the level of voting for, against and withheld on each 
resolution is made available after the meeting and on the Group’s 
website. The proxy form and the voting results announcement 
make it clear that a vote withheld is not a vote in law and will not 
be counted in the calculation of the proportion of votes for and 
against the resolution.
Separate resolutions are proposed at the AGM on substantially 
separate issues and there is a resolution relating to the financial 
statements. The Notice of AGM and related papers are sent to 
shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting.
Meggitt encourages shareholders to vote at the AGM and 
provides a facility for electronic proxy voting. Shareholders who 
are not CREST members can vote online on resolutions proposed 
at the AGM via our website, after voting has opened. Proxy cards 
contain further details on how and when to vote and further 
information for CREST members. 
The respective Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nominations Committees are available at the AGM to respond  
to questions. It is usual for all other directors to also attend.
At the AGM to be held on 23 April 2015, shareholders’ consent  
will be sought on the following item of special business, in 
addition to the routine business: on the authority to convene 
general meetings on 14 clear days’ notice in accordance with the 
Articles (on the terms set out in the Notice of Meeting).
All directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first 
AGM after their appointment and have been subject to re-election 
annually since 2012 in compliance with the Code. All directors in 
office at the date of the AGM (23 April 2015) will be subject to 
election or re-election except for Sir Colin Terry, who will retire 
from the Board as Chairman and non-executive director at the 
conclusion of the AGM. 
By order of the Board
 
M L Thomas
Company Secretary
23 February 2015
The risk management and internal control systems have been in 
place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of 
the Annual Report, and are regularly reviewed by the Board. 
The Board monitors executive management’s action plans to 
implement improvements in internal controls that have been 
identified following the above-mentioned reviews and reports. 
The Board confirms that it has not been advised of any significant 
failings or weaknesses in the Group’s internal controls.
Remuneration
The Directors’ remuneration report is set out on pages 55 to 75 
and provides details of our remuneration policy which was 
approved at our AGM in 2014, and how it has been implemented 
in 2014, together with the activities of the Remuneration 
Committee. 
Relations with shareholders
The Group values its dialogue with institutional and private 
investors. 
The Board communicates with private investors via direct 
communication with our Group Head of Investor Relations and 
the Company Secretary, material distributed or made available 
on the investor relations section of our website and at the AGM 
(see below).
Effective communication with fund managers, institutional 
investors and analysts about the Group’s strategy, performance 
and policies is promoted by meetings involving, principally, the 
Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer. The Board receives  
reports from the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer  
and the Head of Investor Relations on the views of shareholders, 
which are discussed.
The Chairman and other non-executive directors are available  
to attend meetings with shareholders, and a specific letter was 
issued to major shareholders after the AGM in 2014, offering a 
meeting with the Chairman and Senior Independent Director. A 
number of such meetings on corporate governance took place in 
2014. We also received a number of requests from shareholders 
to have meetings with the Chairman Succession sub-committee, 
which were held before and after the announcement of our 
chosen candidate. 
Directors’ understanding of major shareholders’ views is 
enhanced by reports from the Head of Investor Relations, our 
brokers and attending analysts’ briefings. Analysts’ notes on the 
Group are made available to all directors.
We provide annual reports and other documents to shareholders 
in their elected format under the electronic communications 
provisions, which were approved by shareholders at our AGM in 
2007. Electronic copies of this Annual Report and Accounts 2014 
and the Notice of AGM will be posted on our website, where our 
announcements, press releases and other investor information 
are also available. An analysis of ordinary shareholders by size of 
holdings and shareholder type is also available on our website.

Chairman’s introduction
I am pleased to present the report of the Audit Committee for 2014. 
I chair the Audit Committee and as a Fellow of the ICAEW, former 
Audit Committee Chairman of DP World Limited and Finance 
Director at Bunzl plc, I bring recent and relevant financial 
experience to the Committee. My fellow committee members 
throughout 2014 were Guy Berruyer, Philip Cox, Paul Heiden and 
Brenda Reichelderfer, who attended all three Committee meetings 
during the year. Alison Goligher joined the Committee for her first 
meeting in December 2014 (which was the last meeting for Philip 
Cox before stepping down from the Board in January 2015). By 
invitation, there were a number of other regular attendees 
including the Chief Financial Officer, the Group Financial Controller 
and the internal and external auditors. The Chairman of the Board, 
the Chief Executive, the Corporate Affairs Director and David 
Robins (for the February 2014 meeting) also attended by invitation. 
The key role of the Audit Committee is to provide confidence in 
the integrity of our processes and procedures relating to internal 
financial control and corporate reporting. The Board relies on 
the Committee to review financial reporting and to appoint and 
oversee the work of the internal and external auditors. 
The work of the Committee in 2014 is described below in detail 
and included providing advice to the Board on whether these 
accounts are fair, balanced and understandable.

were updated in 2014 and are available on our website.
Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the Audit Committee include:
•	 Monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the 
Group, including its annual and half-yearly reports, and any 
other formal announcement relating to its financial 
performance, reviewing and reporting to the Board on 
significant financial reporting issues and judgements having 
regard to matters communicated to it by the external auditor;
•	 Reviewing and challenging where necessary: (i) the 
consistency of and any changes to significant accounting 
93987_p46-54.indd   51 04/03/2015   17:02 52 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
Audit Committee report continued
Significant judgements relating to the financial statements
The table below summarises the significant judgements reviewed by the Committee in respect of the Group’s financial statements:
Significant judgements Action
Goodwill and other  
intangible assets arising  
on an acquisition
The principal judgements are management’s determination of the level at which impairment testing 
should be performed, the achievability of CGU business plans (and therefore future cash flows) and 
the appropriateness of the discount rates applied to future cash flows. The Committee addressed 
this through consideration of a report from management setting out the basis for the assumptions, 
confirmation that the cash flows used were derived from the 2015 budget and strategic plan (which 
in their role as members of the Board, committee members had previously reviewed), a sensitivity 
analysis on key assumptions and an analysis of the headroom for each CGU. The Committee agreed 
the assumptions made by management were appropriate and that no impairment was required.
Development costs  
and programme  
participation costs
The Committee considered the method of testing for potential impairment used by management, the 
reasonableness of assumptions used on specific programmes with limited headroom, the aggregation 
of related intangible assets at an aircraft platform level and the appropriateness of the estimated 
useful lives assigned to the assets. The Committee addressed this through consideration of a report 
from management covering these areas, exposure to different platforms and a sensitivity analysis 
on specific programmes. The Committee concluded that the assumptions made by management were 
reasonable and the carrying value and estimated useful lives of the assets appropriate.
Provision for environmental  
matters relating to 
historic sites
The Committee considered a report from management setting out the basis for the judgements 
made and the extent to which these were supported by third party specialist advice. The Committee 
discussed with management, the sensitivity of the estimates to increases in cost estimates 
and changes in discount rates applied to future cash flows. The Committee agreed with the 
judgements made by management. 
Provision for onerous  
contracts and other matters
The key areas reviewed by the Committee were the provision held for the supply from a vendor of 
non-conforming raw material identified in the prior year, judgements made by management relating 
to selling prices, product quantities and unit costs on a small number of onerous production contracts 
and the impact of Heatric’s local content provider in Brazil having filed for creditor protection. 
The Committee considered a report from management setting out the bases for the judgements 
made on each of these items. The Committee agreed with the accounting treatment adopted. 
Retirement benefit  
obligations
Assumptions on mortality, inflation and the rates at which scheme liabilities are discounted can have 
a significant impact on the value at which retirement benefit obligations are included in the financial 
statements. The Committee considered a report from management setting out the basis on which 
the 2014 assumptions had been determined, including the revised mortality tables used for the 
Group’s US schemes. Additionally, the Committee reviewed a benchmarking, they had requested, of 
the Group’s assumptions used in the 2013 consolidated financial statements against those disclosed 
by other large corporate entities. The Committee concluded that the assumptions recommended, 
which were supported by third party actuarial advice, were appropriate.
Income taxes Judgements have to be made by management on the tax treatment of a number of transactions in 
advance of the ultimate tax determination being known. In determining the appropriateness of the 
estimates made, the Committee considered a report from management setting out the basis for 
the judgements. The Committee concluded that the position taken was appropriate.
Contract accounting revenue The Committee considered a report from management setting out the key judgements made 
by management in recognising revenue under contract accounting principles, focusing on the 
process by which amounts recognised were determined using estimates of total contract costs 
and the historical reliability of such estimates. The Committee concluded that the basis of revenue 
recognition was appropriate. 
Treatment of exceptional 
operating items
The Committee discussed the treatment and disclosure of items included within exceptional operating 
items. The Committee noted items were treated appropriately and consistently year on year. 
 
The Committee also discussed each of the above judgements with the external auditors in reaching their conclusions.
93987_p46-54.indd   52 04/03/2015   17:02 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE REPORTS STRATEGIC REPORT 53
On balance, the Committee is satisfied that the overall levels of 
audit-related and non-audit fees are not material relative to the 
income of the office of PwC conducting the audit or PwC as a 
whole and therefore the objectivity and independence of the 
external auditors was not compromised.
Internal audit
The Committee agrees the annual internal audit plan which is 
developed according to a risk assessment process and ensures 
that adequate resources are available to execute the plan. 
In 2014, the risk assessment process was reviewed. It was 
agreed that businesses would be split into three tiers based on 
their significance to the Group’s results, prior year audit findings, 
a self-assessment questionnaire and discussions with key 
stakeholders throughout the Group. Tier 1 businesses are visited 
annually, with Tier 2 businesses visited every other year and 
Tier 3 every third year. 
At each meeting, the Committee receives a status update on the 
audit programme and reviews, discusses and challenges any 
significant issues arising and monitors implementation by the 
business of the recommendations made. In 2014, internal audits 
were carried out at a number of Group sites, including post-SAP 
implementation audits and the annual audit of the finance shared 
service centres. 
IT was added to the scope of internal audit in 2014, using the 
services of Grant Thornton UK LLP. The 2014 IT audit scope 
included reviews of IT strategy and risk management, IT security, 
a data centre which has been established in the UK, and the 
global template utilised on SAP, our ERP system. 
The Committee routinely meet internal audit without executive 
management present. No concerns were raised at the meeting 
and it was confirmed that internal audit had been able to carry 
out their work and offer constructive challenge to executive 
management during the year. The Committee considered 
the effectiveness of internal audit and confirmed that they 
were satisfied. 
Whistleblowing
During the year, the Committee transferred responsibility 
for reviewing the process for handling allegations from 
whistleblowers to the Ethics and Trade Compliance Committee. 
In January 2015, the Ethics and Trade Compliance Committee 
confirmed that it was satisfied with the Group’s process for 
handling whistleblowing allegations. Whistleblowing is covered 
under our Ethics and Business Conduct Policy and Code of 
Conduct, which are available on our website. The Group sponsors 
an independently operated and monitored Ethics Line, enabling 
employees to report concerns about possible misconduct, with 
proportionate and independent investigation and appropriate 
follow-up action. Whistleblowing reports are reviewed regularly 
by the Ethics and Trade Compliance Committee of the Board. 
On behalf of the Audit Committee
David Williams
Chairman of the Audit Committee

Key areas of oversight
External audit
The external auditors are PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) 
who were appointed as Group auditors for the financial year 
commencing 1 January 2003 on 2 October 2003 after a 
competitive tender. There are no contractual obligations 
restricting the Committee’s choice of external auditors.
The lead audit partner is Mr Paynter whose appointment in 
this role commenced with the audit for the financial year ended 
31 December 2013. Mr Paynter has had no previous involvement 
with the Group in any capacity.
The Committee assessed the effectiveness of PwC and 
the external audit process using a questionnaire and 
a Committee discussion on the responses to the questionnaire. 
The Committee was satisfied with PwC’s performance 
and the external audit process and that they had employed 
an appropriate level of professional challenge in fulfilling 
their role. The Committee has determined, on the basis 
of the satisfactory outcome of the evaluation, that the 
external audit will not be subject to tender in 2015. It has 
recommended that the Board submit the re-appointment 
of PwC to shareholders for approval at the AGM in 2015. 
The Committee has reviewed the tendering and rotation 
provisions from the EU, Competition and Markets Authority 
(CMA) and those contained in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. The Committee does not expect to put the external audit 
services out for tender before the end of the current audit 
partner rotation period i.e. after the audit for the financial year 
ending 31 December 2017. This is subject to (i) any clarifications 
or changes issued by the CMA relating to their transitional 
provisions; (ii) the detailed implementation of the EU auditor 
rotation rules in UK law, scheduled for later in 2015; (iii) any other 
changes to the regulatory regime; and (iv) the Committee 
continuing to be satisfied with the effectiveness of the auditors 
which is considered annually.
The Committee routinely meet with PwC without executive 
management present and there were no concerns raised at that 
meeting. It was confirmed that the external auditors had been 
able to offer rigorous and constructive challenge to executive 
management during the year.
Non-audit services
The Group places great importance on the independence of its 
external auditors and is careful to ensure their objectivity is not 
compromised. The Committee agrees the fees paid to external 
auditors for their services as auditors and is required to approve, in 
advance, any fees to the external auditors for non-audit services in 
excess of £0.1 million. 
Details of the fees paid for audit services, audit-related services  
and non-audit services can be found in note 7 to the financial 
statements. The fees paid for non-audit services in 2014 were less 
than £0.1 million (Nil% of the total audit fee) and the average fees 
paid for non-audit services for the last three years to 2014 was  
£0.1 million (4% of the total audit fee over that period). Fees paid  
in prior years related to services permitted to be provided by  
PwC under the Group’s policy on non-audit services. 
The Group’s policy on non-audit services covers which services 
can be provided and which generally cannot be provided (for 
example internal audit services and tax planning). The full policy 
is disclosed on our website.
93987_p46-54.indd   53 04/03/2015   17:02 54 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
Nominations Committee report
Sub-Committee of the Board be formed, for the purpose of 
running the Chairman selection process. Sir Colin Terry was not 
involved in the selection of his successor and Ms Reichelderfer 
chaired the Sub-Committee, which was formed entirely of 
non-executive directors. Advisers (including Russell Reynolds 
Associates acting as search adviser), the Chief Executive and 
other executive directors were consulted during the process.
The role of Chairman was defined in writing and approved by the 
Board. The selection process for the role included consideration 
of prior successful FTSE 100 chair experience, solid experience 
in aerospace and defence or engineering/industrial, as well as 
broad international experience, time availability and preferably 
previous experience of being a Chief Executive. Just over 30 
candidate profiles were initially reviewed in the long list, from 
which a short list was identified and around ten candidates 
(including external and internal) were interviewed. 
Taking into account the requirements of the role and the 
structure, size and composition (including the skills, knowledge, 
experience and diversity) of the Board, the Chairman Succession 
Sub-Committee decided to recommend to the Board that  
Sir Nigel Rudd be appointed as Chairman. It was the view of the 
Board who approved his appointment, that Meggitt would benefit 
from the counsel and governance of Sir Nigel Rudd, a seasoned 
chairman with extensive international business experience 
spanning many industries, including aerospace.
Board diversity
The Board confirms a strong commitment to diversity (including, 
but not limited to, gender diversity) at all levels of the Group. The 
Board’s policy on diversity commits Meggitt to:
•	 Ensuring the selection and appointment process for 
employees and directors includes a diverse range of 
candidates;
•	 Disclosing statistics on gender diversity in every Annual 
Report (see page 41); and
•	 Reviewing this policy from time to time and continuing to 
disclose this policy in the Annual Report.
Based on the current size and composition of the Board and 
taking into account current succession plans, the Board has 
determined that there should be a minimum of two female 
directors, which is currently the case (for gender diversity 
statistics, see page 41). The Board remains committed to 
ensuring that the directors bring a wide range of skills, 
knowledge, experience, backgrounds and perspectives. Our 
directors are from the UK, US and France, and have a range of 
different skills and experience, from energy to aerospace, 
financial and technology backgrounds to an electrical engineer. 
External search consultancies
During 2014, the Committee used Russell Reynolds Associates  
to assist in the search for the Chairman (and assist the Group 
with searches for other senior management posts from time to 
time). Zygos Associates were used to assist in the search for the 
non-executive director. Neither Russell Reynolds Associates nor 
Zygos Associates have any other connection with the Group. 
On behalf of the Nominations Committee
Sir Colin Terry
Chairman of the Nominations Committee 
23 February 2015
Chairman’s introduction
The Nominations Committee plays a leading role in assessing 
the balance of skills and experience on the Board and the 
Group’s principal committees. The Committee identifies the 
roles and capabilities required to meet the demands of the 
business and, with due regard to diversity, ensures that a 
succession plan is in place. Candidates continue to be considered 
on merit against specific criteria determined by the Committee.
David Robins retired from the Board at the end of the 2014 AGM. 
Following a rigorous search process using search firm Zygos 
Associates, a number of candidates for the position of non-
executive director were interviewed by the Board. The 
Nominations Committee recommended the appointment of  
Ms Alison Goligher as a non-executive director, as her career in 
the energy sector in a wide range of functional and operational 
roles would be of great value to Meggitt’s energy businesses. 
In December 2014, we announced the appointment of Sir Nigel 
Rudd as a non-executive director and Deputy Chairman effective 
from 1 March 2015 (becoming Chairman at the conclusion of the 
AGM in April 2015). He is a highly experienced and successful 
director and chairman and with his prior role as a non-executive 
director of BAE Systems, and current exposure to the industry at 
BBA Aviation, Sir Nigel has exceptional knowledge of the 
aerospace sector. His experience across a wide range of 
businesses and expertise will be of significant benefit to the 
Group and make him ideally positioned to be the next Chairman 
of Meggitt PLC. 
We announced in December 2014 that Mr Philip Cox has resigned 
from the Board to concentrate on his new role as non-executive 
director and chairman designate of Drax Group plc.
In 2015, the Committee will continue to review the composition of 
the Board and succession plans for executive and non-executive 
directors, and is considering succession plans for Mr David 
Williams as he approaches his ninth year as a non-executive 
director during 2016.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE REPORTS STRATEGIC REPORT 55
Chairman’s introduction and annual statement
It is my pleasure to present the Directors’ remuneration report for the year ended  
31 December 2014. 
Pay philosophy
Executive remuneration packages at Meggitt are designed to attract, motivate and retain 
directors of a high calibre, to recognise the international nature of the Group’s business and to 
reward the directors for delivering value to shareholders. The package targets fixed pay at 
market competitive levels to companies of a similar size and with similar operating 
characteristics, supplemented by performance-related annual bonuses and an equity-based 
long term incentive plan designed to reward and incentivise growth, and provide a strong link 
to Group and individual performance. 
2014 activity
In 2014, we finalised the review of the remuneration package (which commenced last year and 
was extensively reported on in our 2013 report) and submitted the Directors’ remuneration 
report and remuneration policy (Policy) to shareholders for approval at our AGM. 98.95% of 
those shareholders who voted at the AGM approved our Policy and 99.79% voted for the 
Directors’ remuneration report.
We also finalised the effectiveness review of the Committee and Kepler Associates (Kepler), 
our advisers, which was carried out using questionnaires and Committee discussion. Overall 
the ratings for the Committee and Kepler were satisfactory; there was a valuable discussion 
about effectiveness but no significant areas highlighted for improvement. 
Since May, we have approved awards under the new shareholder-approved Long Term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP), updated our terms of reference to reflect the new remuneration 
reporting and policy regime and confirmed the Equity Participation Plan (EPP) vesting 
outcome (see page 67). We also discussed performance targets for 2015 and agreed the fees 
for Sir Nigel Rudd, who will become Chairman at the conclusion of the AGM on 23 April 2015. 
The intended remuneration arrangements for 2015, outlined in this report, are in line with the 
Policy approved by shareholders at our 2014 AGM.
2014 performance
Civil original equipment revenue enjoyed another year of strong growth, and the civil 
aftermarket gained momentum through the year resulting in full year organic growth in civil 
aerospace of 6%. However, this was offset by declines in military and energy resulting in flat 
organic Group revenue for the year. Underlying organic profit before tax declined by 11% 
reflecting adverse product mix and increased investment in new product introduction costs, 
with a 14% decline in underlying EPS reflecting also adverse movements in foreign exchange 
and the disposal of non-core businesses. This has resulted in the earnings per share (EPS) 
and cash elements of the awards granted in 2012 under the Executive Share Option Scheme 
(ESOS) and EPP failing to meet their performance conditions (the total shareholder return 
outcome on the EPP will be confirmed at the vesting date). Under our Short Term Incentive 
Plan (STIP), we did not hit our financial targets which account for two thirds of the award, but 
the targets for personal performance objectives were met and vesting outcomes for 2014 are 
as a result of this personal performance element. With growing order intake and building 
aftermarket momentum, we anticipate a return to organic growth in 2015.
This Directors’ remuneration report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. 
The report meets the requirements of the UK Listing Authority’s Listing Rules and  
the Disclosure and Transparency Rules. In this report we describe how the principles relating 
to directors’ remuneration, as set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 2012 (the Code), 
are applied in practice. The FRC published a revised UK Corporate Governance Code on  
17 September 2014, applicable to reporting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2014  
(the 2014 Code), although the Board has adopted some of the new provisions in the  
2014 Code earlier than required.

The Policy report
This section of the report sets out the Policy for the directors, which shareholders approved at the 2014 AGM and is effective for a 
period of three years from the date of the 2014 AGM. The only amendments to the Policy from the version approved by shareholders 
are to update the data used in the pay-for-performance scenario analysis from 2014 to 2015 and to remove references to future 
approval of the Long Term Incentive Plan (which was approved at the AGM in 2014).  
Executive Director Remuneration Policy Table
Base salary
Function To attract and retain talent by ensuring base salaries are competitive in the relevant talent market.
Operation Salary will be reviewed by the Committee annually, in February, with changes effective from 1 April of that year. 
Salaries for the year under review are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
In deciding salary levels, the Committee considers personal performance including how the individual has helped 
to support the strategic objectives of the Group. The Committee will also consider employment conditions and 
salary levels across the Group, and prevailing market conditions.
Salaries are paid to existing directors in GBP; however the Committee reserves the right to pay future and 
existing directors in any other currency (converted at the prevailing market rate when a change is agreed). 
Opportunity It is not anticipated that percentage salary increases for executive directors will exceed those of the wider 
workforce over the period this Policy will apply. Where increases are awarded in excess of the wider employee 
population, for example if there is a material change in the responsibility, size or complexity of the role, the 
Committee will provide the rationale in the relevant year’s annual report on remuneration.
Performance 
metrics
None explicitly, but salaries are independently benchmarked periodically against FTSE companies in similar 
industries and those with similar market capitalisation. Personal performance is also taken into account when 
considering salary increases.
 
Pension
Function To provide post-retirement benefits for executive directors in a cost-efficient manner.
Operation The pension plans operated by the Group which executive directors are, or could be, members of are: 
—Meggitt Pension Plan (defined benefit pension plan, closed to new members). 
—Meggitt Workplace Savings Plan (defined contribution personal pension scheme, open to new members). 
Salary is the only element of remuneration that is pensionable. There are no unfunded pension promises or 
similar arrangements for directors.
Opportunity From 2013, it has been our Policy that new executive director external appointments are eligible for a pension 
allowance of 25% of salary, payable either as pension contribution up to any limit set in current regulations or, above 
such limits, in cash. Where agreements have been made prior to the approval of this Policy which entitle an 
executive to receive a pension allowance higher than 25% of salary, pension allowances up to a maximum of 50% of 
salary, will be paid; Mr Young and Mr Green had agreements prior to the approval of this Policy which entitle them to 
receive a pension allowance of 50% of salary and this arrangement will continue for these directors.

Benefits
Function To provide non-cash benefits which are competitive in the market in which the executive director is employed. 
Operation The Group may provide benefits including, but not limited to, a company car or car allowance, private medical 
insurance, permanent health insurance, life assurance, a fuel allowance, a mobile phone, relocation costs and 
any other future benefits made available either to all employees globally or all employees in the region in which 
the executive director is employed. 
Opportunity Benefits vary by role and individual circumstances; eligibility and cost is reviewed periodically. Benefits in respect 
of the year under review are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration. It is not anticipated that the costs of 
benefits provided will increase significantly in the financial years over which this Policy will apply, although the 
Committee retains discretion to approve a higher cost in exceptional circumstances (e.g. to facilitate recruitment, 
relocation, expatriation etc) or in circumstances where factors outside the Group’s control have changed 
materially (e.g. market increases in insurance costs).
Performance 
metrics
None.
Annual bonus (Short Term Incentive Plan—STIP)
Function To incentivise executive directors on delivering annual financial and personal targets.
Operation Performance measures, targets and weightings are set at the start of the year.
The performance period of the STIP is a financial year. After the end of the financial year, to the extent that the 
performance criteria have been met, 75% of the STIP award is paid in cash to the director. The remaining 25%  
of the award will be deferred into shares and released (with no further performance conditions attached, and  
no matching shares provided) after a further period of two years.
Under the STIP 2014 rules as approved by the Committee, the Committee may decide to apply malus and/or 
clawback to STIP awards and deferred STIP awards to reduce the vesting of awards and/or require repayment  
of awards in the event of a review of the conduct, capability or performance of the director where there has been 
misconduct by the director or material misstatement of the Company’s or a Group members financial results  
for any period. 
Deferred STIP awards may lapse in certain leaver circumstances (see page 62).
Opportunity The STIP provides for a maximum award opportunity of up to 150% of salary in normal circumstances with an 
on-target opportunity of 100% of salary and an opportunity of 50% of salary at threshold. 
The Committee has discretion to make a STIP award of up to 200% of salary in exceptional circumstances (e.g.  
a substantial contract win which has a significant positive financial impact in the long term but which has no, or 
negative, short term financial impact). Dividends accrue on unvested deferred STIP awards over the vesting 
period and are released on the vesting date.
Performance 
metrics
STIP awards are based on the achievement of financial and personal performance targets. For the executive 
directors, two-thirds of the STIP will be weighted to financial performance, with the remainder subject to 
personal performance. The relative weightings of the financial and personal elements for any STIP period, and 
the measures used to assess financial and non-financial performance, will be set by the Committee in its 
absolute discretion to align with the Group’s operating and strategic priorities for that year.
The award for performance under each element of the STIP will be calculated independently. The Committee will 
have discretion to review the consistency of the pay-out of the financial and personal elements and adjust the 
total up or down (within the levels specified above) if it does not consider this to be a fair reflection of the 
underlying performance of the Group or the individual. 
The personal performance element will typically be based on three to five objectives relevant to the  
executive’s role.
Details of the measures, weightings and targets applicable to the STIP for each year, including a description of 
how they were chosen and whether they were met, will be disclosed retrospectively in the annual report on 
remuneration for the following year (subject to commercial sensitivity).

58 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Function To align the interests of executive directors with shareholders in growing the value of the Group over the long 
term.
Operation The LTIP replaced the ESOS and EPP in 2014. Under the LTIP, executive directors are eligible to receive annual 
awards over Meggitt shares vesting after three years, subject to the achievement of stretching performance 
targets. 
Whilst it is the current intention that LTIP awards will be in the form of nil cost options, the LTIP provides, at the 
absolute discretion of the Committee, for awards over conditional shares, market value share options and 
phantom awards.
Under the LTIP 2014 rules as approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2014, the Committee may decide to apply 
malus and/or clawback to awards to reduce the vesting of awards and/or require repayment of awards in the 
event of a review of the conduct, capability or performance of the director where there has been misconduct by 
the director or material misstatement of the Company’s or a Group members financial results for any period.
Opportunity Executive directors will normally be eligible for annual LTIP awards of 220% of salary. Awards up to a maximum 
of 300% of salary may be granted in exceptional circumstances (e.g. to support the recruitment of a key executive 
or to recognise exceptional individual performance).
30% of an award will vest if performance against each performance condition is at threshold and 100% if it is at 
maximum, with straight line vesting in between.
Dividends accrue on unvested LTIP awards over the vesting period and are released, to the extent the LTIP award 
vests, on the vesting/exercise date.
Performance 
metrics
Vesting of LTIP awards is subject to continued employment and performance against three measures, which are 
intended to be as follows:
•	 E ar ni n g s 	p er	S h ar e 	(E P S ) ;
•	 Re t u r n 	on	Tr ading 	A s s et s	(R OT A ),	w hic h 	is	un d e r ly i n g 	o p er a ti n g 	pr o fi t 	a f te r	tax	d i v ide d	by 	n et	t r a d in g	a s s et s ,	
measured at constant currency. Net trading assets are adjusted to exclude goodwill and other intangible assets 
arising on the acquisition of a business, derivative financial instruments, retirement benefit obligations, 
deferred tax and net debt; and
•	 S tr a te g ic 	g o al s 	(t y p ic al l y	to	be	ba se d	on	th r e e	s tr a te g ic 	p r io r i t ie s	a r o un d 	exe c u t i on , 	gr o w t h	an d 	i n n o v at i o n).
The way these measures link to our KPIs can be seen on pages 27 to 30. It is the current intention that the 
weighting of the measures will be equal (i.e. one third each) but that the Committee will consider, and adjust if 
deemed appropriate, the weighting at the start of each LTIP cycle. Any commercially-sensitive information on 
measures, targets and performance will be disclosed retrospectively.
Awards made under the LTIP will have a performance period of three financial years, starting from 1 January of 
the year in which the award is made and ending on 31 December of the third year. If no entitlement has been 
earned at the end of the relevant performance period, awards will lapse. 
Vesting of the strategic element will also be subject to a discretionary assessment by the Committee of the extent 
to which achievement of the strategic objectives is consistent with the underlying financial performance over the 
three-year period. 
The measures and targets in operation for grants made under the LTIP in the current year, and which are not 
deemed commercially sensitive are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
Sharesave Scheme and Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
Function To align the interests of employees and shareholders by encouraging all employees to own Meggitt shares.
Operation Sharesave Scheme—All employee scheme under which all UK employees (including executive directors) may 
save up to the maximum monthly savings limit (as determined by legislation) over a period of three or five years. 
Options under the Sharesave Scheme are granted at a discount of up to 20% to the market value of shares at the 
date of grant.
SIP—All employee scheme under which (i) all UK employees (including executive directors) may contribute up to 
the monthly maximum (as determined by legislation) to purchase shares monthly from pre-tax pay; and (ii) all UK 
employees (including executive directors) may receive free shares up to the annual maximum value (as 
determined by legislation).
Opportunity Savings, contributions and free shares are capped at the prevailing legislative limit at the time UK employees are 
invited to participate.

Notes to the Policy table
The Committee is satisfied that the above Policy is in the best interests of shareholders and does not promote excessive risk-taking. 
The Committee retains discretion to make minor, non-significant changes to the Policy without reverting to shareholders.
Payments from outstanding awards
Outstanding awards are currently held by the directors under the EPP and the ESOS, the Group’s long term incentives operated  
prior to the introduction of the LTIP in 2014. These awards will continue to vest (subject to performance conditions being met) and  
be capable of exercise during the period over which this Policy applies. The tables on pages 74 to 75 highlight outstanding and  
vested awards.
Approach to target setting and performance measure selection
Targets applying to the STIP and LTIP are reviewed annually, based on a number of internal and external reference points, including 
the Group’s strategic plan, analyst forecasts for Meggitt and its sector comparators, historical growth achieved by Meggitt and its 
sector comparators and external expectations for growth in Meggitt’s markets. 
STIP
The performance measures used under the STIP reflect financial targets for the year and non-financial performance objectives. The 
Policy provides the Committee with flexibility to select appropriate measures on an annual basis.
STIP performance targets are set to be stretching but achievable, with regard to the particular personal performance objectives and 
the economic environment in a given year. For financial measures, ‘target’ is based around the annual budget approved by the Board. 
Prior to the start of the financial year, the Committee sets an appropriate performance range around target, which it considers 
provides an appropriate degree of ‘stretch’ challenge and an incentive to outperform.
LTIP
The vesting of LTIP awards is linked to EPS, ROTA and the achievement of long-term strategic goals.
EPS is considered by the Board to be the most important measure of Meggitt’s financial performance. It is highly visible internally,  
is regularly monitored and reported, and is strongly motivational for participants. EPS targets will continue to be set on a nominal 
cumulative (pence) basis to incentivise consistent performance and reflect the fact that Meggitt’s profits are generated to a large 
degree outside the UK and not significantly influenced by UK retail price inflation.
ROTA helps to balance the achievement of growth and returns. The Committee believes ROTA is a good internal proxy for total 
shareholder return (TSR) which focuses executives on managing the balance sheet and Meggitt’s operational performance, whilst 
also being less remote for participants below Board level. The definition of net trading assets for ROTA excludes goodwill and other 
intangible assets arising when a business is acquired, to reflect that acquisitions are not within the control of the majority of 
participants. In order to safeguard against poor acquisitions, the Committee has overall discretion to reduce the outcome under the 
ROTA element if in its opinion the outcome does not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Group. The performance of 
acquisitions against Board approved targets is also monitored separately. 
The Committee believes that the strategic goals component will help reinforce the realisation of Group strategy and the achievement 
of key non-financial and strategic goals over long product cycles which drive long-term value at Meggitt. The element will typically 
comprise a scorecard of three-year targets across a maximum of three core strategic areas for the Group. The Committee believes 
that this approach will enable it to reflect the Group’s long-term nature and shifting strategic priorities in the LTIP to ensure 
executives’ interests remain closely aligned with those of our shareholders over time. Specific measures and targets for each area 
will be developed and clearly defined at the start of each three-year cycle to balance leading and lagging indicators of performance. 
Vesting of this element is subject to a discretionary assessment by the Committee of the extent to which achievement of the strategic 
objectives is consistent with Meggitt’s underlying financial performance over the performance period.
Remuneration policy for other employees
The remuneration policy for other employees is based on broadly consistent principles as that for executive directors. Annual salary 
reviews take into account Group performance, local pay and market conditions, and salary levels for similar roles in comparable 
companies. Some employees below executive level are eligible to participate in annual bonus schemes; opportunities and 
performance measures vary by organisational level, geographical region and an individual’s role. Senior executives are eligible for 
LTIP on similar terms as the executive directors, although award opportunities are lower and vary by organisational level. All UK 
employees are eligible to participate in the Sharesave Scheme and SIP on identical terms.
Share ownership guidelines
In 2013, the Committee increased the minimum shareholding guidelines for executive directors from 100% to 300% of base salary for 
the Chief Executive and from 100% to 200% of base salary for each of the other executive directors. There is no set time frame within 
which directors have to meet the guideline, however until they meet the guideline they are not permitted to sell more than 50% of the 
after-tax value of a vested share award. The shareholding requirement ceases when a director leaves the Group. Further information 
on the shareholding requirement is in the annual remuneration report (see page 73).

Potential reward opportunities are based on the Policy, applied to 2015 base salaries and 2015 incentive opportunities. Note that the 
LTIP awards granted in a year will not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant, and the projected value excludes 
the impact of share price movement or dividend accrual.
The ‘Maximum’ scenario reflects fixed remuneration (salary and benefits and pension), plus maximum payout under all incentives 
(150% of salary under the STIP, and full vesting of LTIP awards).
The ‘On-target’ scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus target STIP (based on two-thirds of maximum opportunity) and 
LTIP threshold vesting (30% vesting). 
The ‘Minimum’ scenario reflects fixed remuneration only, being the only elements of the executive directors’ remuneration package 
not linked to performance.
Non-Executive Directors’—Remuneration Policy Table
Non-Executive Directors are submitted for re-election annually, do not have a contract of service and are not eligible to join the 
Group’s pension or share schemes. Details of the Policy on fees paid to our non-executive directors are set out in the table below:
Fees
Function To attract and retain non-executive directors of the highest calibre with broad commercial and other experience 
relevant to the Group.
Operation Fee levels are reviewed annually, with any adjustments effective 1 April each year. The fees paid to the Chairman 
of the Board are determined by the Committee, while the fees for all other non-executive directors are reviewed 
by a committee of the Board formed of executive directors. Fees for the year under review and for the current 
year are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
Additional fees are paid to the chairmen of the Remuneration and Audit Committee and to the Senior Independent 
Director, to reflect the additional time commitment of these roles.
In deciding fee increases, the committees consider employment conditions and salary increases across the 
Group, and prevailing market conditions.
Currently, all fees are paid in GBP, however the committees reserve the right to pay future and existing non-
executive directors in any other currency (converted at the prevailing market rate when a change is agreed) .
Opportunity Fee increases will be applied taking into account the outcome of the annual review. The maximum aggregate 
annual fee for all non-executive directors (including the Chairman) as provided in the Company’s Articles of 
Association is £1,000,000.

Recruitment
External appointments
In cases of hiring or appointing a new executive director from outside the Group, the Committee may make use of all existing 
components of remuneration, as follows:
Component Approach
Maximum annual 
grant value
Base salary The base salaries of new appointees will be determined based on the experience and skills 
of the individual, internal comparisons, employment conditions and salary levels across 
the Group, and prevailing market conditions. Initial salaries may be set below market and 
consideration given to phasing any increases over two or three years subject to 
development in the role.
N/A
Pension In line with the Policy, new appointees will be entitled to become members of the Meggitt 
Workplace Savings Plan (defined contribution plan) or receive a cash pension allowance of 
25% of salary in lieu.
N/A
Benefits/
Sharesave/SIP
New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits in line with the Policy, and will be 
eligible to participate in all-employee share schemes. 
N/A
STIP The structure described in the Policy table will apply to new appointees with the relevant 
maximum being pro-rated to reflect the proportion of employment over the year. Targets 
for the personal element will be tailored to the appointee.
150% of salary  
(200% in exceptional 
circumstances)
LTIP New appointees will be granted awards under the LTIP on similar terms as other executive 
directors, as described in the Policy table.
220% of salary 
(300% in exceptional 
circumstances)
In determining the appropriate remuneration structure and levels, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors to 
ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of Meggitt and its shareholders. The Committee may make an award in respect of 
a new appointment to ‘buy out’ incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, i.e. over and above the approach 
outlined in the table above. Any such compensatory awards will be made under existing share schemes, where appropriate, and will 
be subject to the normal performance conditions of those schemes. 
The Committee may also consider it appropriate to structure ‘buy-out’ awards differently to the structure described in the Policy 
table, exercising the discretion available under UKLA Listing Rule 9.4.2 R where necessary to make a one-off award to an executive 
director in the context of recruitment. In doing so, the Committee will consider relevant factors including any performance conditions 
attached to these awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining. The value 
of any such ‘buy-out’ will be fully disclosed.
Internal promotion
Where a new executive director is appointed by way of internal promotion, the Policy will be consistent with that for external 
appointees, as detailed above. Any commitments made prior to an individual’s promotion will continue to be honoured even if they 
would not otherwise be consistent with the Policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled, although the Group may, where 
appropriate, seek to revise an individual’s existing service contract on promotion to ensure it aligns with other executive directors 
and prevailing market best practice.
Disclosure on the remuneration structure of any new executive director, including details of any exceptional payments, will be 
disclosed in the RIS notification made at the time of appointment and in the annual report on remuneration for the year in which the 
recruitment occurred.
Non-executive directors
In recruiting a new non-executive director, the Committee will use the Policy as set out in the table on page 60.

62 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
Service contracts and exit payment policy
Executive director service contracts, including arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered by the Committee and 
are designed to recruit, retain and motivate directors of the quality required to manage the Group.
The Committee’s Policy is that executive directors’ service contracts should be terminable on no more than 12 months’ notice. The 
Committee’s approach to payments in the event of termination of employment of an executive director is to take account of the 
particular circumstances, including the reasons for termination, individual performance, contractual obligations and the rules of the 
Group’s applicable incentive plans which apply to share awards held by the executive directors:
•	 	 C o m p en s a ti o n 	 fo r 	 lo s s 	 of 	 of fi ce 	 in 	 s er v ice 	 co ntr ac t s 
Except as set out in the table on page 63, under the terms of their service contracts, the executive directors may be required to work 
during their notice period or may, if the Group decides, be paid in lieu of notice if not required to work the full notice period. Payment in 
lieu of notice will be equal to base salary plus the cost to the Group of providing the contractual benefits (pensions allowance, health 
insurance and company car or car allowance) that would otherwise have been paid or provided during the notice period. Payments will 
be in equal monthly instalments and will be subject to mitigation such that payments will either reduce, or stop completely, if the 
executive director obtains alternative employment. 
  An executive director’s employment can be terminated by the Company without notice or payment in lieu of notice in specific 
circumstances including summary dismissal, bankruptcy or resignation. 
•	 	 T r e a tm ent	of 	S T IP 
Executive directors have no automatic entitlement to any bonus on termination of employment under the STIP, but the Committee 
may use its discretion to award a bonus (normally pro-rated). 
  Where any bonus is deferred into shares, the award will normally lapse if an executive director’s employment terminates unless 
the executive director leaves for specified ‘good leaver’ reasons. The ‘good leaver’ reasons are death, redundancy, retirement, 
injury, disability, the business or company which employs the executive director ceasing to be part of the Group, any other 
circumstances in which the Committee exercises discretion to treat the executive director as a ‘good leaver’ or on a change of 
control. If the executive director is a ‘good leaver’ their award will vest on the normal vesting date, or earlier on a change of control, 
and would not be subject to pro-rating.
•	 	 T r e a tm ent 	of 	lo n g 	te r m	i n centi v e	p l an	a w ar d s 
The treatment of awards under the ESOS, EPP and LTIP is governed by the rules of the plans which have been approved by 
shareholders and is described below.
  Awards will normally lapse if an executive director’s employment terminates unless the executive director leaves for specified 
‘good leaver’ reasons. The ‘good leaver’ reasons are the same as described above. If the executive director is a ‘good leaver’, 
awards will vest to the extent that the attached performance conditions are met, but on a time pro-rated basis, with Committee 
discretion to allow early vesting. Under the EPP and ESOS, awards vest as soon as practicable after an employee has left. Under 
the LTIP, awards vest on the normal vesting date.

obligation for the Committee to allow Mr Young to exercise 
awards under the Group’s share plans that have already 
vested at the point of termination. 
No change of control provisions.
Mr D R Webb  
Service contract

12 months 6 months As set out in the Policy. 
No change of control provisions. 
Mr P E Green  
Service contract

2001
Group Corporate 
Affairs Director
12 months 6 months Mr Green’s service contract was entered into before 27 June 
2012 and has not been modified or renewed after that date. As 
such, remuneration or payments for loss of office that are 
required to be made under Mr Green’s service contract are 
not required to be consistent with the Policy. 
Payments to Mr Green under his service contract differ from 
the Policy in the following respects: 
On termination of employment, Mr Green is entitled to a 
liquidated damages payment equal to his salary and the value 
of his contractual benefits (bonus, pension allowance, 
insurance and company car or car allowance) at the date of 
termination, pro-rated to the remaining notice period less an 
amount equal to 5% of the aggregate sum and the Committee 
shall exercise its discretion under the Group’s share plans to 
treat Mr Green as a ‘good leaver’. 
On change of control, Mr Green may give notice to terminate 
his employment within six months of the event and upon such 
termination he shall become entitled to the liquidated 
damages payment summarised above. 
External appointments held by executive directors
The Board believes that the Group can benefit from experience gained when executive directors hold external non-executive 
directorships. Executive directors are allowed to hold external appointments and to receive payment provided such appointments are 
agreed by the Board or Committee in advance, there are no conflicts of interests and the appointment does not lead to deterioration 
in the individual’s performance. Details of external appointments and the associated fees received are included in the annual report 
on remuneration on page 72.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Company 
The Committee does not consult with employees specifically on executive remuneration policy and framework but does seek to 
promote and maintain good relations with employee representative bodies—including trade unions and works councils—as part of its 
broader employee engagement strategy and consults on matters affecting employees and business performance as required in each 
case by law and regulation in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. Salary increases made elsewhere in the Group are 
amongst the data that the Committee considers in determining salaries for executive directors. 
Consideration of shareholder views 
The Committee considers shareholder views received during the year and at the AGM each year, as well as guidance from 
shareholder representative bodies more broadly. The majority of shareholders continue to express support of remuneration 
arrangements at Meggitt.

Mr Cox resigned from the Committee on 31 January 2015 on his departure from the Board. There was one meeting between the end 
of the financial year and the date of signing of this report on 16 February 2015, which all current members of the Committee attended. 
The Committee operates within agreed Terms of Reference, which are available on our website and were updated in 2014. The 
Committee is responsible for determining the remuneration policy and packages for all executive directors and Executive Board 
members (covering five of the next most senior executives across the Group) and for agreeing the fees for the Chairman. The 
Chairman, Chief Executive and Organisational Development Director attend meetings of the Committee by invitation; they are absent 
when their own remuneration is under consideration.
None of the non-executive directors has, or has had, any personal financial interests or conflicts of interest arising from cross-
directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business. 
Advisers to the Committee
During the year, the Committee’s independent remuneration advisor was Kepler Associates (Kepler). Kepler, appointed in 2010, was 
selected by the Committee as a result of a competitive tender process. The Committee evaluates the support provided by Kepler 
annually and is comfortable that they provide independent remuneration advice to the Committee. Kepler provide guidance on 
remuneration matters at Board level and below. Kepler do not have any other connection with the Group. Kepler is a member of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group and adheres to its code of conduct (www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com). Their total fees in 
2014 were £88,000 (2013: £87,000).

 EPP is calculated as the number of shares vesting based on performance measures substantially completed during the year, valued at the market 
value of the shares. For 2014, the figure represents the actual vesting outcome of the EPS and cash elements of the 2012 award (the performance 
period ended on 31 December 2014) and an estimate of the outcome of the TSR element of the 2012 award (the performance period of which will end in 
August 2015) based on performance to 31 December 2014. The market value of vested shares is based on the average share price over the last quarter 
of 2014 of 474.07 pence. The valuation of the 2012 award will be amended for the actual vesting outcome of the TSR element in August 2015 and the 
share price on the date of vesting (22 August 2015) in next year’s annual report on remuneration. For 2013, the figure represents the actual vesting 
outcome of the 2011 award, which has been trued up, compared to that reported last year, to reflect the final vesting outcome of the TSR element 
(Nil%) and the share price on the date of vesting (467.80p). Further details on performance criteria, achievement and resulting vesting levels can be 
found on page 67.
5
 ESOS is calculated as the number of shares vesting based on performance measures substantially completed during the year, valued at the difference 
between the market value of the shares and the exercise price of the award. For 2014, the figure represents the actual vesting outcome of the 2012 
award. The market value of vested shares is based on the average share price over the last quarter of 2014 of 474.07 pence and an exercise price of 
397.20p. For 2013, the figure represents the actual vesting outcome of the 2011 award, trued up, compared to that reported last year, to reflect the 
embedded gain based on the actual share price at vesting (504.00p). Further details on performance criteria, achievement and resulting vesting levels 
can be found on page 67.

STIP in respect of 2014 performance
The Board set stretching financial and strategic targets for the STIP at the start of the 2014 financial year. These targets, and our 
performance against these, are summarised in the table below.

  Individual personal performance is measured on a scale of 1 to 5. The average of all ratings drives the STIP outcome, where 2 indicates expectations 
are partially met, 3 is fully met and 4 exceeds expectations. Details of the personal performance measures are provided below. 
It is the view of the Committee that notwithstanding that 2014 has been a challenging year and that the STIP financial targets have not 
been met, the personal performance objectives of the executive directors have been satisfied to the extent shown above, and STIP awards 
should vest on this basis.
A full listing of personal performance objectives has not been provided owing to commercial sensitivity, however, the following is a 
summary of the conditions applying to each executive director. Mr Young’s personal performance objectives related to transforming 
execution capability (e.g. through successful implementation of the Meggitt Production System), shaping the business for competitive 
advantage, positioning for future growth (e.g. progressing technology projects) and ensuring best practice governance (e.g. health and 
safety improvements at sites). Mr Webb’s personal objectives related to assessing the Group’s strategic financial planning and capital 
allocation priorities, delivering sustainable cost improvements, implementing a mid-life ERP effectiveness programme, delivering a 
cyber-security risk reduction programme and shaping the business for competitive advantage. Mr Green’s personal objectives related to 
continued enhancement of the risk management programme, continued improvement of health, safety and environment standards, 
implementation of the US Department of State’s Consent Agreement and enhancing the import compliance and ethics programmes. 
The following STIP awards were received by directors in respect of 2014 performance:

STIP—deferral into shares
As a result of the 2014 performance STIP vesting outcome described above, 25% of the STIP bonus will be deferred into shares and 
released (with no further performance conditions attached) after a further period of two years, per the Policy.

2012 EPP  
The EPP award made in August 2012 vests 50% on cumulative underlying EPS performance, 25% on cash conversion over three 
financial years and 25% on the Group’s relative TSR performance over a three-year period commencing on the date of grant, as 
follows:

2014.

2011 EPP 
As disclosed in the 2013 annual report on remuneration, the Committee determined that 50% of the 2011 EPP award subject to the 
three-year cumulative underlying EPS performance condition and the 25% subject to the cash conversion performance condition vested 
in full based on performance to 31 December 2013. The remaining 25% of the award was dependent on the Group’s TSR performance 
compared to a group of 17 international aerospace and defence companies over the three-year period to 17 August 2014. TSR for all 
comparator companies is measured on a common currency basis.

Following confirmation of the vesting outcome of the TSR element, the overall vesting outcome for the 2011 EPP award (taking into

Total pension entitlements (audited) 
The table below sets out details of the pension entitlements under the Meggitt Pension Plan (MPP) for Mr Young and Mr Green. 
Under the MPP, Mr Young and Mr Green accrued defined benefits at 3% of salary per annum up to the Scheme Cap and were entitled 
to a cash supplement equivalent to 50% of salary above the Scheme Cap. Since reaching the government’s Lifetime Allowance in 
April 2012, Mr Young and Mr Green ceased accruing further benefit under the MPP and received a 50% pension allowance on their full 
salary. Mr Young and Mr Green’s dependants remain eligible for dependants’ pensions and the payment of a lump sum on death in 
service.
Mr Webb receives a pension allowance of 25% of base salary, but is not a member of any defined benefit or defined contribution 
pension scheme operated by the Group. 
The pension allowance payments made in 2014 are included in the single total figure of remuneration table.

Percentage change in CEO cash remuneration  
The table below shows the percentage change in CEO remuneration from the prior year compared to the average percentage change 
in remuneration for all executive employees. We have selected our executive population (around 300 people) for this comparison 
because it is considered to be the most relevant, due to the structure of total remuneration; most of our senior executives receive 
benefits under the same STIP and LTIP structure as our CEO.

The CEO’s remuneration includes base salary, taxable benefits and STIP. For 2013, the figures comprise elements paid to Mr T Twigger before his 
retirement from the Board in May 2013 and payments made to Mr S G Young from his appointment as CEO since May 2013. 
2
 The base salary for executive employees is calculated using the increase in the earnings of full-time executive employees using a consistent set of 
employees.
3
 For benefits, this information is not collected for the executive employee population and is therefore estimated from a sample of executive employees, 
using a consistent set of employees.
4
 For STIP, the increase is estimated as at 13 February 2015 as the validation processes for personal performance ratings for executive employees below 
the level of the Board and Executive/Operations Boards is not yet complete. To the extent there is a significant variation between the actual outcome 
and the estimate, this will be declared in the 2015 Directors’ remuneration report.

No exit payments have been made in 2014. 
Payments to past directors (audited)
There were no payments to past directors in 2014. A de minimis of £10,000 applies to all disclosures under this note.
Review of past performance
The remuneration package is structured to help ensure alignment with shareholders. There is no direct correlation between share 
price movement and the change in the value of the pay package in any one year (as the remuneration package comprises several 
components, some fixed, and others based on non-financial measures). The graph and table below show how the CEO’s pay has been 
sensitive to the share price over the last six years. 
This graph illustrates the Group’s performance compared to the FTSE100 Index, which is considered the most appropriate broad 
equity market index against which the Group’s performance should be measured. Performance, as required by legislation, is 
measured by TSR over the six-year period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2014:

Implementation of Remuneration Policy for 2015
Base salary
Base salaries are reviewed taking into account personal performance, employment conditions and salary levels across the Group 
and prevailing market conditions. Base salaries were reviewed in early 2015 and, effective 1 April 2015, will be as follows for the 
executive directors:
2015
 
£’000 % change
2014
 
£’000
Mr S G Young 677 +2.0 664
Mr D R Webb 449 +2.0 440
Mr P E Green 361 +5.0 344
For context, salary adjustments across the Group vary from region to region according to local salary inflation; in the UK and the US 
the average salary adjustment will be 2%. Mr Green assumes additional responsibilities in 2015, including for the commercial 
contracts function. The Committee therefore agreed to increase his salary by 5% in recognition of this change in role and in view of 
his salary continuing to be below competitive levels. 
Pension and benefits
There were no changes in pension contribution rates or benefit provision.
2015 STIP measures
STIP measures for 2015 are based on underlying operating profit (one third), free cash flow (one third) and personal performance 
(one third). The definition of profit for the purposes of this target has been changed for 2015 from underlying profit before tax to 
underlying operating profit because it is considered by the Committee to be more aligned to the metrics used to monitor our business 
units and therefore more relevant to STIP participants. The STIP targets for 2015, together with details of whether they have been 
met, will be disclosed (subject to commercial sensitivity) in the 2015 Directors’ remuneration report. The opportunity is in line with 
the Policy disclosed on page 57.
2015 LTIP measures
The executive directors will be granted awards under the LTIP in 2015, the vesting of which will be subject to the measures and 
targets set out in the table below. A number of the strategic measures have agreed annual schedules and, to ensure that the LTIP 
targets for these measures remain relevant and stretching over the entire three-year performance period, targets for these 
measures will be set as three sets of annual targets (i.e. at the start of each year and measured over a 12-month period). Therefore, 
the quality and delivery targets shown below are effective for year 1 of the 2015 LTIP award, and also for year 2 of the 2014 LTIP 
award. In determining the final vesting outcome at the end of each LTIP cycle, the Committee will consider performance over the 
three-year performance period for each strategic measure.
Vesting of the LTIP awards will be subject to the following measures and targets:

On 23 April 2015, Sir Nigel Rudd will assume the role of Chairman. As part of the selection process, the Chairman’s fee was reviewed and it was 
agreed that it would be appropriate to review the fee against a benchmark based on Chairman fees at other FTSE 100 companies, and for the fee 
to reflect Sir Nigel Rudd’s extensive experience at Board level across multiple industries. With his prior role as a non-executive director of BAE 
Systems, and current exposure to the industry at BBA Aviation, Sir Nigel has exceptional knowledge of the aerospace sector. His experience 
across a wide range of businesses and expertise will be of significant benefit to the Group and make him ideally positioned to be the next 
Chairman. It was also agreed that Sir Nigel Rudd will receive additional benefits of £20,000 per annum for secretarial and car services needed for 
business purposes.

Conflicts of interest
The Company has a procedure for the disclosure, review, 
authorisation and management of directors’ conflicts of interest 
and potential conflicts of interest, in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006. In deciding whether to 
authorise a conflict or potential conflict the directors must have 
regard to their general duties under the Companies Act 2006. 
The authorisation of any conflict matter, and the terms of 
authorisation, are regularly reviewed by the Board.
Political donations
No political donations were made during the year (2013: None).
Share capital and control 
The issued share capital of the Company at 31 December 2014 
and details of shares issued and cancelled during the financial 
year are shown in note 34 of the Group’s consolidated financial 
statements. On 31 December 2014 there were 802,330,037 
ordinary shares in issue. A further 2,916,114 ordinary shares 
were bought back and cancelled between 1 January 2015 and 13 
February 2015 with an aggregate amount paid of £15.2m, all of 
which were cancelled as a result of the share buyback 
programme, and 1,031 shares have been allotted under the 
Sharesave Scheme. The ordinary shares are listed on the 
London Stock Exchange.
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s ordinary 
shares are set out in the Articles. A copy of the Articles is 
available for inspection at the registered office. The holders of 
ordinary shares are entitled to receive the Company’s report  
and accounts, to attend and speak at general meetings of the 
Company, to appoint proxies to exercise full voting rights and  
to participate in any distribution of income or capital.
There are no restrictions on transfer, or limitations on holding 
ordinary shares and no requirements for prior approval of any 
transfers. There are no known arrangements under which 
financial rights are held by persons other than holders of the 
shares and no known agreements or restrictions on share 
transfers or on voting rights. Shares acquired through Company 
share plans rank pari passu (on an equal footing) with the 
shares in issue and have no special rights. 
Rules about the appointment and replacement of Company 
directors are contained in the Articles which provide that  
a director may be appointed by ordinary resolution of the 
shareholders or by the existing directors, either to fill a vacancy  
or as an additional director. Changes to the Articles must be 
submitted to the shareholders for approval by way of special 
resolution. The directors may exercise all the powers of the 
Company subject to the provisions of relevant legislation, the 
Articles and any directions given by the Company in general 
meeting. 
The powers of the directors include those in relation to the issue 
and buyback of shares. At each AGM, the shareholders are 
requested to renew the directors’ powers to allot securities in the 
Company up to the value specified in the notice of meeting and to 
renew the directors’ powers to allot securities, without the 
application of pre-emption rights, up to the value specified in the 
notice of meeting in accordance with the Articles. The Company 
can seek authority from the shareholders at the AGM to purchase 
its own shares.
Dividends
The directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 
9.50p net per ordinary 5p share (2013: 8.80p), to be paid on 8 May 
2015 to those members on the register at close of business on  
20 March 2015. An interim dividend of 4.25p (2013: 3.95p) was 
paid on 3 October 2014. If the final dividend as recommended  
is approved the total ordinary dividend for the year will amount  
to 13.75p net per ordinary 5p share (2013: 12.75p).
Dividends are paid to shareholders net of a non-refundable tax 
credit of 10%. Shareholders liable to higher rates of income tax 
will have additional tax to pay. 
Share dividend plan
During 2014, the Company made a share dividend plan available 
for the dividends paid in May 2014 (the final dividend for 2013) 
and in October 2014 (the interim dividend for 2014). The cash 
dividend necessary to give an entitlement to one new ordinary 
share was fixed at 454.54p and 467.40p respectively. 
A share buyback programme was announced on 5 November 
2014. Consistent with introducing a share buyback programme, 
the Board determined that a dividend reinvestment plan would 
be offered instead of a scrip dividend in 2015. Further details of 
the share buyback programme are contained in the Chief 
Financial Officer’s review (page 35).

The directors of the Company who were in office during the year 
and up to the date of signing the financial statements were:  
Sir Colin Terry (Chairman), Mr S G Young (Chief Executive),  
Mr G S Berruyer, Mr P G Cox (resigned 31 January 2015),

report, Mr Philip Cox resigned as a director on 31 January 2015. 
Additionally, the Board announced in December 2014 that on  
1 March 2015, Sir Nigel Rudd will join the Board, initially as a 
non-executive director and Deputy Chairman, and then as 
Non-Executive Chairman at the conclusion of the Annual 
General Meeting (AGM) being held on 23 April 2015, following  
the retirement of Sir Colin Terry. 
All directors will be submitted for election or re-election at the 
AGM, except Sir Colin Terry who is due to retire at its conclusion. 
Details of any unexpired terms of the directors’ service 
contracts are in the Directors’ remuneration report. 
Membership of committees and biographical information is 
disclosed on pages 44 to 45 and in the notice of AGM.
The directors have the benefit of qualifying third-party 
indemnity provisions for the purposes of Section 236 of the 
Companies Act 2006 pursuant to the Articles which were in 
effect throughout the financial year and up to the date of this 
Directors’ report. The Company also purchased and maintained 
throughout the year Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance. 
No indemnity is provided for the Company’s auditors.

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Directors’ Remuneration report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors 
have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union, and the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law).  
Share capital and control continued
The Group has significant financing agreements which include 
change of control provisions which, should there be a change 
of ownership of the Company, could result in renegotiation, 
withdrawal or early repayment of these financing agreements. 
These are a USD 900 million revolving credit agreement dated 
September 2014, a USD 600 million note purchase agreement 
dated June 2010 and a USD 250 million note purchase 
agreement dated June 2003. 
There are a number of other long-term commercial 
agreements that may alter or terminate upon a change of 
control of the Company following a successful takeover bid. 
These arrangements are commercially confidential and their 
disclosure could be seriously prejudicial to the Company. 
Agreements with the Company’s directors or employees 
providing compensation in the event of a takeover bid:
Director Contractual entitlement
Mr S G Young None except that provisions in the Company’s 
share plans may cause options and/or awards 
granted to employees under such plans to vest  
on a takeover.
Mr D R Webb None except that provisions in the Company’s 
share plans may cause options and/or awards 
granted to employees under such plans to vest  
on a takeover.
Mr P E Green Mr Green may terminate his employment 
within six months and would be entitled to 
compensation from the Company for loss of 
office. The compensation would be annual 
remuneration plus the value of benefits for the 
unexpired notice period less 5%. In addition, 
provisions in the Company’s share plans may 
cause options and/or awards granted to 
employees under such plans to vest on  
a takeover.
Non-executive 
directors
None.
All other 
employees
There are no agreements that would provide 
compensation for loss of employment resulting 
from a takeover except that provisions in the 
Company’s share plans may cause options 
and/or awards granted to employees under 
such plans to vest on a takeover.

Under company law the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and 
of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.  
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are 
required to:
•	  select suitable accounting policies and apply them 
consistently;
•	  make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; and
•	 state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the Group and parent Company financial statements 
respectively.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities. The directors are also responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation 
in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions. 
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in 
the Board of Directors on page 44 to 45, confirm that to the best 
of their knowledge: 
•	 the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit  
of the Group; and
•	 the Strategic report and this Directors’ report include a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Group, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
Each of the persons who is a director as at the date of this report 
confirms that:
•	 so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; 
and
•	 the director has taken all the necessary steps in order to 
make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in 
accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies 
Act 2006.
Fair, balanced and understandable
The directors as at the date of this report consider that the 
Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy. The Board has made this assessment on the 
basis of a review of the accounts process, a discussion on the 
content of the annual report assessing its fairness, balance and 
understandability, together with the confirmation from executive 
management that the report is fair, balanced and 
understandable.

Our audit approach
Overview
Materiality •	 Overall group materiality: £11m which 
represents approximately 5% of profit before tax.
Audit Scope •	 We conducted audit work at 17 reporting units.
•	 Business units where we performed audit work 
accounted for 100% of group profit before tax 
and 77% of group net assets.
Areas of focus •	 Goodwill and intangible asset impairment 
assessments.
•	 Environmental and contractual provisions.
•	 Revenue recognition under long term contract 
accounting primarily in the group’s energy 
business.
•	 Retirement benefit obligation liability.
•	 Provision for uncertain tax positions.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors 
made subjective judgements, for example in respect of 
significant accounting estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future events that are inherently 
uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of 
management override of internal controls, including 
evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors 
that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect 
on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, 
are identified as ‘areas of focus’ in the table below. We have also 
set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in 
order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, 
and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should 
be read in this context. Each of the areas of focus below is also 
referred to in the Audit Committee report on page 52 and in the 
critical accounting estimates and judgements on pages 96 to 98. This 
is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. 
Report on the group financial statements
Our opinion 
In our opinion, Meggitt PLC’s group financial statements (the 
“financial statements”):
•	 give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2014 and of its profit and cash flows for the 
year then ended;
•	 have been properly prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as 
adopted by the European Union; and
•	 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
Meggitt PLC’s financial statements comprise:
•	 the Consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2014;
•	 the Consolidated income statement and Consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income for the year then 
ended;
•	 the Consolidated cash flow statement for the year then 
ended;
•	 the Consolidated statement of changes in equity for the 
year then ended; and
•	 the notes to the financial statements, which include a 
summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere 
in the Annual Report and Accounts (the ‘Annual Report’), 
rather than in the notes to the financial statements. These are 
cross-referenced from the financial statements and are 
identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.

Area of focus How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus
Goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessments
Refer also to notes 18, 19 and 20 (pages 107 to 110)
The group holds significant amounts of goodwill 
(£1.5bn), acquired intangibles (£0.7bn), 
development costs (£0.3bn) and programme 
participation costs (£0.2bn) on the balance sheet. 
We focused on the risk that certain of these 
balances could be overstated.
We focused in particular on the estimated value in 
use of the Meggitt Sensing Systems business as it 
has the lowest percentage headroom of estimated 
value in use over book value (headroom £53.4m) 
and also the Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems 
business as it has the highest net book value of 
goodwill and intangibles at £1.5bn and has the 
second lowest percentage headroom of estimated 
value in use over net book value (headroom 
£313.6m).
We evaluated and challenged the directors’ future cash flow forecasts, and the process by 
which they were drawn up, and tested the underlying value in use calculations. We 
compared the directors’ forecast to the latest Board approved five year plans and assessed 
the actual performance in the year against the prior year budgets to evaluate budgeting 
accuracy.
The key assumption in the Sensing Systems business forecast is the planned level of 
profitability following a significant decline in profits during 2014. In assessing this assumption 
we evaluated in particular the likelihood of the factors that drove the decline in profits during 
2014 impacting the business over the 5 year forecast period. 
The key assumption in the Braking Systems business forecast is the assumed level of 
growth. In assessing this assumption the factors we considered included the expected 
growth in the number of aircraft on which the braking business has its equipment (based on 
third party forecasts) during the forecast period, in particular the aftermarket size and 
whether a sole source supplier position is held. 
In respect of both forecasts, we also challenged: 
•	 the directors’ assumptions for terminal growth rates in the forecasts by comparing them 
to economic and industry forecasts; and
•	 the discount rate by assessing the cost of capital for the company and comparable 
organisations. 
We performed sensitivity analysis in respect of the assumptions noted above to ascertain 
the extent of change in those assumptions which either individually or collectively would be 
required for the goodwill and intangible assets to be impaired and we assessed the 
likelihood of these changes in assumption arising. 
Although uncertainties exist in any long term forecasting exercise, based on the work 
performed we reached the view that the cash flows required to support the carrying values 
are achievable.
Environmental and contractual provisions
Refer also to note 31 (page 119)
The group has liabilities of £133.0m relating to 
environmental matters and £42.6m relating to 
other matters. We focused on these areas 
because certain of these provisions include 
significant subjective judgements as set out 
below.
The environmental matters, which primarily 
relate to site remediation and clean up liabilities 
at legacy manufacturing sites in the US, are 
based on judgements as to the estimated 
clean-up cost and also the length of time that 
operation and monitoring of the site is required.
In addition the group has contract related and 
other provisions based, for example, on 
estimates of the potential cost of settling any 
claims for damages by customers and, where 
appropriate, the cost of any new equipment or 
rework required under the contract.
Our work on the valuation of environmental liabilities comprised the following:
•	 We obtained the cost estimates and reports prepared by the group’s external 
environmental consultants, for the most significant sites, and discussed these with the 
group’s internal legal counsel. We agreed the provisions recorded to the cost estimates 
included in these reports. In addition we assessed the consistency of the cost estimates 
year on year and the level of costs incurred compared to the prior year estimates.
•	 We assessed the competence of the external environmental consultants including 
reviewing their qualifications and we assessed the level of historical accuracy of the 
estimates produced by these consultants and in-house legal experts by comparing them 
to the actual costs or settlements.
•	 We assessed the extent of insurance coverage against the known exposures including 
obtaining evidence of the insurers’ financial position to assess their ability to meet the 
commitments in these policies. 
We found no material exceptions in these tests.
Our work on contract related and other provisions included obtaining corroborating 
evidence for the directors’ cost estimates including looking at the historical level of actual 
costs incurred against the estimated costs and comparing the future cost estimates to the 
current actual costs. We also read legal and other correspondence with customers for 
evidence regarding claims outstanding or provided for at year end. In addition where 
insurance exists in respect of an exposure we read the correspondence with the insurers. 
We found no material exceptions in these tests.
We performed sensitivity analysis in respect of the cost estimates of contractual disputes 
(including estimated costs of settlement and the expected cost of production of new 
equipment or rework), to ascertain the extent of change in those estimates that either 
individually or collectively would be required for the provisions to be materially misstated. 
We discussed the likelihood of such a change in these estimates with the directors and 
agreed with their conclusion that this was unlikely.

Area of focus How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus
Revenue recognition under long term contract accounting primarily in the group’s energy business
Refer also to note 5 (page 98)
We focused on the recognition of revenue because 
where long term contract accounting is used, 
estimates and judgements are made in 
determining the amount of revenue to be recorded. 
The group’s long term contract accounting is 
primarily concentrated in its energy business 
which contracts to manufacture printed circuit 
heat exchangers. These comprise the majority of 
the group contract accounting revenue of £98.3m. 
The recognition of revenue is largely dependent on 
the estimated stage of completion of each contract 
which is determined based on the proportion of 
contract costs incurred for work performed to date 
compared to the estimated total contract costs.
As these contracts sometimes span a number of 
reporting periods, changes in the estimate of total 
contract costs or the inappropriate recording of 
costs around the year end could result in material 
amounts of revenue being recorded in the 
incorrect period.
 We tested revenue recognised under long term contract accounting as follows:
•	 Tested the calculation of stage of completion including testing the costs incurred and 
recorded against the contract for occurrence and accuracy, assessing the basis for 
determining the total contract cost and reperforming the percentage of completion 
calculation.
•	 Agreed that the revenue recognised was consistent with the calculated stage of 
completion.
•	 Tested whether the work allocated to contracts had been carried out in the period in 
which the revenue had been recognised.
•	 For raw materials in stock at year end and allocated to contracts, tested to confirm that 
these were made specifically for the contract and therefore that revenue was recorded 
in the appropriate period.
•	 Assessed the estimates of costs to complete for major contracts and also assessed the 
historical accuracy of the estimates of total contract costs.
•	 Examined any loss making contracts to determine the level of provisioning required and 
also assessed the actual profit or loss achieved on contracts that completed in the year 
compared to the forecast position in the prior year.
We found no instances of inappropriate revenue recognition.
Retirement benefit obligation liability
Refer also to note 33 (pages 121 to 125)
The group has retirement benefit obligations with 
gross liabilities of £1,078.9m, which are significant 
in the context of the overall balance sheet of the 
group.
The valuation of retirement benefit obligations 
requires significant levels of judgement and 
technical expertise in choosing appropriate 
assumptions. Small changes in a number of the 
key assumptions (including salary increases, 
inflation, discount rates and mortality) can have a 
material impact on the calculation of the liability. 
We evaluated the assumptions made in relation to the valuation of the liabilities. In 
particular:
•	 We compared assumed mortality rates to national and industry averages.
•	 We assessed the assumption for salary increases against the group’s historic trend and 
expected future outlook.
•	 We agreed the discount and inflation rates used to our internally developed benchmarks.
•	 We validated the census data used by the group’s actuaries to the underlying data held 
by the group and scheme administrators. 
We found no material exceptions in these tests.
Provisions for uncertain tax positions
Refer also to note 14 (page 105)
Judgements have to be made by management on 
the tax treatment of a number of transactions in 
advance of the ultimate tax determination being 
known. These uncertain tax outcomes result 
from the complexity of the group’s legal 
structure (including multiple legal entities) and 
the multiple tax jurisdictions (primarily the UK 
and US) and the changing tax environment in 
which the group operates. In addition uncertainty 
arises from the level of tax credits claimed and 
the level of intergroup transactions that are 
recorded. 
We evaluated the process by which management have calculated each exposure and we 
challenged the estimates made by management in arriving at the provision for uncertain tax 
positions. We also calculated our own range of outcomes in respect of each of the significant 
tax exposures. In addition we considered any tax opinions or other tax reports the group had 
received from its tax advisors in relation to the exposures identified to determine if the 
treatment is consistent with the advice obtained. We also tested the underlying calculation 
of the provision for uncertain tax positions. We found that the assumptions management 
have used in developing the estimated exposure provided a reasonable basis for 
provisioning.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed 
enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic 
structure of the group, the accounting processes and controls, 
and the industry in which the group operates. 
The group’s accounting process is structured around a local 
finance function in each of the group’s reporting units. These 
functions maintain their own accounting records and controls 
(although transactional processing and certain controls for 
some reporting units are performed at the group’s shared 
service centres) and report to the head office finance team 
through an integrated consolidation system.
In establishing the overall group audit strategy and plan, we 
determined the type of work that needed to be performed at 
the reporting units by the group engagement team and by

statements using the going concern basis of accounting. The 
going concern basis presumes that the group has adequate 
resources to remain in operation, and that the directors intend it 
to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial 
statements were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded 
that the directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
Other required reporting
Consistency of other information
Companies Act 2006 opinion
In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic report 
and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion:
•	 information in the Annual Report is:
 – materially inconsistent with the 
information in the audited financial 
statements; or
 – apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, our 
knowledge of the group acquired in the 
course of performing our audit; or
 – is otherwise misleading.
We have no 
exceptions to 
report arising from  
this responsibility.
•	 the statement given by the directors on page 
79, in accordance with provision C.1.1 of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (“the 
Code”), that they consider the Annual Report 
taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the 
information necessary for members to 
assess the group’s performance, business 
model and strategy is materially inconsistent 
with our knowledge of the group acquired in 
the course of performing our audit.
We have no 
exceptions to 
report arising from 
this responsibility. 
•	 	 the	section	of	the	Annual	Report	on	page	51,	
as required by provision C.3.8 of the Code, 
describing the work of the Audit Committee 
does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We have no 
exceptions to 
report arising from 
this responsibility.
Adequacy of information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit. We have no 
exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
component auditors from other PwC network firms or by our 
shared service centre teams. Where the work was performed 
by component auditors or our shared service centre teams, we 
determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the 
audit work at those reporting units so as to be able to conclude 
whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been 
obtained as a basis for our opinion on the group financial 
statements as a whole.
For each reporting unit we determined whether we required 
an audit of their complete financial information or whether 
specified procedures addressing parts of their financial 
information would be sufficient. Those where a complete audit 
was required included the largest reporting unit (Meggitt 
Aircraft Braking Systems Akron), because this makes up more 
than 15% of the group’s revenue and profits. We included a 
further 9 reporting units in 4 countries based on their size or 
risk and performed specified procedures on a further 7 
reporting units in respect of specific balances. 
The group consolidation, financial statement disclosures and a 
number of complex items were audited by the group 
engagement team at the head office. These included derivative 
financial instruments, hedge accounting, defined benefit 
pension schemes, share based payments and goodwill. The 
group engagement team also visited 10 businesses in 3 
countries (UK, USA and Switzerland) to review the work 
undertaken by component auditors and to assess the findings. 
Together these 17 reporting units accounted for 100% of Group 
profit before tax and 77% of net assets. This gave us the 
evidence we needed for our opinion on the financial statements 
as a whole.
Materiality
The scope of our audit is influenced by our application of 
materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for 
materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, 
helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, 
timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the 
effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial 
statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined 
materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall group materiality £11m (2013: £14m).
How we determined it Approximately 5% of profit before tax.
Rationale for benchmark 
applied
Consistent with last year, we applied this 
benchmark, a generally accepted 
auditing practice, in the absence of 
indicators that an alternative benchmark 
would be more appropriate.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them 
misstatements identified during our audit above £500,000 (2013: 
£500,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our 
view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ 
statement, set out on page 37, in relation to going concern. We 
have nothing to report having performed our review.
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have 
concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial 
93987_p80-84.indd   83 04/03/2015   17:36 84 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
We test and examine information, using sampling and other 
auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to 
provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We 
obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of 
controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to 
identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the company financial 
statements of Meggitt PLC for the year ended 31 December 
2014 and on the information in the Directors’ remuneration 
report that is described as having been audited.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and 
the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ 
responsibilities set out on pages 78 to 79, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs 
(UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: 
•	 whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; 
•	 the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by the directors; and 
•	 the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the 
directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our 
own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the 
financial statements.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
When a foreign subsidiary is disposed, the cumulative exchange 
differences relating to the retranslation of the net investment in the 
foreign subsidiary are recognised in the income statement as part of 
the gain or loss on disposal. This applies only to exchange differences 
recorded in equity after 1 January 2004. Exchange differences arising 
prior to 1 January 2004 remain in equity on disposal as permitted by 
IFRS 1 (‘First time Adoption of International Financial Reporting 
Standards’). 
Transactions between, and balances with, Group companies are 
eliminated together with unrealised gains on inter-group transactions. 
Unrealised losses are eliminated to the extent the asset transferred is 
not impaired. The accounting policies of acquired businesses are 
changed where necessary to be consistent with those of the Group.
The following items in respect of the acquisition and disposal of 
subsidiaries are excluded from the underlying profit measures used by 
the Board to monitor and measure the underlying performance of the 
Group (see note 10):
•	 A n y	a m o u nt s 	by	w hi c h 	th e	f a ir 	v a lu e 	of	n et 	a s s et s	of	an	a c q u ir e d

•	 C o s t s	di r e c t ly 	a t tr i b u t ab le	to	th e	a c qu i s i ti o n 	an d	in te gr a t i o n	of		
 a subsidiary;  
•	 A n y	g a in 	or	lo s s 	a r i s in g	f r om	th e	di s p o s a l 	of	a	s u b s i di a r y; 	an d 
•	 A d j u s tm en t s 	to	th e	f a ir 	v a lu e 	of	c o nt i n g e nt 	co n si d e r a t io n 	p a y ab le 	in		
 respect of the acquisition of a subsidiary or receivable in respect of  
 the disposal of a subsidiary. 
 
Foreign currencies
Functional and presentational currency
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds 
sterling. Items included in the financial statements of each of the 
Group’s subsidiaries are measured using the functional currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates.
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at exchange rates 
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are reported at exchange 
rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences on 
retranslating monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the 
income statement except where they relate to qualifying cash flow 
hedges or net investment hedges in which case exchange differences 
are recognised in hedging and translation reserves within other 
comprehensive income. 
Foreign subsidiaries
The results of foreign subsidiaries are translated at average exchange 
rates for the period. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are 
translated at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. 
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the results and 
opening net assets of foreign subsidiaries are recognised as a separate 
component of equity in hedging and translation reserves. Exchange 
differences on borrowings designated as net investment hedges of 
foreign subsidiaries are also recognised in hedging and translation 
reserves.

a foreign subsidiary are treated as assets and liabilities of the  
subsidiary and are retranslated at exchange rates prevailing at the 
balance sheet date.

financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and

instruments) at fair value.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group in the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements are set out below. 
These policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented 
unless stated otherwise. 
 
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of 
th e	C om p a ny	an d	al l	of 	it s	s u b si d ia r ie s . 	A	s u b si d ia r y 	is	an 	en ti t y 	o v er	
which the Group has control. The Group has control over an entity 
where the Group is exposed to, or has the rights to, variable returns 
from its involvement with the entity, and it has the power over the entity 
to affect those returns. The results of subsidiaries acquired are fully 
consolidated from the date on which control transfers to the Group. 
The results of subsidiaries disposed are fully consolidated up to the 
date on which control transfers from the Group. 
The cost of an acquisition is the fair value of consideration provided, 
including the fair value of any contingent consideration, as measured at 
the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent 
consideration are recorded in the income statement. Identifiable 
assets and liabilities of an acquired business meeting the conditions 
for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at fair value at the date of 
acquisition. To the extent the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair 
value of net assets acquired, the difference is recorded as goodwill. To 
the extent the fair value of net assets acquired exceeds the cost of an 
acquisition, the difference is recorded immediately in the income 
s t a tem en t . 	C os t s	di r e c t ly	a t tr i b u t ab le 	to 	an 	a c qu i s i ti o n 	ar e 	r ec o g n i s ed	
in the income statement as incurred.
When a subsidiary is acquired, the fair value of its identifiable assets 
and liabilities are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date. All 
f a ir	v a lu e 	a d j u s tm ent s 	ar e 	r ec o r d ed	w i th 	ef f e c t	f r om 	th e	d a te 	of	
acquisition and consequently may result in the restatement of 
previously reported financial results.
When a subsidiary is disposed, the difference between the fair 
value of consideration received or receivable and the value at which  
net assets of the subsidiary were recorded, immediately prior  
to disposal, is recognised in the income statement. Any contingent 
consideration receivable is measured at fair value at the date of 
di s p o s a l 	in	d e te r m in in g 	th e	g a in	or 	lo s s 	to 	be	r ec o g n i s ed .	C o nt i n g e nt 	
consideration is measured at fair value at each subsequent  
balance sheet date, with any changes in fair value recorded in  
the income statement.

Revenue from services
Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the 
contract. For ‘cost-plus fixed fee’ contracts, revenue is recognised 
equal to the costs incurred plus an appropriate proportion of the fee 
agreed with the customer. For other contracts, the stage of completion 
is typically measured by reference to contractual milestones achieved, 
number of aircraft flying hours or number of aircraft landings.
Revenue from funded research and development
Revenue is recognised according to the stage of completion of the 
contract. The stage of completion is typically measured by reference  
to contractual milestones achieved.
Exceptional operating items
Items which are significant by virtue of their size or nature, which are 
considered non-recurring and which are excluded from the underlying 
profit measures used by the Board to monitor and measure the 
underlying performance of the Group (see note 10) are classified as 
exceptional operating items. They include, for instance, gains or losses 
mad e	on	th e	di s p o s a l 	or	cl o su r e 	of	a	b us i ne s s , 	a d j u s tm ent s	to 	th e	f a ir	
value of contingent consideration payable in respect of an acquired 
business or receivable in respect of a disposed business, costs directly 
attributable to the acquisition and integration of a business, and 
significant site consolidation and other restructuring costs. 
Additionally in 2013, given its significance and non-recurring nature, 
the raw material supply issue described in note 11 was treated as an 
exceptional operating item. Exceptional operating items are included 
within the appropriate consolidated income statement category but are 
highlighted separately in the notes to the financial statements. 
 
Intangible assets
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair 
value of the Group’s share of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
and contingent liabilities assumed. Goodwill is tested annually for 
impairment, and also whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is carried 
at cost less amortisation charged prior to 1 January 2004 less 
accumulated impairment losses. In the event the subsidiary to which 
goodwill relates is disposed, its attributable goodwill is included in the 
determination of the gain or loss on disposal.
Research and development
Research expenditure is recognised as an expense in the income 
s t a tem en t 	as 	in c ur r e d . 	D e v e l o pme nt 	co s t s 	in c ur r e d	on 	p r o je c t s	w h er e 	
the related expenditure is separately identifiable, measurable and 
management are satisfied as to the ultimate technical and commercial 
v i a b il i t y	of	th e	p r o je c t 	an d	t h at 	th e	a s s et 	w il l	g en er a te 	f u t ur e 	e c o n o mic

amortisation is charged was reassessed and, as a result, the 
maximum life extended from 10 years to 15 years. The impact of this 
change, which has been applied prospectively, was to reduce the 
charge to the income statement in 2014 by approximately £7.0 million.

Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the fair value of consideration received or 
receivable in respect of goods and services provided in the normal 
course of business to external customers, net of trade discounts, 
returns and sales related taxes. 
Sale of goods
Re v enu e	is	r ec o g n i s ed 	w h en 	th e	s i g n i fi c a nt 	r i sk s 	an d	r e w ar d s 	of	
ownership have transferred to the customer, managerial involvement 
and control of the goods is not retained by the Group, the revenue and 
costs associated with the sale can be measured reliably and the 
c o l le c ti o n	of 	r e l a te d 	r e cei v ab le s	is	p r o b ab le. 	In	th e	ma j or i t y	of	
instances these conditions are met when delivery to the customer 
t a ke s	p l a ce. 	In	a	m in o r i t y 	of 	i n s t an ce s	‘ b il l 	an d	h ol d ’ 	ar r an g em en t s	
exist whereby revenue is recorded prior to delivery but only when the 
customer has accepted title to the goods, the goods are separately 
identifiable and available for delivery on terms agreed with the 
customer and normal credit terms apply.
Contract accounting revenue
The Group is usually able to reliably estimate the outcome of a contract 
at inception and accordingly recognises revenue and cost of sales by 
reference to the stage of completion of the contract. Revenue is 
typically measured by applying to total contract revenue, the 
p r op or t i on	co s t s 	in c ur r e d 	fo r 	w or k 	pe r f o r m ed	in 	th e	p er i o d	b e ar	to	
total estimated contract costs. Where it is not possible to reliably 
estimate the outcome of a contract, revenue is recognised equal to 
costs incurred, provided recovery of such costs is probable. If total 
contract costs are forecast to exceed total contract revenue then the 
expected loss is recorded immediately in the income statement.

Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction or production

Tax payable is based on taxable profit for the period, calculated using 
tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Impairment of non-current non-financial assets
Assets are reviewed for impairment annually and also whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be 
recoverable. To the extent the carrying value exceeds the recoverable 
amount, the difference is recorded as an expense in the income 
statement. The recoverable amount used for impairment testing is the 
higher of the value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. For the 
purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest level 
for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are 
largely independent of cash inflows from other assets or groups of 
assets. At each balance sheet date, previously recorded impairment 
losses, other than any relating to goodwill, are reviewed and if  
no longer required reversed with a corresponding credit to the  
income statement.
Inventories
Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

production overheads, based on normal operating capacity, and is 
determined using the first-in first-out (FIFO) method. Net realisable 
value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected 
to be incurred to completion and disposal. 
When a subsidiary is acquired, finished goods are valued at fair value, 
which is typically estimated selling price less costs of disposal and a

subsequently disposed post acquisition, the fair value is charged to the 
income statement. The difference between the fair value of the 
inventory disposed and its actual cost of manufacture is excluded from 
the underlying profit measures used by the Board to monitor and 
measure the underlying performance of the Group (see note 10).
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items  
where appropriate and for unrealised profits on items of  
inter-group manufacture. 
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Programme participation costs
Programme participation costs consist of incentives given to Original 
Equipment Manufacturers in connection with their selection of the 
Group’s products for installation onto new aircraft where the Group 
has obtained principal supplier status. These incentives comprise cash 
payments and/or the supply of initial manufactured parts on a free of 
charge or deeply discounted basis. Programme participation costs are 
recognised as an intangible asset and carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses. For manufactured parts supplied 
on a free of charge or deeply discounted basis, cost represents the cost 
of manufacture transferred from inventory less the value of any 
revenue received or receivable. Amortisation is charged over the 
periods expected to benefit from receiving the status of principal 
supplier, through the sale of replacement parts, typically up to  
15 years. 
Other intangible assets
a) Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination
For acquisitions, the Group recognises intangible assets separately 
from goodwill provided they are separable or arise from contractual or 
other legal rights and their fair value can be measured reliably. 
Intangible assets are initially recognised at fair value, which is 
regarded as their cost. Intangible assets are subsequently held at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Where 
intangible assets have finite lives, their cost is amortised on a 
straight-line basis over those lives. The nature of intangible assets 
recognised and their estimated useful lives are as follows:
C us tom e r	r el a t i o n s hi p s .............................. Up to 25 years
Technology  .................................................. Up to 25 years
Tr ade 	n am e s	an d	tr a d em ar k s .................... Up to 25 years

Amortisation of intangible assets acquired as part of a business 
combination is excluded from the underlying profit measures used by 
the Board to monitor and measure the underlying performance of the 
Group (see note 10).
b) Other purchased intangible assets
P ur c h a s e d	l icen ce s , 	tr a d em ar k s , 	p a te n t s 	an d 	s of t w a r e	ar e 	c arrie d 	at

Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful economic life, typically over periods up to 10 years. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses, except for land which is recorded 
at	co s t 	le s s 	a c c u m u l a te d 	im p a ir m e n t 	l o s s es. 	C os t	in c lu d e s

When property, plant and equipment is disposed, the difference 
between sale proceeds, net of related costs, and the carrying value of 
the asset is recognised in the income statement.

Provision is made for environmental liabilities, onerous contracts, 
product warranty claims and other liabilities when the Group has a

specific to the obligation which have not been reflected in the 
undiscounted provision. The impact of the unwinding of discounting  
is recognised in the income statement within net finance costs.
Retirement benefit schemes
For defined benefit schemes, pension costs and the costs of providing 
other post-retirement benefits, principally healthcare, are charged to 
the income statement in accordance with the advice of qualified 
independent actuaries. 
Past service credits and costs are recognised immediately in the 
income statement.
Retirement benefit obligations represent, for each scheme, the 
difference between the fair value of the schemes’ assets and the 
present value of the schemes’ defined benefit obligations measured at 
the balance sheet date. The defined benefit obligation is calculated 
a n n u al ly	by	i n d ep en d en t 	ac tu a r i e s 	u s in g 	th e	p r o j ec ted 	un i t 	c r e di t 	
method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is 
determined by discounting the defined benefit obligations using 
interest rates of high quality corporate bonds denominated in the 
currency in which the benefits will be paid and with terms to maturity 
comparable with the terms of the related defined benefit obligations. 
Where the Group has a statutory or contractual minimum funding 
r e qu i r em en t	to	m a ke 	c o ntr i b u ti o n s 	to	a	s c h em e	in	r e s pec t 	of	p as t	
service and any such contributions are not available to the Group once 
paid (either as a reduction in future contributions or as a refund during 
the life of the scheme or when the scheme liabilities are settled, to 
which the Group has an irrevocable right), an additional liability for 
such amounts is recognised.
Remeasurement gains and losses are recognised in the period in 
which they arise in other comprehensive income.
For defined contribution schemes, payments are recognised in the 
income statement when they fall due. The Group has no further 
obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Share-based compensation
The Group operates a number of equity-settled and cash-settled 
share-based compensation schemes.
For equity-settled schemes, the fair value of an award is measured at 
th e 	d a te	of	g r a nt 	an d	r e flec t s 	an y	ma r ke t -b a s e d	v est in g	co n d i t io n s .	
No n	ma r ke t -b a s e d	v est in g	co n d i t io n s 	ar e 	excl u d e d	f r om	th e	f a ir	v a lu e

a w ar d s 	e xpec ted	to	v est 	as 	a	r e s ult	of	n on 	ma r ke t -b a s e d 	v est in g	
conditions and the fair value of this estimated number of awards is 
recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the period for which services are received. At each balance 
sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of awards 
e xpec ted	to	v est 	as 	a	r e s ult	of	n on 	ma r ke t -b a s e d	v est in g	co n d i t io n s

directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital 
(nominal value) and share premium.
For cash-settled schemes, the total amount recognised is based on the 
fair value of the liability incurred. The fair value of the liability is 
remeasured at each balance sheet date with changes in fair value 
recognised in the income statement for the period.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost less any impairment losses. 
An impairment is recognised in the income statement, when there is 
o b j e c ti v e	e v i d en ce 	th e	Gr ou p 	w il l	n ot	be	ab le 	to	c o l le c t 	al l 	a m o u nt s	du e

recorded is the difference between the carrying value of the receivable 
and its estimated future cash flows discounted where appropriate.

Trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently

L e as e s	w h er e	th e	Gr ou p 	ha s 	s u b s t an ti al l y	al l	th e 	r i sk s	an d	r e w ar d s 	 
of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are 
capitalised at commencement of the lease at the lower of fair value of 
the leased asset and present value of the minimum lease payments. 
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance 
charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance 
outstanding. The corresponding lease obligations, net of finance 
charges, are included in liabilities. Assets acquired under finance 
leases are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the 
useful life of the asset or the lease term.
L e as e s	in	w hi c h 	a	s i g n i fi c a nt 	p or t i on	of 	th e	r i sk s	an d	r e w ar d s 	of	
ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Payments made under operating leases, net of any incentives 
received from the lessor, are charged to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the period of the lease. 
Dividends
Interim dividends are recognised as liabilities when they are approved 
by the Board. Final dividends are recognised as liabilities when they 
are approved by the shareholders.
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, being proceeds 
received less directly attributable transaction costs incurred. 
Borrowings are generally subsequently measured at amortised cost 
with any transaction costs amortised to the income statement over the 
p er i o d	of	th e	b or r o w i n gs 	u s in g 	th e	ef f e c t i v e	inte r est 	me t ho d. 	C e r t a in 	
borrowings however are designated as fair value through profit and 
loss at inception, if the Group has interest rate derivatives in place 
which have the economic effect of converting fixed rate borrowings into 
floating rate borrowings. Such borrowings are measured at fair value 
at each balance sheet date with any movement in fair value recorded in 
the income statement within net operating costs. Movements in fair 
value are excluded from the underlying profit measures used by the 
Board to monitor and measure the underlying performance of the 
Group (see note 10).
Any related interest accruals are included within borrowings. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an 
unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 
months after the balance sheet date.

Derivatives not meeting the criteria for hedge accounting
Where derivatives do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, 
changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income 
statement. The Group utilises a large number of foreign currency 
forward contracts to mitigate against currency fluctuations.  
The Group has determined the additional costs of meeting the 
extensive documentation requirements in order to apply hedge 
accounting under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’ are not merited. Gains and losses arising from 
measuring these contracts at fair value are excluded from the 
underlying profit measures used by the Board to monitor and  
measure the underlying performance of the Group (see note 10). 
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new shares are deducted from the proceeds 
recorded in equity. 
O wn	s h ar e s 	r ep r e s en t 	s h ar e s 	in 	th e	C om p a ny	t h at	ar e 	he ld	by 	an

shares purchased is deducted from retained earnings. The shares 
when purchased are cancelled and the nominal value of the cancelled 
shares is transferred from share capital to a separate capital 
redemption reserve. Where the Group has entered into an irrevocable 
non-discretionary contract to purchase for cancellation shares on its 
behalf during a close period, the obligation to purchase shares is 
recognised in full at the inception of the contract, even when the 
obligation is conditional on the share price. The obligation is 
remeasured at each balance sheet date with changes recognised in the 
income statement.

Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure 
to	inte r est	r a te	r i sk 	an d 	f o r e i gn 	c ur r e n c y 	tr an s a c ti o n a l 	r i sk .	D er i v a ti v e 	
financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date 
the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date using values 
determined indirectly from quoted prices that are observable for the 
asset or liability. 
The method by which any gain or loss arising from remeasurement  
is recognised depends on whether the instrument is designated as  
a hedging instrument and if so the nature of the item hedged. The 
Group recognises an instrument as a hedging instrument by 
documenting, at inception of the instrument, the relationship between 
th e	in s t r um e n t	an d	th e	h ed g ed	i te m 	an d 	th e	o b j e c ti v e s 	an d	s t r a te g y	fo r 	
un d e r t a k in g	th e	h e dg i ng	tr an s a c ti o n . 	To 	be	d e s i g n a te d	as 	a	h e dg i ng 	
instrument, an instrument must also be assessed, at inception and on 
an ongoing basis, to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair 
values or cash flows of hedged items. 
To the extent the maturity of the financial instrument is more than 12 
months from the balance sheet date, the fair value is reported as a 
non-current asset or non-current liability. All other derivative financial 
instruments are reported as current assets or current liabilities. 
Fair value hedges
Ch a n g e s	in	f a ir 	v a lu e	of 	d er i v a ti v e	fi n an c i al 	in s t r um e n t s , 	t h at	ar e 	
designated and qualify as fair value hedges, are recognised in the 
income statement within net operating costs together with changes in 
fair value of the hedged item. Any difference between the movement in 
fair value of the derivatives and the hedged item is excluded from the 
underlying profit measures used by the Board to monitor and measure 
the underlying performance of the Group (see note 10). The Group 
currently only applies fair value hedge accounting to the hedging of 
fi xe d 	inte r est 	r a te	r i sk 	on 	b or r o w i n gs .
Cash flow hedges
Ch a n g e s	in	f a ir 	v a lu e	of 	th e	ef f e c t i v e	p or t i on	of 	d er i v a ti v e 	fi n an c i al

value of any ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the 
income statement within net operating costs. 
To the extent changes in fair value are recognised in other 
comprehensive income, they are recycled to the income statement in 
the periods in which the hedged item affects the income statement. 
The Group currently only applies cash flow hedge accounting to the 
h e dg i ng 	of	fl o at i n g 	inte r est 	r a te	r i sk 	on 	b or r o w i n gs .
If the forecast transaction to which the cash flow hedge relates is  
no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income 
statement immediately. If the hedging instrument is sold, expires or no 
longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the cumulative gain or 
loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is 
transferred to the income statement when the forecast transaction is 
recognised in the income statement.
Net investment hedges
Hedges of net investments of foreign subsidiaries are accounted for in 
a	s i mi l ar 	w ay	to 	c a sh 	flo w 	h e d g es.	Ch a n g e s 	in	f a ir	v a lu e 	of	th e	ef f e c t i v e

On the acquisition of a business, it is necessary to attribute fair values to any intangible assets acquired, provided they meet the criteria to be

estimate the point at which research activities conclude and development activities commence. Absent a contract, the Group also does not believe 
there is generally sufficient certainty over the future economic benefits that will be generated from the technology, to allow capitalisation of those

Environmental matters
The Group is involved in the investigation and remediation of certain sites for which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party under 
US law. Advice is received by the Group from its environmental consultants and legal advisors to assist in the determination of the timing and 
estimation of the costs the Group may incur in respect of such claims and appropriate provisions are made. The Group has extensive insurance 
arrangements in place to mitigate the impact of historical environmental events on the Group. To the extent estimates in respect of claims change

b.  Although the Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against foreign currency exposures, it has decided that the costs of 
meeting the extensive documentation requirements to be able to apply hedge accounting under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’ are not merited. The Group’s underlying profit figures exclude amounts which would not have been recorded if hedge accounting 
had been applied. 
  Where interest rate derivatives do not qualify to be hedge accounted, movements in the fair value of the derivatives are excluded from 
underlying profit. Where interest rate derivatives do qualify to be hedge accounted, any difference between the movement in the fair value of 
derivatives and in the fair value of fixed rate borrowings is excluded from underlying profit.

 investing activities.
c. In 2013, the Group announced it had identified an issue relating to the supply from a vendor of non-conforming raw material in one of our   
 businesses. A provision of £20.0 million was made for the estimated cost of this issue, including where necessary the replacement of the   
 relevant parts over the next few years. No amounts were recorded in the income statement in respect of this issue in 2014.
The tax credit in respect of exceptional operating items was £4.1 million (2013: £10.7 million).

the total taxation charge for 2014 to increase, or reduce respectively, by approximately £2.1 million.

effect of converting fixed rate US dollar borrowings into floating rate US dollar borrowings. To the extent they meet the criteria for hedge 
accounting, the floating rate to fixed rate swap contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges and the fixed rate to floating rate swap contracts 
as fair value hedges. 
Foreign currency forward contracts
Although the Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against foreign currency exposures, it has decided that the costs of 
meeting the extensive documentation requirements to be able to apply hedge accounting under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’ are not merited.

water as well as the handling, storage and disposal of such materials and other environmental matters. Failure to comply with its obligations 
potentially exposes the Group to serious consequences, including fines, other sanctions and limitations on operations. The Group is involved in 
the investigation and remediation of current and former sites for which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party under US law. 
Provision has been made for the expected costs arising from these sites based on information currently available. The provisions are expected 
to be substantially utilised over the next fifteen years and are discounted, where appropriate, using an appropriate discount rate. A receivable 
has been established to the extent these costs are recoverable under the Group’s environmental insurance policies or from other parties (see 
n o te	2 3) .	T he 	n et	ch a r ge 	to 	n et	o p er a ti n g 	co s t s 	of	£16 . 6	m il l i o n	w as	p a r t ly	of f s et 	by	a	c r e di t	to	n et 	o p er a ti n g	co s t s 	of	£ 9.7 	m il l i o n , 	r ec o g n i s ed	in	
respect of an increase in the year in amounts recoverable under these insurance policies and from other parties. 
b.  Onerous contracts include lease obligations and trading contracts. Provision has been made for the estimated rental shortfall in respect of 
properties with onerous lease obligations. These will be utilised over the lease terms typically up to five years and are discounted, where 
appropriate, using a discount rate appropriate to each provision. Provision has also been made for estimated losses under certain trading 
contracts. As described in note 11, during 2013 the Group was made aware of an issue relating to the supply from a vendor of non-conforming 
raw material in one of our businesses. Provision has been made for the estimated future costs associated with this matter, which include the 
provision of a number of free of charge replacement parts to customers over a period of several years. There are a number of uncertainties 
regarding the ultimate amounts that will be payable, including the extent to which replacement parts will be required. However, the directors 
believe, based on the information currently available, that the ultimate outcome will not be significantly different from that recognised. Onerous 
trading contract provisions are expected to be substantially utilised over the next ten years and are discounted, where appropriate, using a 
discount rate appropriate to each provision.
c.  Provision has been made for product warranty claims. These provisions are expected to be utilised over the next three years. 
d.  A number of asbestos-related claims have been made against subsidiary companies of the Group. To date, the amount connected with such 
claims in any year has not been material and many claims are covered fully or partly by existing insurance and indemnities. There is a provision

Government approves certain past or future remedial costs incurred or to be incurred by the Group’s US subsidiaries. In addition, the Group is 
required to implement additional future compliance measures. No provision is held for the suspended penalty as it is not considered probable 
that such amounts will be payable. The provisions are expected to be substantially utilised over the next ten years and are discounted, where 
appropriate, using a discount rate appropriate to each provision.

33. Retirement benefit obligations
Pension schemes
The Group operates a number of pension schemes for the benefit of its employees. The nature of each scheme which has a significant impact on 
the financial statements is as follows: 
•	 	 In	th e	UK ,	th e	Gr ou p	o p e r a te s 	a	f un d e d	d efi n e d 	b en e fi t 	s c h em e	w hi c h 	is	c lo s e d	to	ne w	m em b er s 	bu t 	o p en	to	f u t ur e	a c cr ua l 	fo r 	ex is t i n g

open to future accrual for existing members. The schemes are a mixture of funded and unfunded schemes; and

The UK and US schemes provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life. The benefits provided depend on a 
m em b er ’ s 	 len g th 	 of 	 s er v ice. 	 Fo r 	 th e 	 ma j or i t y 	 of 	 s c h em e s , 	 th e 	 b en e fi t s 	 ar e 	 al s o 	 d ep en d ent 	 on 	 s al ar y 	 at 	 r e ti r em ent 	 or 	 a v er a g e 	 s al ar y 	 o v er 	
employment in the final years leading up to retirement. In the US, one scheme provides a fixed benefit for each year of service. The Swiss scheme 
has many of the characteristics of a defined contribution scheme but provides for certain minimum benefits to be guaranteed to members. 
For all funded schemes, benefit payments are made from funds administered by third parties unrelated to the Group. The assets of such schemes 
are held in trust funds, or their equivalent, separate from the Group’s finances.

also agree funding arrangements with the Group.

Meggitt is a named fiduciary with the authority to manage the operation of the US schemes.
For all unfunded schemes, benefit payments are made by the Group as obligations fall due. The Group also operates a number of defined 
contribution schemes under which the Group has no further obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Healthcare schemes
The Group has two principal other post-retirement benefit schemes providing medical and life assurance benefits to certain employees, and

Asset volatility 
In determining the present value of schemes’ defined benefit obligations, liabilities are discounted using interest rates of high quality corporate 
bonds. To the extent the actual return on schemes’ assets is below this yield, the retirement benefit obligations recognised in the consolidated

asset values are offset by similar changes in the value of scheme liabilities. However, the Group also invests in other asset types such as equities, 
property, hedge funds, commodities and derivatives where movements in asset values may be uncorrelated to movements in the yields on high 
quality corporate bonds. The Group believes that, due to the long-term nature of its scheme liabilities, it is appropriate to invest in assets which 
are expected to out-perform corporate bonds over this timeframe. Scheme assets are well diversified, such that the failure of any single

The Group operates a number of share schemes for the benefit of its employees. The total expense recorded in the income statement in respect  
of such schemes was £1.7 million (2013: £11.9 million) (see note 9). The nature of each scheme which has a significant impact on the expense 
recorded in the income statement is set out below.

Under the Meggitt Long Term Incentive Plan 2014, an annual award of shares may be made to certain senior executives. For awards made in 2014 
the number of shares, if any that an executive ultimately receives, depends on three performance conditions:
•	 	 An	e a r n in g s 	p er	s h ar e 	(E P S ) 	me as u r e	(3 3 % 	of 	th e	a w a r d );

Cash-settled
Awards are no longer made under this scheme. Under the scheme the Group was able to grant cash-settled SARs to certain overseas employees. 
The Group is required to pay the intrinsic value of the SARs to the employee at the date of exercise. Awards can only be exercised if the Group 
meets an earnings per share performance condition. Awards may be exercised at any point between the vesting date and ten years after the date 
the award was made.

Meggitt Equity Participation Plan 2005 
Awards are no longer made under this scheme. Under the Meggitt Equity Participation Plan 2005, an annual award of shares could be made  
to certain senior executives. For awards made under the plan, the number of shares an executive ultimately receives, depends on three 
performance conditions:
•	 	 An	e a r n in g s 	p er 	s h ar e 	(E P S ) 	me as u r e	(5 0 %	of 	th e	a w a r d ); 	
•	 	 A	c a sh	flo w 	me as u r e	(2 5 % 	of 	th e	a w a r d );	an d

of the award).
Each of the conditions is measured over a three year performance period. An expense of £0.3 million (2013: £5.4 million) was recorded in the year.

Operating lease commitments
The Group leases various factories, warehouses and offices under non-cancellable operating leases. These leases have various lease periods, 
escalation clauses and renewal rights. None of these terms represent unusual arrangements or create material onerous or beneficial rights or 
obligations. Additionally the Group leases various items of plant and machinery under both cancellable and non-cancellable operating leases. 
Expenditure on operating leases is charged to the income statement as incurred and is disclosed in note 8.
The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non–cancellable operating leases are as follows:

Other financial commitments
The Group enters into long-term arrangements with Aircraft and original equipment manufacturers to design, develop and supply products to 
them for the life of the aircraft. This represents a significant long-term financial commitment for the Group and requires the consideration of a 
number of uncertainties including the feasibility of the product and the ultimate commercial viability over a period which can extend over 40 years. 
The directors are satisfied that, at this time, there are no significant contingent liabilities arising from these commitments. Based on latest OE 
delivery forecasts from external agencies, the future estimated expenditure under contractual commitments to incur development costs and

Other Companies Act 2006 reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report 
arising from this responsibility. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
set out on pages 78 to 79, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do 
not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or 
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An 
audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This 
includes an assessment of: 
•	 whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; 
•	 the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made 
by the directors; and 
•	 	 th e	ov e r a ll	p r e s e nt a t i o n 	of	th e	fi na nci a l 	s t a tem en t s . 	
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the 
directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our 
own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial 
statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other 
auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to 
provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain 
audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, 
substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information 
in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of 
performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of 
Meggitt PLC for the year ended 31 December 2014.

Report on the company financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion, Meggitt PLC’s company financial statements (the 
‘financial statements’):
•	 give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2014;
•	 have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
•	 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
What we have audited
Meggitt PLC’s financial statements comprise:
•	 the Company balance sheet as at 31 December 2014; and
•	 the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the 
Annual Report and Accounts (the ‘Annual Report’), rather than in the 
notes to the financial statements. These are cross-referenced from 
the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
Other required reporting
Consistency of other information
Companies Act 2006 opinion
In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic report and 
the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial 
statements.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs 
(UK & Ireland)’) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
information in the Annual Report is:
•	 materially inconsistent with the information in the audited  
 financial statements; or

Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at exchange rates 
prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and 
liabilities, denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date, 
are reported at exchange rates prevailing at that date. Exchange 
differences on retranslating monetary assets and liabilities are 
recognised in the profit and loss account, except where they relate to 
qualifying cash flow hedges in which case the exchange differences are 
recognised in equity. 
Pension scheme arrangements
As the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets 
and liabilities of the Meggitt Pension Plan on a consistent and 
reasonable basis, the Company accounts for the scheme as though it 
were a defined contribution scheme. Accordingly the amount charged 
to the profit and loss account is the contribution payable in the period. 
Differences between contributions payable in the period and 
contributions paid are shown as accruals or prepayments in the 
balance sheet. 
Share-based compensation
The fair value of services received from employees is recognised as  
an expense in the profit and loss account over the period for which 
services are received (‘the vesting period’). 
Awards made to employees of the Company are equity-settled. The fair 
value of an award is measured at the date of grant and reflects any 
market-based vesting conditions. Non market-based vesting 
conditions are excluded from the fair value of the award. At the date of 
grant, the Company estimates the number of awards expected to vest 
as a result of non market-based vesting conditions and the fair value of 
this estimated number of awards is recognised as an expense in the 
profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. 
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimate of the 
number of awards expected to vest as a result of non market-based 
vesting conditions and adjusts the amount recognised cumulatively in 
the profit and loss account to reflect the revised estimate. Proceeds 
received, net of directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to 
share capital (nominal value) and share premium.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to 
employees of subsidiary undertakings, is treated as a capital 
contribution. The fair value of the awards made is recognised, over the 
vesting period, as an increase in investment in subsidiary 
undertakings, with a corresponding credit to the profit and loss 
reserve.
Shares in the Company are held by an independently managed 
Employee Share Ownership Trust (‘ESOP Trust’), to meet future 
obligations in respect of the Company’s employee share schemes.  
The cost of own shares held by the ESOP Trust is deducted from 
shareholders’ funds.
1. Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern 
basis and under the historical cost accounting convention, as modified 
by the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities 
(including derivative financial instruments) at fair value, in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006. The Company continues to prepare its 
financial statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (UK GAAP). 
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Company in the 
preparation of the financial statements are set out below. These 
policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented unless 
stated otherwise.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for 
impairment in value, except for investments acquired before 1 January 
1988 where Section 612 merger relief has been taken and investments 
are stated at the nominal value of the shares issued in consideration.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any 
impairment losses. Cost includes the original purchase price of the 
asset and costs attributable to bringing the asset into use. 
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land. On other assets it is 
provided in equal annual instalments over their estimated useful lives  
as follows:
Land and buildings ...................................... Over period of lease
Plant and equipment ................................... 3 to 10 years
Motor vehicles.............................................. 5 years
Operating leases
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss 
account on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the 
payments are not made on this basis.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the period and takes 
into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between 
the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred taxation is provided in full, without discounting, on timing 
differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay 
more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected  
to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law. 
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent it is regarded as 
more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred taxation is not provided on timing differences arising from  
the sale or revaluation of fixed assets unless, at the balance sheet date, 
a binding commitment to sell the asset has been entered into and it is 
unlikely that any gain will qualify for rollover relief.
Notes to the financial statements of the Company
93987_p135-140.indd   135 04/03/2015   17:15 136 MEGGITT PLC          REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
Notes to the financial statements of the Company continued
Loans
Loans are initially stated at proceeds received less directly attributable 
transaction costs incurred. Transaction costs are amortised to the 
profit and loss account over the period of the loans. Fixed interest rate 
borrowings are held at fair value where a hedge relationship is in 
place. Any related interest accruals are included within the value at 
which loans are recorded. Loans are classified as current liabilities 
unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of 
the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. 
Capital instruments 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new shares are deducted from the proceeds 
recorded in equity. Other instruments are classified as liabilities if they 
contain an obligation to transfer economic benefits, otherwise they are 
included in shareholders’ funds.
Dividends
Interim dividends are recognised when they are approved by the Board. 
Final dividends are recognised when they are approved by the 
Company’s shareholders.
Profit and recognised gains and losses of the Company
The Company has taken advantage of the legal dispensation contained 
in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 allowing it not to publish a 
separate profit and loss account and related notes. The Company has 
also taken advantage of the legal dispensation contained in Section 408 
of the Companies Act 2006 allowing it not to publish a separate 
statement of recognised gains and losses.
Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 8 
from the requirement to disclose related party transactions within  
the Group.
Share buyback
On 5 November 2014, the Company announced the intention to 
commence a share buyback programme. The total consideration 
payable for shares purchased is deducted from the profit and loss 
reserve. The shares when purchased are cancelled and the nominal 
value of the cancelled shares is transferred from share capital to a 
separate capital redemption reserve. Where the Company has entered 
into an irrevocable non-discretionary contract to purchase for 
cancellation, shares on its behalf during a close period, the obligation 
to purchase shares is recognised in full at the inception of the contract, 
even when that obligation is conditional on the share price. The 
obligation is remeasured at each balance sheet date with changes 
recognised in the profit and loss account.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value on the 
date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date. To the extent the 
maturity of the financial instrument is more than 12 months from the 
balance sheet date, the fair value is reported as a non-current asset or 
liability. Derivative financial instruments with maturities of less than  
12 months from the balance sheet are shown as current assets or 
liabilities. The method by which any gain or loss is recognised depends 
on the designation of the derivative financial instrument:
Fair value hedges
Fair value hedges are hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or 
liabilities or a firm commitment. Interest rate swaps that change fixed 
rate interest to variable rate interest are treated as fair value hedges 
provided they meet the hedge criteria. Changes in the fair value of 
derivative financial instruments, designated as fair value hedges, are 
recognised in the profit and loss account together with changes in the 
fair value of the hedged item. 
Cash flow hedges
Cash flow hedges are hedges of highly probable forecast transactions. 
Interest rate swaps that change variable rate interest to fixed rate 
interest are treated by the Company as cash flow hedges provided they 
meet the hedge criteria. Changes in fair value of the effective portion of 
derivative financial instruments, designated as cash flow hedges, are 
initially recorded within equity. To the extent changes in fair value are 
recorded in equity, they are recycled to the profit and loss account in 
the periods in which the hedged item affects the profit and loss 
account. However, when the transaction to which the hedge relates 
results in the recognition of a non-monetary asset or a liability then 
gains and losses previously recognised in equity are included in the 
initial measurement of the cost of the non-monetary asset or liability.
If the forecast transaction to which the cash flow hedge relates is no 
longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in equity is transferred to the profit and loss account 
immediately. If the hedging instrument is sold, expires or no longer 
meets the criteria for hedge accounting the cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognised in equity is transferred to the profit and loss 
account when the forecast transaction is recognised in the profit and 
loss account.
Derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting 
Where derivatives do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, 
changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the profit and loss 
account. The Company utilises a number of foreign currency forward 
contracts to mitigate against currency fluctuations. The Company has 
determined that the additional costs of meeting the extensive 
documentation requirements for the Company’s large number of 
foreign currency contracts are not merited. Accordingly gains and 
losses arising from measuring the contracts at fair value are recorded 
immediately in the profit and loss account.

Smart engineering is second nature to us
High pressure air travelling through the 
geometry of bleed air valves cast or 
machined in the traditional way is 
extremely noisy, something that will be 
familiar to those who live near airports. 
In future, air could flow more quietly 
through a radical new concept from 
Meggitt based on a fir-cone design, an 
organic structure made possible through 
additive layer manufacturing. The bold use 
of innovative processes forms part of 
Meggitt’s centrally coordinated and highly 
focused technology strategy.

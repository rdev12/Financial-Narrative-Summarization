Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Welcome
Johnston Press plc is one of the UK’s leading  
local media providers. We have the largest daily 
digital audience of any regional publisher. We are 
transforming local media, through comprehensive 
relaunches of all our titles in print and online and 
introducing innovative new products and services 
to grow audiences across all platforms.

The first two phases of  
the newspaper relaunch 
were commenced with 
successes in increasing 
newspaper sales revenue.

Sales Effectiveness 
Our sales programme  
of new structures and 
customer propositions to 
improve relationships with 
advertisers and provide 
new products, continues  
to be rolled out across  
the Group.
See more on page 16.
Mobile Websites, Tablet 
and Smartphone Apps
All of the Group’s digital 
products can now be 
accessed by mobile. 
During the year we 
launched 18 tablet  
apps and 11 smartphone 
football apps with our 
digital audience growing 
from 8 million to over  
10 million.

2012 proved to be another difficult 
year for local media, but we have 
worked hard to develop our 
strategy to compete in a rapidly 
changing environment.
Chairman’s Statement
also has an essential role to play as we 
continue the relaunch of our titles and 
focus on improving our subscription rates. 
All of this will be set against the overriding 
objective of continuing the huge strides we 
have made in reducing the Group’s debt.
The difficult trading environment which we 
reported for the early part of 2012 continued 
throughout the year with the UK economy 
returning to recession. Digital advertising 
revenues grew strongly by 12.0% to £20.6 
million, but were not sufficient to prevent  
a decline in total revenues before non-
recurring items for the year of £45.2 million 
(12.1%) to £328.7 million (see page 18). 
Although our title re-launches and cover 
price increases resulted in only a 4.0% 
decline in newspaper sales revenue, print 
advertising revenues dropped by 14.8%  
to £181.3 million. The Group’s cost 
performance for the year was outstanding, 
with non-recurring operating costs down by 
£37.6 million (12.2%). Our underlying 
operating profit (before non-recurring and 
IAS 21/39 items) for 2012 fell by 4.7% after 
adjusting for the impact of the partial 
cancellation of our printing arrangements 
with News International. This contributed 
(£3.9 million) to the reduction in headline 
operating profit to £57.0 million (down 11.6% 
on 2011) and delivered a one-off cash receipt 
of £30.0 million. There was an operating 
profit margin of 17.4%, a slight increase  
on 2011. 
Underlying earnings per share (before 
non-recurring and IAS 21/39 items) were 
3.42p, compared to 3.50p in 2011. Net 
profit after tax was £5.6 million. Cash flow 
performance was once again strong with 
net debt at the end of the year of £319.4 
million, a reduction of £32.3 million from  
the start of 2012.
The steps forward that we have made in 
strategic development this year helped to 
push our share price to higher levels in the 
autumn than we had seen for some time, 
although there is much to do to return it  
“ The pace of change and innovation 
increased across the Group during the 
year and that will continue in 2013.”
We laid out our strategic aims for the 
Group’s development last April and are 
now implementing that vision for the future 
of our business. The pace of change and 
innovation increased across the Group 
during the year and that will continue in 
2013. Our Chief Executive Ashley Highfield 
provides more details of subsequent steps 
– and future plans – in his report. It is 
essential that we increase our profitability 
and use the changes and innovations that 
we are undertaking to grow revenues.  
To do so, digital will be key (both in terms 
of new services and growing our audience 
reach) but our established print business   Overview

to satisfactory levels. We continue to use 
excess cash to reduce the Group’s debt 
and, as required under our financing 
arrangements, no dividend is proposed  
for the year. 
Our industry has once more been in the 
spotlight with the publication of the Leveson 
Report. We support the principle of effective 
redress for complaints relating to the local 
press and the efforts of the industry to put  
in place a new system of self-regulation 
without resorting to legislation which could 
potentially burden a fragile sector with 
crippling costs. 
At the end of March, Danny Cammiade, 
who has served as our Chief Operating 
Officer since 2005, will step down. Danny 
started his career with TR Beckett which 
became part of Johnston Press in 1992 
and has over 35 years of experience in the 
newspaper industry. He leaves with our 
thanks for his work over that time and we 
wish him well for the future. In accordance 
with best practice, all of our continuing 
Board will stand for re-election at our 
Annual General Meeting on 26 April.
I am satisfied that our Board remains 
effective and it regularly reviews both  
the balance of its membership and the 
issues which it considers when it meets.  
Its meetings are structured to scrutinise 
both strategic and operational matters in  
an atmosphere of constructive challenge  
and debate. A key feature of our Board’s 
effectiveness is our programme of site  
visits for all of our Non-Executive Directors. 
The Board once again wishes to convey 
its gratitude to our employees whose hard 
work has been essential in overcoming  
the challenges we have faced. Their 
commitment to the quality of our products 
has been remarkable during a period of 
great change and difficult trading conditions. 
The outlook for the economies of the UK 
and Republic of Ireland and our markets  
is still challenging. That only serves to 
highlight the need for innovation in our 
business to continue. We believe that the 
opportunity is there to do so successfully 
and return Johnston Press to growth.

National Coverage with a Local Focus
Consumers are increasingly demanding news as it happens 
and our journalists work hard to be the first to report breaking 
stories. They are part of their communities and have wide-
ranging networks of contacts, helping to ensure they know 
what is happening and when.
Johnston Printing
We operate modern, high-speed printing 
presses at three centres: Sheffield and 
Portsmouth in England, and Carn in 
Northern Ireland. In addition to publishing 
our own titles, we hold several national 
contracts to provide printing services  
to other newspaper and industry groups.
Community Involvement
Our newspapers and websites remain 
trusted providers of information in the 
communities we serve. Campaigns,  
local events and fund-raising activities 
build strong links with audiences and 
cement our titles’ roles as the voices  
of their communities.

Our Market & Strategy
The fundamental needs of our 
consumers remain consistent.  
For our readers, knowing what’s 
happening in their local community  
and having a trusted platform to 
engage in the debate is as important  
as ever. For our local and national 
advertisers, reaching an engaged 
audience with products and services  
of interest to them remains a key 
marketing goal. Serving both  
these communities, audiences and 
advertisers, in a trusted, quality,  
and authentic way, will remain the  
core focus of Johnston Press.
The future of local media will however 
be very different in its delivery. It will be 
predominately digital, with an emphasis 
on mobile, delivered on a daily and 
hourly basis with most print editions 
being a weekly, in-depth, read.
Building deeper relationships with  
our audience and advertisers will 
enable us to move beyond publishing 
and our traditional footprint into 
providing services that make the lives 
of our audiences and advertisers 
easier, more efficient, better informed 
and more fun – whether they live in, 
commute to, or visit our communities.

Our Market & Strategy
(continued)
Local media is now being accessed  
in different ways. We expect these 
developments to continue.
By 2020 we see half of  
our advertising revenues 
coming from digital.
We are leveraging our 
existing print advertising 
relationships to drive our 
digital future.
In 2012, half of our monthly 
audience accessed our 
content digitally.

The way we engage with 
our customers will reflect 
the changing landscape.
Digital-led advertising
Department for Work and Pensions
The DWP auto-enrolment campaign  
was a digital-led marketing campaign 
that ran alongside a print campaign.  
The aim of the four week campaign  
was to reach a somewhat ‘daunted’ 
audience who would require further 
information and thus generate high 
levels of traffic to the DWP website.  
The DWP leveraged the reach offered  
by our digital and print portfolio and  
ran the campaign across all our local 
websites and in 13 daily and 17 weekly 
print titles.
Print advertising Longer series advertising Mobile campaigns
Hopkinsons
Hopkinsons Estate Agents are committed 
to their local newspaper and all the  
benefits and rewards that relationship 
brings. Hopkinsons are a great testimony  
to the relationship sell – they prefer to 
strategically forward plan their commitment 
but with the tactical flexibility to respond  
to market demands.
Stoneacre Ford
Stoneacre is a classic local media 
advertiser and relies on forward 
planning media campaigns over a three 
month programme. The benefits of this 
approach are numerous and allows 
them to correlate many aspects of their 
business alongside seasonal activity 
and local influences. This client values 
the traditional print advertising but  
is fully engaged in the digital potential  
of our local websites. 
ASDA
The ASDA mobile campaign was 
specifically targeted at increasing  
on-line orders through the use of 
handsets. ASDA was attracted to the 
reach and impact we could offer via  
our mobile network, they felt it added 
significant value to their current media  
mix and our mobile offerings are a key 
component to their media strategy  
going forward. 10 | Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Strategic Priorities for 2013
We have six objectives for 2013.  
These are our principal steps  
in the return to growth.
01.
Stem the rate of 
decline of profits, 
and return to top 
line growth
02.
Keep our print 
circulation 
revenues stable
03.
Grow digital 
substantially
What we did in 2012: 
´ ´ We reduced the underlying operating 
profit decline to 4.7% (after adjusting 
for the changes to the contract printing 
arrangements with News International), 
from 10.3% in 2011 and an annual  
rate of 19.1% between 2006 and 2010 
(unadjusted decline 11.6%). Substantial 
changes to our infrastructure, such as 
consolidating 14 call centres into two, 
had a short term impact on profits in 
2012 but these are already achieving 
budget in 2013. We re-designed all 
our print titles which will enable us  
to offer advertisers a better quality, 
and more consistent, advertising 
experience going forward.
What we’ll do in 2013:
´ ´ Stabilise local advertising turnover by 
making a step change in the way we 
engage with our customers; by selling 
longer series packages across all our 
platforms, thus creating more selling 
time for our sales people. Once 
re-launched, all our titles will fit one  
of five demographic clusters, making 
us an easy, simple, cost effective buy 
for national advertisers. We aim to 
increase our margins by reducing our 
cost base by building on the work 
from 2012. We will get a full year 
effect of the savings initiatives that 
were delivered last year, whilst 
continuing to execute further 
efficiency opportunities.
What we did in 2012: 
´ ´ We invested heavily in our print titles 
creating a fresh new look for all our 
paid for titles that we rolled out across 
60 weekly titles, with the balance 
being re-launched in 2013. As titles 
re-launched, journalists were given 
new hardware and software to enable 
‘digital first publishing’. Web traffic 
improved by 28% year-on-year. As 
anticipated, there was a temporary 
increased decline in some titles’ 
circulation as re-launches were 
accompanied by substantial cover 
price increases, but by Q4, all 
re-launched titles were making at 
least 5% more revenue year-on-year.
What we’ll do in 2013:
´ ´ Continue to invest in our print titles 
underpinned by a central marketing 
and circulation strategy. Key to this 
will be the relaunch of our remaining 
158 print titles with the objective of 
narrowing circulation declines. Our 
relaunches will continue to exhibit 
leading edge innovative re-design  
and fresh content (such as enhanced 
business coverage and new ‘going 
out’ guides) to appeal to new 
audiences such as young families, 
whilst still remaining relevant to our 
heartland readership. Our smaller 
titles will have improved pagination 
and more ‘hyper-local’ contributed 
content to increase value-for-money.
What we did in 2012: 
´ ´ We became the largest (10m unique 
users a month, 555k per day regular 
users), and fastest growing (adding 
two million new digital users during 
the year) digital regional publisher, 
and grew digital revenues by 12%.  
We launched new services such as 
DealMonster and entertainment portal 
WOW247 as well as tablet apps for  
17 of our largest titles. We moved 
from packaging just 10% digital 
adverts with print advertisements,  
to a 40% sell through rate.
What we’ll do in 2013:
´ ´ Increase the monetisation of this  
new digital traffic, by further improving 
the integrated ‘print + digital’ offer. 
We will explore opportunities for 
paid-for-content (building on success 
of Scotsman iPad app subscription 
volumes). We will relaunch all our local 
websites – with improved look and feel, 
better navigation, improved social 
media content, and substantially more 
video – along with the relaunch of  
our print titles. We will accelerate the 
growth of our digital verticals portfolio 
(such as WOW247, DealMonster, jobs, 
property and motors) and launch new 
ones. Finally, and perhaps strategically 
most significantly, we will launch a 
new Digital Marketing Services offer 
for Small and Medium Enterprises.  Overview

What we did in 2012: 
´ ´ Our overall aggregate audience 
across print, online and mobile 
increased by 11%. We reach more 
people with our content now than 
ever. Our mobile offering grew from 
almost nothing to reach over 2 million 
users, mostly within the advertiser-
attractive ABC1 18-34 demograph. 
We embraced social media; on  
Twitter we now have nearly 700,000 
followers and we generated close  
to 2 million tweets.
What we’ll do in 2013:
´ ´ We will provide content and services, 
especially video and social media, 
that resonate with all our audiences 
(from greater sport coverage online  
to digitising our print archive across 
all titles), which will help us to increase 
our engagement, moving monthly 
users to become regular weekly 
visitors, and becoming the true  
home of ‘local, social, and mobile’, 
accelerating our overall audience 
reach. We will use our new technology, 
our new templated newspapers, and 
new work flows, better to enable our 
journalists to spend more time on the 
ground, in the heart of the communities 
we serve, generating and curating 
print and digital content that will allow 
our titles to remain both trusted and 
relevant. For example, our hyper-local 
contributed content (parish pump news, 
local amateur sport, event listing) will 
become available online, and could 
be shared across relevant titles and 
regions. These initiatives, together 
called ‘Journalism 2015’ will herald  
a new relationship with our audience.
What we did in 2012: 
´ ´ Despite considerable costs of 
refinancing, resulting in a peak net 
debt during the year of £371.7 million 
we have continued the absolute focus 
of the last few years reducing our net 
debt from £746.4 million in 2006 to 
£319.4 million at the end of 2012.  
A combination of strong cash flows, 
extremely tight cash management, 
close balance-sheet management 
(including exiting from non-core 
assets such as unfit for purpose 
offices and printing facilities), and 
extensive restructuring to reduce the 
cost base inevitably had a short term 
impact on profitability, but has set us 
fair for continued reduction in 2013.
What we’ll do in 2013:
´ ´ Reducing debt as quickly as possible 
remains a key management priority, 
with the aim to be able to engage  
with alternative refinancing options  
in 2014/2015 (our current finance 
arrangements continue until September 
2015). We will continue to review all 
assets and their potential impact on 
accelerating reduction in Group debt.

Management 
(CRM) capability
What we did in 2012: 
´ ´ Piloted aggressive subscriber 
acquisition strategies at The Scotsman 
and drove subscriptions from 12% to 
26%, during the year. Overall across 
the group, we doubled our subscriber 
base, created a strong DealMonster 
daily deal database, and saw over 50 
thousand downloads of our tablet apps.
What we’ll do in 2013:
´ ´ Having acquired a new CRM database 
solution during 2012, we will move to 
increase dramatically the number of 
readers and users we have registered 
with us that we can market to. We are 
going to continue to grow our daily 
subscriptions and will look to double 
the percentage of our subscriber base 
for our weekly titles. We will build on 
our successful rollout of a subscription 
loyalty scheme as well as an iPad  
and newspaper subscription bundle. 
Finally, we will complete the re-launch 
of our print titles, as re-launched titles 
have shown subscriptions growth 
rates of almost double the rate of the 
rest of the portfolio. 12 | Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

well as within Johnston Press.
The benefits of these changes will be felt 
during 2013, with 2012 being very much a 
transitional year during which we grew our 
digital audience considerably from 8.1 million 
a month to 9.8 million a month, resulting in an 
aggregate print and digital audience growth of 
over 5%. Digital revenues increased 12.0% to 
£20.6 million, providing a solid base for 2013.
During 2012 our key priorities included 
reducing our net debt and our operating  
cost base. Despite £11.8 million of 
refinancing costs, we reduced our net debt 
from £351.7 million to £319.4 million during 
the year and our cost base was reduced  
by £37.6 million (12.2%) from £309.3 million  
to £271.7 million. As a result, our operating 
margins increased slightly to 17.4%.
Our underlying operating profit (before 
non-recurring and IAS 21/39 items) for 2012  
fell by 4.7% after adjusting for the impact  
of the proactively agreed partial cancellation  
of the News International printing contract. 
This change to our arrangements with News 
International contributed (£3.9 million) to  
the reduction in the headline profit to £57.0 
million (down 11.6% on 2011) but also 
delivered a significant one-off cash receipt 
(£30.0 million) to considerably reduce our net 
debt. We have re-filled most of the vacated 
capacity. The 4.7% underlying profit decline 
compares favourably with 2011’s decline  
of 10.3% and the average annual decline 
between 2006 and 2010 of 19.1%. We are 
stemming the rate of profit decline, and 
focussed on the twin financial priorities of 
returning the Group to profit growth, whilst 
continuing to pay down debt.
Our teams across the UK and Republic  
of Ireland have worked hard to deliver 
compelling and innovative solutions to 
advertisers, but overall print advertising 
revenue declined by 14.8% (or 13.5% in 
respect of ongoing 2013 titles) over the course  
of the year and remains indicative of the very 
challenging markets in which we operate.  
In 2013 our sales teams’ challenge is to  
use the improved technology, tools and 
propositions that we are putting in place  
to deliver improved performance.  
Trading remained very challenging in  
2012 with the ongoing effect of structural 
change in our industry being evident to all.  
For this reason there can be no let-up in  
our work to reposition Johnston Press  
for the modern media environment. 
Review of the Year
The year just ended has seen continued 
recession in the economies of the United 
Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, with 
economic challenges in the United Kingdom 
showing little sign of ending outside of London. 
Responding to this macro situation, we have 
embarked on a year of transformational 
change at Johnston Press. We have seen 
the implementation of a number of strategic 
initiatives focussed on improving efficiencies 
and saving costs as we continue to reshape 
the Group for its future as a local media 
provider. These include reducing the number 
of contact centres from fourteen to two; 
consolidating our printing into three sites from 
seven; off-shoring our pre-press operations; 
and taking out layers of senior management. 
These significant changes enabled us to take 
£37.6m out of the business, some 11.6% 
of the base cost and helped us to reduce 
our net debt to £319.4m from £371.7m 
immediately post re-financing. 
There were not-unexpected short term 
impacts on revenue line items during this 
transition, but we believe we are now set fair 
to be able to weather the trend of deteriorating 
performance in certain advertising categories 
that we reported in 2011 and that continued 
into 2012. Like others in our sector, we saw a 
negative impact from events over the summer, 
including the Jubilee Bank Holiday, European 
Football Championships and, in particular, the 
Olympic Games. 
Putting in place the infrastructure, technology 
and resources to get the top line back to growth 
was also a priority for 2012, the benefits of 
which should be felt in H2 of 2013 and beyond. 
By the end of the year, we had equipped all 
1,500 sales staff with Salesforce.com software 
and 800 with iPads (and over 350 of our 
journalists with new laptops and smart 
phones); relaunched 69 redesigned 
newspapers (on the way to relaunching over 
200 titles around five demographic clusters), 
over 200 mobile websites, 18 tablet apps and 
11 phone apps all across iPad/iPhone and 
Android platforms. We also upgraded all our 
websites, becoming along the way, one of the 
UK’s fastest growing and largest portfolio of 
regional publisher websites with average daily 
audience up 29.3% year-on-year to 560,000. 
Our plans have also seen many of our staff 
move to far better accommodation – suitable 
for our future needs.   Overview

 Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 | 13
We saw early signs of this in December,  
with year-on-year rates for local display  
and features advertising being down 5.4%,  
a significant improvement on third and fourth 
quarter run rates (see pages 18 and 19).  
We have a well-earned reputation in our 
industry for exceptional cost performance  
and in 2012 once again our teams delivered 
with our operating costs falling by £37.6 
million year-on-year. The profound change 
that our industry is experiencing has meant 
we have continued to need to reduce our 
workforce and the number of staff employed 
by the Group fell to just over 4,350 at the end 
of December, down 23.1% on 2011, inevitably 
with a degree of disruptive impact. 
Our regional organisational structure  
was radically reshaped in 2012, reducing  
a two-tier management structure of twenty 
five Managing Directors to a single structure 
of just eight Managing Directors. In addition  
to the consolidation of contact centres, we 
centralised and/or outsourced our pre-press, 
web creation and finance functions. This has 
been implemented with our stated objective  
of keeping our editorial and sales presence  
at the heart of the local communities where 
we publish.
The Group’s modern print facilities at 
Dinnington, Portsmouth and Carn remain 
state of the art, however changing print 
demands and the revised terms of our print 
arrangements have allowed us to look at our 
operations and rationalise our capacity. As 
well as the closure of our Isle of Man print 
facility at the beginning of 2012, our plants  
at Leeds, Peterborough and Sunderland  
were also closed during the year. 
I am pleased to say our work through the 
year, especially the focus on paying down 
debt, helped to raise our share price to  
levels which had not been seen for some 
time. Although we wish to see this grow  
a great deal more, we are pleased that  
there has been recognition for the strategy 
we are following.
Refinancing
As we reported last April, we successfully 
refinanced our existing lending facilities 
through to September 2015. We were  
able to do so in large part because of  
our continued focus on reducing debt  
and that remains a key objective for us  
in 2013 and beyond. The terms of our 
facilities provide strong incentives to 
implement an alternative debt structure  
by the end of 2014 and further priority  
to repaying debt is a key consideration. 
Strategy Update
Last year, in my first statement as Chief 
Executive, I laid out the priorities for our 
strategic development, recognising the key 
contribution that our printed products will 
make for many years, while emphasising  
our need to reinvigorate them, to see them 
develop further their audiences and bring  
our use of digital technology to the centre  
of everything we do. Our management has 
worked hard to identify the key steps in 
getting us back to growth – it is now our 
challenge to ensure we deliver. In 2012  
we started our process of relaunching our 
newspaper titles with 69 being completed  
by the end of the year. That programme is 
continuing and by the end of the first half  
of 2013 we will have completed our relaunch 
programme covering a total of 227 titles.  
This is a huge achievement for our team  
and one that is delivering attractive modern 
papers which we are confident will appeal  
to both a wider pool of advertisers and to  
key demographics and new audiences in  
our communities. Circulation revenues for 
relaunched titles, particularly towards the end 
of the year, were encouraging, up almost 8% 
in December 2012 against the same period 
last year. Further, relaunches have helped  
to drive increases in subscription rates  
which are now double the rates of our 
non-relaunched titles – a key objective for  
us. Subscriptions for our weekly titles have 
nearly doubled to just under 4% of total 
circulation while for The Scotsman, they 
increased from 15% in 2011 to 27% in 2012. 
Alongside the relaunch of our printed 
products, new websites are being delivered 
for all of our titles. Our overall audience 
(across print, online and mobile) grew in 2012 
– a direct result of the steps we are taking. 
Our journalists (who won 35 awards in 2012) 
are key to our ambitions to draw ever larger 
readership to our content by being able to 
capture stories in words, pictures, graphics 
and video and publish them in print, on our 
websites and through an expanding range  
of media and devices. 
We are aiming to ensure our editorial staff 
have the right equipment, software, training 
and working environments to operate in this 
new landscape – a project we are calling 
Journalism2015. This will be aligned to the 
development of all our staff through a new 
performance management and reward 
process. Our employees are key to our 
success and I would like to thank them  
for their dedication through a difficult time. 
Digital remains key to our future. After 
encouraging growth was experienced in 2012 
we must ensure we build on this while 
focusing on our audience quality by driving 
more loyal and frequent visitors. To do so,  
as well as the new websites, we have plans 
to deliver new product offerings across  
a number of areas as we have already  
done with the WOW24/7 entertainment  
What’s-On website.
Our combined digital and print offerings are 
now working well together. The frequency 
with which we packaged together local 
online display adverts with print advertising 
more than trebled over the year to around 
40% in 2012 and we were pleased that 
digital advertising revenues finished the  
year very strongly. In the coming year we  
will continue to improve the effectiveness  
of our sales operation to improve sales  
of longer series packages to advertisers, 
across more of our titles and websites,  
along with growing our local display  
and features advertising business. The 
considerable changes we put through  
the sales force in 2012 inevitably had a 
temporary disruptive effect on advertising 
revenues, especially classifieds.
Alongside all of this, we are building new 
skills and capabilities within our Group  
to accelerate the delivery of our bigger 
projects; improve our systems to help share 
content across the Group and accelerate  
the growth in our subscriber base; improve 
the technology we use (including getting 
better bandwidth to our outlying offices);  
and upgrade our mobile skills now that  
a third of our 10 million online users access 
us via their phones and tablets (up from 5% 
of online users in 2011). Throughout all of  
this our focus on costs will remain key and 
careful choices must be made as to where 
our resources are concentrated. I am pleased 
with the change in the business that we have 
been able to deliver with very careful cost 
management in 2012. The development of 
the Group will continue during 2013 at the 
same time as maintaining that control.
Summary
Our work to adapt our business to the 
changing environment in which we operate 
continues and we must be increasingly 
nimble and responsive to the demands  
it places on us. In the face of an economic 
outlook which remains difficult we will focus 
on getting our offering right in order to 
develop the Group and return it to growth. 
Our trusted local newspapers and brands 
remain key in doing this, and must be  
allied to the best use of both current and 
developing technology and the opportunities 
they can create for us. The demand for 
information about the communities in which 
people work and live has never been greater 
and we remain exceptionally well placed  
to serve that demand. The demand from 
advertisers to reach those communities  
in a targeted and cost-effective manner also 
grows. We are on a clear journey to become 
the ‘one-stop shop’ for advertisers and 
readers across all media in the communities  
we serve.

Key Performance 
Indicators
To measure performance against  
our strategic objectives, we have  
key performance indicators that are 
monitored regularly. Our performance 
in 2012 versus 2011 is shown below.
Total advertising 
revenue*
(£’m)
Operating costs*
(Total cost of sales and 
operating expenses £’m)
Total revenues*
(£’m)
Operating profit*
(£’m)
There was a 12.7% decline 
in total advertising revenues 
in 2012, however within 
that digital advertising 
increased 12.0%. 
Operating cost savings of 
£37.6 million were achieved 
in 2012, as the Group 
sought to maintain margins.
Total revenues before  
non-recurring items 
declined 12.1% in 2012. 
The Group continues to 
seek to grow profit to 
enhance shareholder value.
´ ´ Print advertising which 
declined 14.8% was 
adversely affected  
by the contact centre 
consolidation; however  
the benefits of this and the 
sales effectiveness project 
should be seen in 2013. 
´ ´ There is an increased 
focus on digital advertising 
revenues which now make 
up 10.2% of advertising 
revenues. We expect to 
have 50% of advertising 
revenues from digital  
by 2020. New products 
launched in 2012 included 
The SmartList and 
WOW247, and the growth 
in DealMonster helped to 
increase revenues. 
´ ´ The Group underwent a 
full reorganisation of its 
management structure, 
with savings made 
through eliminating  
layers of management.
´ ´ Production cost savings 
were made during the year 
through the closure of  
older print presses in 
Leeds, Sunderland and 
Peterborough, as well  
as the reduced frequency 
of publication of five titles 
that moved from daily  
to weekly.
´ ´ Further savings are expected 
in 2013 due to the full year 
effect of initiatives started 
during 2012.
´ ´ The primary reason for the 
decline in total revenues 
was the decrease in print 
advertising revenues.
´ ´ Newspaper sales, while 
down 4% primarily due to 
changing the frequency of  
five daily titles to weekly, 
should see the benefits  
of the programme of title 
relaunches in 2013.
´ ´ Due to the partial 
termination of a print 
contract with News 
International, contract 
printing revenues  
declined 30.0%. The 
operating profit impact  
of the loss in revenues  
was partially mitigated by 
production cost savings 
described below.
´ ´ Operating profit was 
impacted primarily by  
the reduction in print 
advertising revenues, 
offset by substantial  
cost savings.
´ ´ Operating margins 
continue to be maintained 
at an industry-leading 
level. In 2012, an operating 
margin* of 17.4% was 
achieved, compared  
with 17.3% in 2011.

Reducing net debt 
continues to be a key 
priority for the Group. 
Growing circulation 
revenues and subscriptions 
are key aims for the Group.
As an information provider 
to the local community, it is 
important to reach as large an 
audience as possible, through 
both printed newspapers and 
digital platforms. 
Johnston Press remains 
committed to improving 
health and safety for all 
employees and reducing  
the number of accidents  
at work.
´ ´ The Group had a net 
operating cash flow for  
the year of £71.3 million, 
compared with £67.9 
million in 2011.
´ ´ Net debt reduced by  
£32.3 million in 2012. This 
was despite high levels of 
exceptional redundancy 
costs and refinancing fees 
incurred during the year 
and included the receipt of 
£30.0 million in connection 
with the partial termination 
of a print contract with 
News International.
´ ´ The Group has reviewed 
its property portfolio and 
is selling under utilised 
properties to release 
surplus cash and further 
reduce debt.
´´´ Subscriptions for weekly 
titles doubled in 2012 to 
4%, which the Group aims 
to increase to over 10% 
by 2015.
´´´ Circulation volume 
declines in 2012 were 
mitigated through 
increased cover prices.
´´´ The relaunch programme 
should benefit circulation 
revenues as new readers 
are attracted to the 
redesigned titles.
´ ´ New and improved digital 
platforms (such as apps 
and new websites) helped 
to increase the audience 
reach in 2012. 
´ ´ Building new products 
helps to appeal to new 
users, particularly a 
younger and more mobile 
(and technologically 
aware) audience.
´ ´ The Group aims to be the 
number one brand in each 
of the markets it serves.
´´´ 2012 recorded the lowest 
number of employees 
involved in accidents in  
the six years for which 
detailed statistics have 
been compiled.
´ ´ The Group introduced  
a new ‘working environment 
charter’ in 2012, which 
aims to improve working 
conditions for all employees 
through providing suitable 
office accommodation 
and tools. 16 | Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
The Group continued to focus  
on delivering its strategic aims  
in print and digital. 
Operational Review
The review also included an evaluation  
of sales skills and measures have 
subsequently been introduced to ensure 
that all existing and new employees attain 
an agreed standard of expertise. This 
coincides with the appointment of a  
new Group Commercial Director and 
restructuring of senior management to 
provide greater leadership in each of the 
customer categories.
This has been a significant and challenging 
project involving a great deal of change but 
it lays the foundations for the Group’s multi-
media face-to-face customer engagement 
programme going forward and will ensure 
that the organisation benefits from the 
many digital platforms which have been 
progressed during the year.
In support of these local initiatives, during 
the year the Group consolidated its 14 
telephone contact centres, which manage 
inbound and outbound activity, into two 
better resourced centres in Sheffield and 
Edinburgh. The implementation of this 
project was supported by new management 
teams from the contact centre industry, 
enhanced technology to manage the 
volume of enquiries and new customer 
relationship management systems to 
provide better customer insight. 
Restructuring, building our skills set and 
being prepared and properly equipped to 
develop further revenue opportunities were 
the three key themes for the operational 
teams in 2012 as the Group continued to 
focus on delivering its strategic aims in 
print and digital.
Perhaps the most challenging undertaking, 
and potentially the most beneficial in the 
longer term, was the implementation  
of a new sales plan during the year to 
up-skill, reorganise and better focus our 
face-to-face sales force on meeting local 
customer needs. 
This involved a review of many markets  
and sales teams to ensure we have the 
right resources, technology and customer 
insight to meet the marketing requirements 
of local consumers. The majority of these 
customers are small to medium sized 
enterprises whom we have served for many 
years and we are now able to offer more 
defined marketing solutions from the 
various media platforms we can provide.
Breaking the news... ‘Oxbangs’
The Edinburgh Evening News broke  
the news that a fireworks display in the 
city’s Oxgangs district had gone wrong 
when dozens of boxes of fireworks 
exploded after being hit by a stray  
rocket. Coverage included a video  
online of spectators running away  
from the explosion. The story was  
picked up by national titles and TV.

These projects have been introduced  
in preparation for the various business 
development strategies which are being 
progressed, including the roll-out of new 
digital platforms for property and motors, 
and further progress with the Group’s 
voucher website, DealMonster, which is 
now operational in 19 towns, cities or 
regional areas, as well as non-geographical 
markets for travel and shopping deals.  
A new site has also been launched for the 
entertainment market, WOW247.co.uk, to 
support further the Group’s engagement 
with the local community. 
In addition, the Group’s recruitment portal 
Jobstoday.co.uk, continues to expand with 
additional services such as The SmartList 
which provides application filtering and 
other benefits for a fixed price to recruiters. 
All of our local digital platforms can be 
accessed via a dedicated mobile site. We 
have 209 websites for our local titles, and 
a further six sites for e-commerce, such as 
DealMonster and SmartList. In 2012 we 
launched tablet apps for 18 titles on iPad, 
Amazon Kindle Fire and Google Play 
Android. In addition, 11 titles now have 
smartphone football apps on both iPhone 
and Android platforms. These solutions 
support the programme of change in print 
products and some of the relaunched 
newspapers, and were backed by 
expanded digital activity including the 
ability to subscribe to the newspaper and 
digital service for a single price. This will 
continue as more titles re-launch in 2013.
New leadership took responsibility for 
sundry revenues such as reader travel and 
online shops. The premise is unchanged 
with items offered for sale in our newspaper 
titles being supported by fulfilment and 
cross promotion online. 
As part of our strategy to ensure our 
newspapers remain relevant and up-to-
date, a programme was introduced during 
the year to relaunch all the Group’s titles. 
Five newspaper titles changed publishing 
frequency from daily to weekly, nine titles 
altered size from broadsheet to tabloid, 
three free titles became paid-for and a 
further 47 newspapers (including 10 free 
titles) were redesigned with the support 
from industry leading designers. The project 
is being implemented in four phases with 
two being completed during the year with 
the final phases to occur in 2013. Overall, 
response has been favourable and has 
created the opportunity to demonstrate 
value to readers. Each stage has created 
the opportunity to evaluate and use the 
experience to improve the next phase of 
change and has been beneficial to both 
staff and the communities we serve, with 
many examples of increased advertising 
revenues as businesses see the benefit 
from greater engagement. 
The relaunch programme has also created 
an opportunity to review and improve the 
product portfolio for each market. In some 
cases, this has resulted in a decision to 
close a number of free newspapers and, 
where it is in the interests of our customers 
to do so, consolidate bi-weekly newspapers.
The implementation of the re-launch 
programme has been assisted by  
changes made to our backroom fulfilment 
services. All aspects of production are now 
centralised to a single point enabling each 
newspaper to have the same workflows 
supported by a single design team for both 
advertising and editorial. These changes 
have included further consolidation of  
our press centres with the closure of the 
Peterborough, Leeds and Sunderland press 
halls and also the partial outsourcing of 
advertisement creation work which has 
driven further efficiencies.
These various changes within the  
Group mean a number of markets  
and centres are now faced with legacy 
accommodation which does not meet  
the requirements of the business going 
forward. To address this, the Group’s 
‘Environment Charter’ was introduced.  
The Charter is a commitment to provide 
accommodation and technology which  
will enable staff to conduct their specified 
tasks, primarily content gathering,  
in a modern and efficient way which  
is consistent with a local multi-media 
community publisher. Accordingly,  
a programme to enhance technology 
systems is being rolled out across the 
Group. 800 iPads and smart phones  
have been issued to sales staff to provide 
remote access to the new customer 
relationship management system allowing 
them to have far greater insight into our 
customers’ needs. The Group is also 
equipping 1,700 journalists to enable them 
to again work remotely in the heart of their 
local communities. Each journalist will 
have a laptop and quality smartphone for 
simple photography and video capture. 
This initiative will greatly improve the 
quality, quantity and timeliness of multi-
media content available on websites, 
mobile sites and tablet apps.
Additionally, new accommodation has 
been provided for staff in a number of 
locations, including prestigious new 
offices for The Yorkshire Post in Leeds.  
It is anticipated that this programme  
will accelerate during 2013.
This commitment recognises the 
importance of our staff and, while  
overall manning levels were reduced  
during the year, we continue to invest  
in training and development along with 
further improvements to Group-wide 
communication. The Group’s weekly 
e-newsletter and website, The Word,  
is well received with nearly 90% of staff 
saying it is a useful source of Group 
information. In addition, we launched a  
staff satisfaction survey in 2012 to identify 
areas of improvement such as career 
development, recognition, training and 
leadership. One of the outcomes of this 
survey was the introduction of a new 
annual Johnston Press plc awards scheme, 
to recognise and celebrate media and 
commercial excellence in our staff.
“ The r elaunch 
programme has 
also created  
an opportunity  
to review and 
improve the 
product portfolio 
for each market.” 18 | Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Performance Summary for 2012 and 2011
(Before non-recurring and IAS 21/39 Items)
The operating profit* margin increased 
slightly to 17.4% (2011: 17.3%) with  
an operating profit* for the year of  
£57.0 million (2011: £64.6 million). 
The trading environment in the Group’s 
markets continued to be difficult during 
2012. Advertising revenues in particular 
remained under pressure. Total Group 
revenues* declined by £45.2 million 
(12.1%) but this decline was mitigated by 
the management of the cost base which 
was reduced by £37.6 million (12.2%).  
The operating profit margin increased 
slightly to 17.4% (2011: 17.3%) with  
an operating profit for the year of  
£57.0 million (2011: £64.6 million).
There were a number of key transactions 
and actions that influenced financial 
performance in 2012, all of which  
are discussed further in this review.  
These include:
´ ´ Refinancing of our lending facilities  
in April 2012;
´ ´ Further restructuring of our cost base;
´ ´ Closure of four print presses;
´ ´ Launch of new digital initiatives;

Total Revenue
The vast majority of the decline in total 
revenues was due to reduced print 
advertising. Indeed, after adjusting for the 
contract print revenues associated with the 
agreed cancellation of part of our contract 
with News International and the effect  
of the planned change of five titles from 
daily to weekly, the balance of the decline 
in Group revenues is almost entirely 
attributable to reduced print advertising 
with other revenue categories remaining 
relatively stable. Taken together the other 
non-advertising categories were down 
11.0%, but after adjusting for the contract 
printing and daily-to-weekly changes the 
non-advertising decline reduces to 6.6%.
Advertising Revenue
Display advertising
Total display advertising in print and online 
declined by 11.9% (2011: 3.0%). Of this, 
the decline in local display was 8.9% with 
national display revenues down 18.6% 
year-on-year. The decline in national display 
revenues was consistent throughout the 
year and was seen throughout the industry 
as large national advertisers reduced 
marketing spend. The declines seen in local 
display principally related to the second 
half of 2012 and were particularly impacted 
by the effect of the economy on advertiser 
confidence. Local display revenues are the 
focus of our sales effectiveness project; we 
expect to see significant upside from this 
project in 2013.

Classified advertising 
Overall classified revenues declined by 
13.3% in 2012 and again the declines in  
the second half of the year were greater than 
the first reflecting the changing economic 
conditions across the year. Within this, 
employment revenues declined 14.7%.  
Digital employment revenues are making an 
increasing contribution to this category, but 
both print and digital continue to be affected 
by the depressed employment market in 
much of the UK and Republic of Ireland.
The other classified categories also 
experienced declines in the year. Property, 
with a reduction of 10.7%, showed the 
smallest decline, but this was still a larger 
decline than the prior year (2011: decline 
of 7.6%). The decreases in motors and 
other classifieds, of 18.0% and 12.3% 
respectively, while reflecting the lack of 
new car sales in the year and the general 
economic conditions, also reflect the 
migration of these advertising categories 
to online advertising. There was also some 
impact from consolidating the contact 
centres into two locations; however the 
benefits of this project are expected  
to be seen in 2013.
Print advertising 
Total print advertising in the year declined 
by 14.8% compared with the 9.7% 
reduction in 2011. This was primarily due 
to national print display revenues being 
down by 19.3% and employment print 
revenues being down by 22.1%, although 
these employment revenues now only 
represent 8.0% of total print revenues.
The economic environment affected  
other classified advertising also with 
year-on-year declines being seen across 
all categories. While property declined by 
11.3% and other classified advertising  
by 14.1% compared with 2011 there was 
an improving trend in the final quarter. 
Local display was 11.9% lower than 2011 
with motors showing a year-on-year 
decline of 18.1%.
“ 12.0% growth in 
digital revenues  
to £20.6 million. 
Within this, digital 
employment 
revenues stabilised, 
resulting in a 5.6% 
revenue growth  
in this category.” 20 | Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
IAS 21/39 items relate to the fair value 
movement in the Group’s derivative 
financial instruments (primarily interest  
rate caps and foreign exchange call 
options) as well as the retranslation of the 
Group’s US dollar and Euro denominated 
borrowings. The net charge for the year 
was £2.8 million (2011: £0.7 million). 
Further details are shown in Note 11c.
Finance Income and Costs
Finance costs in the year were  
£42.1 million (2011: £38.5 million).  
The increase from the previous year 
reflects the increased cost of borrowing  
as a result of the finance arrangements 
that were negotiated in April 2012, 
including the increased level of payment-
in-kind (PIK) interest.
The interest charge in the year reflects  
a blended rate of 11.7%, which includes 
PIK. This is an increase on the 9.9% 
blended rate in 2011 and is due to the 
increased rates following the April 
refinancing, as well as the expiry of cross 
currency swaps in early 2012 which had 
beneficial foreign exchange rates included 
that could not be repeated in the current 
market. The charge in the Income 
Statement also includes £4.1 million  
in respect of the amortisation of the fees 
associated with the Group’s finance facilities.
The Group’s exposure to the US dollar 
interest and principal payments on the 
private placement loan notes are hedged 
from a currency perspective through 
foreign exchange call options.
The net finance expense on pension 
assets and liabilities was £2.5 million 
(2011: income of £2.3 million). This  
was due to the interest rate on the fund 
liabilities being higher than the expected 
return on the pension fund assets.
Loss Before Tax
The Group’s loss before tax was £6.8 million 
(2011: loss before tax of £143.8 million).  
The significant difference between 2012  
and 2011 was the non-recurring impairment 
expense recognised in 2011 of £163.7 million. 
Other differences between 2012 and 2011 
included the reduction in operating profit 
before non-recurring items in 2012 of  
£7.5 million, higher net non-recurring 
operating charges (excluding impairment  
of intangibles) of £8.8 million, an increase  
of £3.6 million in interest charges and the 
pension interest expense of £2.5 million 
compared to income of £2.3 million in 2011.
Digital revenues
This was an important year for the Group’s 
digital activities, with an increased focus 
on this area resulting in an overall 12.0% 
growth in digital revenues to £20.6 million. 
Within this, digital employment revenues 
stabilised, resulting in a 1.4% revenue 
growth in this category (compared with  
a 9.2% decline in the previous year).  
In addition, local digital display revenues 
grew 38.6% year-on-year providing  
a significant improvement in monetisation  
of the digital audience growth. A number 
of new digital enterprises in the year also 
contributed to the overall revenue growth, 
including a new venture with Zoopla  
for online property revenues and  
a partnership with motors.co.uk to boost 
digital motors revenues. The focus on 
digital revenues in 2012 has shown 
encouraging revenue growth, which is 
anticipated to accelerate further in 2013. 
Non-Advertising Revenues
The reduction in the Group’s circulation 
revenues in the year of 4.0% to £91.8 
million was due almost entirely to the 
planned change of five daily titles to weekly 
publication. Contract print revenues were 
affected by the negotiated reduction in 
external revenues from News International 
in exchange for a receipt of £30.0 million 
which has been accounted for as a 
non-recurring item. In the absence of this, 
contract print revenues were broadly in line 
year-on-year. Taking account of the cost 
savings associated with the daily to weekly 
publication changes and the contract print 
reduction, the overall impact of these 
changes should improve both the efficiency 
and profitability of the remaining activities.
Operating Costs
Total operating costs (cost of sales  
and operating expenses) for the Group 
excluding non-recurring and IAS 21/39 
items were £271.7 million, a saving of 
£37.6 million from 2011. This reflects 
savings across all parts of the business 
with significant initiatives implemented  
to further restructure the operations  
to make them more efficient. These 
initiatives include the consolidation and 
centralisation of the Group’s contact 
centres and the restructuring of senior 
management. There were significant 
savings in production costs due to the 
closure of the printing plants at Leeds, 
Peterborough and Sunderland during  
the year, as well as the reduced costs  
from the five titles that changed from daily  
to weekly format (which offsets the impact  
of lower newspaper sales revenues from  
the change).
Non-recurring and IAS 21/39 Items
In addition to the trading results discussed 
above, a number of items have been 
identified as non-recurring either due to 
the nature of the item or their significance. 
Total net non-recurring items before tax 
were £16.6 million (2011: £171.5 million, 
including an impairment of intangibles  
of £163.7 million). Non-recurring items  
in 2012 included:
´ ´ The receipt of £30.0 million in respect 
of the negotiated partial cancellation 
of the contract print arrangements 
with News International. The receipt 
has been treated as non-recurring 
revenue.
´ ´ Due to the closure of the Peterborough 
and Sunderland print presses during 
the year, the book value of the print 
presses affected has been written 
down to the estimated realisable  
value on disposal. A non-recurring 
charge of £17.2 million has been 
recognised due to the write down.
´ ´ A £1.5 million credit was recognised 
resulting from a pension exchange 
exercise. Further details are provided 
below in the pensions section.
´ ´ Restructuring costs of £24.4 million 
were incurred as the Group continued 
to change the way in which it carried 
out its business to drive efficiencies 
and cost savings. This resulted in a 
number of redundancies, the costs  
of which have been recorded as a 
non-recurring item.
´ ´ A £7.5 million charge from writing 
down the value of property held for 
sale to the net realisable value in the 
current market.
´ ´ A gain of £1.0 million from the sale  
of a significant property.
The only non-recurring items that involved 
significant cash outflows for the Group  
in 2012 were the restructuring costs of 
£24.4 million.

“ The Gr oup 
remained highly 
cash generative 
throughout the 
year, with net 
cash in from 
operational 
activities of  
£71.3 million.”
Tax Rate
The Group tax rate for the year, excluding 
non-recurring and IAS 21/39 items and 
before the impact of the deferred tax rate 
change, was 25.8%, slightly higher than 
the UK tax rate of 24.5%.
Earnings Per Share and Dividends
Basic earnings per share was 0.88p, 
compared with a loss of 14.24p in 2011. 
The improvement in basic earnings per 
share reflects the following reasons:
´ ´ There was no impairment charge in 
2012, whereas in 2011 an impairment 
charge of £163.7 million was recognised;
´ ´ A reduction in the underlying operating 
profit before non-recurring and IAS 
21/39 items of £7.5 million;
´ ´ A £3.6 million increase in finance costs 
under the new lending facilities due to 
higher interest rates;
´ ´ IAS 21/39 movements in 2012 were  
a charge of £2.8 million compared  
to a charge of £0.7 million in 2011; 
´ ´ There was a net pension finance 
charge of £2.5 million in 2012 
compared to finance income  
of £2.3 million in 2011; and
´ ´ The impact of tax credits  
of £12.4 million.
Excluding non-recurring and IAS 21/39 
items, the underlying earnings per share  
at the basic level of 3.42p was down from 
the previous year’s comparative of 3.50p 
due to the lower operating profit and 
higher interest charges.
There will be no ordinary dividend 
payment relating to 2012. This reflects the 
Group’s focus on further reducing the debt 
levels of the business and is also in line 
with the Group’s finance arrangements 
which preclude the payment of dividends 
until the ratio of net debt to EDITDA falls 
below 2.5 times.
Breaking the news...

about Tour de France winner and Olympic 
gold medallist Bradley Wiggins being

went around the world because of the 
phenomenal interest in the cyclist.

Cashflow, Financing and Net Debt
Net debt at 29 December 2012 was 
£319.4 million, a reduction of £32.3 million 
on the prior year. The Group remained 
highly cash generative throughout the 
year, with net cash received from 
operating activities of £71.3 million 
including £30.0 million received from  
News International. The cash was primarily 
used for cash interest payments of £17.2 
million, the cost of refinancing our finance 
facilities of £11.8 million and to repay 
borrowings of £26.5 million. The Group 
maintained tight control of capital 
expenditure with £5.2 million spent, while 
proceeds received from the disposal of 
surplus assets (primarily property sales 
and the disposal of closed presses) were 
£8.9 million.
The Group successfully concluded 
negotiations with its lenders regarding  
the renewal and extension of its finance 
facilities in April 2012. A secured initial 
facility of £393.0 million was agreed, 
amending the previous arrangements  
and extending the maturity of the facilities 
to September 2015.
The maximum cash interest margin 
payable in the case of the bank facilities  
is LIBOR plus 5.0%, and in the case of  
the loan notes, a cash interest coupon  
rate of up to 10.3%. The interest rates  
are based on the absolute amount of  
debt outstanding and leverage multiples 
and reduce based on agreed ratchets.
In addition to the cash interest, a PIK 
margin accumulates and is payable at the 
end of the facility. The PIK margin rate is 
again based on the absolute amount of the 
debt outstanding and leverage multiples 
and reduces based on agreed ratchets.  
If the loan facilities are fully repaid prior  
to 31 December 2014, the rate of the PIK 
margin accrued throughout the period  
of the agreement will be recalculated at  
a substantially reduced rate.
There is an agreed repayment schedule  
of £70.0 million over three years with  
£5.0 million originally scheduled for 2012. 
Following the News International receipt 
discussed above, £20.0 million of the 
scheduled repayments have been repaid 
early, with £45.0 million remaining as at 
the balance sheet date. In addition, a 
pay-if-you-can (PIYC) repayment schedule 
was agreed totalling £60.0 million over 
three years, of which £2.0 million was  
paid ahead of schedule in 2012.
Five-year share warrants over the 
Company’s share capital have been issued 
to the Group’s lenders. Warrants for 2.5% 
of the Company’s share capital were 
issued on completion of the new financing 
arrangements and a further 5.0% were 
issued in September 2012. In addition,  
the exercise period for the 5.0% warrants 
issued to the lenders in August 2009 was 
extended to make the expiry of all the 
warrants coterminous in September 2017. 
As a result, warrants equivalent to a total 
of 12.5% of the Company’s issued 
ordinary share capital have been issued. 
No warrants were exercised during 2012.
Net Asset Position
At the period end, the Group had net 
assets of £273.9 million, a decrease  
of £10.4 million on the prior year. The 
movements in the net asset position from 
the prior year included a reduction in total 
liabilities of £28.0 million and an increase  
in cash on hand of £19.4 million, offset by 
decreases in property, plant and equipment 
(including assets held for sale) of £39.6 
million, inventory of £1.9 million, derivative 
financial instruments of £8.8 million and 
trade and other receivables of £7.1 million. 
Pensions
The Group’s defined benefit pension 
deficit increased by £17.3 million over the 
year. The increase in the deficit was the 
result of the following factors both positive 
and negative:
´ ´ While investment markets remained 
volatile during 2012, returns were 
greater than those assumed  
by £8.3 million; 
´ ´ There was a further reduction in  
the discount rate applied to the  
scheme liabilities which resulted in  
an increase in the value of liabilities  
of £32.2 million; 
´ ´ A decrease in the assumptions  
relating to inflation has resulted in a 
£8.4 million reduction in liabilities; and
´ ´ In 2012 (following similar exercises  
in 2011), the Group offered a number 
of existing pensioners the opportunity 
to take part in a pension exchange 
where, for a higher pension today, they 
forgo a proportion of future increases. 
This resulted in a gain of £1.5 million 
(2011: £1.9 million).
Other movements of £3.3 million made up 
the balance of the increase in the deficit.
“ At the period end, 
the Group had  
net assets of 
£273.9 million,  
a decrease of 
£10.4 million on  
the prior year.”

The pension fund was also subject  
to a triennial valuation carried out as  
at 31 December 2010. The result of this 
valuation gave rise to a new schedule of 
contributions and funding plan to reduce 
the deficit. As a result, the annual level  
of contributions under the new schedule 
increased from £2.2 million to £5.7 million 
with effect from 1 June 2012. The £5.7 
million annual contributions are payable 
until 31 December 2024.
Financial Reporting
In terms of this report, there are no 
significant changes in International 
Financial Reporting Standards from  
those in force at the end of 2011.
Control Processes
As discussed in the Corporate 
Governance Statement, the Group 
operates rigorous internal control 
processes that assist in the efficient 
operation of the Group’s businesses. 
Central to these processes and controls  
is the fact that the general ledgers,  
fixed asset registers, payables system, 
expenses and payroll are controlled 
through our shared services centre in 
Peterborough, with all cash processing 
and sales ledger balances for mainland  
UK being controlled through a single 
centre in Leeds.
Factors Affecting Future  
Group Performance
The performance of the Group will 
continue to be affected by the economic 
conditions in the UK and Ireland, and the 
on-going cyclical downturn as indicated 
by the current low growth in GDP , 
employment, property transactions,  
new car sales and the levels of consumer 
confidence. However, the outlook for the 
Group will also depend on a number of 
other factors, including:
´ ´ Successful implementation of the 
Group’s new strategy;
´ ´ Growing new revenues (particularly 
digital) in the Group’s existing market 
segments;
´ ´ Maintaining market leadership  
in existing markets;
´ ´ Ability to adapt to customer 
requirements through new sales 
propositions and advertising channels;
´ ´ Continually improving existing efficient 
operations through technology and 
improved processes; and 
´ ´ Further re-engineering of the cost 
base of the business.
Liquidity and Going Concern
The Board has undertaken a recent and 
thorough review of the Group’s forecasts 
and associated risks. These forecasts 
extend for a period beyond one year from 
the date of approval of these financial 
statements. The extent of this review 
reflected the economic outlook and the 
current revenue and cost trends, together 
with the on-going volatility in advertising 
revenues. The forecasts make key 
assumptions, based on information 
available to the Directors, around:
´ ´ Future advertising trends which show 
reducing declines in 2013, consistent 
with current market views with 
stabilisation in 2014.
´ ´ Further cost reduction measures  
to reflect lower revenues and the 
on-going re-engineering of the 
business.
´ ´ Continued growth in digital revenues.
´ ´ Increase in newspaper sales  
revenue performance following  
the title relaunch.
´ ´ Cash inflows on the disposal  
of surplus properties.
Following a thorough review of these 
forecasts and projections and after taking 
account of reasonable downside scenarios 
to the key assumptions underlying these 
forecasts, the Directors are satisfied the 
Group will be able to operate within the terms 
of its financing agreement and covenants.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will have adequate resources 
to continue in operation for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, the Directors continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the Annual Report and Financial Statements.
Breaking the news… MP resigns
The Corby Telegraph broke the news  
that Louise Mensch, MP for Corby & East 
Northamptonshire, was resigning to spend 
more time with her family. Louise contacted 
a reporter at home to tell her the news, 
allowing the Northants Telegraph and its 
Corby edition to scoop the rest of the 
media. The paper’s website enjoyed a 26% 
increase in traffic that day and the story 
dominated the national headlines in the 
following days as it forced a by-election  
and raised questions about MPs juggling 
their political and private lives.

Principal Risks  
and Uncertainties
There are a number of potential risks and 
uncertainties which have been identified by 
the business that could have a material impact 
on the Group’s long-term performance.
This is not a complete list of all those risks 
identified but those that the Directors feel 
could have a significant impact on the 
Group. By including risks within this section, 
the Directors make no prediction as to the 
particular likelihood of any event or set of 
events occurring. The business could also 
be affected by other risks not currently 
identified or considered to be significant.
The risks listed immediately below are 
those the Directors consider the most 
significant in terms of the general 
economic conditions in the markets in 
which we operate. These risks remain  
the most important in terms of the overall 
performance of the Group, but also relate 
to issues over which the Group has no 
control, namely:
´ ´ Change in Gross Domestic Product;
´ ´ Change in the unemployment rate;
´ ´ Levels of property transactions;
´ ´ Levels of new car sales;
´ ´ Levels of consumer confidence; and
´ ´ Public sector spending.
Description of risk Impact
Further Reductions in Print Advertising
Mitigation
Newspaper circulations 
continue to decline due to 
increased availability of news 
through alternative media 
channels and reductions in  
the regularity of purchase.
The reduction in circulations can lead to reduced 
newspaper sales revenues as well as reduced audience 
for our advertisers.
Lifestyle and Technology Changes Affect Newspaper Circulations
The Group continues to promote loyalty schemes to encourage 
increased frequency of newspaper purchase and is seeking to 
increase subscription rates. In response to changing reader habits 
we have introduced news websites tailored to mobile devices, 
increased the frequency of updates and promoted news and 
related apps. 
Print advertising revenues 
could continue to decline  
due to further migration  
of customer spending to 
online media, the on-going 
economic downturn in the  
UK and Republic of Ireland 
and the lack of consumer 
confidence.
Online migration of classified advertising means that 
even with an economic recovery in the UK, it is unlikely 
that these revenues would be fully recovered. Consumer 
confidence is low due to the difficulties in the UK and 
Republic of Ireland economies and on-going Eurozone 
issues, with national and local businesses reducing 
display advertising as consumers are spending less.
The Group continues to develop its online classified offering through 
partnerships, mobile apps and new verticals such as WOW247.  
It also continues to invest in its sales expertise to ensure both a 
more proactive and effective approach and that the sales offering  
is fully understood by sales staff and customers. The relaunch of 
newspaper titles is expected to provide customers with a more 
attractive advertising proposition.
This is an industry issue. 
Online advertising rates are 
lower and it is difficult to 
charge for accessing news 
online because free 
alternatives exist.
Readership continues to migrate to a digital environment 
where the advertising rates per reader are significantly 
lower.
Our digital strategy focuses on building digital audiences  
and revenues through new platforms and enhancing the content 
available to readers and advertisers. The Group has launched a 
number of paid-for news applications and continues to innovate  
its digital products.
Failure to Monetise Increased Readership of our News Websites
As the Group is operating 
above its optimal level of 
gearing, repayment of debt is 
a key priority. However, this 
focus could lead to missed 
revenue opportunities if 
insufficient funds are left 
available for investment.
The Group may be unable to take advantage of 
opportunities to invest in its core business or 
complementary revenue streams thus impacting  
its long-term growth prospects.
Business Opportunities Constrained by Debt
The Group seeks to comply with all the requirements of its funding 
arrangements in the most cash-effective manner and carefully 
prioritises any funds available for investment to those areas which 
can provide the greatest long-term return.
Like most organisations there 
is an element of dependency 
on certain key individuals in 
the Group.
Should some of these key people leave the organisation 
there could be the loss of industry knowledge, supplier 
relationships, technical expertise and leadership.
The Group has put in place succession planning across the 
organisation and this is reviewed annually by the Executive 
Directors and by the main Board. During 2012 further emphasis  
has been placed on staff engagement. With detailed surveys 
conducted, increased staff communication and introducing  
a new awards scheme.

Business Risk Management System
Impact Mitigation
The Group has finance 
facilities in place which 
require certain financial 
covenants to be met, 
including profit and  
cashflow targets.
If the covenants are not met, the Group would face a 
breach of the terms of its finance facilities and may be 
forced to renegotiate them with its lenders.
The Group continues to use excess cash to reduce the level of debt. 
Under its finance arrangements, covenant levels have been set 
based on management’s forecasts and expectations. The Group 
anticipates operating within the covenants throughout the term of 
the facilities.
Financing Risk
There is a risk to the business 
in terms of both supply and 
pricing of newsprint which, 
after staff costs, is the largest 
single expense incurred by 
the business.
Newsprint Price and Supply Risk
In 2012 newsprint represented approximately 12% of  
the Group’s cost base. A significant increase in price 
would impact the Group’s profitability and a reduction  
in supply could impact the quantity of free newspapers 
we distribute in the market, which could in turn have an 
impact on advertising revenues.
The Group carefully manages its consumption of newsprint through 
waste management, recycling, pagination and distribution of free 
titles. The Group also has some of the most efficient printing presses 
in the industry. Contracts are put in place with key suppliers to 
ensure security of supply and optimum pricing.
The Group Defined Benefit 
pension scheme is currently 
in deficit leaving the Group 
responsible for potential 
shortfalls.
While working to reduce the pension deficit, the Group 
must balance this with the need to invest in the business 
and reduce the level of debt and resulting interest 
charges.
Higher deficit funding payments have been made to the scheme 
since June 2012 as agreed with the trustees and taking into account 
Group cashflow forecasts. The scheme is closed to future accrual, 
and pension exchange exercises have taken place to limit the level  
of pension increases, reducing the liability further.
Pension Deficit Funding
The Group has a financial risk 
in terms of variations in 
interest rates and foreign 
exchange rates.
Should interest rates increase, the Group could pay 
more in interest and this would put a strain on cashflow 
and debt reduction plans. The Group also has debt  
in US dollars and Euros and adverse fluctuations in 
exchange rates could affect net indebtedness.
Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Risk
The Group policy is that at least 50% of its interest rate exposure 
should be hedged. The Group has in place interest rate caps 
covering its sterling debt with the US dollar denominated debt at  
set coupon rates. The US dollar denominated debt is hedged with 
respect to foreign exchange risk such that there is minimal risk  
on either the interest payments on or the repayments of principal  
as and when they fall due. The Euro denominated debt was 
approximately €12.3 million and was more than matched by the 
value of Euro denominated assets, with interest payments funded  
by Euro cash flows from the Group’s Republic of Ireland activities.

Corporate Social  
Responsibility
Johnston Press is committed to operating all  
of the Group’s business activities to the highest 
standards of business ethics and integrity.  
These principles are reflected in the Group’s 
approach to Corporate Social Responsibility.
Business Ethics
The Group’s code of ethics is supported  
by clear policies and procedures for 
addressing relevant issues. Policies  
are made available to employees with 
supporting guidance and are designed to 
protect both the employee and employer. 
The Group seeks to act as a fair and 
reasonable employer and is very aware of 
its responsibilities to readers, customers, 
suppliers, shareholders, other stakeholders 
and the environment. Some of the many 
community orientated activities the Group 
is involved in are explained on page 29  
and more can be found on our website, 
www.johnstonpress.co.uk.
Board Responsibility
The Board has delegated the day-to-day 
responsibility for all matters related to 
Corporate Social Responsibility to the 
Executive Directors. They are assisted by 
the Company Secretary who also chairs 
the Group’s Carbon Footprint Taskforce.
Responsibility for formulating, updating 
and ensuring adherence to Group human 
resources policies and relevant legislation 
has been delegated to the Director of 
Human Resources, who reports to the 
Chief Executive Officer on these issues.
The Directors regularly review issues 
relating to the Group’s Corporate Social 
Responsibility Statement.
The Group seeks to monitor developments 
in relevant environmental, social and 
governance issues and to respond to 
changes in legislation, regulation and  
best practice. Environmental, social and 
governance risks are assessed as part  
of the Group’s ongoing risk analysis.
Health & Safety
The Group’s rigorous health & safety 
management and reporting processes  
have brought about a significant reduction 
in all types of accidents and in the number 
of people involved in accidents. The last 
recorded ‘lost time’ accident was in 
January 2012. We believe that our focus  
on addressing the causes of accidents,  
and our insistence on the adherence to 
best practice and procedures, has played a 
part in our improved performance. Although 
we are proud of this achievement, our work 
will continue to ensure every effort is made 
to maintain this record.
There are Health & Safety Committees in 
every Group company and a Group Health 
& Safety Committee which instructs and 
reviews audit visits, monitors compliance 
with Group policies, ensures those policies 
are kept up to date and encourages best 
practice. Representatives of companies 
with leading health & safety performances 
are invited to attend meetings to share 
their experiences and best practice.
The Group Health & Safety Manager 
co-ordinated independent audits of all  
our main sites in 2012. He also worked  
to create stronger links with site health  
& safety officers and this helped centres 
improve their scores in our rolling 
programme of internal audit inspections. 
Our consistent reporting processes have 
now been in place for more than eight 
years, allowing performance over time to be 
measured. Every accident is reported and 
this is a key part of our control environment.
Employee Involvement
We have more than 4,300 employees in 
the UK and Republic of Ireland and our 
aim is to attract, retain and engage the 
best people in a high performance and 
supportive culture that drives business 
performance and recognises that a  
diverse workforce adds clear value  
for our employees, our customers, our 
shareholders and the communities we 
serve. We fully support the principle of 
equal opportunity for all. Our procedures 
allow any employee to report behaviour 
that is contrary to our policies or is in any 
way of concern to them. We recognise  
a number of trade unions at an operating 
company level in both the UK and in the 
Republic of Ireland and have employee 
forums at a Group and operating company 
level for communication and consultation.
An all-staff survey conducted in the first 
half of 2012 helped identify areas for 
improvement and staff development. All 
employees had the opportunity to have 
their say and help develop action plans  
for their areas of the business. A second 
survey took place in January 2013.
Our subsidiary businesses have differing 
pay structures based on their size and 
local market conditions. Progression 
within these pay structures is based on 
competence, achievement of qualifications 
and performance. We also operate bonus 
schemes for executive and sales staff.
Our Disability Access policy is included  
in our Personnel Policies & Procedures 
manual. As part of our health & safety 
audits (and property maintenance 
programmes), we seek to ensure that 
access to our sites does not discriminate 
against disabled employees or customers.
T o assist disabled users of our digital products, 
the Group continues to make improvements 
to its core internet sites in accordance 
with WCAG 2.0 accessibility standards 
and in line with W3C recommendations.   Overview

Customer Services
It is Group policy to provide the highest 
standard of service to all of our customers. 
Each operating company has staff appointed 
to respond to customer enquiries. There 
are strict procedures for resolving customer 
complaints or queries regarding service 
and these are carefully monitored.
Local management in each operation  
is responsible for ensuring compliance 
with all customer and competition related 
legislation. To monitor this, and for training 
purposes, the Group undertakes ‘mystery 
shopping’ exercises. Our Group call 
centres allow us to offer a high level of 
response, professionalism and overall 
experience for customers.
We have commissioned independent 
audits of our customer services to  
drive continual improvement. The Group 
Sales Charter has become central to  
our operations, ensuring customers and 
advertisers are always dealt with in a fair 
and equitable manner. Our terms of trade 
are published in the Group’s newspapers 
and are available on all of our websites. 
Equal attention is paid to the service we 
provide to our readers and viewers with 
each editor directly responsible for any 
complaints. The Editorial Review Group,  
a body of senior Group editors, will be 
replaced by an Editorial Board in 2013 
which will agree editorial strategy, policy, 
standards and innovation. The Group 
conformed to the Press Complaints 
Commission Code of Practice and is 
monitoring proposed industry regulation 
resulting from the Leveson Inquiry.
Energy and Climate Change
Johnston Press achieved the Carbon Trust 
Standard for the second time in July 2012. 
It is recognition for our achievements in 
carbon reduction and demonstrates our 
commitment to reducing carbon emissions 
year-on-year. 
Inroads were made into the Group’s 
energy use last year with one initiative 
reducing lighting in the press hall at 
Dinnington by 50% and the mailroom 
lighting by 80%. The Group, in conjunction 
with its energy management consultants, 
is investigating a process which would 
allow the main plant to be shut down 
when printing does not take place. This 
would reduce site energy consumption  
by an estimated 5%. If successful this 
would be rolled out to our Portsmouth 
plant. Discussions are also continuing  
with respect to the potential installation  
of wind and solar power at Dinnington. 
We continued to make progress on 
reducing the Group’s car and van fleet  
and CO
2
 ratings. Replacement vehicles 
introduced to our fleet generally had lower 
CO
2
 ratings, giving an average reduction 
of 6.0%. Full details are shown in table 1 
on page 28. 
The Group has no emissions to air from  
its printing presses.
Carbon Footprint 
The Group established its Carbon  
Footprint Taskforce in 2008. It developed 
our environmental policy and is responsible 
for co-ordinating activities in this area. 
Among its objectives are promoting energy 
efficiency and recycling, co-ordinating 
Group-wide energy efficiency initiatives, 
agreeing measurement standards for 
carbon footprint and running the Group’s 
Environmental Award.
After a review, the Taskforce recommended 
that we seek reductions in total energy 
consumption of 10% against 2011 levels 
for our printing and publishing centres by 
the end of 2013. We were pleased with 
initial indications of achieving a 7.7% 
reduction in 2012, but our efforts in this 
area continue.
The Group continued to work in partnership 
with Dell, its principal supplier of IT 
equipment, to develop a disposal channel 
for redundant IT equipment. 
Waste Management
The Group continued its long-standing 
partnership with industry-leading 
environmental services companies  
and both paper and non-paper waste 
products are now segregated into more 
than 20 different streams to maximise  
their recycling potential.
All our newsprint waste products are 
returned to paper mills in the UK to be 
used in the manufacture of virgin paper. 
Figures show that in 2011, 78.9% of 
British newsprint was produced from 
recycled fibre, nearly 9% above the  
target agreed with the Government.
The Group adheres to the requirements  
of the Producer Responsibility Obligations 
Regulations 1997.
Non-paper based waste from the printing 
press is separated and collected for 
recycling in line with the Environmental 
Protection Act and Hazardous Waste 
Regulations. This is an audited and ISO 
14001 accredited process carried out by 
our environmental partners. Some 90%  
of all material collected is recycled and 
re-used in the manufacture of a diverse 
range of products.

Environmental Policy
The Group’s environmental policy is to 
ensure that every aspect of our activities  
is conducted in accordance with sound 
environmental practices. We aim to  
ensure that we continually minimise the 
environmental impact of our activities.
Car Fleet
The programme of changing our car fleet 
from wholly owned to leasing continued 
through 2012 and allowed us to move to 
lower emission vehicles where possible.
Driver licensing records and driving  
risk assessments were updated and 
employees driving on Company business 
were issued in 2012 with a new, updated 
comprehensive driver’s handbook 
incorporating road safety advice and 
guidance. We are now conducting a 
comprehensive driver training course in 
conjunction with our motor fleet insurers.
Community Involvement
Our newspapers and websites remain 
trusted providers of information in the 
communities we serve and our journalists 
work incredibly hard to provide the content 
our audiences expect across a variety  
of media. 
In keeping with one of our strategic 
objectives to build online audiences,  
our websites, mobile sites and tablet  
and Smartphone apps are drawing  
ever greater numbers of visitors.
Our journalists have taken advantage  
of social media such as Twitter and 
Facebook to instantly update audiences. 
Journalists also regularly Tweet from 
council meetings, other public debates 
and court cases. The Peterborough 
Telegraph tweeted updates on court 
proceedings from the trial of the parents  
of Tyler Whelan, a boy murdered by  
his stepfather. 
Our websites provide the latest 
information across a wide range of topics 
– and are often the first to break a story. 
The News Post Leader in Whitley Bay  
was the first to break online the suicide  
of PC David Rathband, the policeman 
blinded by gunman Raul Moat, and the 
Wigan Evening Post and Lancashire 
Evening Post were the first to alert the 
world that Tour de France winner Bradley 
Wiggins had been knocked off his bike  
by a car in Wigan.
Our journalists are also getting creative in 
driving online audiences: The Edinburgh 
Evening News took the idea of multi-
media to new levels when the team wrote 
and produced its own pop song and video 
(including vocals from the editor) to mark 
the first all-Edinburgh football cup final in 
116 years. The video went viral, attracting 
an incredible 130,000 views on YouTube in 
just 10 days – the equivalent of one every 
seven seconds. The result was a huge  
PR spin-off for the newspaper on TV and 
radio, an increase in sales of 40,000 and 
more than 100,000 additional website hits.
Campaigns and fund-raising activities 
build strong links with audiences and  
2012 proved no exception as our titles 
continued to cement their roles as the 
voices of their communities.
The Hartlepool Mail launched its  
We Can Do It campaign to encourage 
readers to support a food bank for those 
in need in the town. The target was three 
tonnes of food – but readers donated  
4.5 tonnes in less than three months. The 
Doncaster Free Press’s campaign, Let’s 
Get Doncaster Working, won praise from  
local and Westminster politicians after 
succeeding in getting several unemployed 
people back to work. The Hastings 
Observer’s long campaign to rebuild the 
fire-ravaged Hastings Pier has borne fruit 
with £11 million funding now provided  
for the project, and the Harborough Mail 
launched a campaign to refurbish every 
war memorial in the district ahead of the 
100th anniversary in 2014 of the start of 
the First World War.
The Yorkshire Post has an enviable 
reputation for successful campaigns  
and in July it hailed the success of one  
its most significant ever. Its Give Us a  
Fair Deal campaign, calling for action to 
help the regional economy and narrow  
the North/South divide, resulted in action  
on a third of its 60-strong ‘bank of ideas’ 
to support Yorkshire.
Taking part – and often organising – 
community events remains a key focus  
for our titles. The Fife Free Press organised 
the first ever Raith Rovers FC Hall of Fame 
Show which was a 475-seat sell-out event 
attended by celebrities such as Gordon 
Strachan and Val McDiarmid. It raised 
£7,500 for Raith Rovers and will be held 
again in 2013. All our Northern Ireland 
weekly titles were involved in highlighting 
the unsung heroes in their communities  
as part of a ‘People Who Make Us Proud’ 
initiative which saw the public invited to 
nominate worthy recipients in their towns. 
And the Lancashire Evening Post helped 
mark the Preston Guild – an event held  
only every 20 years – with daily 24-page 
specials, publication of the official souvenir 
and a microsite online featuring news, 
updates, audio and video of the events.
Some of our titles celebrated their own 
anniversaries, recognising long histories  
of serving local people. The Sheffield  
Star marked 125 years with special 
supplements, an exhibition, a specially 
brewed ale and a visit from Prince Andrew. 
East Midlands Trains also named one of  
its engines The Sheffield Star. The Burnley 
Express also marked 125 years of 
publication – its specially brewed ale 
ended up on sale in the members’ bar at 
the Houses of Parliament and a special 
spicy sausage was created called Hot Off 
The Press. And the News Letter in Belfast 
celebrated its 275th anniversary with 
messages from The Queen, Prime Minister 
David Cameron and Northern Ireland’s 
First Minister Peter Robinson. It is the 
oldest English language daily newspaper 
in the world.
Many more case studies outlining our 
community involvement – along with 
details of the more than 35 industry 
awards won by our journalists and titles 
– can be found on our corporate website

Corporate Governance
The Company is committed to the principles of Corporate Governance contained in the UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’) 
published in 2010 by the Financial Reporting Council, for which the Board is accountable to shareholders.
In September 2012 the Financial Reporting Council published a new edition of the Code which applies to premium listed companies 
for financial years beginning on or after 1 October 2012 and the Company will report against the provisions of the revised Code for 
future years.
Statement of Compliance with the Code and the Application of the Principles of Good Governance
Throughout the period ended 29 December 2012, the Company has been compliant with the provisions set out in the Code and 
applied the principles of the Code, including both the main principles and the supporting principles. Further explanation of how the 
principles have been applied is set out below and, in connection with Directors’ remuneration, in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Directors and Board
Board Effectiveness
The Board considers it has shown its commitment to leading and controlling the Company by meeting eight times in the year, and  
can meet when necessary for any matters which may arise. The Remuneration Committee held eight scheduled meetings, the Audit 
Committee six and the Nomination Committee three.
The Board sets the strategic aims and objectives of the Group, ensuring that the Group has sufficient financial and human resources  
to meet its objectives. The Board also sets the Group’s values and standards and ensures that its obligations to its shareholders and 
others are understood and met. Management is responsible for the application of the aims and objectives on a day-to-day basis, as well 
as monitoring the financial achievements of the business. The Board reviews the performance of management in meeting the agreed 
objectives and goals, and monitors appropriate remuneration levels. The Group’s management development and succession plans are 
scrutinised by the Board to ensure that the skills and competencies of management correspond to the Group’s requirements. At least  
one Board meeting each year is wholly devoted to strategy and to the consideration of a plan for the long-term growth and development 
of the Group. This is reviewed and discussed as appropriate at the other Board meetings held during the year.
In addition to the normal agenda at Board meetings, which is described below, the Directors usually consider one or more operational 
or special topic at each meeting. During the last twelve months this has included business risks, circulation and audience reach of 
paid for newspapers, advertising revenues, sales effectiveness, digital revenues and publishing, the Group’s finance facilities and 
human resource requirements, new product offers and presentations from the Group’s Publishing Unit Managing Directors.
Board Meeting Agenda
The Board maintains a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decision, including future strategy, acquisitions  
and disposals, dividend policy, approval of the Annual Report and Accounts, capital expenditure in excess of certain limits, trading 
and capital budgets and Group borrowing facilities. At each meeting during the year, the Board considered reports from the Chief 
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and the Director of Digital and Business Development. Since the  
start of 2013, the Board has also considered a report from the Group Commercial & Marketing Director. The Minutes of Board and 
Committee meetings are circulated to all Board members. The Company Secretary is responsible to the Board for the timeliness  
and quality of information provided to it.
Board Responsibilities
The Board acknowledges the division of responsibilities for running the Board and managing the Company’s business. Ian Russell 
served as Non-Executive Chairman throughout the year. The Chairman is responsible for the leadership of the Board, for setting the 
Board’s agenda and ensuring that adequate time is available for discussion of all agenda items, in particular strategic issues. It is also 
his responsibility to promote a culture of openness and debate by facilitating the effective contribution of Non-Executive Directors  
in particular and ensuring constructive relations between Executive and Non-Executive Directors. 
As part of their role, Non-Executive Directors should constructively challenge and help develop proposals on strategy. They should 
scrutinise the performance of management in meeting agreed goals and objectives and monitor the reporting of performance. They 
should satisfy themselves on the integrity of financial information and that controls and systems of risk management are robust and 
defensible. They are responsible for determining appropriate levels of remuneration of Executive Directors and have a prime role  
in appointing and, where necessary, removing Executive Directors and in succession planning.
Mark Pain served as Senior Independent Director throughout 2012. The Senior Independent Director is available to address any 
concerns that shareholders may have that have not been resolved through the normal communication channels of the Chairman  
or Executive Directors. Throughout 2012, the Nomination Committee was chaired by Ian Russell, the Remuneration Committee  
by Geoff Iddison and the Audit Committee by Mark Pain. The terms of reference of each of the Board’s Committees were reviewed  
by the Board during 2012 and the terms are displayed on the Company’s website. Membership of each Committee is detailed  
with the Directors’ biographies on pages 30 and 31.  Overview

Board Balance and Independence
Of the Company’s current nine Directors, three are Executive and the remainder Non-Executive, of whom four are regarded as 
independent. Details are provided on pages 30 and 31. Throughout the year, the Company complied with the requirement of the Code 
that at least half of the Board (excluding the Chairman) should consist of independent Non-Executive Directors. Ralph Marshall was 
appointed to the Board as the nominee Director of Usaha Tegas which owns 20% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital.  
He is therefore not regarded as independent.
Nomination Committee
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee. Reporting to the Board, its duties include regularly reviewing the structure, 
size and composition of the Board, seeking suitably skilled and experienced candidates as Non-Executive Directors with sufficient time  
to devote to the role and overseeing all Board appointments. In doing so the Committee also considers the Company’s succession 
planning for Executive Directors and senior managers, to ensure that adequate plans are in place to protect against the loss of key staff, 
as well as reviewing the composition of the Board and its committees. In considering candidates to fill Board vacancies, the Nomination 
Committee has regard to the benefits of and the need to encourage diversity within the Board’s membership and this is specified in its 
terms of reference which were reviewed in 2012. Once the role of a vacancy has been determined, the Committee may appoint external 
recruitment consultants to assist with the search. 
Induction and Professional Development
The Company has a detailed induction programme for new Directors. This is tailored to specific requirements and includes visits to  
a range of the Group’s operations where appropriate and meetings and discussions with senior management and advisers, together 
with the provision of the Company’s full written induction guide.
All Board members have access to independent advice on any matters relating to their responsibilities as Directors and as members  
of the various Committees of the Board. The assistance of the Company Secretary is available to all Directors for all matters connected 
to their duties.
Training
Director training is undertaken as required during the year. This can encompass a variety of topics, including industry specific 
governance and technical issues. It is the Company’s policy that each Non-Executive Director visits at least two of the Group’s  
centres each year where they receive a presentation and a tour of the business. Individual Directors also attended a range of seminars 
presented by professionals throughout the year. When the Non-Executive Directors meet without the Executive Directors present,  
the balance of skills on the Board (including training needs) is one of the standard topics for the Board to consider, both individually 
and collectively.
Board Performance Evaluation
During the last year, the Board has conducted a rigorous evaluation of its own performance and that of each of its Committees.  
This involved the completion of a self-assessment questionnaire by all Directors covering the performance of the Board, individual 
Directors, the Company Secretary and Board Committees. Other topics included the conduct of meetings, the provision of information, 
relationships, strategy, training and the overall effectiveness of the Board. The composition and chairmanship of each Committee was 
reviewed together with its fulfilment of its role as outlined in its terms of reference, its reporting and overall performance. The topics  
which the evaluation exercise addressed were intended to provide the Board with an analysis of the performance of its key duties.  
The process has been developed internally and is administered by the Company Secretary. The process that the Company deploys 
utilises a scoring system for assessing Committee and Board performance with a focus on the particular skills and contributions of 
individuals. The Company Secretary prepared a report of the conclusions which was presented to the Board together with a summary  
of any individual recommendations for the consideration of the Chairman. This was followed up by meetings as appropriate between  
the Chairman and individual Directors. Reviews of Board Committees were undertaken by Committee members as well as the Board  
as a whole. The results highlighted areas of particular focus for the Board in the coming year and overall the process was positive  
and confirmed the effectiveness of the Board and relevant Committees as well as the contributions of individual Directors. Under the 
provisions of the Code, evaluation of the boards of FTSE 350 companies (which does not include the Company) should be conducted 
externally every three years. The Board considered whether to undertake an externally facilitated evaluation during 2012 and concluded 
that it was not appropriate to do so at that time. However, the position is being kept under review. 34 | Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Corporate Governance
(continued)
Board Re-election
Under the provisions of the Company’s Articles of Association, all Directors are subject to election at the first Annual General Meeting 
after their appointment and thereafter to re-election every three years. The Company is not currently a member of the FTSE 350 index 
of companies and is therefore not required to comply with the provision of the Code which requires all directors of companies in that 
index to be subject to annual re-election. However, the Board considers that it is now appropriate that all Directors stand for annual 
re-election, and resolutions will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting for the re-election of each Director who 
wishes to continue in office.
The Nomination Committee and Ian Russell as Chairman have, following the formal evaluation process described above, considered 
the performance of each of the Directors who wish to stand for re-election at the 2013 Annual General Meeting and are satisfied that 
those individuals’ performance continue to be effective and that they have demonstrated a clear commitment to their roles.
Separately during the course of the year, the Non-Executive Directors met without Ian Russell to review his performance as Chairman 
and were satisfied that he continues to be effective and has demonstrated an on-going commitment to the role.
Accountability and Audit 
Financial Reporting
The Board is committed to presenting appropriate information about the Group’s financial position by complying with best practice 
and all standards issued by the International and UK Accounting Standards Boards relating to the disclosures which are included  
in this Annual Report.
Directors’ Responsibilities Statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations. Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards  
and applicable law). Under company law the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a  
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
•	 make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•	 state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed; and
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue 
in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
•	 properly select and apply accounting policies;
•	 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
•	 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
•	 make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Going Concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have formed a judgment, at the time of approving the financial statements, that there is a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Business Review on 
pages 12 to 29.  Overview

Internal Control
The Board has applied principle C.2 of the Code by establishing a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
significant risks the Group faces. The Board regularly reviews the process, which has been in place from the start of the year to the 
date of approval of this report and which is in accordance with the revised guidance on internal control published in October 2005  
(the Turnbull Guidance). The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.  
Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
In compliance with Provision C.2.1 of the Code, the Board regularly reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control. 
The Board’s monitoring covers all controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management and is 
based principally on reviewing reports from management to consider whether significant risks are identified, evaluated, managed and 
controlled and whether any significant weaknesses or emerging issues are promptly remedied or indicate a need for more extensive 
monitoring. The Board has also performed a specific assessment for the purpose of this Annual Report. This assessment considers  
all significant aspects of internal control arising during the period covered by the report including work of the Group’s Internal Financial 
Control Committee (IFCC). The Audit Committee assists the Board (which maintains responsibility in this regard) in discharging its 
review responsibilities.
During the course of its review of the system of internal control, the Board has not identified or been advised of any failings or 
weaknesses which it has determined to be significant. Therefore a confirmation in respect of necessary actions has not been 
considered appropriate. The key elements of the on-going continuous process during the period under review have been:
•	 Formal Board reporting on a monthly basis of the Group’s performance and on any emerging risks and issues. The monthly 
management accounts break down the results of the Group’s operations into its two reportable segments. All significant 
variations against budget and the previous year are fully examined. The day-to-day responsibility for managing each of the 
Group’s operations rests with experienced senior executives and the Group has a clear organisational structure which includes 
appropriate delegation of authority. The Executive Directors ensure that regular contact is maintained with all senior executives. 
•	 Formal Board approval for capital expenditure over £500,000 and for other investment decisions. 
•	 Formal Board approval of the annual budget for the forthcoming financial year. This includes detailed and comprehensive 
budgets covering each operating business.
•	 Formal Board reporting of the key functional departments’ future strategy as part of the operational topics considered at Board 
meetings during the year.
•	 Review by the Audit Committee (with subsequent reporting to the Board) on a six-monthly basis of the work performed by the 
IFCC based on a programme of work agreed in advance. The IFCC is chaired by the Group Head of Finance who is responsible 
for the conduct of control reviews in selected locations by members of the Committee who are independent of the location 
visited. The IFCC is also responsible for the review of detailed financial control checklists submitted monthly by each operation 
to the Group’s head office. This work is supported by the Group’s financial accounting centre which ensures a consistent and 
compliant approach to the processing of transactions and ensures a uniform control process across the Group’s operations.  
The Audit Committee has reviewed the role of the IFCC. Due to the changing nature of the Group and in order to ensure that 
resources are properly deployed to identify, monitor and mitigate risk, it has concluded that the work of the IFCC be 
supplemented through the use of a dedicated internal audit function, the form of which shall be determined, and the appointment 
made by, the Audit Committee, with a recommendation being made by the Executive Directors. It is anticipated that the new 
internal audit structure will be in place by the end of the first half of 2013.
•	 Review by the Audit Committee (with subsequent reporting to the Board) of the conclusions of the Group’s external auditors  
in their annual audit and review of the half-year results. These reviews include discussion of any control weaknesses or issues 
identified by the auditors.
•	 The risk assessment process involving all senior managers of the Group’s businesses in addition to the Executive Directors.  
A risk matrix is reviewed on a regular basis throughout the year by both the local operations and senior management. Risks  
are examined at regular executive meetings both locally and at Group level. These risk assessment sessions are held at each 
operation and will evaluate and address the risks identified. The results of these assessments are addressed in the Executive 
Directors’ reports to the Board. During 2012, senior management considered customer care metrics; newspaper re-launch, 
human resources, pensions, newsprint, banking covenants, national advertising sales, revenue growth and digital strategy, 
management resources, newspaper sales, energy management, and property.
Steps are taken on an on-going basis to embed best practice into all the Group’s operations and to deal with areas of improvement 
which come to management’s and the Board’s attention. 36 | Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Corporate Governance
(continued)
Internal Control (continued)
In addition, senior management set policies, procedures and standards as detailed in the Group’s policy guidelines. These are reviewed 
and revised on an annual basis and tailored versions have been issued to the businesses in the Republic of Ireland and Isle of Man.  
The guidelines include policies on:
•	 Finance including cash/treasury controls and authorisation levels;
•	 Trading;
•	 Customer service;
•	 Commercial and competition;
•	 Technology;
•	 Property management;
•	 Human resources including pension administration, disability and health and safety; 
•	 Environmental issues and energy management;
•	 Legal and regulatory compliance; and
•	 Business continuity. 
At the Board meeting in early March 2013, the Directors reviewed the need for an internal audit department and, as reported on page 
35, concluded that they believed it was necessary for the Group to adapt its internal audit function to reflect the changing nature of the 
business through the introduction of a dedicated internal audit resource.
Audit Committee and Auditors
Summary of the Role of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board from the Non-Executive Directors of the Company. The Audit Committee’s terms of 
reference include all matters indicated by Disclosure and Transparency Rule 7.1 and the Code. The terms of reference are considered 
annually by the Audit Committee and are approved by the Board. A copy of the current terms of reference are available on the 
Company’s website.
The Audit Committee is responsible for:
•	 monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the Group and any formal announcements relating to the Group’s financial 
performance and reviewing significant financial reporting judgements contained therein;
•	 reviewing the Group’s internal financial controls and the Group’s internal control and risk management systems;
•	 monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the IFCC and making proposals to the Board as to the need, or otherwise, for an 
internal audit function;
•	 making recommendations to the Board, for a resolution to be put to the shareholders for their approval in general meeting, on 
the appointment of the external auditors and the approval of the remuneration and terms of engagement of the external auditors;
•	 reviewing and monitoring the external auditors’ independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process, taking 
into consideration relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements;
•	 developing and implementing the Group’s policy on the engagement of the external auditors to supply non-audit services, taking 
into account relevant guidance regarding provision of non-audit services by the external audit firm; and
•	 reviewing the arrangements by which staff may, in confidence, raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial 
reporting or other areas.
The Audit Committee is required to report its findings to the Board, identifying any matters on which it considers that action or 
improvement is needed and make recommendations on the steps to be taken. The Committee’s Terms of Reference permit it to 
oversee the selection process for appointing new auditors should it determine, or it becomes necessary, to do so.
Composition of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Mark Pain, a Chartered Accountant, who is considered by the Board to have relevant financial 
experience and expertise for that role, and fulfils the requirement that the Committee includes at least one financially qualified member. 
All Audit Committee members are expected to be financially literate. Camilla Rhodes and Kjell Aamot, both of whom hold or have 
previously held board and/or executive management level posts in major media organisations, are also members. Details of each 
Director can be found on pages 30 and 31.
Membership of the Committee is reviewed at regular intervals by the Chairman of the Committee and the Chairman of the Board,  
who is not a member of the Audit Committee. The Committee is normally comprised of three independent Non-Executive Directors.  Overview

Meetings
The Audit Committee is required to meet not less than three times per year and has an agenda linked to events in the Group’s financial 
calendar. The agenda is predominantly cyclical and is therefore approved by the Audit Committee Chairman on behalf of his fellow 
members. Each Audit Committee member has the right to require reports on matters of interest in addition to the cyclical items.
The Audit Committee meetings are attended by the Chief Financial Officer and the Group Head of Finance at the invitation of the 
Committee and by the Company Secretary, who acts as Secretary to the Committee, with minutes being circulated to all Board 
members. The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer are also invited to attend if required to do so by the 
Committee. Towards the close of relevant meetings, all Executives leave in order for the Committee to have appropriate discussion 
with the external auditors. The Audit Committee Chairman also has a private meeting with the external audit partner during the course 
of the year to discuss any relevant issues.
The Committee meets once during the year with the Company’s external auditors to discuss and agree the audit programme for the 
forthcoming year, together with any proposed non-audit work. Any significant non-audit work by the auditors is approved by the 
Committee in advance of any engagement letter being signed.
Overview of the Actions Taken by the Audit Committee to Discharge its Duties
Three of the scheduled meetings in 2012 followed the year-end audit and the fourth and fifth followed the interim review. The third 
meeting after the year-end results was required in order to consider the implications of the Group’s refinancing in April 2012. The 
meetings covered comprehensive reports from management on material accounting policies and significant judgement areas and  
from the external auditors on their work and conclusions. The Committee focussed in particular on the areas of financial judgement  
by the Group.
Three of the meetings during 2012 considered reports on the work of the IFCC. Its work, together with the proposed changes to the 
function, is described in the Internal Control section.
A sixth meeting took place in November 2012 where the Committee carried out a review of the Group’s key business risks and 
amendments to its system of reviewing and monitoring risk. The Committee is actively involved in the ongoing review of risk and 
internal controls by the main Board.
External Auditors
At the meeting to review the Annual Report and Accounts, the Committee formally considers the non-audit services provided by  
the Group’s external auditors and the effectiveness of the audit process. It is the Company’s policy that any non-audit work to be 
performed by the auditors, where fees on a cumulative basis exceed £50,000 in any financial year, must be approved by the Audit 
Committee. The Group’s policy requires that services and/or advice that requires auditing is not undertaken by the external auditors.  
If non-audit fees for a financial year exceed the audit related fees for a year, then Board approval must be given.
To assess the effectiveness of the external auditors, the Audit Committee reviewed:
•	 the arrangements for ensuring the external auditors’ independence and objectivity;
•	 the external auditors’ fulfilment of the agreed audit plan and any variations from the plan;
•	 the robustness and perceptiveness of the auditors in their handling of the key accounting and audit judgements; and
•	 the content of the external auditors’ reporting on internal control.
During 2012 the Company has used several professional firms for different projects. The Republic of Ireland taxation compliance and 
advisory work is undertaken by a professional firm other than the Group’s auditors.
The Committee oversaw the appointment of Deloitte LLP in 2002 and has a primary responsibility for the appointment, re-appointment 
and removal of auditors. The Committee conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the external audit process as part of its work 
during the year. The Committee reviewed the auditor’s plan for the year, noting the role of the senior statutory audit partner and key  
audit staff, the arrangements for day-to-day management of the audit, if there were any conflicts of interest and the extent of non-audit 
services provided by the auditor. Non-audit related services provided in 2012 consisted of taxation compliance and advisory and pension 
funding advisory, with total fees of £146,000 (see Note 8). The advice was provided by partners and staff who had no involvement in the 
audit of the financial statements. The Committee is satisfied that the objectivity and independence of the external audit is safeguarded. 
The Committee has considered the likelihood of a withdrawal of the external auditor from the market and noted that there are no 
contractual obligations to restrict the choice of external auditors.
The Committee has recommended to the Board the re-appointment of the external auditors. On the recommendation of the Audit 
Committee, the Directors will be proposing the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP at the Annual General Meeting on 26 April 2013.  
The Audit Partner rotated at the commencement of the 2012 interim review and will continue to rotate every five years. 38 | Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Corporate Governance
(continued)
Dialogue with Institutional Shareholders
The Board encourages and seeks to build a mutual understanding of objectives between the Company and its institutional 
shareholders. As part of this process, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer make twice yearly presentations  
to institutional shareholders and meet with shareholders to discuss any issues of concern and to obtain feedback. In addition,  
they communicate regularly throughout the year with those shareholders who request a meeting.
The Chairman personally contacts the leading shareholders in the Company on an annual basis to address any concerns and discuss 
any issues. The Board receives a report on any discussion with shareholders and the written feedback that follows full year and the 
half year results presentations is circulated to the Board. Brokers’ reports and analysts’ briefings, when available, are included in the 
Board papers sent to the Directors in advance of meetings.
The Board receives a quarterly update on the shareholder register with a summary of the main movements in shareholdings since the 
previous report.
Members of the Board have met with institutional shareholders during the year to consider Corporate Governance matters. All the  
Non-Executive Directors are prepared to meet with shareholders to understand their views more fully.
Annual General Meeting
The Board seeks to encourage shareholders to attend its Annual General Meeting. It is the policy of the Board that all Directors should 
attend the Annual General Meeting and be available to answer shareholders’ questions unless unable to do so. The Company uses the 
Annual General Meeting to communicate with private investors and encourages their participation. All Directors attended the Annual 
General Meeting in 2012. In 2012, the notice of the Annual General Meeting and related papers were sent to shareholders not less 
than 20 days before the meeting.

Directors’  
Remuneration Report
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committee’s report on Directors’ remuneration for 2012.
As you may be aware, the Government has tabled proposals to reform the way Directors’ remuneration is voted upon and reported.  
In particular, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (‘BIS’) has produced two consultation papers, the results of which, 
amongst other things will have an impact on the content and presentation of information in the Remuneration Report.
The new legislative requirements will not come into effect until October 2013 but, although not mandatory for this report, the Committee 
has decided to adopt some of these changes early. Consistent with the proposals, the report has been split into two sections: a Policy 
Section which sets out the policy on the remuneration of the Executive and Non-Executive Directors and an Implementation Section 
which discloses how the remuneration policy has been implemented for the period ending 29 December 2012. We will be seeking your 
support for both parts of the report by way of a single advisory vote at the forthcoming AGM on 26 April 2013.
2012 was a year of significant change for Johnston Press as we sought to implement the key elements of our new strategy. Against a 
difficult trading environment in the period, the Group again generated substantial cash flow and saw a marked improvement in share 
price. Reflecting the Company’s progress in the year, annual bonus payouts of 27.6% to 47.5% of maximum were made to continuing 
Executive Directors. Awards made under the Performance Share Plan in 2009 were subject to a relative total shareholder return 
condition. Performance against the condition was tested during 2012 and these awards lapsed. Overall, the Committee believes  
that this represents a fair link between reward and performance for the period under review.
We are committed to ensuring that rewards for Executives are closely aligned to the interests of shareholders through having all our 
incentive arrangements linked to challenging performance targets, focused on growing earnings and generating market-beating levels 
of shareholder return. Our long-term incentive plans seek to reward our Executives for the Company’s performance against its peers 
and a recovery in its earnings per share. Amongst the targets for bonuses in 2013 are EBITDA and debt reduction as well as measures 
for individual Directors linked to individual performance. These measures relate directly to the Company’s business scorecard and are 
therefore directly linked to the achievement of key strategic objectives.
We continue to monitor our remuneration practice to ensure we have the correct alignment with business strategy, Company 
performance and shareholder interests, and are comfortable that it does so. As a result, we are not proposing any major changes to 
the remuneration policy for the 2013 financial year, particularly to the structure of the annual bonus and LTIP . However, to reflect our 
near term priorities, we have altered the mix of bonus measures that will apply for Executive Directors in 2013 so that there is a greater 
focus on financial measures over individual KPIs than in 2012. Salaries were reviewed in late 2012 and the Committee, for the sixth 
consecutive year, decided not to award increases to the Executive Directors in 2013.
The Committee encourages dialogue with the Company’s shareholders and will consult with major shareholders ahead of any 
significant future changes to the remuneration policy. We were delighted that the 2011 Remuneration Report received a 93%  
vote in favour. Thank you for your continued support.
And finally, after three years as chairman of the Committee, I will be stepping down from that role at the forthcoming AGM.  
Camilla Rhodes will Chair the Committee after that date and I wish her well. 
Yours faithfully
Geoff Iddison

Directors’  
Remuneration Report
(continued)
Introduction
In preparing this report we have taken into account the new BIS proposals and have split this year’s Remuneration Report into two 
parts, a Policy Section and an Implementation Section. As required, the Report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8  
to the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006 (‘the Act’). The report also meets the relevant requirements of the 
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority (the ‘Listing Rules’) and describes how the Board has applied the principles relating  
to Directors’ remuneration in the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’). A resolution to approve the report will be proposed  
at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved. The current legislation requires  
the auditors to report on certain parts of the Directors’ Remuneration Report and to state whether, in their opinion, those parts of the 
report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Accounting Regulations. The report has therefore been divided into 
separate sections for audited and unaudited information. 
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Policy Section
The Committee’s remuneration policy aims to attract, motivate and retain Directors of the highest calibre needed to maintain the 
Group’s strong position in its varied markets, to drive the future success of the business and to reward them for delivering long-term 
value to shareholders.
The Company’s policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the Executive Directors should be performance related. 
Executive Directors may earn annual bonus payments together with the benefits of participation in share schemes and these 
arrangements are described below.
The Committee reviews the performance criteria attached to short and long-term incentives each year and their appropriate mix to 
ensure that they are aligned with the Company’s strategic objectives and future direction.
The Committee has also considered the structure of the Directors’ remuneration packages from a risk perspective. It remains satisfied 
that the packages, which include a base salary, an annual bonus (with a significant element paid in shares, receipt of which is deferred) 
and long-term incentives, do not encourage inappropriate risk taking. Risk is taken into account when setting the targets under variable 
incentive schemes. This is done by ensuring that a mix of metrics is used and targets, while stretching, are realistic, attainable, for the 
long-term benefit of the Company and achievable without taking inappropriate business risks.
The Remuneration Committee also considers the level of pay and employment conditions throughout the Group (and in particular  
of other members of senior management) when setting Executive Directors’ remuneration.
In reviewing the remuneration policy, the Committee has the discretion to take into consideration (amongst other factors) corporate 
performance on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. The Committee is satisfied that ESG risks are not raised by the 
incentive structure through inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
The Remuneration Committee encourages dialogue with the Company’s major shareholders and on a regular basis. Major shareholders 
will be consulted in advance on any significant changes proposed for the remuneration policy. The feedback from consultation will be 
considered by the Committee.
The table following sets out a summary of each element of the Executive Director’s remuneration packages, the policy for how these 
are operated and their link to the Company’s strategy.  Overview

Description of performance 
metrics applying Changes for 2013
Base  
salary
To attract and retain 
high-calibre individuals.
Reflects an individual’s 
experience, role and 
performance.
Salaries are reviewed prior 
to the beginning of each 
calendar year and when  
an individual changes 
position or responsibility. 
Any changes as a result  
of the annual salary review 
normally take effect from  
1 January. 
In deciding appropriate 
levels, the Committee takes 
into account market 
conditions, the market rates 
for similar positions in 
comparably sized 
companies and appropriate 
media companies, the 
responsibilities, individual 
performance and 
experience of each Director.
To pay around the  
mid-market level.
Increases are generally  
limited to the level of salary 
increases awarded to 
employees across  
the Group but higher increases 
may be appropriate where  
an individual is promoted, 
changes role or where an 
individual is appointed on a 
below market salary with the 
expectation that his salary  
will increase with experience 
and performance.
Individual performance  
is taken into account in 
determining salaries.
No change.
There were no 
increases to 
Directors’ salaries 
in 2013, being the 
sixth consecutive 
year that salaries 
have remained 
unchanged for 
continuing 
Directors.
Benefits To aid retention and 
remain competitive  
in the market place. 
Medical benefits provided 
to minimise disruption.
Benefits comprise  
a car (or car allowance), 
telephone, health insurance 
and life assurance (four  
times cover).
Not applicable. Not applicable. No change.
Annual  
bonus
To motivate executives 
and incentivise the 
achievement of key 
financial and strategic 
targets over the year 
without encouraging 
excessive risk taking.
The Committee considers 
and approves the measures 
and targets at the start of 
each year and ensures they 
are aligned with business 
strategy and are sufficiently 
stretching.
In setting the appropriate 
financial parameters,  
the Committee takes into 
account the Company’s 
internal budgets and, where 
applicable, analysts’ 
expectations for the 
forthcoming year. The 
targets applying to financial 
measures are based on  
a sliding scale.
Maximum bonus opportunity 
is 120% of salary for Ashley 
Highfield and 100% of salary 
for Grant Murray. 
Danny Cammiade, is not 
eligible to participate in  
the 2013 bonus scheme.
For the 2013 financial year, 
Ashley Highfield and Grant 
Murray have bonus targets 
relating to EBITDA and debt 
reduction performance,  
and each has a number of 
individual key performance 
targets linked to the 
Group’s strategy, customers 
and people development. In 
the event that the minimum 
threshold target for EBITDA 
or debt reduction is missed, 
the Executive shall not be 
entitled to receive a bonus 
payment in respect of that 
measure, and the bonus  
in respect of KPIs which 
would otherwise have been 
payable will be halved.
The weightings 
applying to each 
measure were 
adjusted for  
2013 to reflect  
a focus on 
financial 
measures  
over individual 
KPIs.
Details of 
individual 
weightings  
are provided  
on page 44. 
Targets relating  
to EBITDA and 
debt reduction 
performance have 
equal weighting  
in each case.

Annual bonus
(continued)
The Company’s  
policy (unless special 
circumstances apply) is that 
50% of any bonus payable to 
Ashley Highfield, and one 
third of bonus payable to 
Grant Murray are deferred in 
shares for three years under  
the provisions of the 
Company’s Deferred Share 
Bonus Plan. Deferred shares 
are released subject to 
continued employment  
and not being under  
notice of termination.
Clawback provisions apply 
to bonuses payable to 
Executive Directors.  
This allows the Company  
to require the repayment  
of amounts of bonus  
in certain specified 
circumstances, including  
a material misstatement  
of the Group’s financial 
position. 
If the minimum threshold 
EBITDA and net debt 
targets are both missed,  
no element of bonus will be 
payable in respect of either 
target or for individual 
non-financial KPIs, 
(irrespective of their 
achievement) unless the 
Committee determines  
that extraordinary 
circumstances apply. 
Long-term 
incentives
Incentivises Executive 
Directors and selected 
senior executives to 
achieve superior financial 
performance and 
long-term shareholder 
returns.
To facilitate share 
ownership and provide 
further alignment with 
shareholders.
The Company operates a 
Performance Share Plan 
(PSP). Under this plan 
annual awards (structured 
as nil cost options) are 
granted. These awards  
vest after three years 
subject to the achievement 
of stretching performance 
conditions measured over a 
period of three years and 
continued employment. The 
Committee reviews the 
appropriateness of metrics 
and targets annually.
The level of grant is 
reviewed annually  
(subject to the PSP 
individual limit) taking  
into account overall 
remuneration, the 
performance of the 
Executive and the 
Company’s share price.
Under the PSP, awards with  
a face value of no more  
than 125% of salary (or 150% 
of salary in exceptional 
circumstances) may  
be made in any year.
As part of the terms agreed 
with the Ashley Highfield upon 
his recruitment, he will receive 
PSP awards of no less than 
62.5% of his base salary in 
2012 and 2013. His recruitment 
terms also provide that Mr 
Highfield may also receive 
matching awards if he invests 
his own monies. In aggregate, 
the maximum face value  
of PSP and matching awards 
cannot exceed 125% of his 
salary in any financial year
1
. 
The Committee intends to 
make an award of 75% of 
salary to Mr Highfield  
(in addition to any matched 
element) in 2013.
Given his forthcoming 
departure from the Company, 
Danny Cammiade will not 
receive a PSP award in 2013.
Other senior executives are 
expected to receive slightly 
larger numbers of awards than 
last year – for the Chief Financial 
Officer, this is an award over 
shares worth c.60% of his base 
salary (assuming a share price  
of 13.0p).
For the 2013 awards,  
the performance metrics 
will be the same as for 2012. 
50% of the awards are 
subject to a Total 
Shareholder Return 
condition measuring the 
Company’s share price 
growth (plus dividends 
reinvested) against the 
constituents of the FTSE 
All-Share Media sector 
(excluding FTSE 100 
companies) over a  
three year period.
The other 50% is subject  
to earnings per share 
growth targets
2
. 
For both measures, if 
performance is between 
threshold and maximum, 
vesting is on a straight  
line basis.
In addition, awards will only 
vest if the Committee is 
satisfied that the Company’s 
underlying performance has 
achieved an appropriate 
level of improvement. 
No change.

Pensions To aid retention and 
remain competitive  
in the market place.
The Company operates  
the Johnston Press Pension 
Plan (JPPP), which has  
a closed defined benefit 
section and a defined 
contribution section. The 
defined benefit section  
has been closed to future 
accrual since 30 June 2010. 
In addition, the Company 
may contribute to a private 
pension or a salary 
supplement. The Company 
has announced in 2013 
proposed plans to close the 
defined contribution section 
of the JPPP and transfer  
its pension provision to 
Zurich under the terms of  
a master trust agreement.
Danny Cammiade accrued 
benefits under the defined 
benefit section of the JPPP. 
Since its closure, the Company 
makes pension contributions  
of 25% of his basic salary and 
matches any contributions  
by him up to a maximum of  
5% of salary by way of a salary 
supplement less the cost of 
employer National Insurance 
contributions on such amounts.
Ashley Highfield is a member of 
the JPPP. The Company makes 
pension contributions of 25% 
of his basic salary and matches 
any contributions by him up to 
a maximum of 5% of salary. 
Grant Murray is not a member 
of the JPPP. The Company  
has agreed with him that it will 
make an annual contribution  
of £50,000 to the JPPP (if he 
chooses to join) or, at his option, 
into a private pension scheme.
Only base salary is pensionable.
Not applicable. No change.

Policy Section (continued)
In determining the remuneration policy for Executive Directors, the Committee takes into account the policy of employees across  
the Group. Specifically, the Committee reviews the remuneration policy and remuneration recommendations for other members  
of the executive management as it is designated to consider. Pay and benefits elsewhere in the Group are determined by senior 
management and approved by the Executive Management Committee. The Committee receives reports in respect of these reviews  
as part of updates in respect of remuneration across the Group.
Basic Salary
With effect from 1 January 2013 the salaries of Ashley Highfield, Grant Murray and Danny Cammiade remained unchanged at 
£400,000, £270,000 and £323,592 per annum respectively. 2013 is the sixth year during which salaries for continuing Executive 
Directors have stayed at the same level.
Annual Bonus
The following table lays out the elements of the maximum potential bonus payable for each Executive Director in 2013 and the 
performance measures that apply:
Elements of bonus as a 
percentage of base salary
Ashley 
Highfield
Grant  
Murray
EBITDA and debt reduction 80% 60%
Key performance indicators 40% 40%
Maximum potential bonus payable in 2013 120% 100%
Performance Share Plan
After consulting with certain of our significant shareholders, the Committee decided to retain the same performance conditions and 
weightings for awards to be made in 2013. Accordingly, half of the awards will be subject to a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) condition 
and the other half subject to an Earnings Per Share (EPS) growth condition. 
The TSR element will be measured against the constituents of the FTSE All-Share Media sector (excluding FTSE 100 companies)  
over a three year period. 25% of this part of the award will vest if the Group achieves median ranking and 100% vests if upper quartile 
is achieved. None of this part of the award vests if the Company performance is below median. For performance between median  
and upper quartile, vesting is on a straight line basis. The awards subject to TSR will only vest if the Committee is satisfied that the 
Company’s underlying performance has achieved an appropriate level of improvement. 
For the EPS element, 25% of this part of the award will vest for EPS growth of 0% per annum over the three-year period ending  
31 December 2015 with all of this part of the award vesting for EPS growth of 6% per annum or greater with vesting on a straight  
line basis between these targets. The Company’s EPS has declined over recent years and the Committee considers a reversal of  
this trend to be very important. Accordingly, achievement of these targets would represent a significant turnaround in the Company’s 
performance. No vesting of this part of the award would occur for EPS growth of less than 0% per annum. 
PSP Matching Awards made to Ashley Highfield 
Under the terms of his contract, if Ashley Highfield invests in Company Shares out of his own monies prior to the payment of any bonus 
in 2013 and/or out of a cash bonus during 2013 and/or out of a cash bonus during 2014, then he will receive an award (or awards) of 
Matching Shares under the PSP (‘PSP Matching Shares’) on a 2-for-1 basis by reference to the level of investment (grossed up for tax  
in the case of investment of cash bonus). The value of these PSP Matching Shares cannot exceed 60% of salary in these circumstances 
and also cannot exceed £200,000 in respect of an investment of own monies. 
The aggregate market value of shares (as at the time of grant) over which all awards are granted to him under the PSP (including any 
Award of PSP Matching Shares) in any financial year of the Company will not exceed 125% of his base salary at that time. 
All awards made to Ashley Highfield under the PSP scheme rules, and as described in this report, shall be subject to such conditions 
(including performance conditions) as the Committee, acting reasonably, may specify on or prior to the award being granted and to  
a normal vesting period of at least three years. For any matching awards that may be granted in 2013, half of these will be subject  
to a TSR condition against the constituents of the FTSE All-Share Media sector (excluding any FTSE 100 companies) measured over 
three years from the date of award and the other half subject to a EPS growth measure – the targets and vesting range will be the 
same as those that apply to the annual cycle of 2013 PSP awards. 
Awards over PSP Matching Shares will also normally only vest to the extent that he has retained the related ‘matched’ investment 
shares until the time of vesting. As we explained last year, the Committee and the Board considered that the long-term incentive 
arrangements contained in Ashley Highfield’s contract were necessary at the time to secure his recruitment in November 2011 and  
to incentivise appropriate strategic development necessary to return the business to growth.

All-Employee Share Schemes
The Company operates the following all-employee schemes:
A Company Share Option Plan (CSOP) was introduced in 2012 and has been approved by HM Revenue and Customs. It permits the 
Company to grant options to certain employees which may be subject to performance conditions to be determined by the Committee. 
Executive Directors are not eligible to receive awards under the CSOP . The CSOP is not open to employees in the Isle of Man. The first 
awards to employees under the CSOP were made in 2012 and are not subject to performance conditions.
A SAYE Sharesave Plan, the Johnston Press 2007 Sharesave Plan, for eligible employees under which options may be granted at a 
discount of up to 20% of market value, subject to the employee entering into a monthly savings contract with maximum aggregate 
savings equal to £250 per month. The last offer was made in 2010. The Committee will consider whether to make an award in 2013 
during the course of the year.
A Share Incentive Plan (SIP) for all eligible employees. The SIP has been approved by HM Revenue and Customs and is in two parts. 
The first is a Partnership Scheme, which allows employees to purchase shares in the Company, worth up to £1,500 in any tax year,  
on a monthly basis in a tax efficient manner. The second element is a Free Shares Scheme, which can provide employees who have 
joined the scheme with free shares up to a maximum value. Employees who leave the Group as a bad leaver within three years of the 
shares being awarded forfeit the Free Shares. For Free Share awards, the Committee set a Group profit target and a base fund to be 
utilised to purchase shares in the Company. If the target was met, Free Shares were allocated to employees based on hours worked 
and not pro rata to salary. 
During 2012, the Committee considered the operation of the SIP and concluded that the Free Shares Scheme was not operating 
effectively as an incentive. As a consequence, the Company did not operate the scheme in 2012 and has no current plans to make 
awards under the Free Shares Scheme in 2013 or future years. It intends to continue to operate the Partnership Scheme.
The Company operates similar schemes in the Republic of Ireland.
Share Ownership Guidelines
Executive Directors are expected to retain 50% of shares which vest under executive share plans, after allowing for sufficient sales  
of shares to meet tax liabilities, until a holding to the value of 100% of salary has been achieved.
Service Contracts
The contract dates and notice periods for each Executive Director are as follows:
Date of Contract
Notice period 
by Company
Notice period 
by Director
Ashley Highfield 27 July 2011 1 year 1 year
Danny Cammiade 27 February 2006

1 year 1 year
Grant Murray 3 May 2011 1 year 1 year

 As amended by a compromise agreement dated 13 December 2012 (see below).
The Executive Directors have one year rolling contracts terminable by either party on 12 months’ notice. In the event of termination by 
the Company, the Executive Directors would be entitled to salary and benefits for the notice period and the Committee seeks to apply 
the principles of mitigation following termination.
In the event of termination, payment of any element of bonus to Executive Directors will depend upon the relevant circumstances,  
the terms of their contract and whether the leaver is treated as a good or bad leaver. 
The Executive Directors’ contracts of employment may also be terminated, at the option of the Company, by giving six months’ notice 
if the Executive is incapacitated by reason of ill-health or accident from performing his duties for certain specified periods. 
The Company may also terminate the Executive’s employment forthwith in certain circumstances including any serious breach of his 
obligations under the relevant contract of employment. The Executive Directors’ service contracts do not provide any entitlement to 
payment in lieu of notice or the provision of liquidated damages.
As disclosed in last year’s remuneration report, the Company entered into a compromise agreement with Danny Cammiade on  
19 August 2011 which had the effect of amending his contract of employment. This agreement provided that he could, upon the 
service of notice to the Company, terminate his contract of employment with the Company on 31 December 2012. The agreement  
also provided that, subject to the achievement of certain objectives linked to Group cost savings in 2012, he could receive an 
additional bonus (on top of his annual maximum) of 75% of salary, i.e. a total of 225% of salary. That agreement was superseded by  
a subsequent compromise agreement between the parties executed on 13 December 2012. Under the terms of the new agreement, 
his contract of employment with the Company will terminate on 31 March 2013, and, consistent with his August 2011 agreement,  
he will be entitled to receive payment of one year’s basic salary, pension, car allowance and medical insurance (totalling £420,000)  
to be paid in 12 equal monthly instalments commencing in April 2013 (such sum to be mitigated by any payments received by him for 
any alternative full time employment or work which he secures during that period). The agreement also provides that he is entitled to 
receive a cash bonus equivalent to 125% of salary payable on 8 April 2013, but is not entitled to receive any bonus under the Group’s 
ordinary bonus scheme for Executive Directors in respect of 2012 or 2013. This amount recognises Mr Cammiade’s contribution to the 
Group throughout 2012 and during the first three months of 2013 and his management of specific projects during that time. 46 | Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Service Contracts (continued)
The Committee is satisfied that this arrangement was necessary to continue to drive the Group’s cost performance, improve efficiencies 
and manage the implementation of a new management structure during the transitional period in 2012 and early in 2013, and merited  
in recognising Mr Cammiade’s key role in delivering these objectives. Mr Cammiade is entitled to be treated as a good leaver for the 
purposes of the Company’s share schemes (for the avoidance of doubt, his entitlement to any awards shall be subject to the rules 
applied to good leavers in these circumstances and are therefore subject to performance and time pro-rating where applicable). 
Executive Directors are entitled to accept up to two Non-executive director appointments outwith the Company provided that the 
Chairman’s permission is obtained. The Remuneration Committee decides whether any fees for such positions are retained by the 
Director. In addition, the Executive Directors are entitled to accept any positions connected with the newspaper industry or any 
business in which the Company holds an investment. 
Executive Directors’ service contracts will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
Non-Executive Directors
The appointments of Non-Executive Directors of the Company are terminable at will, subject to a three month notice period. It is the 
Committee’s policy that any future Board appointments will be made on the same terms. The Non-Executive Directors have letters  
of appointment dated as follows:
Ian Russell 28 January 2012 Camilla Rhodes 13 July 2012
Ralph Marshall 25 June 2011 Geoff Iddison 1 December 2012
Mark Pain 1 May 2012 Kjell Aamot 2 July 2010
A copy of the standard letter of appointment for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors is displayed on the Company’s website  
in the Investor Centre section.
The letters of appointment provide specific terms of engagement for Non-Executive Directors and their remuneration is determined  
by the Board within the limits set by the Articles of Association and based on external advice including independent surveys of fees 
paid to Non-Executive Directors of similar companies. The basic annual fee paid to each Non-Executive Director is £40,000. The 
Non-Executive Directors receive further fees for additional work performed for the Company in respect of chairing the Remuneration 
Committee and Audit Committee, together with responsibilities as Chairman and Senior Independent Director. The Chairmen of the 
Audit Committee, Remuneration Committee and the Senior Independent Director each receive an additional £7,500 per annum. The 
Chairman’s fee is £130,000 per annum. Each of these fees has been unchanged since 2008. During 2009 the Board agreed that 50% 
of Non-Executive Directors’ fees would be paid in the form of shares and this policy has been retained since that time. It will be 
reviewed in 2013. Non-Executive Directors’ fees are paid on a quarterly basis. Non-Executive Directors cannot participate in the 
Company’s bonus plans, Share Schemes or pension plan.

UNAUDITED INFORMATION 
Determination of the 2012 Bonus
The targets and weightings applying to the 2012 bonus plan are set out in the table below.
Elements of bonus as a percentage of base salary
Ashley Highfield Grant Murray
Operating profit and cash flow 70% 75%
Key performance indicators 50% 25%
Maximum potential bonus payable in 2012 120% 100%
Operating profit (before non-recurring and IAS 21/39 items) for 2012 was between lower threshold and budget. Cash flow was  
above upper threshold. In making its proposal in respect of payments of bonuses, and mindful of the trading conditions faced by  
the Company in 2012, the Executive Directors recommended that the bonuses which would have been payable to them be reduced. 
While recognising the achievements of the Executive Directors in meeting their bonus objectives during the year, the Committee 
agreed with this proposal and exercised its discretion under the Company’s bonus scheme rules to reduce the level of bonuses 
payable. In keeping with this decision, a profit and cash flow based bonus equal to 28% of salary was payable to Ashley Highfield  
and 19.3% of salary was payable to Grant Murray.
The individual key performance targets varied by Executive Director. These included strategic development, newspaper circulation 
revenue, refinancing, audience growth, implementation of organisational change, stakeholder satisfaction, together with other  
strategic (including digital) and financial targets. Since the 2012 profit and cash flow threshold was achieved, bonus was payable  
for the achievement of individual key performance targets (although in line with the Executive Director’s recommendation the 
Committee also determined to reduce the level of payment in respect of these). As a result bonuses equivalent to 19.5% and 8.3%  
of salary were payable to Ashley Highfield and Grant Murray respectively in relation to their individual key performance targets. 
As disclosed above on page 45, Danny Cammiade will receive a bonus of 125% of salary as set out in his compromise agreement

1  2010 awards: Based on relative TSR against the constituents of the FTSE All-Share Media sector, excluding any FTSE 100 participants (the ‘Comparator Group’). Below 
median, none of the award vests, 25% of the award vests for median ranking and 100% for upper quartile ranking. Vesting is on a straight line basis for performance between 
median and upper quartile. In addition, awards will only vest if the Committee is satisfied that the Company’s underlying performance has achieved an appropriate level of 
improvement. As at the date of this report, it is anticipated that the 2010 award will not vest.
2  2011 awards: Two performance conditions apply. 50% is based on relative TSR against the Comparator Group. The same vesting schedule as for the 2010 awards applies.  
In addition, the awards subject to TSR will only vest if the Committee is satisfied that the Company’s underlying performance has achieved an appropriate level of improvement. 
The other 50% is based on growth in earnings per share (EPS). 25% of the EPS element of the award will vest for EPS growth of RPI + 4% per annum over the three-year period 
ending 31 December 2013 and all of this part of the award would vest for EPS growth of RPI + 12% per annum or greater with vesting on a straight line basis between these 
ranges. No vesting of this part of the award would occur for EPS growth of less than RPI + 4% per annum. 
3  Ashley Highfield received a one-off recruitment award under the PSP . Two performance conditions apply. 50% is based on relative TSR against the Comparator Group.  
The performance period is 3 years from the date of the award and the same vesting schedule as for the 2011 awards applies. The other 50% is based on growth in earnings 
per share (EPS) over a three year period using the 2011 financial year as the base year. In addition, the awards subject to TSR will only vest if the Committee is satisfied that 
the Company’s underlying performance has achieved an appropriate level of improvement. 25% of the EPS element of the award will vest for EPS growth of 0% over the 
three-year period ending 31 December 2014 and all of this part of the award would vest for EPS growth of 8% per annum or greater with vesting on a straight line basis 
between these ranges. No vesting of this part of the award would occur for EPS reduces over the performance period. 
4  2012 awards: Two performance conditions apply. 50% is based on relative TSR against the Comparator Group (with the same vesting schedule as for the 2010 and 2011 
awards) with the other 50% relating to performance against EPS growth targets. The awards subject to TSR will only vest if the Committee is satisfied that the Company’s 
underlying performance has achieved an appropriate level of improvement. 40% of the EPS element of the award will vest for EPS of 0% and all of this part of the award 
would vest for EPS of 8% with vesting on a straight line basis between these targets. No vesting of this part of the award would occur if EPS reduces over this period. The 
face value of these awards at grant are £381,806.50 for Ashley Highfield, £60,502.05 for Grant Murray and £72,511.04 for Danny Cammiade. The performance period for the 
TSR element is three years from the date of grant and the EPS element is the three financial years starting with the 2012 financial year. The award to Ashley Highfield included 
926,270 PSP awards under the PSP Matching Awards provisions described above.
5  These are subsequent matching awards that were granted following Ashley Highfield’s purchase of shares on 12 October 2012. The same performance conditions apply as 
those attached to Mr Highfield’s recruitment award (footnote 3). However, for the TSR element, the three-year performance period begins on the date of grant.
6  The 2009 award was subject to a relative TSR condition against the Comparator Group. Johnston Press was ranked below median of the group and the award lapsed.
The PSP awards listed above are only exercisable subject to the level of achievement of the performance criteria denoted above.
The awards within the PSP are exercisable at nil cost at the end of the three year vesting period.

UNAUDITED INFORMATION 
Directors’ Interest in Shares
To further align the interests of senior management with those of shareholders, Executive Directors and certain other senior managers are 
subject to share ownership guidelines. Executive Directors are expected to retain 50% of shares which vest under executive share plans 
after allowing for sufficient sales of shares to meet tax liabilities, until a holding to the value of 100% of salary has been achieved. The 
interests of the Directors as at 29 December 2012 are set out below.

Dilution
At the end of 2012 the total number of options and share awards granted, less lapsed, over new issuable shares under the share 
schemes over the previous 10 years was 1.67% of the issued share capital within a maximum limit of 10.0%.
The Company is proposing an ordinary resolution at its forthcoming Annual General Meeting to authorise it to hold up to 7.5% of its 
issued share capital in its Employee Benefit Trust. This proposal is intended to provide the Company with greater flexibility to satisfy 
share awards.
The Remuneration Committee
The Committee was chaired by Geoff Iddison throughout 2012. Mark Pain and Camilla Rhodes were members of the Committee 
throughout the year and up to the date of this report. All are independent Non-Executive Directors. Mr Iddison will step down as a 
Chairman of the Committee at the Company’s forthcoming Annual General Meeting on 26 April 2013 and Camilla Rhodes will succeed 
him as Committee chair with effect from that date. During 2012, the Committee met on eight occasions. At those meetings basic salaries 
of Executive Directors were reviewed, the targets and quantum of annual performance related bonuses for directors were agreed, as were 
awards to be granted under the Group’s PSP and the performance measures applying. The operation of all employee share schemes was 
also reviewed and the meetings also approved the level of vesting of the 2009 PSP awards.
The Committee has the delegated responsibility for reviewing the Board policy on remuneration for the executive management team 
(which includes the three Executive Directors) and setting all aspects of remuneration, including the total remuneration package for all 
Executive Directors and the Chairman of the Board. 
The Committee’s terms of reference were reviewed in 2012 and require it to meet at least twice each year and at such times as is 
necessary. The terms of reference, which are available on the Company’s website and on request, set out the responsibilities of the 
Committee. 
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is a matter for the Chairman of the Board and the Executive Directors.
No member of the Committee has any personal financial interest (other than as a shareholder), conflicts of interest arising from cross 
directorships or day to day involvement in running the business. Other Directors attend meetings when invited by the Committee and 
the Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee. The Company’s Director of Human Resources also attends meetings by 
invitation. No Director plays a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration. 50 | Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
The Remuneration Committee (continued)
During the year, the Committee received executive remuneration advice from its external independent adviser, New Bridge Street 
(NBS), which is part of Aon plc. Neither NBS nor any other part of Aon plc provided other services to the Company during 2012.  
NBS attended one of the meetings of the Committee during the year and provided advice as required by the Committee. The terms  
of engagement between the Company and NBS are displayed on the Company’s website. NBS are signatories to the Remuneration 
Consultants Group’s Code of Conduct.
There is an on-going training programme for the Committee which consists of an annual update on any changes in regulations and 
also best practice. In addition, each member of the Committee attends various seminars throughout the year.
As explained on page 33, the Board undertook an evaluation of its performance during the year. This included a review of the 
effectiveness of this Committee considering its composition, chairmanship, whether it fulfilled its role as outlined in the terms of 
reference, its reporting and overall performance. This evaluation process was undertaken by the members of the Committee itself as 
well as by all members of the Board. The results of this process confirmed the continued effectiveness of the Committee. Members  
of the Committee reviewed comments received as part of this process with a view to improving the Committee’s operation.
Performance Graph
The following graph shows the Company’s performance, measured by total shareholder return, compared with the performance of the 
FTSE 350 Index and FTSE All Share Media Sector. The FTSE 350 Index and FTSE All Share Media Sector have been selected for this

Directors’ Report
The Directors present their Annual Report on the affairs of the Group, together with the financial statements and auditors’ report for 
the period ended 29 December 2012. The Corporate Governance report set out on pages 32 to 38 forms part of this report.
Principal Activities
The Group’s main activities are the publishing of local and regional weekly, evening and morning newspapers; both paid-for and free  
in both in print and digital format, together with specialist publications in print, online or via mobile technologies, and related services 
in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland.
Review of Business
The results for the year 2012 are set out in the Group Income Statement on page 59. The Group loss for the period before taxation  
was £6,765,000 (2011: loss of £143,803,000) which results in a net profit after tax for the period of £5,611,000 (2011: loss of 
£88,937,000). Details of the business activities during the year, the financial results, the financial position and the principal risks  
and uncertainties facing the Group are set out in the Business Review on pages 12 to 29.
The subsidiary undertakings principally affecting the profit and net assets of the Group are disclosed in Note 35 to the  
financial statements.
Dividends
No interim dividend was paid and the Directors recommend no final dividend for the period. The preference dividend was paid  
on 29 June and 29 December 2012.
Share Capital
Details of share capital are shown in Note 27.
Environmental Policy
The Board acknowledges that environmental protection is one of the Group’s business responsibilities. It aims for a continuous 
improvement in the Group’s environmental performance and to comply with all relevant regulations. A documented environmental 
policy to monitor performance and to take action where appropriate is in force.
Donations
Charitable donations amounted to £2,000, principally to local charities serving the communities in which the Group operates  
(2011: £27,000). There were no payments for political purposes.
Supplier Payment Policy
The Group’s policy is to settle terms of payment with suppliers when agreeing the terms of each transaction, ensuring that suppliers 
are made aware of the terms of payment, and to abide by the terms of payment. Trade creditors of the Group at the end of the period 
were equivalent to 33 days purchases (2011: 30 days), based on the average daily amount invoiced by suppliers during the period.
Financing Policy and Derivatives
The Group’s policies are set out in Notes 21 to 23 and Note 32. These also include details of financial instruments and derivatives.
Auditor
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval of this report confirms that:
(1) so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
(2)  the Director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself/herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s Auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of s.418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Forward-looking Statements
Where the Directors’ Report (including the Performance Highlights, Business Review, Operational Review, Performance Review and 
Corporate Governance Report) contains forward-looking statements these are made by the Directors in good faith based on the 
information available to them at the time of their approval of this report. These statements will not be updated or reported upon further. 
Consequently such statements should be treated with caution due to the inherent uncertainties including both economic and business 
risk factors underlying such forward looking statements or information.
Directors and Their Interests
Under the Company’s Articles of Association, each Director is subject to retirement every three years and to election at the first Annual 
General Meeting after their appointment. In addition, in 2013, all Directors who wish to continue in office will offer himself/herself for 
re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Structure of Shares
Details of the issued share capital, together with details of the movements in the Company’s issued share capital during the period  
are shown in Note 27. The Company’s issued ordinary share capital was 639,746,083 shares at 29 December 2012. As part of the 
refinancing completed on 28 August 2009, the Company issued warrants over 5.0% of its issued share capital to the Group’s lenders, 
exercisable at any time over the 5 year period ending 27 August 2014 (the ‘First Issue Warrants’). As part of the refinancing completed 
on 24 April 2012 (i) the exercise period for the First Issue Warrants was extended to 30 September 2017 (the ‘Warrant Expiry Date’),  
(ii) the Company issued further warrants over just under 2.5% of its issued share capital to the Group’s lenders (the ‘Second Issue 
Warrants’) and (iii) the Company undertook that on or before 30 September 2012, and subject to receiving all necessary shareholder 
approvals, authorisations and powers, it would issue further warrants over just under an additional 5.0% of its issued share capital  
as at 23 April 2012 to the Group’s lenders (the ‘Third Issue Warrants’). The Third Issue Warrants were subsequently issued on  
25 September 2012. Each of the First Issue Warrants, Second Issue Warrants and Third Issue Warrants (together the ‘Warrants’)  
are exercisable at 10p each at any time prior to the Warrant Expiry Date. No Warrants were exercised during the 52 week period  
ended 29 December 2012.
The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income. Each share carries the right to one vote at  
general meetings of the Company. The redeemable cumulative preference shares carry 13.75% interest but do not carry voting rights. 
The percentage of the issued nominal value of the ordinary shares is 98.3% of the total issued nominal value of all share capital.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding or on the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general 
provisions of the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation. The Directors are not aware of any agreements between holders  
of the Company’s shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.
Details of employee share schemes are set out in Note 30.
No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. With regard to the 
appointment and replacement of Directors, the Company is governed by its Articles of Association, the United Kingdom Corporate 
Governance Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council, the Companies Acts and related legislation. The Articles themselves  
may be amended by special resolution of the shareholders. The powers of Directors are described in a schedule of matters reserved 
for approval of the Board, and the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 32 to 38. 54 | Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Directors’ Report
(continued)
Substantial Shareholdings

shareholders, other than Directors, as at the date of this report are as follows:
% Holding
Ordinary Shares
of 10p each
Number
PanOcean Management Ltd (on behalf of Usaha Tegas) 20.0 127,947,952

Tindle Newspapers Ltd 8.0 51,179,698
Cazenove Capital Management Ltd 5.6 35,934,743
Employee Involvement
It is the policy of the Group to encourage and develop all members of staff to realise their maximum potential. Wherever possible, 
vacancies are filled from within the Group and adequate opportunities for internal promotion are created. The Board is committed to  
a systematic training policy and the Company has a comprehensive training and development programme creating the opportunity  
for employees to maintain and improve their performance and to develop their potential to a maximum level of attainment. In this way, 
staff will make their best possible contribution to the organisation’s success. The Group supports the principle of equal opportunities 
in employment and opposes all forms of unlawful or unfair discrimination on the grounds of race, age, nationality, religion, ethnic or 
national origin, sexual orientation, gender or gender reassignment, marital status or disability. It is also the policy of the Group, where 
possible, to give sympathetic consideration to disabled persons in their application for employment with the Group and to protect the 
interests of existing members of the staff who are disabled.
Close Company Status
So far as the Directors are aware the Company is not a close company for taxation purposes.
Change of Control
In the event of a change of control the Group’s lenders (private placement loan note holders and various banks) have the option  
to declare all amounts outstanding repayable on demand.
Directors’ Liability 
As permitted by the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’), the Company has insurance cover for the Directors against liabilities in relation  
to the Group.
Electronic Voting 
The Company has made provision for shareholders to vote electronically on the Resolutions to be considered at the Annual General 
Meeting and full instructions are included on the Form of Proxy, issued to shareholders with this Annual Report.
Special Business
Five resolutions (resolutions 13 to 17) are set out under special business in the notice of this year’s Annual General Meeting. The first 
two of these resolutions will be proposed as ordinary resolutions and the others as special resolutions.
The first resolution, Resolution 13, concerns a proposal to amend the Johnston Press Employee Share Trust (the “Trust”) to increase 
the maximum number of shares which may be held by the Trust at any time from 5.0% to 7.5% (excluding shares under the 
Company’s Share Incentive Plan or unconditionally allocated to and held on behalf of the beneficiaries of the Trust). This is proposed 
in order to increase the Board’s ability to use certain share schemes to provide suitable incentives to the Company’s management.
The purpose of the next resolution is to renew the Directors’ authority to allot shares in the Company. Part (i) of Resolution 14  
seeks authority to allot shares, and to grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into shares in the Company up to a 
maximum nominal amount representing 33.33% of the existing issued ordinary share capital of the Company. The second part of 
Resolution 14 seeks additional authority to allot equity securities equivalent to a further 33.33% of the existing ordinary share capital 
of the Company. In accordance with recommended best practice, this additional authority will be applied to fully pre-emptive rights 
issues only and the authorisation will be valid for one year only. The Directors have no current intention to allot shares or grant rights  
to subscribe for or convert any security into shares except in connection with employee share schemes or on conversion of existing 
warrants, and the authority, if approved, will expire at the end of the Annual General Meeting in 2014.
The third resolution, Resolution 15 (which is the first of the three special resolutions), relates to the power given to the Directors  
to allot equity securities for cash without the statutory pre-emption provisions of the Act applying. In accordance with best practice 
guidelines, this authority is limited to allotments representing in total up to 5% of the existing issued ordinary share capital and to 
allotments in connection with a rights issue. This power, which accords with normal practice, currently expires on the date of this 
year’s Annual General Meeting. The purpose of the resolution is to renew this power for a further year.  Overview

The fourth item of special business is the renewal of the authority of the Company to purchase its own ordinary shares as permitted 
under its Articles of Association and the Act. Resolution 16 will, if passed, give authority to make such purchases in the market.  
The Directors have no immediate intention of using such authority and would do so only if they consider it to be in the best interests  
of shareholders generally and that an improvement in earnings per share would result. This Resolution specifies the maximum number 
of ordinary shares which may be purchased (representing approximately 10% of the Company’s existing issued ordinary share capital) 
and the minimum and maximum prices at which they may be bought, reflecting the requirements of the Act and the Financial  
Services Authority.
The final resolution to be proposed is to permit the Company to call General Meetings (other than Annual General Meetings) on not 
less than 14 days notice as permitted by the Act. Although no such meetings are currently planned, the Directors believe that having 
authority to do so may, in some circumstances, assist with the efficient discharge of the Company’s business. The Company intends 
to continue to provide as much notice as practicable of General Meetings and would normally use this authority only where it would  
be to the advantage of shareholders as a whole.
Auditor
Ordinary resolutions to re-appoint Deloitte LLP as the Company’s auditor and to authorise the Directors to fix their remuneration  
will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

 Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 | 57
We have audited the financial statements of Johnston Press plc for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2012 which comprise  
the Group Income Statement, the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Group Statement of Changes in Equity, the Group 
Statement of Financial Position and the Parent Company Balance Sheet, the Group Cash Flow Statement, and the related Notes 1 to 
42. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has 
been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibility Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual 
report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
•	 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 29 
December 2012 and of the group’s profit for the 52 week period then ended;
•	 the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
•	 the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice; and
•	 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
•	 the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
•	 the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

received from branches not visited by us; or
•	 the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
•	 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and

1. General Information
Johnston Press plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act. The registered office is at 108 
Holyrood Road, Edinburgh, EH8 8AS. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in Notes 5 and 6  
and in the Business Review on pages 12 to 29.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment  
in which the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in Note 3.
2. Adoption of New and Revised Standards
The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted for the period ended 29 December 2012. Their adoption 
has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements but may impact the accounting for future 
transactions and arrangements.
•	 Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures – The amendments increase the disclosure requirements for 
transactions involving the transfer of financial assets in order to provide greater transparency around risk exposures when 
financial assets are transferred. There has been no impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied  
in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
•	 IFRS 1 (amended) Government Loans
•	 IFRS 7 (amended) Disclosures – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
•	 IAS 19 (revised) Employee Benefits 
•	 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
•	 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements
•	 IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 (amended) Investment entities
•	 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
•	 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
•	 IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
•	 IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements
•	 IAS 27 (revised) Separate Financial Statements
•	 IAS 28 (revised) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
•	 IAS 32 (amended) Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements  
of the Group in future periods, except as follows:
•	 IFRS 7 (amended) will increase the disclosure requirements where netting arrangements are in place for financial assets and 
financial liabilities;
•	 IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of Financial Instruments;
•	 IFRS 12 will impact the disclosure of interests the Group has in other entities; 
•	 IFRS 13 will impact the measurement of fair value for certain assets and liabilities as well as the associated disclosures; and
•	 IAS 19 (revised) will impact the measurement of the various components representing movements in the defined benefit pension 
obligation and associated disclosures, but not the Group’s total obligation. It is likely that following the replacement of expected 
returns on plan assets with a net finance cost in the Income Statement, the profit for the period will be reduced and accordingly 
other comprehensive income increased.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed 
review has been completed.
Notes to the Consolidated  
Financial Statements 
For the 52 week period  
ended 29 December 2012 64 | Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
3. Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) adopted by the 
European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain properties and financial 
instruments. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets. The principal 
accounting policies adopted are set out below. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its 
subsidiaries) made up to the Saturday closest to 31 December each year for either a 52 or 53 week period. Control is achieved where the 
Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Group Income Statement from the effective date of 
acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of 
subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group. All intra-group transactions, balances, income 
and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Basis of preparation 
The Group’s business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future development, performance and financial position and 
commentary on the Group’s financial results, its cash flows, liquidity requirements and borrowing facilities are set out in the Business 
Review on pages 12 to 29. In addition, Note 32 to the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for 
managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities, and its exposures 
to liquidity risk and credit risk. 
The financial statements have been prepared for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2012. The 2011 information relates to the  
52 week period ended 31 December 2011.
Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Business Review on pages 12 to 29.
Non-recurring items
Items which are deemed to be non-recurring by virtue of their nature or size are included under the statutory classification appropriate 
to their nature but are separately disclosed on the face of the consolidated income statement to assist in understanding the financial 
performance of the Group.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate 
of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group 
in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the Income Statement as incurred. The acquiree’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3, including publishing titles, 
are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held 
for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’, which are recognised and 
measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Investment in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through 
participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee. Significant influence is the power to participate in the 
financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these Group financial statements using the equity method of 
accounting. Investments in associates are carried in the Group Statement of Financial Position at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition 
changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.

 Additional Information
 Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 | 65
Publishing titles
The Group’s principal intangible assets are publishing titles. The Group does not capitalise internally generated publishing titles.  
Titles separately acquired after 1 January 1989 are stated at cost and titles owned by subsidiaries acquired after 1 January 1996 are 
recorded at Directors’ valuation at the date of acquisition. These publishing titles have no finite life and consequently are not amortised. 
The carrying value of the titles is reviewed for impairment at least annually with testing undertaken to determine any diminution in the 
recoverable amount below carrying value. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in  
use is based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows. Any impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.  
An impairment loss recognised for publishing titles can be reversed in a subsequent period if the discounted cash flows justify  
the treatment.
For the purpose of impairment testing, publishing titles are allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units. Cash generating  
units are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable 
amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the 
carrying amount of the value of publishing titles and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount  
of each asset in the unit. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and 
services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes. 
Print advertising revenue is recognised on publication and circulation revenue is recognised at the point of sale. Digital revenues are 
recognised on publication for advertising or delivery of service for other digital revenues. Printing revenue is recognised when the 
service is provided. 
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position 
of each Group company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentation 
currency for the consolidated financial statements. 
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency 
(foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each period end, monetary 
assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the close of business on the 
last working day of the period. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at 
the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost 
in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit or 
loss for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit 
or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at historical cost in respect of 
which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. 
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are 
translated at exchange rates prevailing on the period end date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange 
rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s hedging and translation 
reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of. 
Fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate.  66 | Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
3. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment balances are shown at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. In certain cases,  
the amounts of previous revaluations of properties conducted in 1996 or 1997 or the fair value of the property at the date of the 
acquisition by the Group have been treated as the deemed cost on transition to IFRSs. Depreciation is provided on all property, plant 
and equipment, excluding land, at varying rates calculated to write-off cost over the useful lives. The principal rates employed are:
Heritable and freehold property (excluding land) 2.5% on written down value 
Leasehold land and buildings   Equal annual instalments over lease term 
Web offset presses (excluding press components) 5% straight-line basis 
Mailroom equipment    6.67% straight-line basis 
Pre-press systems     20% straight-line basis 
Other plant and machinery    6.67%, 10%, 20%, 25% and 33% straight-line basis 
Motor vehicles     25% straight-line basis
Assets held for sale
Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through 
continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate  
sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale. Where the sale is expected to qualify for recognition as  
a completed sale within one year from the date of classification, the assets are shown as current and when the sale is anticipated  
to complete after one year from date of classification the assets are shown as non-current.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost incurred in bringing materials to their present location and 
condition comprises; (a) raw materials and goods for resale at purchase cost on a first-in first-out basis; and (b) work in progress at 
cost of direct materials, labour and certain overheads. Net realisable value comprises selling price less any further costs expected to 
be incurred to completion and disposal. 
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s Statement of Financial Position when the Group becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets
Investments are recognised and derecognised on the trade date in accordance with the terms of the purchase or sale contract and are 
initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs.
Available for sale financial assets
Listed and unlisted investments are shown as available for sale and are stated at fair value. Fair value of listed investments is determined 
with reference to quoted market prices. Fair value of unlisted investments is determined by the Directors. Gains and losses arising from 
changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, with the exception of impairment losses which are recognised directly in the 
Income Statement. Where the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in equity is included in the Income Statement for the period.
Dividends on available for sale equity investments are recognised in the Income Statement when the Group’s right to receive the 
payment is established.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest. They are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowance for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, 
is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows. Other trade receivables are provided for on an individual basis where 
there is evidence that an amount is no longer recoverable.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each period end date. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective 
evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash 
flows of the investment have been impacted. The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all 
financial assets with the exception of trade receivables where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts. Changes in the carrying value of this allowance are recognised in the Income Statement.

Derivative financial instruments
The Group’s activities and funding structure give rise to some exposure to the financial risks of changes in interest rates and foreign 
currency exchange rates. The Group enters into a number of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to these risks, 
including interest rate swaps and caps, cross currency swaps, foreign exchange options and forward foreign exchange contracts. 
Further details of derivative financial instruments are given in Note 32.
The Group re-measures each derivative at its fair value at the period end date with the resultant gain or loss being recognised in profit 
or loss immediately. All such changes in the fair value of the Group’s derivatives are shown in a separate column on the face of the 
Group Income Statement.
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as 
a financial liability. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument 
is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current 
assets or current liabilities.
Embedded derivatives
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not measured at fair value with the 
changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.
Financial liabilities and equity
Debt and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the 
substance of the contractual arrangement.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
The Company has issued share warrants over 12.5% of its issued share capital to lenders (with 5.0% issued 28 August 2009,  
2.5% issued 24 April 2012 and 5.0% issued 21 September 2012). All of the share warrants expire 30 September 2017. The warrant 
instruments will be settled by the Company delivering a fixed number of ordinary shares and receiving a fixed amount of cash in return 
and so qualify as equity under IAS 39. The Binomial Option pricing model was used to assess the fair value of the share warrants 
issued in the financial year that they were issued.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and bank overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including 
premia payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are charged to the Income Statement using the effective interest 
method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. 
Fees incurred in negotiating borrowings are held on the Statement of Financial Position and amortised to the Income Statement over 
the term of the underlying debt.
Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. In the event 
that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. The aggregate benefit of 
incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Where the Group is a lessor, rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant 
lease.
Where the Group leases a property but is no longer using the premises, full provision is made for the rentals payable over the 
remaining term of the lease (up to any break clauses where relevant).
Operating profit/(loss)
Operating profit/(loss) is stated after charging restructuring or other non-recurring costs but before investment income, other finance 
income, finance costs and the share of the results of associates.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will  
be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
obligation at the reporting date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. 68 | Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
3. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the Income 
Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items 
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the period end date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the financial statements and the corresponding tax based values used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using 
the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the 
initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable 
profit nor the accounting profit. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity,  
in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
On transition to IFRS, a deferred tax liability was recorded in respect of publishing titles and properties that do not qualify for any tax 
allowances that were acquired through business combinations. Given that the Group elected, under IFRS 1, not to restate pre-transition 
business combinations under IFRS 3, this pre-transition deferred tax element was charged against retained earnings. Any such fair value 
on future business combinations will form part of the goodwill on acquisition and both the goodwill and related deferred tax liability will be 
included in any impairment test in relation to the relevant cash generating unit. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the relevant requirements of IAS 12 are satisfied. 
Retirement benefit costs
The Group provides pensions to employees through various schemes.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged to the Income Statement as an expense as they fall due. 
Payments made to the industry-wide retirement benefit schemes in the Republic of Ireland are dealt with as payments to defined 
contribution schemes where the Group’s obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution 
retirement benefit scheme. 
For defined benefit retirement benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, 
with actuarial valuations being carried out at each period end date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in 
which they occur. They are recognised outside the Income Statement and presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Past 
service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested and otherwise is amortised on a straight line 
basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. 
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Statement of Financial Position represents the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from 
this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the 
scheme. 
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity settled share-based benefits to certain employees. The Group has elected to apply IFRS 2 to all share-based 
awards and options granted post 7 November 2002 but not vested at 31 December 2004. These share-based payments are measured 
at their fair value at the date of grant and the fair value of share options is expensed to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period. Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model, as amended to take account of the Directors’ best 
estimate of probable share vesting and exercise.

4. Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 3, management has made the following 
judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements (apart from those involving 
estimations, which are dealt with below).
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Non-recurring items
Non-recurring items include significant exceptional transactions, the restructuring of businesses and material one-off items such as 
revenue received on the termination of significant print contracts, the disposal of a significant property and impairment of intangible 
and tangible assets together with the associated tax impact. The Company considers such items are material to the Income Statement 
and their separate disclosure is necessary for an appropriate understanding of the Group’s financial performance.
Valuation of publishing titles on acquisition
The Group’s policies require that a fair value at the date of acquisition be attributed to the publishing titles owned by each acquired 
entity. The Group’s management uses its judgement to determine the fair value attributable to each acquired publishing title taking into 
account the consideration paid, the earnings history and potential of the title, any recent similar transactions, industry statistics such 
as average earnings multiples and any other relevant factors.
The publishing titles are considered to have indefinite economic lives due to the historic longevity of the brands and the ability to 
evolve the brands in the changing media environment.
Assets held for sale
Where a property or a significant item of equipment (such as a print press) is marketed for sale, management is highly committed to 
the sale and the asset is available for immediate sale, the Group classifies that asset as held for sale. If the asset is expected to be 
sold within twelve months, the asset is classed as a current asset. The value of the asset is held at the lower of the net book value or 
the expected realisable sale value. The Directors’ have estimated the sale values based on the current price that the asset is being 
marketed at and advice from independent property agents. The actual sale proceeds may differ from the estimate.
Provisions for onerous leases and dilapidations
Where the Group exits a rented property, an estimate of the anticipated total future cost payable under the terms of the operating 
lease, including rentals, rates and other related expenses, is charged to the Income Statement at the point of exit as an onerous  
lease. Where there is a break clause in the contract, rentals are provided for up to that point. In addition, an estimate is made of the 
likelihood of sub-letting the premises and any rentals that would be receivable from a sub tenant. Where receipt of sub-lease rentals  
is considered reasonable, these amounts are deducted from the rentals payable by the Group under the lease and provision charged 
for the net amount.
Under the terms of a number of property leases, the Group is required to return the property to its original condition at the lease expiry 
date. The Group has estimated the expected costs of these dilapidations and charged these costs to the Income Statement. The costs 
have been discounted to the net present value given the length of some of the leases.
Valuation of share-based payments
The Group estimates the expected value of equity-settled share-based payments and this is charged through the Income Statement 
over the vesting periods of the relevant payments. The cost is estimated using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The Black-Scholes 
calculations are based on a number of assumptions that are set out in Note 30 and are amended to take account of estimated levels  
of share vesting and exercise. This method of estimating the value of the share-based payments is intended to ensure that the actual 
value transferred to employees is provided in the share-based payments reserve by the time the payments are made. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the period end date that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are 
discussed below.
Impairment of publishing titles
Determining whether publishing titles are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units (CGUs) to  
which these assets are allocated. Key areas of judgement in the value in use calculation include the identification of appropriate CGUs, 
estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from each CGU, the long-term growth rates and a suitable discount rate to apply to 
cash flows in order to calculate present value. The Group has identified its CGUs based on the seven geographic regions in which it 
operates. This is considered to be the lowest level at which cash inflows generated are largely independent of the cash inflows from other 
groups of assets and has been consistently applied in the current and prior periods. No impairment loss has been recognised in 2012 
(2011: loss of £163,695,000). The carrying value of publishing titles at 29 December 2012 was £742,294,000 (2011: £742,851,000). 
Details of the impairment reviews that the Group performs are provided in Note 15. 70 | Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
4. Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty (continued)
Valuation of pension liabilities
The Group records in its Statement of Financial Position a liability equivalent to the deficit on the Group’s defined benefit pension 
schemes. This liability is determined with advice from the Group’s actuarial advisers each year and can fluctuate based on a number 
of factors, some of which are outwith the control of management. The main factors that can impact the valuation include:
•	 the discount rate used to discount future liabilities back to the present date, determined each year from the yield on corporate 
bonds;
•	 the actual returns on investments experienced as compared to the expected rates used in the previous valuation;
•	 the actual rates of salary and pension increase as compared to the expected rates used in the previous valuation;
•	 the forecast inflation rate experienced as compared to the expected rates used in the previous valuation; and
•	 m o r t a l it y a s sum p t i o n s .
Details of the assumptions used to determine the liability at 29 December 2012 are set out in Note 24.
Bad debt allowance
The trade receivables balance recorded in the Group’s Statement of Financial Position comprises a large number of relatively small 
balances. An allowance is made for the estimated irrecoverable amounts from debtors and this is determined by reference to past 
default experience. Further details are shown in Note 21.
5. Business Segments

UK corporation tax is calculated at 24.5% (2011: 26.5%) of the estimated assessable profit/(loss) for the period. The 24.5% basic  
tax rate applied for the 2012 period was a blended rate due to the tax rate of 26.0% in effect for the first quarter of 2012, changing  
to 24.0% from 1 April 2012 under the 2012 Finance Act. Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the 
relevant jurisdiction.
The Group has recognised a £12.1 million tax credit as a result of the change to the UK deferred tax rate from 25% to 23%.
The tax credit for the period can be reconciled to the loss per the Income Statement as follows:

15. Intangible Assets (continued)
The exchange movement above reflects the impact of the exchange rate on the valuation of publishing titles denominated in Euros  
at the period end date. It is partially offset by a decrease in the euro borrowings.
The carrying amount of publishing titles by cash generating unit (CGU) is as follows: 
 
2012
£’000
2011
£’000
Scotland 56,013 58,575
North 272,190 279,223
Northwest 93,201 104,561
Midlands 168,190 168,731
South 60,602 45,267
Northern Ireland 73,422 63,042
Republic of Ireland 18,676 23,452
Total carrying amount of publishing titles 742,294 742,851
The Group tests the carrying value of publishing titles held within the publishing operating segment for impairment annually or more 
frequently if there are indications that they might be impaired. The publishing titles are grouped by CGUs, being the lowest levels for 
which there are separately identifiable cash flows independent of the cash inflows from other groups of assets. 
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use 
calculations are:
•	 the discount rate;
•	 expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period; and 
•	 g r ow t h r a te s .
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the CGUs. The discount rate applied to future cash flows in 2012 was 11.0% (2011: 11.0%). The discount rate reflects 
management’s view of the current risk profile of the underlying assets being valued with regard to the current economic environment 
and the risks that the regional media industry are facing. 
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market. These include 
changes in cover prices, advertising rates as well as movement in newsprint and production costs and inflation.
Discounted cash flow forecasts are prepared using:
•	 the most recent financial budgets and projections approved by management for 2013 – 2015 which reflect management’s current 
experience and future expectations of the markets the CGUs operate in; 
•	 cash flows for 2016 to 2032 that are extrapolated based on an estimated annual long-term growth rate of 1.0%;
•	 a discounted residual value of 5 times the final year’s cash flow; and
•	 capital expenditure cash flows to reflect the cycle of capital investment required. 
The present value of the cash flows are then compared to the carrying value of the asset to determine if there is any impairment loss.
The total net impairment charge recognised in 2012 was £nil (2011: net impairment charge of £163.7 million).
The net nil impairment charge in the period comprises further impairment of £25.8 million primarily in the North and North West  
of England, offset by the reversal of past impairment in the South of England and Northern Ireland.
The Group has conducted sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each CGU’s carrying value. A decrease in the long term growth 
rate of 0.5% would result in an impairment for the Group of £18.8 million and an increase in the discount rate of 0.5% would result in 
an impairment of £31.0 million.

Trade receivables
The average credit period taken on sales is 41 days (2011: 44 days). No interest is charged on trade receivables. The Group has 
provided for estimated irrecoverable amounts in accordance with the accounting policy described in Note 3. 
Before accepting any new credit customer, the Group obtains a credit check from an external agency to assess the potential 
customer’s credit quality and then defines credit terms and limits on a by-customer basis. These credit terms are reviewed regularly.  
In the case of one-off customers or low value purchases, pre-payment for the goods is required under the Group’s policy. The Group 
reviews trade receivables past due but not impaired on a regular basis and considers, based on past experience, that the credit quality 
of these amounts at the period end date has not deteriorated since the transaction was entered into and so considers the amounts 
recoverable. Regular contact is maintained with all such customers and, where necessary, payment plans are in place to further 
reduce the risk of default on the receivable. 
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £14.6 million (2011: £19.9 million) which are 
past due at the reporting date but for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality 
and the Group believes that the amounts are still recoverable. The Group does not hold any security over these balances. The 
weighted average age of these receivables (past due) is 26 days (2011: 25 days).

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable 
from the date credit was initially granted up to the balance sheet date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer 
base being large and unrelated. Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the 
allowance for doubtful debts. 80 | Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
21. Other Financial Assets and Liabilities (continued)
Ageing of impaired trade receivables
Impaired trade receivables are those that have been provided for under the Group’s bad debt provisioning policy, as described  
in the accounting policy in Note 3. The ageing of impaired trade receivables is shown below.

The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables at the balance sheet date approximate to their fair 
value. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents totalling £32,789,000 (2011: £13,407,000) comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits 
with an original maturity of three months or less. The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.

Trade creditors and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs. The average credit 
period taken for trade purchases is 33 days (2011: 30 days). The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure all 
payables are paid within the agreed credit terms.

Finance facilities
On 24 April 2012, the Group entered into an amended and restated finance agreement for credit facilities with bank lenders and 
private placement loan note holders until 30 September 2015. The facility is secured (see Note 29) and share warrants over 12.5% of 
the Company’s share capital have been issued to the lenders and note holders. 5.0% of the warrants were issued in August 2009, and 
a further 7.5% were issued in 2012, with all warrants expiring 30 September 2017. Interest rates are based on the absolute amount of 
debt outstanding and leverage multiples, with reductions based on agreed ratchets. 
Bank loans
The Group has credit facilities with a number of banks. The total facility at 29 December 2012 is £237.5 million (2011: £273.9 million)  
of which £10.0 million is unutilised at the balance sheet date (2011: £55.0 million). The credit facilities are provided under two separate 
tranches as detailed below.
•	 Facility A – a revolving credit facility of £55.0 million. This facility includes a bank overdraft facility of £10.0 million (2011: £10.0 
million). The loans can be drawn down for three month terms with interest payable at LIBOR plus a maximum cash margin of 
5.00% (2011: 4.15%). 
•	 Facility B – a term loan facility of £182.5 million (2011: £218.9 million), which can be drawn in Sterling or Euros. Interest is payable 
quarterly at LIBOR plus a cash margin of up to 5.00% (2011: 4.15%).
In accordance with the credit agreements in place, the Group hedges a portion of the bank loans via interest rate swaps exchanging 
floating rate interest for fixed rate interest and interest rate caps. At the balance sheet date, borrowings of £30.0 million (2011: £200.0 
million) were arranged at fixed rate, while a further £180.0 million borrowings (2011: £nil) were hedged through interest rate caps. 
Further details on all of the Group’s derivative instruments can be found in Note 32.
Private placement loan notes
The Group has total private placement loan notes at 29 December 2012 of £34.0 million and $137.8 million (2011: £39.1 million and 
$158.2 million). Interest is payable quarterly at fixed coupon rates up to 10.30% (2011: 9.45%) depending on covenants. 
The private placement loan notes consist of:
•	 £34.0 million at a coupon rate of up to 10.30% (2011: £39.1 million at a coupon rate of up to 9.45%)
•	 $58.7 million at a coupon rate of up to 9.75% (2011: $67.4 million at a coupon rate of up to 8.9%)

In order to hedge the Group’s exposure to US dollar exchange rate fluctuations, the Group has in place foreign exchange options. 
These options allow the Group to purchase US dollars at a set exchange rate, hedging the Group’s cash flow risk if the market rate 
falls below the set rate. The options are in place to cover all interest payments and scheduled principal repayments due on the US 
denominated private placement notes. 82 | Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
22. Borrowings (continued)
Repayments
All facilities are due for full repayment on 30 September 2015. 
Scheduled repayments are due every six months in relation to both the bank loans and private placement loan notes. Scheduled 
repayments total £70.0 million from 30 June 2012 to 30 June 2015; however following the News International receipt, part of the 
scheduled repayments were brought forward to November 2012 with only £40.0 million scheduled repayments remaining.
In addition, there is a pay-if-you-can (PIYC) repayment schedule agreed for both the bank loans and private placement notes totalling 
£60.0 million up to 30 June 2015. £2.0 million of the PIYC payments were made ahead of schedule in 2012. 
Payment-in-kind interest 
In addition to the cash margin payable on the bank facilities and private placement loan notes, a payment-in-kind (PIK) margin 
accumulates and is payable at the end of the facility. The PIK accrues at a maximum margin of 4.0% depending on the absolute 
amount of debt outstanding and leverage multiples. If the facilities are fully repaid prior to 31 December 2014, the rate at which the 
PIK margin accrued throughout the period of the agreement will be recalculated at a substantially reduced rate.
At the date of the refinancing, previously accrued PIK totalling £18.8 million was capitalised and added to the outstanding borrowings 
under the bank loans and private placement loan notes. Accordingly, the PIK accrual at 29 December 2012 only reflects PIK accrued 
since 24 April 2012.

The weighted average interest rates paid over the course of the year were as follows:

24. Retirement Benefit Obligation
Throughout 2012 the Group operated the Johnston Press Pension Plan (JPPP), together with the following schemes:
•	 A defined contribution scheme for the Republic of Ireland, the Johnston Press (Ireland) Pension Scheme. 
•	 An ROI industry-wide final salary scheme for journalists which was closed on 31 October 2012 and a final salary scheme for a 
small number of employees in Limerick which has been closed to future accruals since 2010. There are no additional financial 
implications to the Group if these schemes are terminated. Consequently, the Group’s obligation to these schemes is included  
in Long Term Provisions and the details shown below exclude these schemes.
The JPPP is in two parts, a defined contribution scheme and a defined benefit scheme. The latter is closed to new members and closed 
to future accrual. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group. The contributions are determined by a qualified 
actuary on the basis of a triennial valuation using the projected unit method. The contributions to the defined benefit scheme are fixed 
annual amounts with the intention of eliminating the deficit. Based on the outcome of the triennial valuation at 31 December 2010, the 
fixed annual contribution amount is £5.7 million from 1 June 2012 under the schedule of contributions agreed between the Company and 
the JPPP Trustees. As the defined benefit scheme has been closed to new members for a considerable period the last deferred member 
is scheduled to retire in 35 years with, at current mortality assumptions, the last pension paid in around 80 years (based on the mortality 
assumptions used for the 2010 triennial valuation). On a discounted basis the duration of the pension liabilities is circa 20 years. The 
financial information provided below relates to the defined benefit element of the JPPP .

During 2012 and 2011, the Company carried out pension exchange exercises whereby a number of pensioner members were made  
an offer by the Company to exchange some of their future pension increases for a one-off increase in pension, where the new uplifted 
amount would no longer be eligible for increases in payment. The impact of this was a non-recurring credit in the Group Income 
Statement of £1.5 million in the year (2011: credit of £1.9 million).
The composition of the trustees of the JPPP is made up of an independent Chairman, a number of member nominated (by ballot) 
trustees and several Company appointed trustees. Half of the trustees are nominated by members of the JPPP , both current employees 
and pensioner members. The trustees appoint their own advisers and administrators of the Plan. Discussions take place with the 
Executive Directors of the Company to agree matters such as the contribution rates. 
The defined contribution schemes provide for employee contributions between 2-6% dependent on age and position in the Group, 
with higher contributions from the Group. In addition, the Group bears the majority of the administration costs and also life cover. 
The pension cost charged to the Income Statement for the defined contribution schemes and Irish schemes in 2012 was £6,724,000 
(2011: £7,343,000).
Major assumptions:
2012 2011
Discount rate 4.5% 4.9%
Expected return on scheme assets 5.6% 5.6%
Future pension increases
Deferred revaluations (CPI) 1.9% 2.0%
Pensions in payment (RPI) 2.8% 2.9%
Life expectancy
Male 23.1 years 23.1 years
Female 23.1 years 23.3 years
The valuation of the defined benefit scheme’s funding position is dependent on a number of assumptions and is therefore sensitive  
to changes in the assumptions used. The impact of variations in the key assumptions are detailed below:
•	 A change in the discount rate of 0.1% pa would change the value of liabilities by approximately 1.7% or £8.1 million.
•	 A change in the life expectancy by one year would change liabilities by approximately 3.0% or £14.6 million.
•	 A change in the inflation rate of 0.1% pa would change the value of the liabilities by 1.1% or £5.6 million.

There was no current service costs in 2012 (2011: £nil) as the Defined Benefit scheme was closed to future accrual in 2010.
An actuarial loss of £21,065,000 (2011: loss of £49,584,000) has been recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income  
in the current period. This has been shown net of deferred tax of £5,188,000 (2011: £13,278,000). The cumulative amount of actuarial 
gains and losses recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income since the date of transition to IFRS is a loss of 
£105,530,000 (2011: loss of £84,465,000). The actual return on scheme assets was a £28,494,000 profit (2011: £1,198,000 loss).

The Group estimates that the future rate changes to 21.0% would reduce its UK actual deferred tax liability provided at 29 December 
2012 by £13,402,000, however the impact will be dependent on our deferred tax position at that time.

The Company has only one class of ordinary shares which has no right to fixed income. All the preference shares carry the right, subject 
to the discretion of the Company to distribute profits, to a fixed dividend of 13.75% and rank in priority to the ordinary shares. Given the 
discretionary nature of the dividend right, the preference shares are considered to be equity under IAS 32.
Since the balance sheet date, 2,796,518 ordinary shares of 10p each have been issued following the exercise of a number of share 
warrants.
At the balance sheet date 79,622,023 warrants were outstanding.

Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for certain of its office properties and motor vehicle fleet. Leases are 
negotiated for an average term of 10 years in the case of properties and 4 years for vehicles. The rents payable under property leases 
are subject to renegotiation at various intervals specified in the lease contracts. The Group pays insurance, maintenance and repairs  
of these properties. The rents payable for the vehicle fleet are fixed for the full rental period. 
Assets pledged as security
Under the refinancing agreement signed on 28 August 2009 and amended and extended on 24 April 2012, the Group and all its material 
subsidiaries have entered into a security agreement with the Group’s bankers and private placement loan note holders. The security 
provided includes a fixed charge over the assets of the Group including investments, fixed assets, goodwill, intellectual property and  
a floating charge over its present and future undertakings. 
30. Share-based Payments
Equity-Settled Share Option Scheme
Options over ordinary shares are granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme. Options are exercisable at a price equal to the 
closing quoted market price of the Company’s shares on the day prior to the date of grant. The vesting period is 3 years. If the options 
remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves 
the Group before the options vest. No options have been granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme since 2005.

No share options were exercised during the period. The options outstanding at the period end had a weighted average exercise price 
of 265p and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 0.2 years.
Previous grants were valued using the Black-Scholes model. As far as the assumptions were concerned, expected volatility was 
determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous full year. The expected life used in the 
model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and 
behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised a charge of £nil related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2012 for the Executive Share 
Option Scheme (2011: charge of £nil).
Group Savings-Related Share Option Scheme
The Company operates a Group Savings-Related Share Option Scheme. This has been approved by the Inland Revenue and is based 
on eligible employees being granted options and their agreeing to save weekly or monthly in a sharesave account with Computershare 
Plan Managers for a period of either 3, 5 or 7 years. The right to exercise is at the discretion of the employee within six months 
following the end of the period of saving.

transactions for the Savings-Related Share Option Scheme. 88 | Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
30. Share-based Payments (continued)
The above options granted on 29 September 2006 and earlier were issued to employees at a price equivalent to the average  
mid-market price for the 30 days prior to 27 August 2004, 2 September 2005 and 1 September 2006 respectively. The subsequent 
options were granted at the closing mid-market price on the day prior to the invitation being sent to employees on 3 September 2007, 
1 September 2008, 1 September 2009 and 1 September 2010 respectively. This follows the approval of the revised Sharesave Scheme 
at the Annual General Meeting in April 2007. A discount of 20% to the average mid-market price was applied to the issues up to and 
including 2009. No discount was applied to the 2010 issue.
There were no options granted under the Savings-Related Share Option Scheme in either 2012 or 2011.
Performance Share Plan
The Company makes awards to Executive Directors and certain senior employees on an annual basis under the Performance Share 
Plan. The awards vest after three years if certain performance criteria are met during that period.

Deferred Share Bonus Plan
It is the Company’s policy that a proportion of any bonus paid to Executive Directors and certain senior employees is paid in shares 
deferred for three years. Shares are purchased at the time the bonus is awarded and held by the Company until either the three years 
are completed or the employee leaves and is treated as a good leaver. 5,650,530 shares are held by the Company in relation to the 
Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
The Group recognised a net charge of £114,000 in 2012 (2011: £211,000) related to equity-settled bonus payments for the Deferred

32. Financial Instruments
a) Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the 
return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from 
2011. 
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in Note 22, cash and cash equivalents 
and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed  
in Note 27 and in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
b) Gearing ratio
The Board of Directors formally reviews the capital structure of the Group when considering any major corporate transactions.  
As part of these reviews, the Board considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. Based on the 
recommendations of the Board, the Group will balance its overall capital structure when appropriate through new share issues and 
share buy-backs as well as the issue of new debt or the redemption of existing debt.
The gearing ratio at the period end is as follows:
2012  
£’000
2011  
£’000
Debt 342,740 372,094
Cash and cash equivalents (32,789) (13,407)
Net debt (excluding the impact of cross-currency hedges) 309,951 358,687
Equity 273,917 284,364
Gearing ratio 53.0% 55.8%
Debt is defined as long and short-term borrowings as detailed in Note 22. Equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group 
attributable to equity holders of the parent. 
c) Externally imposed capital requirements
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements. 
d) Significant accounting policies
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement 
and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity 
instrument are disclosed in Note 3 to the financial statements.

f) Financial risk management objectives
The Group’s Corporate Treasury function provides services to the business and monitors and manages the financial risks relating to 
the operations of the Group through assessment of the exposures by degree and magnitude of risk. These risks include market risk 
(including currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
The Group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures.  
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board and guidelines agreed with the Group’s 
lenders that must be operated within. The Group does not enter into or trade in financial instruments, including derivative financial 
instruments, for speculative purposes.
The Corporate Treasury function reports regularly to the Executive Directors and the Board. 90 | Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

32. Financial Instruments (continued)
g) Market risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates (refer to section h) and 
interest rates (refer to section i). The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest 
rate and foreign currency risk, including:
•	 Borrowings in Euros to manage the foreign currency risk associated with the Group’s net investment in its foreign operations; 
•	 Interest rate swaps and caps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates; and
•	 Foreign currency options and currency swaps to manage the foreign currency risk associated with the US dollar denominated 
private placement loan notes.
At a Group and Company level, market risk exposures are assessed using sensitivity analyses.
There have been no changes to the Group’s exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures risk.
h) Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies, hence exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. 
The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows. In particular, the Group has a cash flow 
exposure to fluctuations in the US dollar on the private placement borrowings and interest payments. At the balance sheet date, the 
Group had in place a number of foreign exchange options which allow the Group to purchase US dollars at a set exchange rate when 
interest and principal payments are due on the borrowings. This protects the Group’s cashflows if the US dollar rate falls below the 
agreed option rate. 
The following table details the forward foreign currency options outstanding as at the period end:

Foreign currency sensitivity
As noted above, the Group is mainly exposed to movements in Euros and US dollars rates. The following table details the Group’s 
sensitivity to a 5% change in pounds sterling against the euro and a 5% change in pounds sterling against the US dollar. These 
percentages are the rates used by management when assessing sensitivities internally and represent management’s assessment  
of the possible change in foreign currency rates. 
The sensitivity analysis of the Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the 
change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period. A positive number 
indicates an increase in profit or loss and other equity where pounds sterling strengthens against the respective currency. For a 5% 
weakening of the sterling against the relevant currency, there is an equal and opposite impact on profit or loss and other equity, and 
the balances below reverse signs.

Of the impact on profit or loss an increase of £586,000 (2011: increase of £598,000) relates to the retranslation of the Group’s euro 
denominated borrowings. The £4,262,000 (2011: £183,000) impact on profit or loss from US dollar exposure relates to the retranslation 
of US dollar private placement loan notes.
i) Interest rate risk management
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as the Parent Company borrows funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. The risk is 
managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings and by the use of interest rate 
swap contracts and interest rate caps. Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align interest rate views, define risk appetite and 
the requirements of the funding agreements in place, ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the 
balance sheet or interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
Interest rate sensitivity
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative 
instruments at the period end date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding 
at the period end date was outstanding for the whole year. A 50 basis points increase is used when reporting interest rate risk 
internally to key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the possible change in interest rates.
At the reporting date, if interest rates had been 50 basis points higher and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s:
•	 net profit would decrease by £499,000 (2011: net profit would decrease by £374,000), mainly due to the impact of increased 
interest on sterling denominated borrowings; and
•	 net profit would increase by £36,000 (2011: net profit would increase by £377,000) as a result of the changes in the fair value  
of the Group’s cash flow hedges.
For a decrease of 50 bps, the numbers shown above would have the opposite effect.
Interest rate swap contracts 
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts 
calculated on agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on 
the fair value of issued fixed rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued floating rate debt held.
The following tables detail the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding as at the 
reporting date. The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year. In the tables below, 
positive values in the fair value columns denote financial assets and negative values denote financial liabilities.

1.90 3.57 30,000 253,548 (99) 5,795
The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly basis with interest being paid monthly or quarterly on the underlying principal amount. 
The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is 3 months LIBOR. The Group settles the difference between the fixed and floating interest 
rates on a net basis. All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest rate amounts are 
entered into in order to reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings.

Interest rate caps
Under interest rate caps, the Group has capped the floating 3 month libor rate through a one-off upfront payment. This protects the 
Group from interest rates rising above the cap, while continuing to pay floating libor while it remains below the cap. The interest rate 
caps settle on a quarterly basis.

32. Financial Instruments (continued)
Measurement
Financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are grouped into 3 levels based on the extent  
to which the fair value is observable. The levels are classified as follows:
Level 1: fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets for identified financial assets and liabilities.
Level 2: fair value is determined using directly observable inputs other than level 1 inputs.
Level 3: fair value is determined on inputs not based on observable market data.
In the current and prior period, the interest rate and cross currency swaps, foreign currency options and interest rate caps are 
classified as level 2 financial instruments. The available for sale investments are classified as level 3 financial instruments. There have 
been no transfers between the various levels of the fair value hierarchy during the period.
j) Credit risk management
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.  
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a way of mitigating the risk of financial loss  
from defaults. The Group’s policy on dealing with trade customers is described in Notes 3 and 21.
The Group’s exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored. As far as possible, the aggregate value 
of transactions is spread across a number of approved counterparties.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas. Ongoing credit 
evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar 
characteristics, the latter being defined as connected entities, other than with some of the larger advertising agencies. In the case of 
the latter, a close relationship exists between the Group and the agencies and appropriate allowances for doubtful debts are in place. 
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-
ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies, and the funds and financial instruments are held with a number of banks to 
spread the risk.
The following table shows the total estimated exposure to credit risk for all of the Group’s financial assets, excluding trade receivables 
which are discussed in Note 21:

k) Liquidity risk management
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has agreed an appropriate liquidity  
risk management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management 
requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and borrowing facilities  
by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. 
Included in Note 22 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.
Liquidity risk is further discussed in the Business Review on page 23.

Notes to the Company  
Financial Statements 
For the 52 week period  
ended 29 December 2012
33. Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of accounting and preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. As permitted by that Act, the 
separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards. No Profit and 
Loss Account is presented as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The Company’s result for the period, determined  
in accordance with the Act, was a profit of £61,727,000 (2011: loss of £70,184,000). The financial statements have been prepared on  
the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The 2012 period was for the 52 weeks ended 29 December 2012 with the prior year being for the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2011.
Going concern 
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that both the Company and the Group 
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed asset balances are shown at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation  
is provided on all property, plant and equipment, excluding land, at varying rates calculated to write-off cost over the useful lives.  
The principal rates employed are:
Plant and machinery   6.67%, 10%, 20%, 25% and 33% straight-line basis
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment. Unlisted investments are shown at 
Directors’ valuation. Upward revaluations are credited to the revaluation reserve. Downward revaluations in excess of any previous 
upward revaluations are taken to the Profit and Loss Account.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and bank overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including 
premia payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are charged to the Profit and Loss Account using the effective 
interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which 
they arise. Fees incurred in negotiating borrowings are held on the Balance Sheet and amortised to the Profit and Loss Account over 
the term of the underlying debt.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax 
rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the period end date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at 
the period end date. Timing differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial 
statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are 
recognised in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are 
expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the period end date.
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity settled share-based benefits to certain employees. These share-based payments are measured at their 
fair value at the date of grant and the fair value of expected shares is expensed to the Profit and Loss Account on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period. Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model, as amended to take account of the Directors’ best 
estimate of probable share vesting and exercise.
Dividends
Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recorded as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved. In the 
Company’s financial statements, dividends receivable from subsidiaries are recognised as assets in the period in which the dividends 
are approved.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Balance Sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of that instrument.
The Company’s activities and funding structure give rise to some exposure to the financial risks of changes in interest rates and 
foreign currency exchange rates. The Company uses interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps to manage these 
exposures. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised directly in the Profit and Loss Account.

Retirement benefit obligations
The Company participates in a Group-wide scheme, the Johnston Press Pension Plan, which has a defined benefit section (providing 
benefits based on final pensionable pay) and a defined contribution section (see Note 24). The assets of the scheme are held separately 
from those of the Company. The pension costs for the defined contribution section are charged to the Profit and Loss Account on the 
basis of contributions due in respect of the financial year. In relation to the defined benefit section of the scheme, the Company is unable 
to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities on a consistent and reliable basis and therefore, as required by FRS 17, the 
Company accounts for this scheme as a defined contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the Profit and Loss Account  
in respect of the defined benefit section represents the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the period.

affects the value of the investments held by the Parent Company and the element of the impairment of intangible assets relating to the

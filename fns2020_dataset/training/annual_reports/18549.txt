CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
The London property market 
remains very attractive and 
Foxtons continues to make 
excellent progress with its 
organic growth strategy.
Overview
Revenue grew across all business streams enabling  
the Group to report record revenues. In the sales 
market we saw falling volumes in central London, 
where price and Stamp Duty pressures have deterred 
buyers, more than offset by more active markets in 
outer London where the Group has been focusing 
recent expansion. Adjusted EBITDA is the key metric 
by which we measure performance, achieving  
£46.0 million (2014: £46.2 million) with margins  
in excess of 30%. Profit before tax was £41.0 million 
(2014: £42.1 million). The Company continued its 
growth across London by opening seven new branches, 
bringing the total network to 58. Cash generation 
remains strong, enabling the Company to propose  
an increase in full year dividends of 13.4%. In addition 
the Company commenced a share buy-back 
programme at year end.
Board and governance
The Board places significant importance on corporate 
governance and compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. Full details are set out in the 
Corporate Governance section of our Annual Report 
and Accounts.
Dividend and share buy-back
The Group’s dividend policy is to pay between  
35% and 40% of profit after tax as ordinary dividends 
with the potential for special dividends to return 
excess cash to Shareholders. During 2015 an interim 
dividend of 1.67p per share plus a special dividend  
of 3.10p per share was paid in September 2015.  
The Board is proposing a final dividend for 2015  
of 3.34p per share plus a further special dividend of  
2.89p per share, bringing the total for the full year to 
11.0p per share, £30.8 million in total. The proposed 
dividends will, subject to Shareholder approval at the 
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) on 18 May 2016, be 
paid on 26 May 2016 to Shareholders on the register 
at 29 April 2016. Since its IPO in September 2013,  
the Company will have returned £73.5 million of 
dividends to Shareholders inclusive of the above 
dividend proposal.
In addition to paying the expected dividend, the 
Company commenced a share buy-back programme 
on 16 December 2015, to make on-market purchases 
of Foxtons ordinary shares in line with the Company’s 
policy of returning excess cash to Shareholders, and 
the programme has continued into 2016. As at  
7 March 2016, the Company had purchased and 
cancelled in total 7 million ordinary shares at a  
cost of £12 million.
Summary
The attractive fundamentals of the London property 
market remains strong. Our strategy continues to be 
the delivery of profitable growth through targeted 
organic expansion. The Group has continued to 
perform well, taking into consideration the slow 
recovery of the London market since the General 
Election. The Group has a dynamic and dedicated 
team of people, all determined to build further on our 
success. I would like to take this opportunity on behalf 
of the Board to thank everyone at Foxtons for their 
commitment and hard work. With their continued 
support we can look forward with confidence  
to the future.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Despite a subdued sales market, our 
innovative business model, effective 
expansion strategy and strong position 
in lettings enabled us to grow revenues 
and maintain high EBITDA margins.
Review of the year
Property sales transaction levels within the London market as  
a whole remained subdued throughout the year. In particular,  
the increase in activity expected by many following the General 
Election in May 2015 did not arrive and as a result, 2015 property 
sales within Greater London were well below levels in 2014. 
Activity in central London property markets has been especially 
constrained due to strong recent price growth and Stamp Duty 
changes, which have significantly increased the cost of 
moving home.
Despite these challenging underlying market conditions, we  
have been able to deliver growth in revenue and market share  
by continuing to expand our branch network, particularly within 
outer London. Our centralised business model has enabled us  
to generate high Adjusted EBITDA margins and the innovative 
application of technology and data throughout our Company 
continues to support the excellent customer service that is key  
to our proposition as a premium estate agency.
The Group achieved record revenue in 2015 of £149.8 million,  
up 4.1% versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA of £46.0 million 
remained in line with prior year and Adjusted EBITDA margins 
remained industry leading at over 30%.
Foxtons Sales revenue grew 3.4% reflecting market share gains, 
against an overall market that contracted significantly in 2015, 
while holding firm to our standard commission rates. Our New 
Homes business continued to grow representing 14% of sales 
commissions compared to 9% last year. Lettings continued to 
produce steady top line growth and excellent margins. Lettings 
revenue was more skewed towards renewals than new lets as 
record numbers of tenants chose to extend their tenancies  
in 2015.
Alexander Hall, our mortgage broker, had a particularly  
strong year delivering both substantial revenue and Adjusted 
EBITDA growth.
The Group once again generated high levels of cash with an 
operating cash conversion
1
 ratio of 87.4% in 2015 (2014: 84.5%) 
and net free cash flow of £32.0 million (2014: £27.3 million). This 
stable cash generation has allowed the Group to continue to fund 
its own organic branch expansion.
Expansion programme
During 2015 we opened seven new branches, all in the outer 
London areas of zone 2 and beyond. These areas remain our 
priority for expansion and we have a healthy pipeline of new 
branches in similar locations for 2016. Since our IPO we have 
continued our geographic diversification, opening 16 new 
branches of which 15 are outside zone 1
2
 and these continue  
to follow a similar profile in terms of profitability and cash flow 
generation to our earlier openings. The 20 branches opened 
between 2010 and 2013 on average achieved positive Adjusted 
EBITDA in seven months of opening, and broke even in cash terms 
in 20 months. Average returns on capital employed for the second 
full year of operation were circa 150%. All branches opened in 
2014 and 2015 are performing in line with expectations. 
Awards
As well as achieving strong financial results, Foxtons was delighted 
to win many prestigious awards for its service, training, website 
and marketing, both nationally and internationally, including Best 
London Real Estate Agency and Best Real Estate Agency Website 
at the International Property Awards, and Best Large Lettings 
Agency in the UK at the Sunday Times awards. These awards 
demonstrate the unwavering commitment of our people to 
delivering exceptional service to clients, day in, day out.
Outlook
Our strategy puts us in a strong position both to capture growth 
in outer London through organic expansion and to benefit from 
any future growth in the sales market. We expect some growth in 
the sales market in 2016 but continue to believe that a recovery 
in volumes will be affected by a low level of stock. We remain 
confident that our organic expansion strategy together with our 
strong lettings business will enable us to continue to deliver 
robust results.
London is fundamentally a highly attractive property market for 
both sales and lettings and our balanced business model is proven 
to generate Shareholder value across the market cycle. The Group 
remains debt-free, highly cash-generative and focused on 
returning all excess cash to Shareholders.

cash-generative. This combination allows the Company to generate significant returns for our Shareholders.
5 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2013 5 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Attractive market fundamentals
The UK property market, in terms of value and volume, is concentrated in the south-east of  
the country. High property density and resilient prices in London and the south-east create a 
disproportionately valuable market in this area. Based on Land Registry data in 2015, London 
accounted for nearly half of all residential property sales transactions by value in England and 
Wales, while the south-east accounted for over 80%. London also supports a very strong lettings 
market. Foxtons current and medium-term focus is on the London area with a longer-term 
opportunity in the south-east.
MARKET OVERVIEW
Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015 6 Sales market
The London property market continues to offer 
disproportionate value and growth. High population density 
and limited housing stock within London continue to drive 
resilient sales prices and a valuable lettings market. The 
long-term fundamentals of the London market remain 
attractive mainly due to the lack of supply of properties and 
ever increasing demand. Excess demand is primarily driven 
by high levels of economic activity, affluence, domestic and 
international mobility and population growth, particularly 
of young adults. London also attracts overseas purchasers 
who buy residential property either as homes or for 
investment purposes. Based on the latest London census 
figures, there was a cumulative population increase of  
circa 1.1 million from 2005 to 2014 with only circa  
200k new homes built in the same period.

195,890
Although average prices are significantly higher in London 
than the rest of the country, over 90% of London residential 
property sales are transacted at prices below £1 million and 
69% are in the price band £200k to £600k. With an average 
price during 2015 of £550k, Foxtons market profile mirrors 
that of the wider London market.
Growth through organic expansion 
Foxtons current and medium-term focus continues to be  
on the higher-volume, higher-value London market. As at  
31 December 2015, the Group operated 58 offices, with 
over 80% located in the outer London areas. Foxtons branch 
network covers only just over half of London, and there is 
significant scope to expand and to grow revenue and profit 
without any meaningful uplift in the overall market.

Foxtons relative performance in sales against 
the market
Foxtons sales market share in London has doubled since 
2008, with Foxtons sales growing 134% whilst markets  
in which Foxtons operates have grown only 37%. This 
improvement has been made through increased market 
share by more mature branches and the opening of 
new branches.
Foxtons strategy puts us in a strong position to capture 
growth by both expanding further into outer London areas 
and benefitting from any future improvements in market 
conditions in our more mature branches in the central 
London area.
Divergence of sales activities from central
1
  
to outer London
2
Residential property sales transaction volumes have been 
stronger in outer London areas whereas zone 1 volumes 
have decreased by 15%. Declining volumes were caused  
by uncertainty around the General Election and potentially 
an introduction of a mansion tax, changes to Stamp Duty 
and general affordability issues as prices in zone 1 rose  
by 15% in 2015. 
In the medium-term, affordability will continue to  
drive migration and house building to outer London. 
Foxtons expansion strategy is to capture this growth by 
continuing to open between five to 10 branches per year, 
predominantly in outer London and longer term in the 
south-east of England.

Lettings market
London has experienced a significant shift in tenure with 
nearly 30% of households now living in private rented 
accommodation, double the number seen in the last decade. 
This huge increase in demand for private rentals in London 
provides a solid base for the Group’s lettings business. In 
addition, the continuing increase in London’s population 
maintains an upward pressure on rental rates. The lettings 
market continues to be a key element of Foxtons business 
strategy. It provides a steady, reliable income stream and  
it accounts for half of the Group’s business.

Foxtons has an impressive track record of growing its business by delivering premium service 
levels. The Group’s strategic aim is to continue to leverage its brand, centralised resources, 
technology and sales and service culture, in order to grow revenue and profit as it expands  
its branch network through London’s higher-volume, higher-value property markets.

Foxtons has five strategic priorities:
Target higher-volume,  
higher-value residential 
property markets in London
Foxtons current focus is on the 
higher-volume, higher-value  
London market, which represents a 
disproportionately valuable property 
market. Over time we have the 
potential to increase significantly the 
number of existing branches in London.

Balanced business
The Group places equal importance on

relatively even balance between the 
financial contributions made by each  
over time. The Group’s lettings business

revenues which has delivered year-on-year

Premium service and prices
The Group delivers high-quality service 
levels, maximising value for clients by 
selling or letting their properties at the 
best price through the innovative 
application of technology, the utilisation 
of data and by working harder than 
competitors. Foxtons branches are open 
8am to 8pm, 362 days a year, enabling 
them to work around our clients’ busy

Business model
The Group is based on a business model with a proven significant  
and sustainable competitive advantage.  11 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015
A single brand with a strong identity
The Foxtons brand has been supported by significant levels of expenditure on 
brand and customer marketing communications programmes over the past 35 
years. Foxtons leading property website, www.foxtons.co.uk, and “0% commission” 
campaigns, which support each new branch opening, generate strong brand 
awareness and new business growth. Its distinctive branches and branded MINI 
fleet reinforce its high street presence and underpin its quality credentials.
Business centralisation
The Group’s substantial long-term investment in centralised work groups, 
business process engineering and technology has created a highly scalable 
business, delivering unparalleled levels of productivity and service. This 
centralised approach also delivers significant operational leverage, enabling  
the Group to expand its branch network at relatively low cost, whilst  
delivering high profit margins.
Innovative application of technology
Foxtons development over the last 35 years has been characterised by the 
innovative application of technology to estate agency. The Group is recognised 
as the technology leader in the sector, with sophisticated workflow systems, 
web applications and content-rich information databases underpinning 
virtually every aspect of its business model. These systems enable our internal 
departments to work cohesively together to deliver exceptional levels of 
service and productivity, and have been a key driver in reducing average costs. 
Foxtons systems also provide vital performance tools for managers, enabling 
them to monitor employee performance in real-time.
Foxtons has invested heavily in its website and web-based applications, which 
are internally developed and maintained, and which have received many 
industry awards for their innovative features. Foxtons website showcases clients’ 
properties using high-quality images and floorplans and allows users to search 
for properties using pioneering search criteria. Clients have access to web-based 
applications, such as the landlord portal, giving them secure, direct access to key 
tenancy information and documents, and applications that enable documents  
to be signed and payments to be made online.
Culture and people
Foxtons people are highly motivated to deliver exceptional results for  
clients. A wide range of incentives ensures that outstanding personal and  
team results are rewarded and recognised across the Company. Foxtons 
recruits high-quality individuals and is a true meritocracy. We always promote 
sales people from within our current pool of employees, ensuring that our best 
people experience rapid career progression into leadership positions where 
they can have the greatest positive impact. Our training and development  
goal is to create the finest estate agents in the industry with a clear focus  
on professionalism, integrity and a strong work ethic.
Integrated mortgage broker
Foxtons integrated mortgage broker, Alexander Hall, benefits from low-cost 
sales leads from the estate agency business and has the potential to grow as 
Foxtons expands and as property sales transactions increase. We offer a unique culture
In order to offer exceptional service to our clients, 
it’s vital that our people are inspired, engaged  
and supported. That’s why working at Foxtons  
is energetic, sociable and rewarding.
We provide the opportunity for talented  
and enthusiastic employees to thrive in an 
incentive-driven environment where outstanding 
work is recognised in both team and individual 
capacities, encouraging development as a team 
member as well as personally. We also hold  
regular awards ceremonies, where our employees 
are rewarded for their exceptional performance  
or contribution.
Extensive training 
Much of the value we offer our clients is created 
through the specialist skills and deep knowledge of 
our people and we are committed to ensuring they 
receive the best training and career development 
opportunities with a view to building a long-term 
career. Our award-winning training strategy 
consists of nearly 300 modules made up of formal 
and informal training, mentoring programmes and 
networking events, giving everyone the support and 
first-class resources they need to drive their own 
learning. This investment in training is ongoing 
throughout our peoples’ careers irrespective of 
roles or levels as we believe that in order to excel 
you never stop learning. We’re strongly committed 
to the highest standard of business behaviour, 
compliance and ethics and this forms a major  
part of all our training.
Commitment to career progression
In order to promote loyalty and develop a business 
of true experts, Foxtons is a meritocracy and we 
only ever promote from within (specialist positions 
excepted). We believe that those trained by us are 
best suited to drive this Company forward and 
anyone who demonstrates skill and hard work may 
aspire to reach the highest level and experience 
accelerated development. Our commitment to 
opening five to 10 new offices every year means 
that we offer fast-track career opportunities for 
those with the ability and drive to succeed. The 
average tenure of a senior operational Director  
at Foxtons is nearly 13 years; however, early 
responsibility and rapid promotion for high 
achievers is not unusual.
Diversity and inclusion
We are proud of our diversity throughout the 
Company and our working practices. We hire 
people from a multitude of backgrounds and  
our training takes a comprehensive and personal 
approach allowing us to focus on matching the 
right people to the right roles. The diversity  
profile of our workforce reflects society and  
our client base.
We are committed to equal opportunities and an 
entirely non-discriminatory working environment. 
Our diversity policy aims to ensure that no job 
applicant or employee receives less favourable 
treatment because of gender, marital status, race, 
age, sexual preference, religion, belief or disability. 
All decisions are based on the merits of the 
individual concerned. The Group is dedicated to 
undertaking its business operations in a way which 
respects individual human rights, treats individuals 
with dignity and allows freedom of association.  
We value the contribution of each and every one  
of our employees and together we have created an 
inspiring working environment where everyone is 
engaged, motivated and safe from discrimination 
so they can fulfil their own potential.
Our diversity is evident throughout the organisation 
where 45% (2014: 49%) of our total staff are 
female and 19% (2014: 23%) of our senior staff  
are female.
Appointments to the Board are made on merit, 
against objective criteria and with due regard  
for the benefits of diversity on the Board. Of the  
seven Board members at year end, one was female.
The key to our success
We recognise that our continued success can only be achieved  
through the commitment and dedication of our people. We are  
not just passionate about training our people in how to sell  
and let properties, we are passionate about their ongoing

13 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015 The combination of our strategy and business model, whilst operating  
within the attractive London property market, leads to high profit margins  
and high cash generation:
• The absolute level of profit is determined by the market and our branch 
expansion plan;
• Our strategy and business model generates industry leading margins in  
excess of 30%;
• High profitability, minimal working capital requirements and a relatively  
low level of capital spend generates high levels of net free cash. In 2015, £32.0 
million of net free cash was generated, representing 69.6% of Adjusted EBITDA;
• As the Company is debt-free, net free cash is available to return to Shareholders;
• During 2015 the Company returned 90.3% of net free cash to Shareholders  
in the form of dividends and share buy-backs.

BUSINESS REVIEW
Revenue
The Foxtons Group comprises three business segments 
– Sales, Lettings and Mortgage broking. The majority 
of operations are in the London area with two 
branches in the adjacent area of Surrey. 
Revenue growth:
£m 2015 2014 % variance
Sales 72.2 69.8 +3.4%
Lettings 68.9 67.4 +2.3%
Mortgage broking 8.3 6.3 +31.8%
Other 0.4 0.4
Total revenue 149.8 143.9 +4.1%
Sales
Revenues from Sales increased by 3.4% over the 
previous year as a result of higher transaction 
volumes, despite market volumes falling almost 10%. 
Foxtons was able to grow volumes through organic 
growth and market share gains. Average revenue per 
transaction remained broadly flat versus prior year  
as underlying London price inflation was offset by  
the mix effect of significant volume reductions in  
the higher valued central London area and increased 
volumes at lower average sales prices as Foxtons 
expands out from central London. During 2015 the 
average price of Foxtons property sales was £550k 
(2014: £544k).
Lettings
The Lettings segment continues to provide a 
consistent revenue stream irrespective of the 
variability in the Sales market. Lettings revenue 
continues to grow, driven by an increase in average 
rental values. Renewals revenue increased as a 
percentage of total lets revenue as record numbers  
of tenants chose to extend their tenancies in 2015.
Mortgage broking
Revenue increased by 31.8%. This was primarily 
volume driven with a 20.5% increase due to increasing 
adviser headcount together with average revenue  
per deal increasing by 9.4% due to both increasing 
average loan sizes and increased procuration fees  
paid by lenders.
Organic expansion
The Group has continued its organic expansion 
programme, opening seven new branches during the 
year, increasing the network to 58 branches. Foxtons 
has an experienced in-house project team that works 
with a number of external professionals to manage the 
opening of new branches. Organic expansion is a 
low-risk growth route with many opportunities 
available within London over the foreseeable future. 
Each new branch cohort opened between 2010 and 
2013 achieved positive Adjusted EBITDA within circa 
seven months of opening and broke even in cash 
terms within 20 months. Average returns on capital 
employed for the second full year of operation were 
circa 150%. The 2014 and 2015 tranche of branch 
openings are following a similar profile.
Balanced business
A key strategic priority for the Company is to maintain 
a balanced business. This balance across the Sales and 
Lettings segments provides financial strength in the 
Group to withstand fluctuations in the property market.
% of total revenue 2015 2014
Sales 48.2% 48.5%
Lettings 46.0% 46.8%
Mortgage broking 5.5% 4.4%
Other 0.3% 0.3%
Total revenue 100.0% 100.0%
Continued high margins and 
strong cash generation
The Group has grown revenue across all operating segments and maintained high margins despite the 
challenges of a difficult market in central London. Overall, revenue increased by 4.1% and Adjusted 
EBITDA remained flat as the Group continued expanding organically, opening seven new branches  
during the year. The Group’s continued strong cash generation enables the Company to recommend a 
final and special dividend totalling 6.23p per share which together with the interim and special dividend 
paid earlier in the year results in a total dividend in respect of 2015 of 11.0p per share. This is an increase 
of 13.4% on the prior year (2014: 9.7p per share). In addition, the Company commenced a share buy-back 
programme towards the end of the year which has continued into 2016. 17 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015
KPI analysis
Average revenue per branch of £2.7 million (2014: 
£3.0 million) declined due to an increase of 14.7%  
in the number of branches (average branches across 
year) adding to the number of maturing branches in 
the network, the difficult central London market plus 
the expansion of the network into the outer regions  
of London. Average revenue per employee of £113k 
(2014: £113k) remained flat with property price 
inflation being offset by the extension of our network 
into the outer regions of London where average  
prices are lower.

• Increase of £2.2 million (5.2%) in Sales and Lettings 
salaries and other cost of sales moving broadly in 
line with the increase in total revenue of 4.1%
• Branch overhead costs increased by £2.4 million 
(9.5%), primarily reflecting the opening of seven 
new branches during the year. With a 14.7% 
increase in the average number of branches year  
on year, average branch costs fell by 4.6%.
• HQ costs (Chiswick Park) increased by £0.6 million 
(2.6%) and were only marginally impacted by the 
increase in the branch network during the year, 
reflecting the operational leverage in the business. 
Average HQ costs per branch fell by 10.6%.

BUSINESS REVIEW continued
Profitability analysis
All business segments are highly profitable and are 
shown in the table below.
£m 2015 2014
Sales 23.5 23.2
Lettings 20.7 21.8
Mortgage broking 1.4 0.7
Other 0.4 0.5
Group Adjusted EBITDA 46.0 46.2
Sales and Lettings margins reduced slightly due to the 
challenging central London market in which Foxtons 
still generates a significant proportion of its revenues 
and profits, together with the continued growth in the 
branch network adding to the number of immature 
branches in the Foxtons network. Mortgage broking 
continues to produce margin improvements from 
significant revenue growth. 
2015 2014
Sales 32.6% 33.3%
Lettings 30.1% 32.4%
Mortgage broking 16.5% 11.8%
Group Adjusted EBITDA margin 30.7% 32.1%
Seasonality
EBITDA generation is not phased equally during the 
year due to a certain degree of seasonality in the 
business. Seasonality is seen in both Sales and Lettings 
with Q3 being the peak period for Lettings revenues. 
In addition, EBITDA phasing is impacted by the 
Foxtons expansion programme with openings skewed 
to the first half of the year. By the second half of the 
year new branches are beginning to generate revenues 
and move into profitability. Historically, Adjusted 
EBITDA has been weighted towards the second half of 
the year with a ratio of circa 47:53 (H1:H2). However, 
during 2015 the weighting was slightly more 
pronounced with a 45:55 ratio due to the disruption  
of the General Election in the first half of the year.
Operating profit
Operating profit of £40.9 million (2014: £42.0 million) 
reduced due to a decline in central London operating 
profits together with increased costs due to the 
continued expansion of the branch network into  
outer London. There were no exceptional items in 
either the current or prior year.
Profit before tax (PBT)
PBT of £41.0 million (2014: £42.1 million) fell due to 
the operational performance noted above. The Group 
has no finance costs as it remains debt-free.
Taxation
The business activities of Foxtons all operate within 
the UK and are all UK tax registered. The Group does 
not have any complex tax structures in place and has 
made significant tax payments during the year. The 
Company has benefited from reduced UK corporation 
tax rates. The rate has fallen from 21% (1 April 2014) 
to 20% (1 April 2015). These tax rates produce a 
blended rate of 20.25% for the 2015 financial year 
(2014: 21.5%). The effective current tax rates for  
the Group are in line with these blended rates  
being 19.1% for 2015 and 21.2% for 2014.
The absolute tax charge for the period fell by  
£2.2 million due to:
• Reduced corporation tax rates applied to reduced 
profit before tax, resulting in a reduction in the 
current tax charge of £0.7 million.
• Reduction of £2.0 million in deferred tax, primarily 
due to reduced corporation tax rates on the 
deferred tax liability in respect of the intangible 
brand asset.
• All other tax movements totalling an increase  
of £0.5 million.
Tax payments during the year totalled £8.3 million 
(2014: £10.3million), reflecting higher profitability in 
2013 and the instalment payments thereon falling 
into 2014, together with lower rates of corporation 
tax in 2015. 19 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Earnings per share (EPS)
Basic and diluted EPS increased by 3.4% to 12.3p 
(2014: 11.9p) primarily due to the increase in 
profitability from the deferred tax credit of 
£2.0 million.
Cash flow
Net free cash flow for the year increased to £32.0 
million (2014: £27.3 million). The increase of 17.1% 
was primarily due to an improved working capital 
position together with lower corporation tax payments 
and the fact that in the prior year shares were 
purchased in respect of the long-term incentive 
programme. An improvement in cash conversion can 
be seen from the metric “net free cash as a percentage 
of Adjusted EBITDA”, which improved from 59.1% in 
2014 to 69.6% in 2015.
Due to the continued high cash generation of the 
Company, no overdraft facilities are in place and 
the business remains debt-free.
Dividends
The interim and special dividend of 4.77p per share 
was paid on 25 September 2015. Due to the continued 
strong cash generation of the Company, a final and 
special dividend totalling 6.23p per share is being 
recommended to Shareholders for payment in May 
2016. Subject to Shareholder approval, dividends in 
respect of 2015 will total 11.0p per share (2014: 9.70p 
per share), representing a 13.4% increase.
Share buy-backs
The Company commenced a share buy-back 
programme on 16 December 2015, to make  
on-market purchases of Foxtons ordinary shares  
in line with the Company’s policy of returning excess 
cash to Shareholders. At year end the Company had 
purchased 0.5 million shares (0.2% of issued share 
capital) at an average price of 181p per share and  
a total cost of £0.9 million. The share buy-back 
programme has continued into 2016 and is funded 
from accumulated cash resources. This and any  
future buy-back programmes are not intended to  
lead to a change in the Company’s dividend policy.
Post balance sheet events
As part of the share buy-back programme commenced 
on 16 December 2015, a further 6.6 million shares 
were purchased in 2016 for a cost of £11.1 million.  
In total, the share buy-back programme has resulted  
in 7.1 million shares being purchased for a total cost  
of £12.0 million and an average cost per share of 
170p comprising 2.5% of issued share capital.
Treasury policies and objectives
The Group’s treasury policy is designed to reduce 
financial risk.
Financial risk for the Group is low as:
• The Group is debt-free;
• The Group is totally UK based with no foreign 
currency risk; and
• Surplus cash balances are held with major UK  
based banks.
As a consequence of the above, the Group has not  
had to enter into any financial instruments to protect 
against risk. 
Risk management
The Group has identified its principal risks and 
uncertainties and they are regularly reviewed by  
the Board and senior management. See page 22.
Pensions
The Group does not have any defined benefit  
schemes in place but is subject to the provisions  
of auto-enrolment which require the Company  
to make certain defined contribution payments  
for our employees.

PRINCIPAL RISKS
Risk management
The Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining the Group’s system of risk management and internal control, with 
the aim of protecting its employees and customers and safeguarding the interests of the Company and its Shareholders in  
the constantly changing environment in which it operates. The Board regularly reviews the principal risks facing the Company 
together with the relevant mitigating controls and undertakes a robust assessment. In reviewing the principal risks the Board 
considers emerging risks and significant changes to existing risk ratings. In addition, the Board has set guidelines for risk 
appetite as part of the risk management process (see table overleaf) against which risks are monitored.
The broad structure of risk management is given in the chart below. The identification of risk in the Group is undertaken by 
specific executive risk committees which analyse overall corporate risk, information technology risk and mortgage broking  
risk. Other committees exist below this level to focus on specific areas such as anti-money laundering. A common risk register 
is used across the Group to monitor gross and residual risk with the results being assessed by the Board. The Compliance 
department constantly reviews operations to ensure that any non-standard transactions have been properly authorised and 
that procedures are being properly adhered to across the branch network. The Audit Committee monitors the effectiveness  
of the risk management system through regular updates originating from the various executive risk committees. 
The principal risks table on pages 24 to 25 sets out the risks facing the business at the date of this Report analysed between 
external and internal factors. An assessment of residual likelihood and impact is shown together with an overall risk rating.  
An indication is also provided of whether the risk has changed over the course of the year. These risk ratings are also shown 
graphically in a heat map. Having considered the risks facing the Company the Board replaced “Macroeconomic risk” with the 
more specific “Market risk” and replaced “Government policy” with “Compliance with the legal and regulatory environment”. 
In addition the Board considered that the previously reported risks of “Client monies” and “Potential for fraud” no longer fell 
into the category of principal risks and were therefore removed.
The risks detailed do not comprise all of the risks that the Group may face and are not listed in any order of priority. Additional 
risks and uncertainties not presently known to management or deemed to be less material at the date of this Report may also 
have an adverse effect on the Group.

Risk appetite
The risk agenda
The “risk appetite” statement highlights those risks that the Group is willing to take, as well as those which are unacceptable. The 
risk appetite statement includes a series of risk assertions which are aligned to our strategy, together with the risk parameters 
within which we expect our people to work. Compliance with the risk appetite statement is monitored through the Group’s 
standard monitoring and reporting mechanisms. The Board will continue to review and update the risk appetite statement  
on an annual basis.
Risk appetite statement
The Group operates in markets with high growth potential which are subject to volatility, particularly in the property sales 
market. We will pursue ambitious growth targets and we are willing to accept certain levels of risk to increase the likelihood  
of achieving or exceeding our strategic objectives, subject to the parameters below.
Risk appetite varies depending on the risk type
The Board’s appetite for risk varies depending on the risk type. The Group measures risk by estimating the potential for loss of 
profit, staff turnover and reputational damage. The Board has a low tolerance for compliance related risk. Conversely, it has a 
higher tolerance for strategic risk. Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015 24

 Market risk
Continuous high property price inflation 
may impact affordability which in turn 
may reduce transaction levels in the 
market. The market may also be 
affected by any reduction in London’s 
standing as a major financial city 
caused by a decision by the UK to  
leave the EU.
The market is also reliant on the 
availability of mortgage finance, a 
deterioration in which may adversely 
affect Foxtons. 
The market may also be impacted  
by any changes in Government policy 
such as increases in Stamp Duty  
taxes or increased regulation in  
the lettings market.
The Board endeavours to maintain a generally even balance between  
its sales and lettings revenues and profits in order to provide protection 
against volatility within the property sales market.
Increasing risk due 
to high property 
price inflation  
and increases  
in Stamp Duty. 
2
 Competitor challenge
Foxtons operates in a highly 
competitive marketplace. New or 
existing competitors could develop  
new services or methods of working 
including online and hybrid agents 
which could give them a competitive 
advantage over Foxtons.
Foxtons continually collects information on competitor activity through  
its branch network and centralised Business Development teams. 
Foxtons flat management structure allows this competitor intelligence to  
be fed back to management accurately and quickly so that the Company  
can rapidly consider appropriate responses.
The Board believes that the emotional and complex nature of estate agency 
transactions means that it is unlikely that online agents will play a major role 
in the exchange or completion of sales or lettings transactions without the 
involvement of an estate agent. Any market share gained by online agents is 
likely to be at the expense of traditional estate agents with low levels of 
service who compete on price. However, the challenge of online agents will 
be kept under review.
3
 Compliance with the legal and regulatory environment
Breaches of laws or regulations  
could lead to financial penalties  
and reputational damage.
The Mortgage broking division is 
authorised and regulated by the FCA 
and could be subject to sanction for 
non-compliance.
The Group is supported by Compliance and Legal teams who monitor 
regulatory reform proposals and participate in industry forums. Foxtons 
centralised service structure provides it with a flexible platform from  
which to respond to regulatory change.
The Mortgage broking division has a specific Risk and Compliance 
Committee which monitors compliance with FCA regulations.
Increasing risk due 
to governmental 
focus on the 
increasing 
population renting 
properties.
The assessment of likelihood and impact is based on the following definitions:
          Likelihood Impact Risk Rating
Low potential of the risk crystallising Very limited or isolated impact to the Group and/or its broader customer base Low
Moderate potential of the risk crystallising Moderate impact to the Group and/or our broader customer base Moderate

Principal risk residual heat map
The principal risk residual heat map is a visual representation  
of the principal risks facing the Group. Risks shown in the 
bottom left-hand corner of the chart have a low risk rating as 
they have a low likelihood of occurring and a low potential 
impact on the Group. Conversely, risks shown in the top 
right-hand corner of the chart have a high risk rating as  
they have a high likelihood of occurring and a high potential 
impact on the Group.
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 2014 revision of the  
UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors have assessed  
the prospects of the Company over a longer period than the 12 
months required by the ‘going concern’ provision. The Directors 
have assessed the viability of the Group over a three year period 
which is the period over which the Group’s strategic review is 
assessed by the Board.
This assessment has considered the potential impact of the 
principal risks on the business model, future performance and 
liquidity of the Group over the period. In making this statement 
the Directors have considered the resilience of the Group under 
varying market conditions together with the effectiveness of  
any mitigating actions. Specifically, the Board has reviewed its 
three year financial plan and stress-tested it against property price 
deflation and reductions in transaction volumes. In addition, the 
Board has assessed the potential impact from online and hybrid 
agents. As part of this assessment the Directors have taken 
account of the Group’s debt-free position, ability to raise finance, 
strong cash generation and key potential mitigating action of 
restricting dividend payments.
Based on the results of this analysis, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three 
year period of their detailed assessment.

 IT systems
Foxtons business operations are 
dependent on sophisticated IT systems 
which could fail, leading to interruption 
of service or corruption of data.
All key IT systems are closely monitored by internal and external specialist 
teams. Dedicated in-house IT development and maintenance teams exist  
to provide rapid response to IT service issues.
Group disaster recovery plans are in place utilising a physically separate 
location for critical systems.

 People
There is a risk that Foxtons may not  
be able to recruit and retain sufficient 
people to satisfy its organic expansion 
plans. In addition, senior staff may  
be recruited by competitors.
Foxtons structured approach to recruitment using internal specialist  
teams enables us to increase the recruitment of high-quality people  
quickly, should it become necessary to do so. Foxtons continues to  
invest in training, development and succession planning so that  
future leaders can be identified and nurtured.
Our culture of promoting from within generates significant staff  
loyalty within senior and mid-management employees.

guidelines for dealing with gifts, hospitality, corruption, fraud  
and the use of inside information.

Group. Employee engagement is achieved through a variety of 
means, including regular briefings and team meetings.

Whistle-blowing 
Details of the Company’s whistle-blowing procedures are included 
in the governance section on page 36.
Supporting our local communities 
We have a responsibility to the communities in which we operate. 
We are actively involved in supporting local communities, schools 
and charities. We believe this type of engagement offers not only 
social benefits, but benefits to our people too. In addition to our 
regular commitments, 2015 saw Foxtons proudly launch two new 
long-term charity partnerships:
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
We are committed to operating our business in an ethical and responsible manner. As such,  
looking after the communities and environments in which we operate through our Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) strategy is an integral part of our Company ethos and plays a major role in leading 
our people and operations.
Commitment to integrity  
and community
Making the Leap (MTL) – Training and education is a core 
element of Foxtons strategy and we wanted to share our 
expertise and knowledge by contributing towards education 
within the local community. MTL is a charity aimed at 
raising aspirations of disadvantaged school students  
and young adults by providing a range of educational 
programmes. Supporting the invaluable work that MTL  
does, Foxtons hosts and delivers regular training and 
interview coaching sessions to help give young people  
the head start that they deserve.
London’s Air Ambulance (LAA) – LAA is Foxtons first 
long-term official corporate partnership with a three year 
commitment following the charity’s campaign to acquire 
and sustain a much-needed second helicopter to reach 
patients across Greater London. In addition to sponsorship 
commitments, the partnership is supported by numerous 
employee fundraising activities, as well as an extensive 
marketing campaign aimed at increasing public awareness 
for the non-NHS funded charity.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting 
As a service Company our greenhouse gas emissions are minimal. 
Full disclosure is given below. We have targeted to reduce  
our emissions per employee by focusing on efficiencies in the 
Company. In particular, we aim to increase the efficiency of  
our car fleet, which is a major element of our CO

 emissions. 
This is our third carbon footprint emissions report and it has been 
prepared in full accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol 
(GHG), the most widely used international carbon calculation 
methodology. Foxtons uses operational control to establish the 
organisational boundary of its carbon reporting, which includes  
all the sites and vehicles owned and leased by Foxtons. 
The GHG statement opposite is based on Foxtons Group plc 
greenhouse gas emissions from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 
2015. It gives a summary of emissions from fuel consumption  
and the operation of our facilities (scope 1) and from purchased 
electricity (scope 2), both of which are mandatory.

Managing our environmental impact
As a rapidly expanding business we are committed to finding ways of reducing our environmental impact and endeavour to be a 
considerate member of our local communities, as well as looking at the bigger picture.
We ensure that all of our estate agency branches’ lighting is low energy and voltage or LED, and that lights are only in use during office 
hours and for maintenance purposes. We are constantly reviewing new technology to improve our energy efficiency. We also only stock 
Belu as our bottled water of choice, with 100% of profits donated to WaterAid.
As a business we actively encourage a paperless environment, but where this is not possible all our offices are equipped with recycling 
facilities to reduce our consumptive waste.

CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION
Dear Shareholders, 
I am pleased to introduce the 2015 Corporate Governance  
Report on behalf of the Board. This review and the reports of the 
Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees that follow 
summarise the Board’s activities during the year. 
The Board remains committed to promoting the highest  
standards of corporate governance as we believe this supports  
the achievement of the Group’s strategy and also creates and 
preserves value for Shareholders. 
Risk
The Board is accountable for the Company’s success and is 
responsible for setting strategy, monitoring delivery of the 
Company’s strategic objectives and managing risk. In 2014 the  
UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) was revised to 
include a particular focus on how risk is governed and managed. 
For the first time this year the Board is required to publish a 
viability statement. In preparing to make the statement the Board, 
in conjunction with the Audit Committee, has reviewed the 
Company’s risk culture and risk appetite to ensure that risk and 
strategy are appropriately aligned. We have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Company, including 
those that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity. Details of the principal risks and how they 
are mitigated, together with further information on our risk 
management, risk culture and appetite is provided in the Principal 
Risks section on pages 22 to 25. We will continue to monitor  
the Company’s risk management system, principal risks and 
mitigations on an ongoing basis through the Audit Committee  
and Board in 2016.
Due to the size of Foxtons and the centralised nature of its 
operations, the Board does not consider it necessary for the 
Company to have an internal audit function. However, we will 
obtain independent assurance on key areas from time to time,  
as appropriate. During the year the Board agreed that an 
independent assurance audit of the Company’s IT control 
environment should be undertaken, in addition to the regular 
external security testing arrangements that the Company 
commissions. The Company’s auditor, Deloitte, was asked to 
perform the review, which was completed prior to the year end. 
Further information is given in the Audit Committee Report but 
we were pleased to note that no areas of high risk were identified. 
An appropriate plan will be implemented to address 
recommendations made.
Values
It is important for any company to have corporate values that 
underpin its behaviour and actions. During the year, the Company’s 
values – integrity, innovation and transparency – were articulated 
and are being reinforced throughout the organisation. We believe 
that it is important that the tone is set from the top, that the 
Company operates to the highest ethical standards and is open and 
honest in all dealings with customers, partners and stakeholders. 
Board evaluation
In the second half of 2015 we carried out a Board evaluation 
exercise to review the performance of the Board, its Committees 
and individual Directors. This was an internal evaluation facilitated 
by Capita Asset Services, under my direction. The results indicated 
that the Board continues to work well and, whilst there are some 
areas of focus for the Board in the next 12 months, there are  
no significant concerns. More information on the results of the 
evaluation are provided on page 35. In 2016 the Board will be 
undergoing an external evaluation for the first time and I look 
forward to being able to share the findings from that exercise  
with you next year.
Appointment and re-election of Directors
Following the internal performance evaluation of Directors in 
2015, I can confirm that all Directors continue to be effective, 
committed to their roles and have sufficient time available to 
perform their duties. Accordingly, as recommended by the 
Nomination Committee, all Directors will be offering themselves 
for annual re-election at the Company’s Annual General Meeting 
to be held on 18 May 2016, in accordance with the Code. Further 
information on the appointment of Directors can be found on 
page 54 of the Directors’ Report. 
Compliance with the Code
To ensure that it is up to date with evolving governance 
requirements and best practice, the Board regularly receives 
updates on changes to corporate governance, the Listing Rules  
and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules.
The remainder of this Report explains in more detail how the 
Company has complied with the principles and provisions of  
the 2014 edition of the Code.

Board governance
Overview
This Report explains the key features of the Company’s 
governance structure and how it complies with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”), published by the Financial 
Reporting Council in September 2014. The Report, which 
highlights areas of focus during the year, also includes items 
required by the Disclosure and Transparency Rules. The Code  
is available on the Financial Reporting Council website at  
www.frc.org.uk.
The disclosures in this Report relate to our responsibilities for 
preparing the Annual Report (including compliance with the Code 
as required), our report on the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems, and the functioning  
of our Board Committees.
Compliance with the Code
The Company adheres to the principles of the Code and has 
complied with all the provisions throughout the year, except  
in respect of part of E.1.1. relating to the Senior Independent 
Director (“SID”) attending meetings with a range of major 
Shareholders. The Board believes that there were appropriate 
mechanisms in place during the year for the Board to understand 
the views of major Shareholders and to communicate with them. 
The SID is available to meet with Shareholders if requested and 
would instigate such meetings if she became aware of issues or 
concerns through the procedures in place. The Board believes this 
is consistent with the main principle of the Code on dialogue  
with Shareholders. 
The role of the Board and division of responsibilities
The Board is responsible for the effective oversight of the 
Company and agrees the strategic direction and governance 
structure that will help to achieve the long-term success of the 
Company and deliver Shareholder value. The Board comprises  
the Non-Executive Chairman, three independent Non-Executive 
Directors, one non-independent Non-Executive Director and  
two Executive Directors. A list of the Directors, with brief 
biographical details, is provided on pages 30 to 31. There is  
a separation of responsibilities between the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive Officer which is set out in writing. Coupled with 
the schedule of reserved matters described below, this division  
of responsibilities ensures that no individual has unfettered  
powers of decision-making.

• provide a broad range of skills and experience to the Board  
to assist in formulating the Company’s strategy; and 
• provide constructive challenge and support to the  
Executive Directors.
All of the Non-Executive Directors, except for Michael Brown,  
are regarded by the Company as independent Non-Executive 
Directors within the meaning defined in the Code and are free

The Board and its Committees
A number of key decisions and matters are reserved for the 
Board’s approval and are not delegated to management or any  
of its Committees, though it may consider recommendations  
from them. These include matters relating to the Group’s strategy, 
approval of acquisitions, capital expenditure, financial results and 
overseeing the Group’s systems of internal control, governance 
and risk management. 
Each year, the Board meets to set annual objectives for the 
business in line with the current Group strategy. The Board 
monitors the achievement of the Company’s objectives through 
monthly Board reports which include updates from the Group 
Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other key 
personnel. The Board has a rolling agenda of items that are 
regularly considered by the Board and this agenda is continually 
updated to include any topical matters that arise.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015 34
The Board delegates specific responsibilities to Committees so that the Board can operate effectively and efficiently and give the right 
level of attention and consideration to relevant matters. The Board has established the following Committees: Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration. A report from each Committee is set out on pages 37 to 53. The role and responsibilities of each Board Committee are 
set out in formal Terms of Reference which are determined by the Board and the Chairman ensures that the very significant work of the 
Committees feeds into, and is influenced by, the full Board. The Chair of each Committee reports to the Board after each Committee 
meeting on the matters discussed and minutes of each meeting are provided to the Board for information as appropriate. The terms  
of reference of the Committees are available at www.foxtonsgroup.co.uk.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT continued
The key agenda items discussed by the Board during the year included: 35 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Directors’ contracts
All of the Directors have service agreements or letters of 
appointment which are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office during normal business hours. The details of  
their terms are also set out in the Remuneration Report. No  
other contract with the Company or any subsidiary undertaking  
of the Company in which any Director was materially interested 
subsisted during or at the end of the financial year.
Directors’ induction and professional development
The Company has in place an induction programme, led by  
the Chairman and the Company Secretary, for new Directors  
to provide them with a full, formal and tailored introduction  
on joining the Board, which ensures that they attain sufficient 
knowledge of the Company to discharge their responsibilities 
effectively. The programme includes meeting with senior 
management and advisers and visits to the Group’s operational 
locations. The Board calendar is planned to ensure that Directors 
are briefed on a wide range of topics, including updates on 
Corporate Governance and regulatory matters.
Directors are also given the opportunity to visit the Group’s 
branches and discuss aspects of the business with employees.  
As well as internal briefings, Directors also attend appropriate 
external seminars and briefings. 
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary, who is responsible to the Board for ensuring 
the Board procedures are complied with and that Directors have 
access to independent and professional advice at the Company’s 
expense, where they judge this to be necessary to discharge their 
responsibilities as Directors. 
Directors’ conflicts of interest
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations in which they 
have or may have interests that conflict with those of the 
Company, unless that conflict is first authorised by the Directors. 
This includes potential conflicts that may arise when a Director 
takes up a position with another company. The Company’s  
Articles of Association allow the Board to authorise such potential 
conflicts, and there is in place a procedure to deal with any actual 
or potential conflict of interest. Should a Director become aware 
that they, or their connected parties, have an interest in an existing 
or proposed transaction with the Company, they should notify the 
Board. The Board deals with each appointment on its individual 
merit and takes into consideration all the relevant circumstances. 
Board evaluation and effectiveness
An internal evaluation of the performance of the Board, its 
Committees and the Chairman was carried out during the year 
and the process of evaluating the performance was undertaken  
by Capita Asset Services under the direction of the Chairman.
A tailored, high-level questionnaire was distributed for the 
Directors to complete. This was structured to provide Directors 
with an opportunity to express their views about:
• The performance of the Board and its Committees, including 
how the Directors work together as a whole;
• The balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge 
of the Directors; and
• Individual performance and whether each Director continues  
to make an effective contribution.
The responses to the evaluation of the Board and its Committees 
were reviewed with the Chairman and then considered by the 
Board. Separate meetings were also held between the Chairman 
and individual Directors to discuss the Board’s effectiveness and 
individual performance. The results of the evaluation indicated 
that the Board continues to work well and there are no significant 
concerns among the Directors about its effectiveness. It was 
agreed that the following were key areas of focus for the Board  
in 2016:
• Continue to develop the talent pipeline and increase diversity;
• Continue to review succession planning within the  
Executive Team;
• Make enhancements to the risk reporting to the Audit 
Committee and Board;
• Senior management to meet with and present to the Board  
on a more regular basis; and
• Revisit the format of the annual strategy session and adapt  
it to ensure more time for presentation and debate.
The results of the evaluation of the Chairman’s performance  
were considered by the SID and the Non-Executive Directors  
and were discussed between the SID and the Chairman. 
In accordance with the Code, the Board will be undertaking  
an externally facilitated evaluation in 2016.

Accountability and audit
Financial reporting
The Group has in place a comprehensive financial review cycle, 
which includes a detailed annual financial planning process where 
budgets are prepared for approval by the Board. The Group uses a 
number of KPIs to measure both operational and financial activity 
within the business. Depending on the measure, these are 
reported and reviewed on a weekly or monthly basis. In addition, 
management receives a weekly and monthly pack of indicators 
which are the basis of regular operational meetings, where 
corrective action is taken if necessary. At a Group level, a 
well-developed comprehensive management accounts pack, 
including income statements, balance sheets, cash flow 
statements as well as key ratios, is reviewed monthly by 
management and at Board meetings. A re-forecast of the current 
year numbers is carried out quarterly. Management monitors the 
publication of new reporting standards and reports on any updates 
to the Board.
Risk management and internal controls
The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, keeps under review 
the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal 
control systems to ensure that controls in place are effective in 
order to safeguard Shareholders’ investments and the Group’s 
assets. Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
In 2015 a number of activities were undertaken to enhance  
and further develop the Group’s risk management and internal 
control systems. These included implementation of a standard 
methodology for risk assessment across the Group to assist with 
monitoring gross and residual risk and comparing residual risk 
against the Board’s appetite for risk. As required by the Code,  
the Board has carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Company, including those that could threaten  
its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.  
This is more fully described in the Risk Management section  
on pages 22 to 25.
The Group has the following key procedures in place to provide 
effective internal control:
• an ongoing process to identify, evaluate and manage significant 
risks, which is monitored and regularly reviewed by the 
Executive Team with significant issues presented to the  
Board and Audit Committee; 
• the Group’s Compliance department continuously reviews 
operations to ensure that transactions have been properly 
authorised and procedures are adhered to across the Group;
• the Group’s controls include appropriate segregation of duties 
and are fully documented and embedded within the organisation;
• the Audit Committee reviews fraud, anti-bribery and  
whistle-blowing policy and procedures and considers  
any whistle-blowing incidents; and
• the Group has in place a system for planning, reporting and 
reviewing financial performance, including performance against 
strategy and the business plan as described under the Financial 
Reporting above.
In 2015 the Audit Committee also commissioned, at the Board’s 
request, an independent review of IT system controls to provide 
additional assurance in this area. More detail on this is provided  
in the Audit Committee Report on page 38.
On the basis of the above procedures and the monitoring 
processes employed, and having regard to the “Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business 
Reporting” issued by the Financial Reporting Council in September 
2014, the Board, advised by the Audit Committee, has concluded 
that the systems of internal controls within the Group are 
effective. No significant control failings or weaknesses were 
identified during the period under review.
The Directors confirm that the processes described above have 
been in place during the 2015 financial year and up to the date  
of the approval of this Annual Report and Accounts.
Whistle-blowing
The Group believes that it is important to have a culture of 
openness and accountability in order to prevent situations relating 
to possible impropriety, financial or otherwise, from occurring or  
to address them when they do occur. The Company’s independent 
whistle-blowing hotline continues to be in operation and reports 
are provided to the Audit Committee on any material matters 
reported to the independent whistle-blower hotline. 
Fair, balanced and understandable
The Group has a comprehensive and thorough assurance process 
in respect of the preparation, verification and approval of periodic 
financial reports. The process involves:
• The involvement of qualified and appropriately experienced 
staff, under the direction of the CFO;
• A comprehensive review and verification process which deals 
with the factual content of the reports and ensures consistency 
across various sections;
• A common understanding amongst senior staff which ensures 
consistency and overall balance;
• A transparent process to ensure full disclosure of information 
to the external auditors; 
• Engagement of a professional and experienced firm of  
external auditors who understand the Foxtons business  
and business model; and
• Oversight by the Audit Committee which, among other  
things, reviews:
• the key accounting judgements and key sources of  
estimation uncertainty;
• the consistency of, and any changes to, significant  
accounting policies and practices;
• significant adjustments arising from the external audit;
• the Company’s statement on risk management and  
internal control; and
• the going concern and viability assumptions.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT continued 37 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015
The process outlined, together with the review and challenge of 
management by the Audit Committee and its recommendation to 
the Board, provides comfort to the Board that the Annual Report 
taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for Shareholders to assess the 
Company’s business model, strategy and performance.
Relations with Shareholders
Responsibility for Shareholder relations rests with the Chairman, 
Chief Executive Officer and Head of Investor Relations. The Board  
receives regular updates at each Board meeting on the views of  
its Shareholders, and the SID is available to meet Shareholders if  
they wish to raise issues separately. The Chairman, Chief Executive 
Officer and Head of Investor Relations also ensure that there is 
effective communication with Shareholders on matters such as 
governance and strategy, and are responsible for ensuring that  
the Board understands the views of major Shareholders.
The Board aims to present a balanced and clear view of the  
Group in communications with Shareholders and believes that 
being transparent in describing how we see the market and  
the prospects for the business is extremely important. We 
communicate with Shareholders in a number of different  
ways. The formal reporting of our full and half year results  
is a combination of presentations, group calls and one-to-one 
meetings. The full and half-year reporting are followed by investor 
meetings in a variety of locations where we have institutional 
Shareholders. We regularly meet with existing and prospective 
Shareholders to update them on our latest performance or to 
introduce them to the Company and periodically arrange a visit  
to the business to give analysts and major Shareholders a better 
understanding of how we manage our business. These visits  
and meetings are principally undertaken by the Chief Executive 
Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Head 
of Investor Relations with any relevant material being uploaded  
to the corporate website to make it available to all Shareholders.
Nomination Committee
Chairman: Garry Watts
Other members: Ian Barlow, Andrew Adcock, Annette Court
Welcome to the Company’s Nomination Committee Report  
for 2015. 
Composition, role and responsibilities
The members of the Committee, listed above, comprise all  
the independent Non-Executive Directors, together with the 
Chairman. Their biographies are detailed on pages 30 to 31. 
The main responsibilities of the Committee are to keep under 
review the structure, size and composition (including the skills, 
knowledge, expertise and diversity) of the Board and the 
membership of its Committees; to consider succession planning 
for the Board and other senior executives; and to assist with the 
selection process for the appointment of new Directors, both 
Executive and Non-Executive, including the Chairman. 
Main activities
The Committee met three times during the year with all the 
members attending.
The Committee met early in the year to discuss the  
structure, size and composition of the Board, the annual time 
commitments required of the Non-Executive Directors, and  
the recommendation to be made to Shareholders regarding  
the re-election of the Directors at the Annual General Meeting.  
In assessing the independence of the Non-Executive Directors, 
consideration was given to other interests of Directors and the 
findings of the internal Board evaluation conducted towards  
the end of 2014. The Committee concluded that each Director 
continued to demonstrate the necessary skills, experience and 
commitment to contribute effectively and add value to the Board. 
Accordingly, all Directors were recommended for re-election. 
During the year the Committee also met to consider succession 
planning for the Executive Directors and senior management, in 
addition to Foxtons approach to diversity. The Board recognises 
that effective succession planning and the development of 
executive strength within the business is a key driver for the 
long-term success of the Group. The Committee concluded  
that the Group has appropriate succession plans in place for  
senior management and other key personnel, either in terms  
of permanent succession or short-term cover until a permanent 
successor can be identified. Due to the nature of the Company’s 
operations, the size of the Board and the relatively short period  
of time since the Board was constituted, the Committee has not 
considered it necessary to consider a succession plan for the 
Non-Executive Directors. However, the Committee intends to 
review this and the need to refresh the Board membership in  
the next 12 to 18 months. The Directors believe that diversity 
throughout the business is important for the Group, due to the 
diverse nature of the communities that Foxtons operates in and 
the need to relate to its customers. Details of Foxtons diversity 
policy and the diversity of Foxtons workforce are set out on page 
12. The Committee is broadly satisfied with the diversity within 
the business, but aspires to improve it further and will consider 
various options to achieve this goal. In seeking to achieve its 
aspirations, Foxtons always seeks to employ the best candidate  
for the role. 
Annual evaluation of the Nomination Committee’s performance
An evaluation of the performance of the Nomination Committee 
was undertaken during the year and it was concluded that the 
Committee had operated effectively throughout the year.

Role, responsibilities and main activities
The primary function of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities to protect the interests of the 
Shareholders with regard to the integrity of the financial reporting, audit, risk management and internal controls. Since the last  
Audit Committee Report the Committee has held four meetings, with the principal work being:
Role Tasks Jul-2015 Sep-2015 Nov-2015 Feb-2016
Financial 
reporting
Monitoring and reviewing the Group’s accounting policies, 
practices and significant accounting judgements
• • Reviewing the plan and progress for the production of the

Welcome to the Company’s Audit Committee Report for 2015. 
Summary
There were no changes to the Committee members from the previous 
year. Each member is an independent Director and deemed to have 
recent and relevant financial experience with the Chairman, Ian 
Barlow, being a chartered accountant and chartered tax adviser. 
The Committee held four meetings during the year with attendance 
disclosed on page 35.
A schedule of the role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee  
is given below together with the main activities undertaken. 
Of particular note during the year was a review by the Committee of 
two significant changes to the Corporate Governance Code, namely:
• Viability statement – the Committee reviewed the viability 
statement and supporting sensitivity analysis which assessed 
the potential impact of the principal risks on the future 
performance and liquidity of the Group over a three year period.
• Risk management system – the Committee reviewed the risk 
monitoring systems within the Company and the Company’s 
assessment of gross risk and residual risk and compared this 
against the Board’s appetite for risk.
The Committee also initiated an independent report on the IT function 
within Foxtons to provide assurance on the controls in place. The 
review concluded that controls in this area were working well but 
recommended improvements to their governance and formal 
documentation and extending business continuity arrangements from 
IT to an enterprise-wide business continuity management framework. 39 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Role Tasks Jul-2015 Sep-2015 Nov-2015 Feb-2016
Agreeing the policy for approval of non-audit services 
provided by the external auditor – details are on our website:  
www.foxtonsgroup.co.uk
• Reviewing the Company’s policy on the employment  
of former employees of the external auditor
• Receiving the external auditor’s interim review report  
to the Audit Committee, in which there were no issues  
of concern identified
• Internal controls Ensuring compliance with the Code
• Reviewing whether the Company should have an internal audit 
function. It was concluded that this was not required because 
of the simplicity of the Group’s centralised business model 
combined with existing assurance activity in key control areas. 
This will continue to be reviewed annually
• Assessing and advising the Board on internal financial, 
operational and compliance controls
• Reviewing the whistle-blowing policy
• Risk 
management
Reviewing the Company’s risk monitoring systems 
which assess gross risk, mitigating controls and residual risk 
across the Company. Considering the Company’s development 
of a risk appetite and its application to risk management. 
Having considered the analysis, the Committee agreed that it 
was appropriate for the Board to assert in the Annual Report 
and Accounts that the Company’s systems of internal control 
are effective
• • Receiving an independent report on the controls within the  
IT function
• Assessing and advising the Board on the internal financial, 
operational and compliance controls
• Governance processes
The Audit Committee usually invites the full Board, plus the external auditor, to attend each meeting. Other members of management 
attend as and when requested. The Committee held a private session with the external auditor without members of management being 
present at the February 2015, November 2015 and February 2016 meetings. At the end of 2015 it was decided that a private session 
with the external auditor would be held after each Audit Committee meeting.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The Audit Committee reviewed the following judgements, estimates and assumptions made by the Directors in the production of  
the accounts all of which were consistent with prior years, except for the removal of share-based payments as the methodology and 
assumptions used in the calculation are now well established. 
Revenue 
recognition  
in respect of 
lettings 
commission
For lettings commission, as the business has substantially completed all of its obligations at the point of signing the 
contract, with the exception of the administration in respect of the cash collection service, the Group is able to recognise 
the majority of the lettings commission upfront. However, for those leases with break clauses, the Group is required to 
refund any commissions related to the associated period should these break clauses be activated. The Audit Committee 
reviewed management’s methodology and judgement in assessing the recognition of lettings commission which is based 
on historical average contract lengths, average break clause lengths and average commission rates. The Audit Committee 
concurred with their approach. (See notes 3 and 4 of the financial statements.)
Impairment of 
goodwill and 
intangibles with 
an indefinite life
The Group has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives amounting to £19.2 million and £99 million 
respectively. The Audit Committee considered the impairment review methodology used by management 
including relevant forecasts and discount rates. The Audit Committee concurred with management’s view that  
no impairment was required and that a reasonable change in assumptions would not lead to an impairment.  
(See note 13 of the financial statements.)
Client funds The rationale for not showing client funds in the consolidated statement of financial position was reviewed and 
the Committee concurred with management’s view that, as these funds belong to the client the asset and liability 
should not be recorded in the accounts. (See note 4 of the financial statements.) Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015 40
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT continued
External auditor
The external auditor, Deloitte LLP, has audited the accounts of  
the Group since 2009. The 2015 audit process was led by Claire 
Faulkner, replacing Richard Muschamp who had completed his 
term as partner following the 2014 year end. No tender has been 
conducted since Deloitte’s appointment.
In accordance with the requirements of the Code and recent 
changes to the EU regulatory framework, the Company will ensure 
that the external audit contract is put out to tender at least every 
10 years from the appointment date of the current auditors. There 
are no contractual obligations on the Company which restrict the 
choice of auditor. 
As noted, the Committee has reviewed the effectiveness  
of the external audit process. The Committee did this by:
• Reviewing the proposed external auditor’s plan for the  
2015 audit;
• Discussing the results of the external auditor testing, including 
their views on material accounting issues and key judgements 
and estimates and their audit report;
• Considering the robustness of the audit process;
• Reviewing the quality of people and service provided  
by Deloitte; and
• Confirming the independence and objectivity of Deloitte.
We concluded that we were satisfied with the performance  
and independence of Deloitte LLP as external auditors and 
recommended their reappointment. 
Non-audit services
Total non-audit services provided by Deloitte LLP for the year 
ended 31 December 2015 were £0.1 million (2014: £0.2 million) 
(note 7 on page 71).
The details of our policy are set out on our website  
www.foxtonsgroup.co.uk. In brief, there are certain services 
termed “excluded services” that are not permitted to be provided 
by the external auditor. Excluded services refers to the situation 
where the auditor could audit their own work or work to which 
they have contributed. All permitted non-audit services provided 
by the external auditor are subject to prior approval by the Audit 
Committee. The main engagement under permitted non-audit 
services was that of tax compliance, as the Committee considers 
that the Group benefits from the knowledge and experience of 
Deloitte while maintaining objectivity and independence by the 
tax team being separate from the audit team.
The Committee considers that the policy and processes in  
place with oversight by the Committee enables the Group to 
benefit from the knowledge and experience of Deloitte whilst 
ensuring that the objectivity and independence of the auditors  
is maintained. 
The Committee will keep under review the extent to which 
non-audit services may be provided by the Group’s external 
auditor in light of the new restrictions to be introduced by  
the EU audit legislation which comes into effect in June 2016.
Annual evaluation of the Audit Committee’s performance
An evaluation by the Board of the performance of the Audit 
Committee has been undertaken and concluded that it had 
effectively fulfilled its role.
Ian Barlow
Chairman of the Audit Committee
7 March 2016 41 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015
The successful expansion of the business and the experience 
gained over the last two years makes the CEO very valuable  
to the business, a view the Committee has confirmed by testing 
the external market for top executives with the necessary 
combination of estate agency and PLC experience. Accordingly,  
the Board has concluded that the CEO’s remuneration should  
be increased in the manner described.
2016 annual bonuses for the Executive Directors will be based 
60% on profit (EBITDA), 20% on organic growth (successful 
opening of new branches on time and on budget) and 20%  
on personal/strategic objectives. The Committee believes the 
introduction of an element on personal/strategic objectives  
will help reinforce delivery of annual business priorities. The 
Committee increased the CEO’s maximum bonus opportunity  
for 2016 from 125% to 150% of salary to further strengthen  
the annual performance incentive.
The Committee has incorporated malus and clawback provisions 
into its incentives which will apply for 2016 annual bonuses and 
LTIP awards to be granted in 2016 onwards. It also has in place 
share ownership guidelines of 200% of salary for both Executive 
Directors. Actual shareholdings of the Executive Directors exceed 
these levels.
During 2016, the Committee will be reviewing the Remuneration 
Policy prior to submitting it for formal approval from Shareholders 
at the 2017 AGM. The Committee will consult with major 
Shareholders in advance if significant changes are proposed.
We continue to value all feedback from Shareholders and hope  
to receive your support at the forthcoming AGM.
Andrew Adcock
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
7 March 2016
Annual statement from the 
Remuneration Committee Chairman
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2015, 
which has been prepared in accordance with the relevant 
provisions of the Listing Rules, section 421 of the Companies Act 
2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008  
(as amended). This Report, as per last year, is set out in two parts: 
the Policy Report which was approved by Shareholders at our 
2014 AGM and the Annual Report on Remuneration which will be 
put forward for an advisory Shareholder vote at the 2016 AGM.
The Group performed well in 2015 in challenging market 
conditions. Revenue grew across all business streams enabling the 
Group to report record revenues. In the sales market falling 
volumes in central London were offset by more active markets in 
outer London where the Group has been focusing its continuing 
expansion. Margins remained in excess of 30% with Adjusted 
EBITDA of £46m. The Company continued its growth across 
London by opening seven new branches, bringing the total across 
the network to 58. 
This performance warranted annual bonuses of 51.5% of 
maximum for the Executive Directors.
As a result of a review of remuneration conducted by the 
Committee during the year, the Committee identified a  
need to significantly improve the competitiveness of its CEO 
remuneration. Following consultation with major Shareholders, 
the Committee has made changes to executive remuneration  
for 2016 which are in line with our remuneration objectives and 
within the Shareholder-approved Remuneration Policy. These 
changes are set out below.
The Committee increased the CEO’s salary from £461,250  
to £550,000 (+c.19%), effective from 1 January 2016. The 
Committee recognises that an increase of this magnitude is 
unusual, however after careful consideration and consultation 
with key Shareholders resolved this was the correct decision. 
When the CEO was appointed to the Board in July 2014, his 
remuneration was set at relatively low levels. This was deemed 
acceptable by both the CEO and the Board as he adapted and 
grew into the enlarged role. Since then the CEO has demonstrated 
strong leadership and has handled well the increasing complexity 
and size of the business. Foxtons delivers market-leading 
economies of scale and has cemented its leadership position  
in London estate agency.

• Fixed cash amount paid monthly.
• A number of factors are taken  
into account when setting  
salary, including:
• Scope and responsibilities of role;
• Skills, experience and 
circumstances of individual;
• Appropriate market data; and
• Pay and conditions elsewhere  
in Foxtons.
• Salary levels are typically reviewed 
on an annual basis. 
• Although the Committee does not 
consider it appropriate to set a defined 
maximum limit on pay increases, the 
intention is that ordinarily the Executive 
Directors’ increases will be in line with 
those given to our employees whose pay 
is non-commission based.
• Increases may be made above this  
in certain circumstances, including:
• Progression within the role;
• Increase in scope and responsibility  
of the role; and
• Increase in experience where an 
individual has been recruited on  
a lower salary initially.

• Executive Directors would also  
be able to participate in any 
all-employee share plans on  
the same basis as other eligible 
employees, should such plans be 
implemented by the Company.

Notes to the policy table
The only addition to the policy table from that disclosed in last 
year’s Report is the inclusion of malus and clawback provisions  
on the annual bonus and LTIP awards. 
Discretion
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration 
payments and payments for loss of office (including exercising any 
discretions available to it in connection with such payments) that 
are not in line with the Policy set out above where the terms of 
the payment were agreed:
(i) before the Policy came into effect; or
(ii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director  
of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the 
payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming 
a Director of the Company. 
For these purposes “payments” includes the Committee satisfying 
awards of variable remuneration and an award over shares is 
“agreed” at the time the award is granted.
The Committee will operate the annual bonus and LTIP in 
accordance with the relevant plan rules. The Committee retains 
discretion as to the operation and administration of these plans  
as follows:
Annual bonus
• The Committee may settle an award in shares; and
• The Committee may amend the performance targets  
applying to an award in exceptional circumstances if the new 
performance targets are considered fair and reasonable and  
are neither materially more nor materially less challenging  
than the original performance targets.
LTIP
• The Committee may settle an award in cash;
• The Committee may amend the performance conditions 
applying to an award in exceptional circumstances if the new 
performance conditions are considered fair and reasonable and 
are neither materially more nor materially less challenging than 
the original performance conditions; and
• In the event of a variation of share capital, demerger, special 
dividend, distribution or any other corporate event which may 
affect the current or future value of an award, the Committee 
may adjust the number of shares or the option price. 
Any use of the above discretions would, where relevant, be 
explained in the Annual Report on Remuneration and may, as 
appropriate, be the subject of consultation with the Company’s 
major Shareholders.
Takeover or other corporate event
For LTIP awards, on a takeover or other corporate event, generally 
the performance period will end on the date of the event. The 
Committee will determine the extent to which performance 
conditions have been achieved at this point taking into account 
relevant factors given the shortened period. Such early vesting 
would generally be on a time pro-rata basis. 
Alternatively, in certain circumstances the Committee may allow 
awards to continue in line with the original terms of the LTIP.
The Committee has the discretion to take other action as 
appropriate if other events occur which may have an effect  
on awards.
In the event that all-employee plans are operated, they would be 
expected to vest on a takeover or other corporate event and those 
which have to meet requirements to benefit from tax benefits 
would vest in accordance with those requirements.
Minor changes
The Committee may make minor amendments to the Policy set 
out above (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative 
purposes or to take account of a change in legislation) without 
obtaining Shareholder approval for that amendment.
Performance measures and target setting
The annual bonus is based on both financial and non-financial 
performance measures which are aligned with Foxtons annual 
strategic plan. 
The LTIP is based on a combination of financial and share price 
measures chosen to motivate and reward Directors for the 
successful achievement of long-term sustainable performance  
and to ensure maximum alignment with Shareholders. 
Targets for both incentive plans are set on an annual basis by  
the Committee and take into account a number of internal and 
external reference points including historic performance, internal 
expectations and broker forecasts.

The Committee does not consider it appropriate to set a maximum limit on increases in the fees of the Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors. However, the fees have been and will be set within the aggregate limits set out in the Company’s Articles of Association as 
approved by Shareholders.
Policy for Chairman and Non-Executive Director fees
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Fee levels
To enable Foxtons to attract and 
retain Non-Executive Directors of 
the required calibre by offering 
market competitive fees.
• The Chairman is paid an all-inclusive fee for all  
Board responsibilities.
• Non-Executive Directors receive a basic Board fee.
• Additional fees may be payable for additional Board 
responsibilities such as chairmanship or membership  
of a Committee.
• The Committee reviews the fees paid to the Chairman  
and the Board reviews the fees paid to Non-Executive 
Directors, periodically. The Committee or the Board  
(as the case may be) may increase the fees, and any  
such increases will take into account factors including:
• Scope and responsibility of the role; and
• Appropriate market data.
• No Director plays a role in determining their own remuneration.
• The fee levels for 2015 are as  
set out on page 49.
• The fee levels will be increased  
by 2.5% for 2016.
• These fees are the only element 
of Chairman and Non-Executive 
Director remuneration.
Approach to remuneration on recruitment
Overarching principle
In order to maintain Foxtons competitive advantage, it is 
important that we are able to recruit Directors of the calibre 
required to deliver successfully our strategic priorities.
Recruitment of Executive Directors
When determining the remuneration arrangements of a new 
appointment to the Board (including internal promotions),  
the Committee will seek to apply the following principles:
• Although we operate in a competitive market for talent, we  
are mindful to pay no more than is necessary to attract and 
retain high-quality talent;
• The remuneration package of a new Executive Director will  
be consistent with the policy table set out above. However,  
at recruitment, the Committee would retain the discretion to 
flex the balance between annual and long-term incentives and 
the measures used to assess performance for these elements, 
with the intention that a significant portion would be delivered 
in shares;
• The maximum level of variable remuneration is 350% of salary 
(excluding buy-outs), in line with the policy as set out in the 
table above;
• It may be necessary to “buy-out” remuneration arrangements 
forfeited on leaving a previous employer on appointment. Such 
payments or awards could include cash as well as performance 
and non-performance related share awards, and would be in 
such form as the Committee considers appropriate taking into 
account all relevant factors such as the form, expected value, 
anticipated vesting and timing of the forfeited remuneration. 
The Committee’s intention is that the value awarded would  
be equivalent to the value forfeited;
• An Executive Director may initially be hired on a contract 
requiring 24 months’ notice, which then reduces pro-rata over 
the course of the first year of the contract to 12 months’ notice;
• Appropriate relocation costs and support may be provided; and
• Where an Executive Director is appointed from within the 
organisation, the normal policy of the Company is that any 
legacy arrangements would be honoured in line with the 
original terms and conditions. Similarly, if an Executive Director 
is appointed following Foxtons acquisition of or merger with 
another company, legacy terms and conditions would  
be honoured.
The Committee retains discretion to make appropriate 
remuneration decisions outside the standard Policy to meet  
the individual circumstances of recruitment when:
• An interim appointment is made to fill an Executive Director 
role on a short-term basis; and
• Exceptional circumstances require that the Chairman or a 
Non-Executive Director takes on an executive function on  
a short-term basis.
Recruitment of Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
On the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive 
Director, the fee will normally be consistent with the Policy  
set out above. Where specific cash or share arrangements are 
delivered to the Chairman or Non-Executives, these will not 
include share options or any other performance related elements.
Service contracts
The current service contracts of the CEO and CFO can be 
terminated by not less than 12 months’ and six months’ notice 
respectively given in writing by either party to the contract. 
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued 47 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015
The appointment of the Chairman and each of the Non-Executive 
Directors is for an initial period of three years, which is renewable, 
and is terminable by the Chairman/Non-Executive Director  
(as applicable) or the Company on three months’ notice. No 
contractual payments would be due on termination. 
Policy on payment for loss of office
Where an Executive Director leaves employment, the 
Committee’s approach to determining any payment for loss  
of office will normally be based on the following principles:
• The Committee’s objective is to find an outcome which is in  
the best interests of both Foxtons and its Shareholders, while 
taking into account the specific circumstances of cessation  
of employment;
• The Committee must satisfy any contractual obligations  
agreed with the Executive Director. This is dependent on  
the contractual obligations (i) not being in contradiction with 
the Policy set out in this Report, or (ii) if so, not having been 
entered into on a date later than 27 June 2012, in accordance 
with the relevant legislation; and
• Other than in circumstances where the Company is entitled  
to terminate employment summarily, if the employment of  
an Executive Director is terminated with immediate effect, a 
payment in lieu of notice may be made which would not exceed 
12 months’ base salary for the current CEO and six months’ 
base salary for the current CFO. This payment may be subject 
to mitigation if alternative employment is taken up during  
this period.
The treatment of outstanding incentive awards will be governed by the relevant plan rules as set out in the table below:

• Employing company being

• Any other reason, except

Committee determines.
• The participant will normally retain 
their entitlement to the bonus to the 
extent that the performance targets 
have been met.
• Bonuses will normally be subject to 
time pro-rating to reflect the period in 
employment, although the Committee 
has the discretion to vary this.
• The Committee may determine that 
the bonus payment is calculated and 
made, at their discretion, at cessation 
instead of at the end of the 
performance period.
• All other leavers will forfeit  
their entitlement to an annual 
bonus payment.

• Ill-health, injury or disability.
• Employing company being 
transferred to an entity which

• Transfer of undertaking.
• Any other reason, except  
gross misconduct, as the 
Committee determines.
• Awards will normally vest on a 
time-apportioned basis taking into 
account the achievement of the 
relevant performance conditions  
at the vesting date.
• The vesting date for such awards  
will normally be the original vesting 
date, although the Committee has  
the flexibility to determine that 
awards can vest upon cessation  
of employment.
• On death, the Committee may 
exercise discretion to allow awards  
to vest, as soon as practicable, taking 
into account performance achieved.
• On vesting, shares will be transferred 
to the participant as soon as 
practicable. For options, participants 
will have up to six months from  
the date of vesting to exercise  
their awards.
• Awards will normally lapse in full 
(unless otherwise determined by 
the Committee).
In the event that a buy-out award is made on recruitment, the leaver provisions would be determined at the time of the award. Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015 48
Differences in remuneration policy for Executive Directors compared with other employees
As for our Executive Directors, the remuneration for the majority of our employees is weighted towards variable pay. However, unlike 
our Executive Directors, whose variable pay is linked to a mixture of short-term and long-term Group-wide performance measures, the 
majority of our employees’ remuneration is linked to individual/team performance measured over the shorter term. This is consistent 
with their focus on the selling and letting of properties within particular geographical areas.
During 2015, the Company introduced the Senior Management LTIP to accommodate grants of shares to employees, which are 
normally subject to performance conditions over a three year period. The Company continues to operate within the dilution limits 
approved by Shareholders on IPO of no more than 5% in 10 years for discretionary schemes and 10% for all schemes.
Executive Directors may not participate in the Senior Management LTIP, although awards granted to an individual who subsequently  
is appointed to the Board will continue to vest.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in Foxtons
Although pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Company are taken into account to ensure the relationship between the  
pay of Executive Directors and employees remains appropriate, the Committee does not consult with employees when formulating  
the Remuneration Policy set out in this Report.
Consideration of Shareholder views
The Committee takes an active interest in Shareholder views and these help shape the structure of the Directors’ remuneration 
arrangements at Foxtons. The Committee also monitors published Shareholder guidelines and will incorporate further best practice 
features as appropriate.

Annual Report on Remuneration
Consideration by Directors of matters relating to Directors’ 
remuneration (unaudited)
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for reviewing  
and making recommendations to the Board regarding the 
Remuneration Policy of the Group and for reviewing compliance 
with the Policy. During 2015, the Remuneration Committee 
consisted of the following Directors: Andrew Adcock (Chairman), 
Ian Barlow, Annette Court and Garry Watts. The Committee  
met four times during the year with attendance disclosed  
on page 35.
In addition, the CEO and CFO attended Committee meetings  
to provide valuable input. No individual was present when  
their own remuneration was being discussed.
During 2015, the Remuneration Committee received independent 
advice on executive remuneration from Kepler Associates, a  
brand of Mercer (Kepler). Kepler was appointed in May 2014 as 
independent advisers to the Remuneration Committee following  
a formal tender process. Kepler is a signatory to the Remuneration 
Consultants’ Code of Conduct. Other than in relation to advice on 
remuneration, neither Kepler nor its parent Mercer provided other 
services to the Company. The fees paid to Kepler for advice 
provided to the Remuneration Committee was £71,350.  
The Committee is satisfied that Kepler provides independent 
remuneration advice to the Committee and does not have any 
connections with Foxtons that may impair its independence.
The following section provides details of how our remuneration 
policy was implemented during the financial year ending  
31 December 2015, and how the Committee intends to 
implement the Policy in 2016.
We are committed to maintaining an open and transparent 
dialogue with our Shareholders and hope that the level of 
disclosure we have provided this year will ensure that decisions 
made on remuneration are fully explained, thereby helping us  
to build a positive relationship with our Shareholders. 49 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015

in 2014) and Nic Budden.
2 In 2015, the CEO and CFO were awarded bonuses of 51.5% of maximum, equivalent to 64.4% of salary. In 2014, the CEO and CFO were awarded bonuses of 20%  
of maximum, equivalent to 25% of salary. Further details of the performance criteria, achievement and resulting awards for the 2015 bonus can be found on page 50.
3 “Pension” includes payments in lieu of pension. For 2015, the Executive Directors received contributions of 15% of salary.
4 Remuneration covers only the period since his appointment as a Director. Nic Budden was appointed CEO on 1 July 2014 on a salary of £450,000 p.a. He was  
previously the COO on a salary of £375,000 p.a. His salary, benefits and pension are pro-rated to reflect the period from 1 July 2014 to 31 December 2014.
5 Michael Brown stepped down as CEO on 30 June 2014 and was appointed a Non-Executive Director from 1 July 2014. As a result, he has been included in the single 
figure of total remuneration table twice: as an Executive Director to 30 June 2014, and as a Non-Executive Director from 1 July 2014. Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015 50
Base salary for 2015
As explained in last year’s Annual Report on Remuneration, Nic Budden and Gerard Nieslony’s base salaries were increased by 2.5%  
to £461,250 and £281,875 respectively at the start of January 2015, following a review of their salaries. 
Annual bonus outcomes for 2015 (unaudited)
For the 2015 financial year, the maximum bonus opportunity for Nic Budden and Gerard Nieslony was 125% of salary. Bonuses were

Awards were granted in the form of nil-cost options, which will, subject to the rules of the LTIP, vest following the Committee’s 
determination of the extent to which the performance conditions have been satisfied.
As described in last year’s Annual Report on Remuneration, 2015 LTIP awards may vest based 70% on three year EPS growth and 30% 
on three year relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR). The TSR comparator group is the FTSE 250 (excluding financial services and oil & 
gas companies). We believe EPS is an important measure of the Group’s financial performance and helps reinforce sustainable long-term 
growth. TSR is aligned to Shareholder value creation and is transparent. Details of the performance conditions are set out below:
Basic EPS growth over the  
three year performance period 
(70% of the award)
Relative TSR performance against  
the comparator group over the  
three year performance period

There will be straight-line vesting between these performance points.
Statement of Directors’ shareholding and share interests (audited)
We strongly believe that Directors should have sizeable shareholdings in Foxtons to ensure that they are as closely aligned as possible 
with the Shareholder experience. As such, Executive Directors are required to hold Foxtons shares equal to two times their gross basic 
salary. The shareholdings of the Executive Directors remained unchanged versus prior year. The tables below show the Directors’ share 
ownership as at 31 December 2015:

companies ranked towards the bottom of the FTSE 250. Note that 
this does not represent either the comparator group or the time

Base salary
Following a review by the Committee, Executive Director salaries 
are as follows:
Base salary at
1 January 
2015
1 January 
2016
Nic Budden £461,250 £550,000
Gerard Nieslony £281,875 £288,922
As described earlier, the Committee increased the CEO’s salary 
from £461,250 to £550,000 (+circa19%), effective I January 2016 
for the reasons set out in the Chairman’s introductory statement.
Benefits
For 2016, Executive Directors continue to be provided with a 
company car (or cash equivalent) and will be provided with life 
assurance and private medical insurance.
Annual bonus
As described earlier in the Report, 2016 bonuses are up to 150% 
of salary for the CEO and 125% of salary for the CFO. Bonuses are 
based 60% on Foxtons annual Adjusted EBITDA, 20% on organic 
growth (successful opening of new branches on time and on 
budget) and 20% on personal/strategic objectives.
Adjusted EBITDA continues to be an important measure of annual 
performance. We continue to strive to achieve high levels of 
profitability through our focus on higher-volume, higher-value 
markets combined with the real competitive advantage that our 
business model provides. 
The successful opening of new branches on time and within budget 
is a key lever to the achievement of our ambitious growth plans, 
and is an important component of our annual bonus plan with  
a 20% weighting. We have a proven track record of expansion  
and the successful opening of new branches continues to create 
significant opportunities for the Group. The remaining 20% will  
be based on the achievement of personal/strategic objectives  
to help reinforce achievement of annual business priorities.
Shareholders will recognise that we operate in a very competitive 
market and so we will not be disclosing prospective bonus 
performance targets for reasons of commercial sensitivity. We 
will, however, provide a full retrospective rationale each year of 
why bonuses were paid to ensure that Shareholders can clearly 
identify the close link between pay and performance at the Group.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT continued 53 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015
LTIP
The LTIP framework is unchanged for 2016. It is anticipated that 
awards will be up to 150% of salary and will be based 70% on 
Earnings Per Share (EPS) performance and 30% on relative TSR 
measured over a three year performance period. We believe EPS  
is an important measure of the Group’s financial performance 
which helps reinforce sustainable long-term growth. TSR is aligned 
to Shareholder value creation and is transparent. Relative TSR 
performance will continue to be assessed against the FTSE 250 
(excluding financial services and oil & gas companies). 
The Committee reviewed the 2016-18 LTIP cycle to ensure that 
the targets remain stretching and achievable. The Committee 
intends to set 2016 LTIP targets as follows:
Basic EPS
1
 growth  
over the three-year 
performance period 
(70% of the award)
Relative TSR performance 
against the comparator 
group over the three year 
performance period  
(30% of the award)
Threshold  
(25% vesting) 15% Median
Maximum  
(100% vesting) 45% Upper quartile
1 Growth will be measured from EPS adjusted to exclude the deferred tax  
credit relating to the impact of reduced corporation tax rates on the intangible 
brand asset. 
There will be straight-line vesting between these performance points.
Pension
For 2016 pension contributions are unchanged. Contributions  
of 15% of salary will be made to the Executive Directors’ personal 
pension schemes. Alternatively, a cash allowance equal to this value 
may be paid.
Non-Executive Director fees
For 2016, the fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors 
were increased as follows: 
Chairman of Company +2.5%
Basic fee for other Non-Executive Directors +2.5%

managed by the Board, which may exercise all the powers of  
the Company, subject to any limitations imposed by applicable 
legislation or the Articles. The general powers of the Directors are 
also limited by any directions given by special resolution of the 
Shareholders of the Company which are applicable on the date

liability insurance.
Compensation for loss of office
The Company does not have arrangements with any Director that 
would provide compensation for loss of office or employment

the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 41 to 53.

Employee involvement and policy regarding disabled persons
The Group provides employees with information on the  
Group’s performance and on matters concerning them on a 
regular basis. Considerable value is placed on the involvement  
of employees, which is reflected in the principles of Foxtons 
Corporate Practice and its related guidance, which require  
regular, open, fair and respectful communication, zero tolerance 
for human rights violations, fair remuneration and, above all,  
a safe working environment.
Foxtons operates an equal opportunities policy that aims to  
treat individuals fairly and not to discriminate on the basis of sex, 
race, ethnic origin, disability or any other basis. The Company’s 
policy and procedures are designed to provide for full and fair 
consideration and selection of disabled applicants, to ensure  
they are properly trained to perform safely and effectively and  
to provide career opportunities that allow them to fulfil their 
potential. Where an employee becomes disabled in the course of 
their employment the Company will actively seek to retain them 
wherever possible by making adjustments to their work content 
and environment or by retraining them to undertake new roles. 55 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Rights and obligations attaching to shares
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends (when 
declared) and a copy of the Company’s Annual Report, attend  
and speak at general meetings of the Company, appoint proxies 
and exercise voting rights. At any general meeting, on a show of 
hands, every Shareholder present shall have one vote and, on a 
poll, every Shareholder present in person or by proxy shall have 
one vote for every share of which they are the holder. Subject  
to certain thresholds being met, holders of ordinary shares may 
requisition the Board to convene a general meeting or propose 
resolutions at AGMs. On liquidation, holders of ordinary shares 
may share in the assets of the Company. 
None of the ordinary shares carry any special rights with regard  
to control of the Company and there are no restrictions on voting 
rights. Major Shareholders have the same voting rights per share 
as all other Shareholders. The Company is not aware of any 
arrangements under which financial rights are held by a person 
other than the holder of the shares.
The Foxtons Group Employee Benefit Trust is an Employee Benefit 
Trust which holds ordinary shares in the Company in trust for 
employees within the Group. The Trustee of the Trust has the 
power to exercise the rights and powers incidental to, and to  
act in relation to, the ordinary shares subject to the Trust in  
such manner as the Trustee in its absolute discretion thinks fit. 
The Trustee of the Employee Benefit Trust has waived its rights 
to dividends on ordinary shares held by the Trust as these have 
not yet vested unconditionally in employees.
Share capital
Further details of the Company’s issued share capital can  
be found in note 21 to the financial statements on page 82.
Restrictions on transfers of securities
Other than the compliance with the Company’s Share Dealing

Shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer  
of securities or voting rights.

at the 2015 Annual General Meeting to allot shares up to 33.33% 
of the Company’s issued share capital as at 2 April 2015. The 
Company also received authority to allot shares for cash on a  
non pre-emptive basis up to 5% of the Company’s issued share 
capital as at 2 April 2015. As at the date of this Report, no shares

DIRECTORS’ REPORT continued
Authority for the Company to purchase its own shares
The Company was granted authority by its Shareholders at the 
2015 AGM to purchase up to 28,217,646 of its ordinary shares, 
being 10% of the issued share capital as at 2 April 2015. This 
authority will expire at the conclusion of the 2016 AGM. A 
resolution will be proposed at the 2016 AGM that the Company 
be authorised to purchase up to approximately 10% of its 
ordinary shares at the Directors’ discretion. If the resolution  
is passed, the new authority will replace the existing authority  
and will lapse at the conclusion of the 2017 AGM.
Share buy-back programme
On 16 December 2015, the Company announced its intention  
to commence a share purchase programme, utilising its general 
authority to make on-market purchases of shares pursuant to  
the policy of returning surplus cash to Shareholders. Of the 10% 
authority given by Shareholders at the 2015 AGM (28,217,646 
ordinary shares), a total of 510,283 ordinary shares of £0.01 each 
were purchased for cancellation during the year with a nominal 
value of £5,103, being 0.18% of the issued ordinary share  
capital at 31 December 2015. The total consideration for  
these repurchases was £924,273.
Following the year end, the Company has repurchased a further 
6,561,794 ordinary shares for cancellation (as at 7 March 2016), 
with a nominal value of £65,618 and being 2.33% of the  
issued ordinary share capital at 31 December 2015. The total 
consideration for these repurchases was £11,075,726. At  
7 March 2016, there were 275,104,391 ordinary shares of  
£0.01 each in issue. Each ordinary share carries one vote, 
therefore, the total votes in issue were 275,104,391.
Significant agreements
The Company is not a party to any significant agreements that 
would take effect, alter or terminate on a change of control of  
the Company.

Going concern 
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity

Furthermore, note 26, page 85 to the consolidated financial 
statements includes the Group’s objectives and policies for 
managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, 
details of its financial instruments and its exposure to credit  
and liquidity risk.
The Directors believe the Group is in a strong financial position 
due to its profitable operations and strong cash generation and 
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operation 
for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.  
The Directors have made this assessment after consideration of 
the Company’s budgeted cash flows and related assumptions and 
in accordance with the Guidance on Risk Management, Internal 
Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting published  
by the UK Financial Reporting Council in September 2014.
Statement on disclosure to auditor
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval  
of this Annual Report confirms that:
(a)  So far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
(b)  The Director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to  
have taken as a Director in order to make himself/herself 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish  
that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office 
as auditors and a resolution to reappoint them will be proposed  
at the forthcoming AGM.
AGM
The Company’s AGM will take place on 18 May 2016 at the 
Company’s registered office at Building One, Chiswick Park,

AGM accompanies this Annual Report and can also be found on 
the Company’s website at www.foxtonsgroup.co.uk.
The AGM is the Company’s principal forum for communication 
with Shareholders. The Chairman of the Board and the Chairmen 
of the Committees, together with the other Directors, will be 
available to answer Shareholders’ questions at the meeting.

Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable  
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the  
IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with Financial Reporting 
Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. Under Company 
law the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for  
that period.
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are  
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced 
Disclosure Framework has been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a  
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable  
users to understand the impact of particular transactions,  
other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position 
and financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair  
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or  
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole;
• the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face; and
• the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a  
whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide  
the information necessary for Shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
This responsibility statement was approved by the Board of 
Directors on 7 March 2016 and is signed on its behalf by:

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
64 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015 
1. General information 
Foxtons Group plc (the “Company”) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act. The address of the 
Company’s registered office is Building One, Chiswick Park, 566 Chiswick High Road, London W4 5BE. The principal activity of the 
Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) is the provision of services to the residential property market in the UK. 
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which  
the Group operates.  
2. Adoption of new and revised standards 
The Group has adopted the following standards and interpretations during the current year, which had no significant effect on the 
Group’s results: 
IAS 19 (amended) 
Annual Improvements to IFRSs 
Annual Improvements to IFRSs 
Employee Benefits 
(2010 – 2012) Cycle 
(2011 – 2013) Cycle 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied  
in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU): 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
IFRS 14 Regulator Deferral Accounts 
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
IFRS 16 Leases 
IAS 19 (amended) 
Annual Improvements to IFRSs 
Employee Benefits 
(2012 – 2014) Cycle 
The Directors of the Company (the “Directors”) expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will not have a material impact 
on the financial statements of the Group in future periods, with the exception of: 
• IFRS 9 – will impact both the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments 
• IFRS 15 – may impact Group revenue and additional disclosure will be required 
• IFRS 16 – is expected to impact the Group consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement  
of financial position 
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed 
review has been completed. 
3. Significant accounting policies 
Compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the 
European Union (“EU”) and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. IFRS includes the 
standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) including International Accounting 
Standards (“IAS”) and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”). 
The accounting policies set out below have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2014 
and 2015, with the exception of note 2. 
Basis of preparation 
These financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the 
consideration given in exchange for the assets.  
   65 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015
 
  Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015 65 
3. Significant accounting policies (continued) 
Basis of consolidation 
The financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) 
made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power over the investee; is exposed, or has rights, 
to variable return from its involvement with the investee; and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. 
Going concern 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future, having considered the Group forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible 
changes in trading performance and the current economic uncertainty. Accordingly, they have adopted the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Directors’ Report on page 56. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). Goodwill 
is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and 
the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over the net of the acquisition-date fair value of the 
identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. 
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated 
to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (“CGUs”) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. CGUs to which 
goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be 
impaired. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to 
reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the 
carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. 
Other intangible assets 
Intangible assets other than goodwill that are acquired by the Group, representing the acquired Foxtons brand name and purchased 
contracts, are stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. The brand name is considered to have an indefinite economic life 
because of the institutional nature of the brand name, its proven ability to maintain market leadership and profitable operations over 
long periods of time, and the Group’s commitment to develop and enhance its value. The carrying value of the brand is subject to an 
annual impairment review, and adjusted to its recoverable amount if required. Purchased contracts are amortised on a straight-line  
basis over their estimated useful economic lives of five years. 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for services 
provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts (if any) and VAT. Revenue is generated from the Group’s operations  
which are wholly based in the UK. 
Rendering of services 
Commission earned on sales of residential property is recognised on exchange of contract. 
In connection with lettings, the Group offers the following services:  
(1) Securing the letting for the landlord including rent collection; and 
(2) Managing the letting on behalf of the landlord.  
Commissions earned on the above services are recognised as follows:  
(1) Commissions on securing the letting are recognised immediately subject to the following: 
(a) a percentage of contracts have break clauses and may require a refund if the tenant breaks early for which the Group recognise 
an estimated lettings refund liability (see note 19) based upon the historical experience of commission repayments over the last 
12 months; and 
(b) a deferral of revenue in recognition that the Group is contracted to provide a rent collection service for the estimated duration of 
the outstanding tenancies and the related revenue associated with the service is recognised on a straight-line basis over that period. 
(2) The management fee is billed and recognised monthly at a fixed percentage of the monthly rental.  
Commission earned on financial services is recognised when insurance policies go on risk and when mortgage contracts complete. 
Income from other services is recognised in the period or periods when the services are provided. Commission is recognised at fair value 
which takes account of expected future cancellations.  Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015 66
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 
66 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015 
3. Significant accounting policies (continued) 
Interest income  
The Group deposits its cash with reputable financial institutions. Interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic 
benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by 
reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable. The Group earns interest income on own funds  
which is shown as finance income. It also earns interest on client funds which is included within Lettings revenue. See note 28.  
Operating leases 
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. In the event 
that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. The aggregate benefit of 
incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis. 
Exceptional items 
As permitted by IAS 1: Presentation and Disclosure, certain items are presented separately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income as exceptional where, in the judgement of the Directors, they need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their nature, size or 
incidence in order to obtain a clear and consistent presentation of the Group’s underlying business performance. No exceptional items  
were present in the year ended 31 December 2015 or 2014. 
Taxation 
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
Current tax 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items 
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s current tax liability is calculated at the statutory rate for the period which in the year 
ended 31 December 2015 is a blended rate of 20.25% (2014: 21.5%). 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet 
liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit 
nor the accounting profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments except where the Group is able to control 
the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and amended to the extent that it is probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised 
based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or 
credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case  
the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. 
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets (other than land and assets under construction) less their residual values 
over their useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: 
Leasehold improvements Over the term of the lease 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment Between 20% and 25% straight-line 
Motor vehicles 25% straight-line  67 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015
 
  Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015 67 
3. Significant accounting policies (continued) 
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect  
of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis. 
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or scrappage of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
Capitalisation of expenditure on new branches totalled £5,537k (2014: £5,042k) and is reflected in leasehold improvements £3,852k 
(2014: £4,341k) and fixtures, fittings and equipment £1,685k (2014: £701k). Depreciation is charged on assets once the office set up  
is complete. 
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill 
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there  
is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset  
is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for 
impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value  
of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount  
of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position when the Group 
becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Financial assets 
All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of the financial asset is under a contract 
whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned and are initially measured 
at fair value plus transaction costs.  
All financial assets, other than cash and cash equivalents, are classified as loans and receivables. 
Loans and receivables 
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market  
are classified as ‘loans and receivables’. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method,  
less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when  
the recognition of interest would be immaterial. 
Impairment of financial assets 
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where there  
is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the 
estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected.  
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are, in 
addition, assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include  
the Group’s past experience of collecting payments as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that  
correlate with default on receivables. 
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception  
of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable  
is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written  
off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
Financial liabilities and equity 
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the  
contractual arrangement.   Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015 68
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 
68 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015 
3. Significant accounting policies (continued) 
Equity instruments 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.  
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Other financial liabilities  
Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.  
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense 
recognised on an effective yield basis.  
Effective interest method 
The effective interest method is used in calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over  
the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected 
life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition. 
Derecognition of financial liabilities 
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable  
that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance 
sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash 
flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows. 
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable  
is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be  
measured reliably. 
Valuation of share options 
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. The fair 
value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-settled 
share-based transactions are set out in note 29. 
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over  
the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the  
Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting 
conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense 
reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves. 
4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the Directors are required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual 
results may differ from these estimates. 
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods. 
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (which are dealt with separately below), that the 
Directors have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the financial statements. 
   69 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015
 
  Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015 69 
4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued) 
Revenue recognition – Estimate of lettings refund liability 
For those contracts with break clauses, there is judgement involved in determining the appropriate refund liability to be recognised  
in relation to the potentially refundable portion of the commission. Since the Group uses standard terms for its letting contracts, and  
its lettings business is focused in one geographical area (London), management considers its lettings portfolio to be a homogenous 
population and estimates the amount of the commission that will be refunded based upon historical data for all lettings contracts, 
which is considered reliable evidence supporting this judgement. The Group maintains robust data which demonstrates that patterns  
of rental behaviour do not change significantly period by period, and thus the Group believes that historical data is a relatively accurate 
proxy for future trends and circumstances.  
Useful economic life of the brand 
The Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the equity of Foxtons Intermediate Holdings on 30 March 2010. The Directors 
identified one material intangible asset: the Foxtons brand, which was deemed to have an indefinite life as there is no foreseeable limit 
to the period over which the asset is expected to generate cash inflows. 
Client funds 
Client monies and the associated liabilities are not shown on the consolidated balance sheet because the Company treats the monies  
as belonging to clients and not as its own funds. Client monies are held by the Company in specifically designated client accounts and, 
on that basis, the Company expects that, in the event of the Company becoming insolvent, such monies would be ring-fenced and not 
be available to the Company’s creditors as a whole. They are not available for offset against any other account held with the bank. 
Treatment of client monies are subject to Association of Residential Lettings Agency Rules.  
Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial period, are 
discussed below. 
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which 
goodwill has been allocated, and the group of CGUs to which intangible assets (i.e. the Foxtons brand) have been allocated. The value  
in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU and a suitable discount rate in 
order to calculate present value. The carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets at the balance sheet date was £118.7 million. 
There have been no impairments to the value of goodwill and intangible assets. See note 13 for details of the tests for impairment. 
5. Business and geographical segments 
Products and services from which reportable segments derive their revenues 
Management has determined the operating segments based on the monthly management pack reviewed by the Directors, which is  
used to assess both the performance of the business and to allocate resources within the entity. Management has identified that the 
Directors are the chief operating decision-makers in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’. 
The operating and reportable segments of the Group are (i) Sales, (ii) Lettings and (iii) Mortgage Broking. 
The Sales segment generates commission on sales of residential property. The Lettings segment earns fees from the letting and 
management of residential properties and income from interest earned on tenants’ deposits. As these two segments operate out  
of the same premises and share support services, a significant proportion of costs have to be apportioned between the segments.  
The basis of apportionment used is headcount in each segment. 
The Mortgage Broking segment receives commission from the arrangement of mortgages and related products under contracts with 
financial service providers and receives administration fees from clients. 
Income/costs not allocated to an operating segment primarily relate to solicitors’ referral fees and rental of unused office space. 
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies described in note 3. Adjusted EBITDA 
represents the profit before tax for the period earned by each segment before allocation of finance costs, finance income, depreciation, 
amortisation, profit on disposal of fixed assets, share-based payments and exceptional items. This is the measure reported to the 
Directors for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance. 
All revenue for the Group is generated from within the UK and there is no intra-group revenue.

Corporation tax for the year ended 31 December 2015 is calculated at 20.25% (year ended 31 December 2014: 21.5%) of the estimated 
taxable profit for the period.  
On 1 April 2014, the UK corporate tax rate was reduced from 23% to 21%. From 1 April 2015, the UK corporate tax rate fell to 20%. 
There will be a reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 19% from April 2017 and a further reduction to 18% from April 2020. The 
reduction in future corporation tax rates has resulted in a deferred tax credit of £1.97 million primarily relating to the intangible brand asset. 
The deferred tax adjustment in respect of prior periods relates primarily to capital allowances for the prior year for both 2015 and 2014. 
The charge for the period can be reconciled to profit in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as follows:

Goodwill for the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2015 has been allocated to segments as follows: Sales £9,819k, Lettings £9,349k and 
Mortgage Broking (£nil). 
The goodwill and other intangible assets recognised arose on the acquisition of Foxtons Intermediate Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries. 
The recoverable amount of the above has been calculated using value in use determined from cash flow projections from formally approved 
budgets and forecasts covering a three year period for each cash-generating unit (“CGU”). The key assumptions in determining the cash 
flows are expected changes in sales and lettings volumes and direct costs to be incurred during the forecast period. These assumptions  
are based upon a combination of past experience of recently observable trends and expectations of future changes in the market.  
To evaluate the recoverable amount of each CGU or group of CGUs, a terminal value has been assumed after the third year and includes  
a growth rate in the cash flows of 2% (2014: 2%) into perpetuity. The discount rates used reflect the risks specific to the CGUs.  
The brand asset has been tested for impairment by aggregating the value in use amounts computed in the goodwill impairment test  
for each CGU, being the aggregation of Sales and Lettings. This grouping of CGUs represents the lowest level at which management 
monitors the brand internally, and reflects the way in which the brand asset is viewed as relating to the Sales and Lettings segments  
as a whole, rather than being allocated to each segment on an arbitrary basis.  
The calculated value in use for Sales is £352 million (2014: £201 million), for Lettings £277 million (2014: £322 million) and for the 
aggregation of Sales and Lettings is £629 million (2014: £523 million). The pre-tax rate used to discount cash flows from Sales is 10.30% 
(2014: 10.67%), from Lettings is 9.80% (2014: 10.17%) and from the aggregation of Sales and Lettings is 10.05% (2014: 10.42%).  
The headroom taken from the calculation was significant, with Sales at £325 million (2014: £175 million), for Lettings £248 million 
(2014: £295 million) and for the aggregation of Sales and Lettings, £483 million (2014: £379 million). The calculations were flexed for 
reasonable changes in the underlying assumptions which did not indicate the assets should be impaired. There have been no indicators 
of impairment for either goodwill or the brand asset during the periods presented.   Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015 76

Trade receivables disclosed above are classified as loans and receivables and are therefore measured at amortised cost. 
Trade and other receivables are all current and any fair value difference is not material. Trade receivables are considered past due once 
they have passed their contracted due date. 
Amounts invoiced to customers on exchange of sales contract or signing of lettings contract are due immediately, albeit in the case  
of lettings they may be collected over time through initial rental payments received. For sales, the vast majority of our receivables  
are received directly from the conveyancing lawyer working on behalf of the vendor. These processes facilitate the prompt collection  
of receivables. Our negotiators track payment and are incentivised to collect these receivables promptly as commission is based on 
amounts received in cash. Should a debt become 21 days overdue this is referred to our legal department unless there is a valid reason 
to the contrary. Outstanding debts are also monitored by Branch Managers and Area Directors. The finance team liaises closely with  
the legal team and is notified should it be decided that a debt is unlikely to be recovered. The Group has recognised an allowance for 
doubtful debts of 100% against all receivables over 180 days because historical experience has been that receivables which are past due 
beyond 180 days are not recoverable. Allowances against doubtful debts recognised against trade receivables between 30 days and  
180 days are based on estimated irrecoverable amounts when information comes to our attention that a receivable is irrecoverable. 
The Group does not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements over any of its trade receivables nor does it have a legal right  
of offset against any amounts owed by the Group to the counterparty. 
Trade receivables disclosed above include amounts which are past due at the reporting date but against which the Group has not 
recognised an allowance for doubtful receivables as we are not aware of any information to suggest that there has been a significant 
change in credit quality and consequently the amounts are still considered recoverable. 
Trade debtor days at the year end were 27 days (2014: 26 days).

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.

17. Deferred tax 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so. The following is the analysis  
of the deferred tax balances (after offset) for financial reporting purposes: 
2015

2014 
£’000
Deferred tax assets 294 876
Deferred tax liabilities (17,820) (19,800)
 (17,526) (18,924)
Deferred tax liabilities relate to the intangible asset, the Foxtons brand, which has an indefinite life. This deferred tax liability will not 
reverse unless the Foxtons brand is impaired or sold by the Group. The deferred tax credit of £2.0 million in respect of intangible assets 
arose as a result of a reduction in future corporation tax rates. 
The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and 
prior reporting periods.

Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of all tax losses and other temporary differences to the extent that it is probable 
that these assets will be recovered through future taxable profits.  
Tax losses carried forward 
A deferred tax asset totalling £0.2 million has been recognised in relation to tax losses carried forward. This relates to £nil (2014: £0.4 million)  
of unused tax losses in Alexander Hall Associates Limited and £1.2 million (2014: £1.9 million) of unused tax losses in Foxtons Intermediate 
Holdings Limited at 31 December 2015. Foxtons Intermediate Holdings Limited has £40.9 million of unused losses (2014: £41.0 million) for

26. Financial instruments 
Capital risk management 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns whilst maximising the 
return to Shareholders. 
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to Shareholders, undertake 
share buy-backs, return capital to Shareholders, issue new shares or negotiate debt facilities. 
The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves  
and retained earnings.  
A regulated subsidiary of the Group, Alexander Hall Associates Limited, is subject to externally imposed capital requirements. The required 
amount is calculated as 2.5% of the subsidiary’s annual revenue as defined by the Financial Conduct Authority. As at 31 December 2015,  
the threshold was £206k (2014: £153k), for which the entity is in compliance. 
Gearing ratio 
The gearing ratio at each period end is as follows:

Financial risk management objectives 
The Group closely monitors cash requirements to ensure sufficient funds are held for the operations of the Group.  
Interest rate risk management 
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk because entities in the Group earn interest on client deposits (see note 28).  
The Group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section 
of this note. 
   Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015 86
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 
86 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015 
26. Financial instruments (continued) 
Interest rate sensitivity analysis 
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at the 
balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at balance sheet 
date was outstanding for the whole period.  
If interest rates had been 1% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit before tax and total equity  
for the 12 months ended 31 December 2015 would increase/decrease by £1.1 million (year ended 31 December 2014: decrease/increase 
by £0.8 million).  
Credit risk management 
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.  
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers and are monitored on an ongoing basis.  
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar 
characteristics. The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related entities. Concentration of credit  
risk to any counterparty did not exceed 1% of gross monetary assets at any time during the period.  
The credit risk on liquid funds is considered to be limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by 
international credit-rating agencies.  
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Group’s 
maximum exposure to credit risk as no collateral or other credit enhancements are held. 
Client funds (see note 28) are held with three financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating 
agencies. The credit risk of banks cannot be totally eliminated. However, as the funds are client monies there is the additional protection 
of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) under which the government guarantees amounts of up to £75k each. This 
guarantee applies to each individual client’s deposit monies, not the sum total on deposit. 
Liquidity risk management 
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has established an appropriate liquidity 
risk management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management 
requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual  
cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.  
The inclusion of information on non-derivative financial assets is necessary to understand the Group’s liquidity risk management  
as the liquidity is managed on a net asset and liability basis.  
The Group’s non-derivative financial assets and liabilities consist of trade and other receivables, cash and trade and other payables. The 
Group’s expected maturity for its non-derivative financial assets and liabilities is less than one month as trade receivables and payables 
are payable on exchange.

Balances and transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation 
and are not disclosed in this note.  
Remuneration of key management personnel 
The remuneration of the key management personnel of the Group is set out below in aggregate for each of the categories specified in 
IAS 24: Related Party Disclosures. Our definition of key management personnel in the year includes the Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors of Foxtons Group plc and the Chief Operating Officer of Foxtons Limited.

28. Client monies 
At 31 December 2015, client monies (all held by Foxtons Limited) in approved bank and building society accounts amounted to £84.8 million 
(31 December 2014: £82.8 million). Neither this amount nor the matching liabilities to the clients concerned is included in the consolidated 
balance sheet. Foxtons Limited’s terms and conditions provide that interest income on these deposits accrues to the Company. 
Client funds are protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) under which the government guarantees amounts 
up to £75,000 each. This guarantee applies to each individual client’s deposit monies, not the sum total on deposit.

29. Share-based payments 
Equity-settled share option scheme 
The Company has a share option scheme for employees of the Group. The awards have been made in the form of an option with a £nil 
option price. The vesting period is under three years. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant 
the options expire. The treatment of leavers before options vest is determined by good leaver/bad leaver provisions detailed in the plan 
rules as set out in the table on page 47. 
Employer’s NI is being accrued, where applicable, at the rate of 13.8% which management expects to be the prevailing rate at the time 
the options are exercised. The total NI charge for the year was £83,327 (2014: £11,582).  
Details of the share options outstanding during the year are as follows.

The options outstanding at 31 December 2015 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of nine years (2014: 10 years).  
In 2015, options were granted on 16 March 2015. The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted is £2.1 million  
(2014: £2.5 million). The inputs into the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo models are as follows: 
2015 2014
Weighted average share price 190p 221p

Expected volatility 27% 27%
Expected life 2.96 years 2.44 years
Risk-free rate 0.9% 0.5%
Expected dividend yield 4.8% 5.9%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the share price of comparable listed companies over  
the previous three years. This is estimated based on comparable companies in line with IFRS 2 as there was insufficient historical 
information for Foxtons as it listed in September 2013. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s 
best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. 
The Group recognised total expenses of £603k (net of NI) in the year ended 31 December 2015 (2014: £84k) related to equity-settled 
share-based payment transactions. 
A summary of the main features of each scheme is given below.  
Long term incentive plan (LTIP) 
Awards are subject to market and non-market performance conditions and vest over a three year period, with discretion available  
to the Remuneration Committee.  
Senior management long term incentive plan (SLTIP) 
Awards are subject to market and non-market performance conditions and vest over a three year period, with discretion available

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
92 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015 
31. Significant accounting policies 
The accounting policies set out below have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2014 
and 2015. The principal accounting policies and judgements adopted are the same as those set out in notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated 
financial statements except as noted below. 
Basis of preparation 
The Company’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. The Company meets the definition of 
FRS 100 (Financial Reporting Standard 100) issued by the Financial Reporting Council. Accordingly, in the year ended 31 December 2015 
the Company has decided to adopt FRS 101 and has undergone transition from reporting under UK GAAP to FRS 101 as issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council. Accordingly, the financial statements have therefore been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 (Financial 
Reporting Standard 101) ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ as issued by the Financial Reporting Council. This transition is not considered 
to have a material effect on the financial statements. The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis. Historical 
cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets. 
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to 
share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not yet effective 
and related party transactions. 
The Company has applied FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ incorporating the Amendments to FRS 101 issued by the FRC in July 
2015 other than those relating to legal changes and has not applied the amendments made to Company law made by The Companies, 
Partnerships and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2015 that are effective date of accounting periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2016. 
Investments in subsidiary companies 
Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at cost less provisions for impairment. 
Going concern 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future having considered the Company forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible 
changes in trading performance and the current economic uncertainty. Accordingly, they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing 
the financial statements. 
32. Profit for the year 
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own income statement for the 
financial year. The Company’s profit for the year was £28.0 million (2014: £28.5 million).  
The Company has no employees at 31 December 2015 (2014: none).  
The auditor’s remuneration for audit and other services is disclosed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. 
33. Investment in subsidiary undertakings 
Investments in subsidiary undertakings were as follows: 
 £’000
At 1 January 2014 31,200
Capital contribution arising from share-based payments 84
At 31 December 2014 31,284
Capital contribution arising from share-based payments 603
At 31 December 2015 31,887
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, less any provision for impairment. 
The subsidiary undertakings, all of which are wholly owned and included in the consolidated accounts, are shown in note 15 to the 
consolidated financial statements.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF FOXTONS GROUP PLC 
94 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015 
Opinion on financial statements of Foxtons Group plc 
In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at  
31 December 2015 and of the Group’s profit for the period then ended; 
• the consolidated financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union; 
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice, including Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards  
the consolidated financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
The financial statements comprise the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of financial 
position, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the consolidated cash flow statement and the related notes 1 to 30, and the 
parent company balance sheet, parent company statement of changes in equity and the related notes 31 to 35. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements 
is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including 
Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. 
Going concern and the Directors’ assessment of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency  
or liquidity of the Group 
As required by the Listing Rules, we have reviewed the Directors’ statement regarding the appropriateness of the going concern basis of 
accounting contained within note 3 to the financial statements and the Directors’ statement on the longer-term viability of the Group 
contained within the Strategic Report on page 25. 
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to: 
• the Directors’ confirmation on page 36 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity; 
• the disclosures on pages 22 to 25 that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated; 
• the Directors’ statement in note 3 to the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s ability to  
continue to do so over a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements; 
• the Director’s explanation on page 25 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so 
and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the 
group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any 
related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions. 
We agreed with the Directors’ adoption of the going concern basis of accounting and we did not identify any such material 
uncertainties. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the  
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Independence 
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical Standards for Auditors and we confirm that we are 
independent of the Group and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. We also  
confirm we have not provided any of the prohibited non-audit services referred to in those standards. 
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation 
of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team. 
The Audit Committee has requested that, while not currently required under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland),  
we include in our Report any key observations in respect of those assessed risks of material misstatement. 
Risk  
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the risk Key observations 
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets
The Group’s value of goodwill and other intangible 
assets as at 31 December 2015 totalled £118.7 
million, of which £99 million relates to the Foxtons 
brand. In combination, these assets represent 78%  
of the Group’s balance sheet net asset value. 
Assessment of impairment of goodwill and other 
intangible assets is a judgemental process, which 
requires a value in use consideration. Calculating the 
value in use requires estimates of future cash flows 
and associated discount rates and growth rates.  
Further information in this area is discussed in the 
significant accounting policies in note 3, critical 
accounting estimates and judgements in note 4  
and the disclosures in note 13.  
 We have challenged management’s 
key assumptions relating to the 
estimated future cash flows,  
growth rate and the discount rates 
applied through benchmarking  
against comparator businesses,  
our understanding of the future 
prospects of the business, with 
particular focus on assessment of 
forecasts against historical forecast 
accuracy. We have used internal 
valuation specialists to assess the 
appropriateness of the assumptions 
used to calculate the discount rate.  
We have agreed source data for the 
discount rates to third party analysis 
and assessed these assumptions 
against the prevailing Group cost  
of capital.  
We have considered the sensitivities 
performed by management and 
recalculated the headroom available 
under the sensitised positions. 
The evidence we examined supported 
the Directors’ conclusion that there 
are no indicators suggesting that the 
carrying value of the goodwill and 
other intangible assets is impaired. 
Additionally, we have found the key 
assumptions management has used  
to calculate the value in use are 
appropriate and the value in use 
supports the carrying value of the 
goodwill and other intangible assets. 
Revenue recognition in respect of lettings 
commission 
A significant volume of lettings contracts include 
break clauses. The Group recognises revenue from 
lettings commission based on its estimate of the 
period of the tenant’s occupation of the lease.  
This requires management judgement in respect  
of estimating the likelihood of a break clause  
being exercised. Management consider the Group 
lettings portfolio to be homogenous and therefore 
calculate the estimate using historical data for all 
letting contracts. 
A lettings refund liability of £4.2 million has  
been recognised at 31 December 2015.  
Further information in this area is discussed in the 
significant accounting policies in note 3 and critical 
accounting estimates and judgements in note 4. 
 We have tested the controls in  
relation to the lettings business  
cycle and reporting systems used.  
We have challenged management’s 
judgement of the likelihood of  
a break clause being exercised by 
reference to historic average lease 
lengths, including reviewing a  
sample of lettings contracts, to  
assess whether the overall level of 
revenue recognised at the year end 
was within a tolerable threshold. 
We are satisfied that management’s 
assumptions and estimates applied  
in calculating the letting commission 
were appropriate and applied 
consistently. Our testing has not 
identified any instances above  
our clearly trivial threshold of 
inappropriate revenue recognition.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF FOXTONS GROUP PLC continued 
 
96 Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015 
Last year our Report included one other risk which was not included in our Report this year, being the valuation of share options. As 
2014 was the first year the Group had issued share options, this risk was presented in our audit report. In the current year the share 
options are accounted for on a consistent basis and are no longer considered to have had the greatest effect on our audit strategy.  
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the Audit Committee discussed  
on page 38. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
Our application of materiality 
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions 
of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work 
and in evaluating the results of our work. 
We determined materiality for the Group to be £2.05 million (2014: £2.1 million), which is below 5% of profit before tax, and below  
2% of equity. This has been determined with a consistent approach to that used in 2014.  
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £41,000 (2014: £42,000), 
as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit 
Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
An overview of the scope of our audit 
Our Group audit scope covers 100% (2014: 100%) of the Group companies, all of which are UK legal entities with the full scope audit 
procedures performed entirely by the central audit team using a statutory materiality appropriate for each entity which was lower than 
Group materiality and ranged from £0.1 million to £1.9 million. At the parent entity level, we also tested the consolidation process. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and 
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements  
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters. 
Directors’ remuneration 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have not 
been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have nothing to report arising from these matters. 
Corporate Governance Statement 
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.

  Foxtons Annual Report and Accounts 2015 97 
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report 
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the  
Annual Report is: 
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or 
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or 
• otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the 
audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the Annual 
Report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should have been 
disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also comply with 
International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control 
procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards review 
team and independent partner reviews. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we  
have formed. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have  
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors;  
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing  
the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

The company
It has been an exceptionally busy year for the Company,
which floated on AIM in June 2005 successfully raising 
£3 million in a placing which was twice oversubscribed. 
The funds raised have enabled the Group to achieve
significant levels of organic growth during the period under
review as it positions itself as a leading provider of IVAs to
over indebted consumers. 
Strategy 
Significant opportunities exist in our target market to grow
the business organically. This is being underpinned by the
development of third party IVA referral relationships as well
as select acquisitions such as Unique Business Finance Ltd
which add complementary services.
This strategy will continue in the coming year as
Debtmatters consolidates its position as one of the leading
consumer IVA providers and continues to pursue value
adding acquisition opportunities.
Market
The market for our IVA services continues to grow.
Consumer debt in the UK is now running at almost £1.2
trillion, the number of IVAs registered with the DTI doubled
in 2005 and, based on figures available to date for 2006, is
expected to double again. Debtmatters has invested in new
premises, people and processes to ensure we have the
capacity to capitalise on this growth in our core market.
Management and staff
The expansion of our business has only been achieved
through the hard work and dedication of my fellow directors
as well as all our staff. I would like to take this opportunity
to thank them all for their commitment to date and their
ongoing support in the current year. 
I would also like to welcome Mark Prideaux to the Board,
who was recently appointed Group Finance Director
replacing Christine Jarvis who stood down in April 2006.
Together with the increase in the number of our insolvency
practitioners we now have the management and
infrastructure in place to take full advantage of the
significant opportunities that exist for our business.
Outlook
Debtmatters has delivered impressive growth during the
period under review and is well positioned to continue its
momentum. It is the Board's intention to employ additional
insolvency practitioners to underpin the strength of our core
business as well as to develop ancillary services through
select acquisitions. Significant opportunities exist for the
Group and I look forward to updating shareholders with
further progress in due course.

A strong performance
I am pleased to report that Debtmatters has had an
excellent year in which it has doubled its share of the IVA
market to 14% in the first quarter of 2006 while delivering
impressive profit and growth figures.
The Board is focused on accelerating the Company's
growth in the year ahead as we continue to provide
indebted consumers with effective solutions to their debt
problems. Total numbers of IVAs registered with the DTI in
the year ending 2005 exceeded 20,000 up from a total of
10,752 in the year ending 2004. Based on current monthly
run rates there are expected to be in excess of 40,000 IVAs
in the year ending 2006. 
Debtmatters is poised to take full advantage of this growing
market by capitalising on its cost effective marketing
strategies, industry leading IVA processing times and quality
service levels.
Strengthened management 
team and support
I am also pleased to welcome Mark Prideaux to the role of
Group Finance Director. Mark, a Chartered Accountant and
licensed Insolvency Practitioner, has been with Debtmatters
since December 2003 and has been on the Company's
Operations Board since its flotation. He has significant
knowledge of Debtmatters' core IVA business as well as an
in depth knowledge of the wider insolvency market place.
This experience will play a key role as Debtmatters
continues to grow its core IVA business as well as
assessing the opportunities to develop ancillary services. 
In addition, David Rankin was appointed to the Operations
Board as Insolvency Director. David, an experienced
Insolvency Practitioner, has been with the Company since
August 2005 and has played a key role in developing
Debtmatters' systems and processes to support its
significant growth post flotation.
I believe that we now have the management team as well
as supporting functions in place to support our growth
plans going forward. 
Business growth
Building on our successes to date, the Board has made 
a number of strategic investments during the period under
Ges Ratcliffe
Chief Executive Chief executive’s review
PAGE 6|   Chief executive’s review
review to support its future development. This has 
included the acquisition of Unique Business Finance Limited
(“Unique”), which has operated from Preston since 2003
and undertakes all aspects of corporate insolvency and
bankruptcy work. This acquisition has enabled 
Debtmatters to undertake other types of complementary
insolvency work.
Debtmatters also entered into an agreement with an
established money advice organisation for the exclusive
referral of IVAs to Debtmatters. This business, which has a
UK wide client base is currently generating significant
numbers of referrals per month and represents a
partnership that Debtmatters is actively seeking to grow in
the short to medium term. The Board is also looking at
suitable acquisitions which will complement the Group's
business model and broaden the range of services offered.
Marketing strategy
The bulk of Debtmatters’ business comes from our
marketing activities. Our advertising strategy is targeted and
understands the consumer in debt and is therefore highly
effective. This, coupled with detailed analysis of response
rates and aggressive buying, gives us the ability to further
scale our operation, taking advantage of the significant
opportunity for growth in our sector.
As advertising spend has increased so has brand
awareness, improving consumer trust and acceptance of
our proposition. Greater spend through the new financial
year will further strengthen our brand name.
Throughout the past year Debtmatters has been a leader in
the sector in terms of cost per case acquired. Investment in
market research and innovative new advertisements will
enable us to maintain this situation.                
Increasing capacity
In order to support the growth of the business, we have
relocated our operations to a new, modern office at
Middlebrook in Bolton which has significantly increased our
capacity. We also have the capability to scale up our
operation further through securing flexible lease terms with
our landlord.
In addition, we have invested in our networks, telephony
and software systems in order to increase our long term IT
capacity. All of these investments support our growth as
Debtmatters establishes itself as a leading supplier of IVAs
in the UK. 
Key performance indicators
In a year of rapid expansion we are proud to have improved
or maintained many of our key performance indicators. 
At an operational level we enjoy one of the industry's 
fastest turnaround times for cases. This speed and
efficiency impacts favourably on both our conversion rates
and cash flow.
In addition, we are working towards ISO 9001 accreditation
in July. This is the internationally recognised standard for an
organisation's internal Quality Management and we
anticipate that it will enable us to better meet our
customers' needs whilst improving operational efficiency.
Our business at a glance
Debtmatters is a leading solutions provider to consumers
with significant debt problems Chief executive’s review
Chief executive’s review |   PAGE 7
Staff commitment
As Investors in People we are committed to the
professional and personal development of our team. 
Our operations board directors and managers work closely
with their teams to ensure that morale is strong and the
Company has many initiatives which involve staff in the
Company ethos on a personal and professional level.
We enjoy exceptionally low levels of staff turnover and have
been able to absorb a significant increase in numbers
without losing our strong sense of team spirit and identity.
We employ people who are loyal, problem solving and
innovative and as a result make a valuable contribution to
our business.  I would like to thank them all for their
commitment and hard work to date.  
Outlook
Debtmatters continues to deliver strong growth as 
it addresses the significant opportunities that exist within
the IVA market place. We have an efficient business 
model in place, which continues to deliver industry
leading turnaround times and a very effective cost of 
case acquisition. 
In addition to significant organic growth, the Board is
profiling a number of possible acquisitions which would
provide an immediate contribution to the group in terms of
earnings.This strategy, which is part of our longer term
outlook will complement the rapid growth of our core IVA
business and I Iook forward to updating shareholders in
due course.
Ges Ratcliffe
Chief Executive
Mission statement
Our mission is to provide the best possible advice to over
indebted consumers in a sympathetic manner, leading to
permanent solutions to their financial problems,
implemented quickly and effectively.
IVA
An IVA is a legally binding agreement between a debtor
and his/her creditors. Interest and charges are frozen and
affordable monthly payments are made over a period of 
typically five years.
At the end of the period any balances remaining are
written off by the creditors and the individual becomes 
free from debt. Financial review

Trading highlights
Debtmatters has had a very successful maiden year as a
publicly quoted company. Since flotation on AIM in June
2005, at which time the business raised £3m before costs,
the Group has gone from strength to strength. We have
invested in operations, systems and people in order to
support our ongoing growth while at the same time
strengthening our gross margins to 58% up from 53% in
2005. In the period since flotation our staff numbers have
increased from 49 to 155 with our IVA processing
capabilities significantly enhanced by the appointment of a
further 3 Insolvency Practitioners.
Turnover has increased from £2.5m to £7.8m over the
period, an increase of 212% and Profit Before Tax has risen
to £2.8m (£500k, FY 05), an increase of 460%, far in
excess of market forecast expectations. This has been
achieved principally by the growth of the core domestic IVA
business. Approved case numbers have increased
throughout the period. In March 2006, 554 IVA cases were
approved which represents a 329% increase on March
2005 figures. 
The Group ended the financial year with a strong balance
sheet with Net Assets of £4.7m, compared to £0.3m at 31
March 2005. The Group remains focused on pursuing its
strategy of growing the top line while re-investing in the long
term development of the Group.
Trading highlights
In line with this strategy, the acquisition of Unique Business
Finance in October 2005 has broadened the scope of the
insolvency services provided by the Group. In the five
month period since acquisition Unique contributed circa
£450,000 to Group turnover and additional pre tax profit of
£207,873. 
Our marketing strategy has been strengthened by television
advertising which commenced in January 2006. This has
had a significant impact on IVA activity levels while at the
same time reducing overall costs of case acquisition. 
In conclusion, our core market continues to grow. We now
have the infrastructure and support in place to service this
demand and expect strong growth going forward.

an accurate invoice.

purchases outstanding in trade creditors.
Directors responsibilities for 
the preparation of the financial
statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual
Report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice. Company law requires the directors to
prepare financial statements for each financial year which
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
Company and of the Group and of the profit or loss of the
Group for that period. In preparing those financial
statements, the directors are required to:
a. select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
b. make judgements and estimates that are reasonable
and prudent;
c. state whether applicable accounting standards have
been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
d. prepare the financial statements on the going concern
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
Group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any
time the financial position of the Group and to enable them
to ensure that the financial statements comply with the
requirements of the Companies Act 1985. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for ensuring that the directors'
report and other information included in the annual report 
is prepared in accordance with company law in the United
Kingdom. They are also responsible for ensuring that 
the annual report includes information required by the 
AIM Rules.
The directors are also responsible for the maintenance and
integrity of the Debtmatters Group plc website. The work
carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of
these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no
responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to
the information contained in the financial statements since
they were initially presented on the website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation
and dissemination of the financial statements and other
information included in annual reports may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Employee involvement
The Group recognises and seeks to encourage the
involvement of its employees, with the aim being 
the recruitment, motivation and retention of quality
employees throughout the Group. An approved share
option scheme is in place operated within the Enterprise
Management Incentive Scheme, as well as an unapproved
option scheme.
The Group's employment policies, including the
commitment to equal opportunity, are designed to attract,
retain and motivate employees regardless of sex, race,
religion or disability. Equality of treatment includes full and
fair assessment of applications and extends to training and
continuing career development. Directors’ report
Directors’ report |   PAGE 13
The Group is committed to ensuring and communicating
the requirements for a safe and healthy working
environment for all employees, consistent with health 
and safety legislation and, wherever practicable, gives 
full consideration to applications for employment from
disabled persons.
Charitable and political
contributions
The Group made charitable donations of £1,199 in the
period to 31 March 2006 (2005: Nil). No political donations
were made in either period.
Awareness of relevant 
audit information
At the date of approval, so far as each of the directors’ is
concerned, there is no relevant audit information of which
the auditors are unaware, and they have taken all the
necessary steps to make themselves aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that the auditors are
aware of that information.
Annual general meeting
The notice convening the Annual General Meeting to be
held at 11am on 19th July 2006 at De Vere Whites Hotel,
De Havilland Way, Bolton, Greater Manchester, BL6 6SF 
is set out within the letter and proxy from accompanying
this report.
Auditors
During the period Baker Tilly, Chartered Accountants’ were
appointed as the first auditors of the Company. A resolution
to re-appoint Baker Tilly as the Company's auditor will be
proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
By order of the Board on 14 June 2006

Chief Executive  Corporate governance
PAGE 14 |  Corporate governance
Principles of corporate
governance
The Company's board of directors appreciates the value of
good corporate governance not only in the areas of
accountability and risk management but also as a positive
contribution to business prosperity. It believes that
corporate governance involves more than a simple “box
ticking” approach to establish whether a company has met
the requirements of a number of specific rules and
regulations. Rather the issue is one of applying corporate
governance principles (including those set out in the
Corporate Governance Guidelines for AIM companies
published by the Quoted Companies' Alliance in July 2005)
in a sensible and pragmatic fashion having regard to the
individual circumstances of the Group's business. The key
objective is to enhance and protect shareholder value. 
Board structure 
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the proper
management of the Group. A statement of directors'
responsibilities in respect of the accounts is set out within
the Director’s Report.
The non-executive director has a particular responsibility 
to ensure that the strategies proposed by the executive
directors are fully considered. The non-executive director 
is considered by the Board to be independent of
management and free of any relationship which could
materially interfere with the exercise of his independent
judgement. He receives a fixed fee for his services. 
To enable the board to discharge its duties, all directors
have full and timely access to all relevant information and
there is a procedure for all directors, in furtherance of their
duties, to take independent professional advice, if
necessary, at the expense of the Group. The board has a
formal schedule of matters reserved to it and meets
monthly. It is responsible for overall Group strategy,
approval of major capital expenditure projects and
consideration of significant financing matters. Both the
executive and non executive directors have attended all
meetings which they were eligible to attend during the
period. 
The following committees, which have written terms of
reference, deal with specific aspects of the Group's
affairs:
• the remuneration committee is responsible for making
recommendations to the Board on the Company's
framework of executive remuneration and its cost. 
The committee determines the contract terms,
remuneration and other benefits for each of the
executive directors, including performance related
bonus schemes, pension rights and compensation
payments. The Board itself determines the remuneration
of the non-executive directors. The committee
comprises the non-executive chairman Mr N Guilford.
The report on directors' remuneration is set out on 
page 16. 
• the audit committee comprises the non-executive
chairman Mr N Guilford and the finance director 
Mr M Prideaux. Its prime tasks are to review the scope
of external audit, to receive regular reports from Baker
Tilly, and to review the half-yearly and annual accounts
before they are presented to the Board, focusing in
particular on accounting policies and areas of
management judgement and estimation. 
The committee is responsible for monitoring the 
controls which are in force to ensure the integrity of 
the information reported to the shareholders. 
The committee acts as a forum for discussion of internal
control issues and contributes to the Board's review of
the effectiveness of the Group's internal control and risk
management systems and processes. It advises the
board on the appointment of external auditors and on
their remuneration for both audit and non-audit work,
and discusses the nature and scope of the audit with
the external auditors. It reviews and monitors the
independence of the auditors especially with regard to
non-audit work. The audit committee has met twice
during the year to consider the reports of the auditors
immediately before the submission of the annual and
interim financial statements to the board.
No formal nomination committee exists in view of the stage
of growth of the Group. Instead, appointments to the Board
are considered by the Chief Executive and other executive
directors and discussed with the non executive director.
Appointments are made after an evaluation of the skills,
knowledge and expertise required to ensure that the Board
as a whole has the ability to ensure that the Group can
continue to compete effectively in its market place.  Corporate governance
Corporate governance |   PAGE 15
Internal control 
The directors are responsible for the Group's system of
internal control and reviewing its effectiveness. The Board
has designed the Group's system of internal control in order
to provide the directors with reasonable assurance that its
assets are safeguarded, that transactions are authorised
and properly recorded and that material errors and
irregularities are either prevented or would be detected
within a timely period. However, no system of internal
control can eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business
objectives or provide absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss. 
The key elements of the control system in operation are:
• the Board meets regularly with a formal schedule of
matters reserved to it for decision and has put in place
an organisational structure with clear lines of
responsibility defined and with appropriate delegation of
authority; and
• there are procedures for planning, approval and
monitoring of capital expenditure and information
systems for monitoring the Group's financial
performance against approved budgets and forecasts; 
The process adopted by the Group accords with the
guidance contained in the document “Internal Control
Guidance for directors on the Combined Code” issued by
the ICAEW.
The audit committee receives reports from the external
auditors on a regular basis and from executive directors of
the Group. During the year, the audit committee has
reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal control
as described above. The Board receives periodic reports
from all committees.
There are no significant issues disclosed in the report and
financial statements for the period ended 31 March 2006
and up to the date of approval of the report and financial
statements that have required the Board to deal with any
related material internal control issues.
The Board has considered whether the Group's internal
controls processes would be significantly enhanced by an
internal audit function and has taken the view that at the
Group's current stage of development, this is not required.
The Board will continue to review this matter each year.
Relations with shareholders 
The Group values its dialogue with both institutional and
private investors. Effective two-way communication with
fund managers, institutional investors and analysts is
actively pursued and this encompasses issues such as
performance, policy and strategy. During the year the
directors have had meetings with analysts and institutions
and will continue to do so on a regular basis. 
There is also an opportunity, at the Company's Annual
General Meeting for individual shareholders to raise general
business matters with the full Board and notice of the
Company's Annual General Meeting is circulated to all
shareholders at least 21 days before such meeting. 
The Chairman of the audit and remuneration committees
will be available at the Annual General Meeting to answer
questions.
The Annual Report is to be published on the Company's
website, which also includes other announcements made
during the year.
Going concern 
The directors confirm that they are satisfied that the
Company and Group have adequate resources to continue
in business for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the
financial statements. PAGE 16 |   Report of the remuneration committee
Report of the remuneration committee
Remuneration policy for executive directors
The basic annual salary payable to each executive director is as set out below and is to be reviewed annually (without any
obligation to increase the same). In addition, performance related bonuses and other benefits are provided, as shown.

During the year the Group paid management charges of £45,000 to G N Ratcliffe in respect of his services for the period prior
to the acquisition by the Company of Debtmatters Limited.
Share options
Details of directors' interests in share options can be found in the directors' report on page 11.
Incentive schemes
The Company has granted options under the EMI scheme to selected key employees. The eligible employees or directors must
be an employee of the Group, and not have a material interest in the Company or the Group. The individual participation limits
held by an employee will be £100,000. The exercise price per ordinary share payable will be the higher of the market value of
the shares at the date of grant agreed by the Inland Revenue and the nominal value of the share. An option will not normally be
exercisable until three years have lapsed since its grant and subsisting options will lapse ten years after the grant. 
As at 31 March 2006 options over 1,660,202 ordinary shares granted under the EMI scheme remained unexercised.
Service contracts
Each of the executive directors has entered into a service agreement with the Company. The service agreements are terminable
on not less than 6 months notice by either party to the others at any time. The service agreements contain provisions for early
termination, inter alia, in the event of a breach by the director in question. 
The non-executive director has entered into an engagement letter with the Company. The engagement letter is terminable on
not less than 6 months notice by either party to the others or where the director is not re-elected at an annual general meeting.
The engagement letter contains provisions for early termination, inter alia, in the event of a breach by the director in question. Independent auditor’s report
Independent auditor’s report |   PAGE 17
We have audited the financial statements which comprise
the Group Profit and Loss Account, the Group Balance
Sheet, the Company Balance Sheet, the Group Cash Flow
Statement, and the related notes. 
This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a
body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we
might state to the Company's members those matters we
are required to state to them in an auditors' report and for
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we
do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other
than the Company and the Company's members as a
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions
we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of
directors and auditors
The directors' responsibilities for preparing the Annual
Report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice)
are set out in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view and are properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and
whether the information given in the Directors' Report is
consistent with the financial statements. We also report to
you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or 
if information specified by law regarding directors'
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report,
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited
financial statements. This other information comprises the
Directors' Report, Chairman's Statement, Corporate
Governance and Report of the Remuneration Committee.
We consider the implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial statements. 
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, 
on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements
made by the directors in the preparation of the financial
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Company's circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all 
the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are
free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud
or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of the state of the Company's
affairs and of the Group at 31 March 2006 and of its
profit for the period then ended and have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985;
and
• the information given in the Directors' Report is
consistent with the financial statements.

PAGE 22 |   Accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the
historical cost convention. Accounting policies are
consistently applied and are in accordance with generally
accepted accounting practice in the UK.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the
financial statements of the Company and all Group
undertakings. These are adjusted, where appropriate, to
conform to Group accounting policies. 
Under a group reconstruction on 8 June 2005 the
Company acquired the whole of the issued share capital of
Debtmatters Limited and Debtmatters Commercial Limited
in exchange for shares. The reconstruction has been
accounted for in accordance with the principles of merger
accounting as set out in the Financial Reporting Standard
No. 6 (FRS 6) and in accordance with Schedule 4a of the
Companies Act 1985. The accounts have been prepared as
if Debtmatters Limited and Debtmatters Commercial Limited
had been owned and controlled by the Company
throughout the periods ended 31 March 2006 and 31
March 2005.
The acquisition of Unique Business Finance Limited on 31st
October 2005 has been accounted for under the
acquisition method. The results of companies acquired or
disposed of are included in the profit and loss account after
or up to the date that control passes respectively. Unique
Business Finance Limited has an accounting reference date
of 31 October. As this was the date at which its trade and
net assets were transferred to the Group, it was effectively
dormant from that date onwards. 
As a consolidated profit and loss account is published, a
separate profit and loss account for the parent company is
omitted from the Group financial statements by virtue of
section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Turnover
Turnover in the profit and loss represents amounts billed or
to be billed in respect of services performed on behalf of
clients. The amounts taken to turnover are calculated as
follows:
Nominee fees - on approval of a proposal in a formal
creditors' meeting the full amount of the nominee fee is
accounted for less a provision for cases on which the full
fee may not be recoverable.
Supervisory fees - on a monthly basis as earned following
the creditors' meeting.
Goodwill
Goodwill representing the excess of the purchase price
compared with the fair value of net assets acquired is
capitalised and written off evenly over 10 years as in the
opinion of the directors this represents the period over
which the goodwill is effective. It is reviewed for impairment
at the end of the first full financial year following the
acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
recoverable.  
Amortisation
Amortisation is calculated to write off the cost of an asset,
less its estimated residual value, over the useful economic
life of that asset as follows:
IPS Licences      - 20% straight line
Fixed assets
All fixed assets are initially recorded at cost.
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an
asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful
economic life of that asset as follows:
Fixtures & Fittings - 25% straight line
Motor vehicles - 25% straight line
Equipment - 33% straight line
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for
impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Accounting policies
Accounting policies |   PAGE 23
Work in progress
Work in progress is valued on the basis of direct costs plus
attributable overheads based on normal levels of activity for
cases on which instructions have been received but not yet
approved in a creditors' meeting for those cases which, in
the opinion of the directors, will proceed to approval by
creditors. Provision is made for any foreseeable losses
where appropriate.
Leasing and hire purchase
commitments
Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the
assets have passed to the Company, and hire purchase
contracts, are capitalised in the balance sheet and are
depreciated over their useful lives. The capital element of
future obligations under the leases and hire purchase
contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged
in the profit and loss account over the periods of the leases
and hire purchase contracts and represent a constant
proportion of the balance of capital repayments
outstanding.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged in the
profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the
lease term.
Deferred Taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing
differences that have originated but not reversed at the
balance sheet date where transactions or events that result
in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to
pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance
sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the
Group's taxable profits and its results as stated in the
financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains
and losses in tax assessments in periods different from
those in which they are recognised in the financial
statements.   
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that
the directors consider that it is more likely than not that
there will be available taxable profits from which the future
reversal of the underlying tax differences can be deducted.  
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are
expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences
are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that
have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance
sheet date.  
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less a provision
for any permanent impairment in value.   Notes to the financial statements

satisfy the Group's requirements. The Group uses financial instruments comprising borrowings, cash, and trade debtors and

5 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 strategic report
Dear Shareholders,
Fortune Oil has continued the programme to build a 
stronger and better performing company and strengthen  
the position of our oil and gas operations in China. 
Whilst the global economic recovery remains fragile the 
China energy landscape continues to develop as more 
energy is required to meet the needs and aspirations of  
the Chinese people. Recent unrest in the Middle East has 
led to increasing uncertainty on the oil price. If the events  
in Iraq spill over to neighbouring countries, higher oil prices 
and potential supply disruption could have a major impact 
on global economic growth and associated energy demand.
Meanwhile we face an increasingly difficult operating 
environment. Chinese society is raising its expectations  
of business. Events such as the Sinopec pipeline explosion 
in Qingdao led to increased public and government scrutiny 
of the commercial sector. This growing public concern over 
industrial developments has led to some companies having 
to relocate or shut down their operations, for example, some 
steel and cement plants in Hebei province, close to Beijing, 
are being shut down permanently due to the air pollution 
these plants have caused in the capital city and surrounding 
areas. Similarly in Maoming, close to where Fortune Oil 
supplies crude oil, protesters have been attempting to  
stop construction of a large new petrochemical plant due  
to environmental and health concerns and some of these 
protests have become violent.
It is important that we pay close attention to these 
developments and continue to use robust processes 
throughout our project selection process, construction  
and operation of our assets, ensuring that we continue to 
meet the highest safety standards and do not compromise 
the health, safety or the environment of our neighbours. 
Engagement with the local communities where we operate 
is a key to our success. Our priority is to ensure that our 
operations are run safely and reliably. 
We have also seen increased action by the Chinese  
state to improve the corporate governance of companies  
in China and this has led to the removal of some of  
the senior management of major Chinese state owned 
energy companies. Fortune Oil has always prided itself in 
maintaining the highest corporate governance standards in 
line with our London listing and we will continue to establish 
such best practices throughout our China operations. 
This has been a busy reporting period for Fortune Oil,  
with two significant transactions. The Group completed  
the sale of Fortune Gas Investment Holdings Limited 
(“FGIH”) to China Gas Holdings Limited (“CGH”) (the  
“FGIH Transaction”). Fortune Oil is now one of the largest 
shareholders of CGH enhancing Fortune Oil’s exposure  
to China’s natural gas business. Pursuant to the Share 
Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) of the FGIH Transaction,  
Ms Li Ching has been appointed as an executive director  
Fortune Oil has made  
steady progress across  
all core businesses.
chairman’s letter
6 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 strategic report
of CGH with effect from the 10 January 2014. Ms Li’s 
responsibilities include overseeing the Group’s interests  
in CGH, encompassing the FGIH city gas and piped gas 
businesses, LNG ship and coal bed methane (“CBM”) 
development and operations. Together with Mr Liu Ming Hui, 
our joint venture partner in China Gas Group Ltd. (“CGG”), 
who is the CGH executive chairman, managing director and 
president, the Group has strengthened its involvement and 
influence in CGH.
With 237 city gas concessions CGH is one of the largest 
city gas companies in China and is well positioned  
to take advantage of the continued expansion of China’s 
natural gas market. Through our long term strategic 
investment in CGH our shareholders will continue to  
have good exposure to this rapidly expanding market 
through a company where commensurate dividend  
growth is anticipated.
The second area where we have been successful during  
the Reporting Period was to enter into a new 20 year joint 
venture agreement with Sinopec in respect to the Maoming 
Single Point Mooring (“SPM”). This is again a measure  
of our strong relationships with the major state owned 
enterprises since we achieved this new agreement despite 
the original joint venture having expired. The new joint 
venture has been expanded with the potential development 
of a new pipeline and buoy system, although we no longer 
have a controlling stake. 
As a result of the FGIH Transaction and the change of status 
of the SPM joint venture, the Company was no longer able to 
maintain a Premium Listing on the London Stock Exchange 
but became a standard listed company, with effect from  
20 March 2013. We will continue to evaluate options such 
that Fortune Oil’s listing status meets the best interests  
of the Company and its shareholders. 
The Board has reviewed the KPI’s following the FGIH 
Transaction and decided to remove the natural gas based 
KPI and replaced it with a new KPI; “Total Shareholder 
Return”. This measure is used by many of our peers in  
the oil sector on the London Stock Exchange and we have 
reported this measure in the remuneration section of the 
annual reports in previous years. We have also revised  
for the KPI on “Revenues” to include shared revenue of 
associates to reflect the performance of the Group after 
completion of the FGIH Transaction and the set-up of the 
new SPM joint venture. The KPI has been amended to 
“Revenues including share of jointly controlled entities  
and associates”. We feel this set of KPI’s continues to  
be valuable in assessing how well the Group has been 
performing against its strategic objectives. For the review 
period we met or exceeded six out of the six KPIs  
(see page 5).
The Board sets the tone and values that shape the 
performance and behaviour of the organisation. It provides 
a strong framework within which management can lead 
operations. Mr Yuan Jun has been appointed to the  
Fortune Oil board, replacing Mr Zhi Yulin. Mr Yuan is 
currently a president at Zhenhua Oil Company Limited  
and the Board will benefit from his experience working for 
one of the major Chinese oil companies. I wish to thank  
Mr Zhi Yulin for his contribution over the last 13.5 years  
and wish him continued success in his future endeavours. 
The Board would also like to thank Mr Tee Kiam Poon,  
our former chief executive, who left the Company in 
December 2013. We valued Tee’s drive and determination 
during his time with Fortune Oil.
In view of the changes to the business structure the 
Company is principally an investment holding company at 
the present time with dividend income from each business 
unit as the core cash inflow to the Company. The Board  
has reviewed its dividend policy in light of these changes, 
the overall Group profitability, as well as the future cash  
flow position of the Group, and has therefore concluded  
not to recommend any further dividend for this reporting 
period and that future dividend payments will be dependent 
on dividend income from each business unit.
I would like to end by thanking you, the shareholders for 
your continued support. I also want to thank all the efforts 
of our employees who continue to drive your company 
forward every working day and I’m looking forward to our 
next year and the continued development of the Company.
QIAN Benyuan
Chairman
24 July 2014
7 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 strategic report
Dear Shareholders,
During the Reporting Period, Fortune Oil continued to  
make steady progress against its strategic priorities.  
I am particularly pleased that we have completed the  
FGIH Transaction with CGH and the two companies  
are now integrated at the operating levels.
Our intention is to continue to participate in the Chinese 
natural gas market through a long term strategic investment 
in CGH one of the largest city gas companies in China.  
CGH supplied 8.0 billion cubic metres (“bcm”) of natural 
gas, in the twelve months ended 31 March 2014, an 
increase of 18 per cent over the previous year. That is an 
increase of 1.2 bcm of natural gas compared to 0.5 bcm  
of natural gas that FGIH sold in the twelve months ended  
31 December 2012 and demonstrates the tremendous 
growth potential of CGH.
Key to CGH’s future is the exclusive concession rights  
to 237 city gas projects. As gas supplies increase we  
see tremendous growth potential for the CGH natural gas 
business as more of these cities are converted to natural 
gas and the gas penetration rates increase from the low 
levels they are at today. The recent natural gas supply 
agreement signed between Russia and China will increase 
the availability of gas, particularly in the northern provinces 
where CGH operates.
During 2013, China introduced long-awaited natural gas 
price reforms which now enables the natural gas price to 
track international crude oil prices more closely. Although 
this will incentivise domestic gas supply, including CBM, 
there are some concerns that the rise of 15 per cent for 
natural gas at the city gate will cause a slowdown in the 
rapid growth in gas demand. Following the gas price 
increases China has also had to raise the electricity  
tariff from gas-fired power plants to resolve the conflict 
between rising gas prices and low on-grid prices for  
gas-based power.
Fortune Oil continues to expand its oil business in China. 
We have entered into a new 20 year joint venture agreement 
with Sinopec in respect of the SPM. The scope of the  
new joint venture has been expanded with the potential 
development of a new pipeline and buoy system.
Finally, our aviation fuel business continues to perform  
well. We continue to see increasing demand for air travel  
in China despite the general slowing down in China’s 
economic growth rate. We now supply aviation fuel at  
20 airports and see considerable growth opportunities  
from the regions served by Bluesky.
The China energy landscape continues to evolve and China’s 
current leadership is encouraging foreign investment in 
some of the sectors which were previously the exclusive 
remit of the major state owned enterprises. Both Sinopec 
and PetroChina recently announced that they will seek 
foreign investment in their downstream fuels marketing  
and pipeline sectors. We believe that this new trend of 
opening up China’s energy sector will present increased 
opportunities for Fortune Oil. We have a major advantage 
chief executive’s letter
We believe that the China energy 
market will continue to grow and 
provide significant opportunities  
for the Group.
8 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 strategic report
since we have been working with these companies for so 
many years already. We have been a good partner in China 
for over 20 years already and this will stand us in good 
stead going forward.
In October 2013 Fortune Oil put in place a US$300 million 
(£180 million) loan facility to aid future expansion of the 
Group and we continue to evaluate investment opportunities 
aligned to our strategy.
The Board remains optimistic about the medium term growth 
prospects for the Company in both the oil and gas sectors 
in China, even though the Chinese economy is expected to 
grow at a more subdued pace in future. Fortune Oil continues 
to strengthen its position in the Chinese natural gas industry 
through our investment in CGH whilst our Oil businesses are 
well placed to take advantage of the continued expansion of 
China’s oil demand.
The Armenia iron ore development is still under evaluation 
and, as with all our projects, we are continuing to assess 
the project’s economic viability. However, the Group will not 
make any material investment in the development of the 
project unless there is an economically viable investment 
case. As a consequence of higher than anticipated rail 
freight costs and the softening in the long term iron ore 
price, Fortune Oil has recognised a non-cash impairment 
loss of £41.0 million in respect of the assets in the Armerian 
iron ore project.
I have been working for Fortune Oil since 1999 and it gives 
me tremendous pleasure to have this opportunity to manage 
a company with such potential, working in one of the most 
dynamic energy markets in the world. Fortune Oil is well 
placed to continue to grow in China with a strong set of 
assets and strategic investments, established partnerships 
with major companies, and a dedicated and committed 
working team of employees.
I’m looking forward to the 2015 financial year and  
continue our progress to strengthen the company.  
We have a company which is fully focused and energised 
and set to be stronger and safer as we continue to deliver 
the energy to our customers. I would like to thank you  
all for your continued faith and belief in Fortune Oil.

Over the past 15 months there has been a continued 
deceleration in China’s economic growth. China gross 
domestic product (“GDP”) growth for 2013 was 7.7 per cent, 
the lowest for 14 years but still above the government target 
of 7.5 per cent set at the beginning of the year. It is also 
above the five-year plan annual growth target of 7 per cent 
between 2011 and 2015 as China plans to accept a slower 
growth pace than previously if this will allow for a more 
sustainable, consumer-driven expansion of its economy. 
China’s economy expanded by 7.4 per cent in the first 
quarter of 2014 and was higher than expected but was also 
the lowest quarterly GDP growth during the past 20 quarters.
GDP Growth

In line with the slow down in economic growth, energy 
demand growth in China has also slowed. Oil demand was 
only 3 per cent higher than in 2012, averaging 9.95 million 
barrels per day in 2013. China oil demand declined 3 per 
cent year on year to 9.69 million barrels per day in 1Q 2014, 
confirming the continued slowdown of the economy in to 
2014. The slowdown is linked to the weakening of industrial 
activity in China as the effect of the stimulus unwinds and 
money supply growth stalls.
Oil Demand

2011 2012 2013

Chinese domestic oil production was only 1.1 per cent 
higher in 2013 compared to 2012 and totalled 208.3 million 
tonnes. Crude oil imports in 2013 totalled 271.1 million 
tonnes, 4.1 per cent higher than 2012 and total refining 
throughput reached 480.4 million tonnes, which was  
3.3 per cent higher than in 2012. Crude oil imports in  
1Q 2014 totalled 74.7 million tonnes, 8.3 per cent higher 
year on year as China took advantage of a lower crude  
oil price to restock its strategic oil reserves.
China’s gas demand continues to remain strong and in 2013 
demand for natural gas rose 13.9 per cent year on year to 
167.6 bcm, accounting for 5.9 per cent of China’s primary 
energy consumption and increased 8 per cent year on year 
in 1Q 2014 to 48 bcm. To mitigate growing imports of 
natural gas China continues to press for increased domestic 
gas production from both conventional and unconventional 
gas sources. In 2013, China produced 120.9 bcm of natural 
gas, 117.7 bcm from conventional fields, 3 bcm from 
surface-level CBM, and 200 million cubic metres of shale 
gas, according to the Ministry of Land and Resources, and 
in 1Q 2014, China natural gas production totalled 33 bcm,  
up 7.2 per cent year on year.
China demand for natural gas will continue to remain strong 
and will play an increasingly strategic role as China diversifies 
the sources from which it can be supplied, both indigenously 
and from overseas. The shale gas revolution has reshaped 
US energy and China is setting aggressive targets for the 
development of unconventional gas such as CBM and 
shale. However, the scale and speed of the roll out of these 
unconventional gas sources in China is still uncertain.

our market outlook
Energy demand and economic 
growth are strongly linked. 
Therefore, the overall trend  
in China, even with the lower 
economic growth, will be of 
increased energy demand. 
10 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 strategic report
Natural gas imports increased to 38 million tonnes in 2013 
(53 bcm), up 25 per cent on 2012 (30.5 million tonnes) 
accounting for over 30 per cent of China gas supply. Pipeline 
deliveries surged 20 per cent year on year, hitting a new 
monthly record of 1.85 million tonnes and LNG imports 
climbed 33 per cent to 2.43 million tonnes in December 
2013. Turkmenistan delivered the most gas pipeline imports 
to China (17.7 million tonnes) followed by LNG from Qatar 
(6.8 million tonnes). Natural gas imports have continued  
to remain strong in Q1 2014. In March 2014 pipeline gas 
imports increased 24 per cent year on year, accounting for 
55 per cent of total gas imports and LNG imports increased 
5 per cent year on year in March 2014.
China continues to develop the gas delivery network to 
support the growth in natural gas demand. In October 2013, 
the China Myanmar gas pipeline went into operation with a 
transmission capacity of 12 bcm per annum. PetroChina 
supplied the first gas via West – East Pipeline II to Hong Kong 
in December 2013. Across China in 2013 an additional 
5,700 km of gas pipelines were installed, which is the third 
consecutive year that more than 5,000 km of gas pipelines 
have been installed bringing the total pipeline network to 
around 60,000 km with an annual transmission capacity of 
120 bcm. Despite the increased supply options, China is still 
facing gas shortfalls in the high demand winter period and, 
during 2013, there was a shortfall of 22 bcm in gas supply.
The growing problem of local air quality in many cities in 
China is driving the Chinese Government to accelerate the 
substitution of coal with natural gas and introduce measures 
to reduce emissions from the automotive sector. In January 
2013 the pollution levels in Beijing were over 20 times higher 
than the World Health Organisation safety limit, with the 
Beijing municipal government advising people to stay indoors 
as much as possible. Studies have shown that exposure  
to ultrafine particulates in the air pollution will result in 
increases in mortality rates. The Chinese Government  
will continue to set policies and provide incentives to 
encourage the investment needed to increase natural gas 
production and infrastructure to supply the gas to reduce 
coal consumption.
The supply of gas to China has also become more 
competitive, with the recent gas supply agreement between  
Russia and China. This will open up gas supply from  
the enormous East Siberian gas fields (5.6 trillion cubic 
metres proved reserves). The initial commitment is to supply 
38 bcm per year and could ramp up to 100 bcm by 2030  
as Russia seeks to diversify its gas markets away from  
over-dependence on Europe where Russia supplied  
137 bcm in 2013.
China continues to have tremendous oil demand growth 
potential as demonstrated by the 15.7 per cent increase  
in passenger car sales in 2013 as Chinese consumers 
bought 17.9 million new cars. Growth in the passenger  
car population has continued in to 2014 with Chinese 
consumers purchasing 1.7 million cars in March 2014, an 
increase of 7.9 per cent year on year. China’s passenger  
car population however is still very low at 85 vehicles  
per 1,000 people compared to other major economies  
(USA 797 per 1,000 people, Brazil 259 per 1,000 people) 
supporting the view of increasing future demand for oil  
and transportation fuels as vehicle ownership increases.
China’s airline industry continues its strong growth. The 
country’s airlines carried 350 million passengers in 2013, up 
nearly 11 per cent from 2012 and the country’s civil aviation 
authority said it will have more than 230 airports by 2015, 
up from 193 in 2013. The International Air Transport 
Association Airline Industry Forecast 2013-2017 predicts 
that routes within or connected to China will be the single 
largest driver of airline growth, accounting for 24 per cent  
of new passengers during the forecast period, projecting  
for China 227.4 million additional passengers, 195 million 
domestic and 32.4 million international passengers, 
suggesting a positive outlook for Bluesky.
On 15 November 2013, China announced new social  
and economic policies promoting a greater reliance on 
market forces and inviting private-sector participation  
and foreign competition in industries previously controlled 
by the central government. As a result both Sinopec  
and PetroChina have announced plans to enable foreign 
investment into the oil and gas sectors, to which previously 
they enjoyed exclusive rights.

We aim to create value through our selective investments in China.
China’s continued economic growth and associated increasing levels of prosperity will create growing demand for  
energy for years to come. We will help to meet that demand by safely operating and investing in oil and gas assets  
in the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”). Our activities are focused on selective investments in infrastructure:
 Through our investment in CGH, access to the natural gas business, supplying natural gas to the domestic,  
commercial and industrial markets and the transportation sector;
 The Bluesky aviation refuelling business supplies jet fuel to 20 major airports;
 The Maoming Single Point Mooring Facility supplies crude oil to Sinopec’s Maoming Refinery, one of the largest  
refineries in China;
 The West Zhuhai import jetty, storage and distribution terminal supplies petrol and diesel to PetroChina’s  
downstream refuelling markets across southern China. The terminal is also part of PetroChina’s “Strategic  
Oil Products Reserve facilities”;
 The supply and trading of oil, gas and petrochemical products.
our business model
our strategy
To be a focused oil and gas infrastructure operator in China.
Fortune Oil has a clear and focused strategy: we invest for the long term in profitable assets supplying oil,  
gas and resources to support China’s growing economy. To achieve this we have focused on:
 Our investment in CGH, thereby becoming a leading integrated natural gas supplier across China;
 By developing opportunities in the Chinese oil sector, thereby creating the Company’s unique position in oil 
products supply and terminals; and
 Developing resources, supported by our strong relationships with major Chinese state owned enterprises.
This strategy has resulted in the creation of the SPM, Bluesky, West Zhuhai Terminal and the natural gas business, 
which have provided consistent cash flows and, most recently, the opportunity to build upon the strategic  
investment in CGH.

We have made solid progress against our strategy. Our goal is to continue to improve the 
competitive financial performance and increase the value for our shareholders.
The Reporting Period covers the 15 month period 1 January 2013 to 31 March 2014. Therefore, the figures are not 
directly comparable with the twelve months audited 2012 annual report. For reference, there is a comparison of the  
twelve months ended 31 December 2013 against the twelve months ended 31 December 2012 in the unaudited 
twelve months interim report issued on 26 February 2014 and available on the Fortune Oil website; www.fortune-oil.

 Group revenues for the Reporting Period, including share of jointly controlled entities and associates increased  
by 67 per cent to £1,232.3 million (2012: £739.4 million). Group revenues from all operations excluding jointly 
controlled entities and associates increased to £377.8 million for the Reporting Period (2012: £214.6 million). This 
was largely driven by the inclusion of the share in CGH’s revenue post the completion of the FGIH Transaction (the 
“Completion”), growth in the Bluesky and trading businesses, offsetting the decrease in the SPM due to the  
expiry of the previous joint venture and exclusion of Fortune Oil’s natural gas business after Completion.
 Group profit from operations for the Reporting Period, excluding “Other Gains and Losses (including share of  
other gains in jointly controlled entities)” described in page 27 of this report, decreased by 3.3 per cent to  
£27.6 million (2012: £28.5 million). The decrease was a result of the effect of the expiry of the joint venture 
agreement for the SPM business and exclusion of Fortune Oil’s natural gas business after Completion,  
offsetting the profit contribution from Bluesky and the share of CGH’s result post Completion.
 Net profit from all operations attributable to owners of the parent for the Reporting Period increased 1,141 per  
cent to £194.4 million (2012: £15.7 million). The increase is due to the inclusion of other gains and losses of  
£171.7 million (2012: £4.6 million), comprising a net gain of £95.3 million in respect of the Group’s investment  
in CGH prior to CGH becoming an associate and a gain of £119.6 million on disposal of FGIH partially offset  
by the non-cash impairment loss of £43.2 million (including the non-controlling shareholder’s share of loss of  
£7.1 million) mainly in respect to the full carrying value of the assets in the Armenian iron ore project (please refer  
to page 27 of this report for details).
 Net profit from continuing operations for the reporting period increased 1,308 per cent to £66.6 million  
(2012: £4.7 million). This is mainly due to the inclusion of a significant amount in “Other Gains and Losses” 
(including share of other gains in jointly controlled entities) as described on page 27 of this report, increase in  
profit contribution from Bluesky and the inclusion of the share of results of CGH since Completion.
 Basic earnings per share for the Reporting Period was 9.08p (2012: 0.82p) and basic earnings per share,  
before other gains and losses, (including share of other gains in jointly controlled entities) as described on  
page 27 of this report, was 0.73p (2012: 0.58p). Basic earnings per share from continuing operations increased  
to 3.11 pence for the Reporting Period (2012: 0.25p).
 Net assets further increased to £343.2 million as at 31 March 2014 (31 December 2012: £246.8 million) including  
a gain of £95.3 million in fair value in respect of the Company’s CGH shares, less a gain of £40.2 million recognised 
in the prior year net assets through equity, and gain on disposal of FGIH of £119.7 million offset by the non-cash 
impairment in charges or of assets of £43.2 million, mainly from the Armenian iron ore project.
 Special dividend of 2.36p per share paid to shareholders in October 2013.

• Q1 2014 sales volumes increased 17 per cent to 
898,000 tonnes (2013 Q1: 770,000 tonnes) driven 
predominantly by an 18 per cent increase in sales 
volumes to the domestic flight market.
• In the Reporting Period Bluesky started supplying fuel  
to three more airports (Zhijiang, Xiangyang and 
Shennongjia) bringing the total number of airports 
Bluesky supplies to 20.
Outlook
• Air travel demand continues to expand across China.
• In line with the 12th five-year plan, Bluesky has plans to 
supply aviation fuel to an additional 13 new airports by 
2020 and a further 13 new airports by 2030, in the five 
provinces where Bluesky operates.
• Bluesky is committed to keeping sufficient storage to 
supply jet fuel at each of its airports for approximately 
two weeks, to ensure that operations remain 
uninterrupted. With a stabilised government pricing 
policy, stable crude oil prices and increasing demand  
for passenger and cargo traffic, we expect Bluesky’s 
sales volumes and profit to continue to remain robust.

15 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 strategic report
Our Business Model and Strategy
Maoming New King Ming Petroleum Company Ltd. is a joint 
venture between Fortune Oil and Sinopec. The joint venture 
owns and operates the Maoming SPM, which is China’s 
only off-shore oil import terminal, with a design capacity of  
11 million tonnes per annum, equivalent to 4 per cent of 
China’s crude oil imports. The SPM is capable of handling 
Ultra Large Crude Carriers (300,000 dwt) and supplies 
crude oil to Sinopec’s Maoming refinery. The refinery has 
recently been expanded to process up to 500,000 barrels 
per day of crude oil, making it one of the largest refineries  
in China.
Our Performance
• The previous joint venture contract expired in February 
2013, the Maoming SPM business was dissolved and 
the net amount expected to be recovered on dissolution 
of the joint venture has been recognised within “Trade 
and other receivables” on the balance sheet as at  
31 March 2014.
• Financial results up until the date of contract expiry are 
presented as discontinued operations and the Company 
has not included the financial or operating performance 
post the joint venture expiration date in its results until  
1 January 2014 when the new joint venture was put  
in place.
• Profit from operations in Maoming SPM business for the 
period of ownership during the 15 month period ended  
31 March 2014 was £0.4 million (2012 £5.5 million).
MAOMING SINGLE POINT MOORING (“SPM”)
• In the first six weeks of 2013, prior to the expiration of  
the joint venture agreement, Maoming SPM handled 
seven tankers delivering a total of 1.1 million tonnes  
of crude oil.
• 2014 Q1 sales volumes increased to 3.1 million tonnes 
(2013 Q1: 1.1 million tonnes). The increase is a result of 
the expiry of the previous joint venture agreement which 
meant that, after February 2013, the Company had no 
effective financial interest in the operations of the SPM.
• The SPM facility continues to operate efficiently and with 
an accident-free and spill-free record.
Outlook
• We anticipate continued demand for crude oil by the 
Maoming refinery associated with the recent expansion 
of the refinery and continued growth for transportation 
fuels in China.
• The Group has entered into a new 20 year  
joint venture agreement with Sinopec in respect  
to the Maoming SPM, which became effective from  
1 January 2014.
• The scope of the joint venture has been expanded  
with the potential development of a new pipeline and 
buoy system.
• Under the new shareholding structure, the shareholding 
interest in the SPM by the Group is 33 per cent and 
accordingly, it no longer holds a controlling equity stake 
in the joint venture.
• The new joint venture is an associate to the Group, and 
equity accounting has been adopted from when the joint 
venture became effective.

22.9 per cent to 555,000 tonnes (Q1 2013: 720,000 
tonnes) due to reduced storage and throughput on  
the terminal.
Outlook
• The terminal continues to play an important role for 
PetroChina given its strategic position in the downstream 
business in Southern China.
• Options to diversify the terminal’s customer base 
continue to be evaluated.

the expansion of the types of products that it trades.
• The Group obtained one of the first licences issued in 
China to enable the supply and trading of diesel and 
other refined products.
trading business
In August 2013 Fortune Oil completed the sale of  
our natural gas business to China Gas Holdings 
Limited (“CGH”).
Our Business Model and Strategy
Our natural gas businesses were responsible for the supply 
and distribution of natural gas and pre-completion of the 
FGIH Transaction, comprised of four businesses:
• upstream CBM Project – A state pilot project 
deploying cutting edge in-seam drilling and advanced 
hydraulic fracturing technology to commercialise coal 
bed methane in Liulin, Shanxi.
• Wholesale Gas Distribution – Our spur pipelines and 
wholesale stations connected the natural gas from the 
main transnational pipelines to the cities and supply  
gas to our downstream customers.
• City gas businesses – Owned and operated the city 
networks, connecting and supplying natural gas to 
apartment complexes and commercial buildings.
• Refuelling with Gas – Installed and operated vehicle  
gas refuelling business, including natural gas refuelling  
of cars, trucks and buses.
Our Performance – 2013 Pre Completion of  
the FGIH Transaction
• For the period up to completion of the FGIH Transaction 
the natural gas business operating profit contribution to 
Fortune Oil was £14 million.
• Natural gas sales volume increased to 330 million cubic 
meters as operations at the new projects came on stream.
• FGIH achieved the profit guarantee threshold of  
HK$200 million (£16 million) for the twelve months 
ended 31 December 2013 as set out in the SPA.
Outlook
Following the completion of the FGIH Transaction the 
Group’s participation in the natural gas business is  
reported under the “China Gas Holdings” section of this 
report. Under the terms of the SPA, the Group will also 
compensate CGH on a dollar for dollar basis if the net  
profit for the natural gas business is less than HK$400 
million (£32 million) for the twelve month period ended  
31 December 2014. As management believes the FGIH 
business within CGH is on target to meet the profit 
guarantee and the possibility of compensation is unlikely. 
The fair value of the obligation has been estimated on the 
basis of the weighted average of the possible outcomes  
to be immaterial and so, no liabilities for compensation  
have been recognised at this moment.

18 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 strategic report
In August 2013 Fortune Oil completed the sale of  
our natural gas business to China Gas Holdings 
Limited (“CGH”). The Company’s strategic intent  
is to participate in the Chinese natural gas market 
through a long term strategic investment in CGH.
Fortune Oil and China Gas Holdings
• For the period post completion of the FGIH Transaction 
to the end of the Reporting Period CGH contributed 
£96.6 million to the Group’s operating profit through  
its share of profit from jointly controlled entities  
and associates. The operating profit includes a 
reclassification to the income statement of £95.3 million 
representing the net gain in fair value of CGG’s 
investments in CGH previously recognised in equity  
up to the date when CGH became an associate.
• CGG, the joint venture company in which the Group  
has a 50 per cent interest, owns 732,446,000 CGH 
shares, representing 14.63 per cent of CGH total  
issued shares as at 23 July 2014. As at 23 July 2014 
the Group and CGG together held 916,565,463 shares  
in CGH, representing 18.31 per cent of CGH total  
issued shares of 5,006,088,561, as per CGH’s latest 
public information.
• The 18.31 per cent shareholding in CGH is necessary  
to secure Fortune Oil’s long term interests in CGH.
• The Group participates in CGH’s board by virtue of 
nomination rights over two board positions.
China Gas Holdings – Segment Performance 2014 
financial year
Fortune Oil’s investment in CGH is managed and reported 
as a separate segment under IFRS following the completion 
of the FGIH Transaction in August 2013. The CGH segment 
results include equity accounting earnings from the investment 
in CGH.
CGH – Summary for the twelve Month Period ended  
31 March 2014, in which the Group participated since 
completion in August 2013
From Completion of the FGIH disposal, CGH became  
an associate of the Group and CGG and thus became 
accounted for under the equity method. Under the equity 
method, the Group and CGG recognise their respective 
shares of the profit, net assets and other equity movements 
of CGH but after adjusting the net assets of CGH to fair 
value at Completion. This uplift to fair value is applied to  
the separately identifiable individual assets and liabilities of 
CGH after which any further uplift to reflect the fair market 
value of the CGH shares at Completion is treated as goodwill 
within the associate. This uplift creates a disconnect between 
the carrying value of CGH in the Group’s balance sheet, 
which is higher than the corresponding share of CGH’s net 
assets as reported by CGH. These fair value adjustments 
have been determined provisionally as at 31 March 2014, 
china gas holdings limited
and will be finalised during the twelve months following 
Completion with any adjustments arising reported at the 
next reporting date.
From Completion onwards, under equity accounting the 
market value of the investment in CGH is no longer directly 
reflected in the Group’s balance sheet, however, any future 
decrease in CGH’s share price, which is significant and 
prolonged, is objective evidence of impairment which would 
be charged to the Group’s income statement in the future 
period in which the impairment arises. Absent any such 
impairment, the fair value uplift adjustments will be 
amortised generally over the lives of the underlying assets 
and liabilities of CGH that were uplifted to fair value, as an 
additional charge against the Group’s share of CGH’s profit.
Therefore, the share of CGH’s results and net assets 
reflected in the Group’s financial statements cannot be 
connected directly to those reported by CGH itself.
In order to facilitate a fuller understanding of the underlying 
performance of Fortune Oil’s associate, CGH, presented 
below is a summary of their financial results and operational 
performance for the year ended 31 March 2014.
• CGH revenues for the period including share of jointly 
controlled entities and associates increased by 45 per 
cent to £2.1 billion (for the twelve month period ended  
31 March 2013: £1.5 billion).
• CGH profit from operations for the period, excluding 
other gains and losses, increased by 43 per cent  
to £343.6 million (for the twelve month period ended  
31 March 2013: £240.9 million).
• Net profit from all operations attributable to owners  
of CGH increased 46 per cent to £207.9 million  
(for the twelve month period ended 31 March 2013: 
£142.4 million).
• Earnings per share increased 36 per cent to 4.32p (for 
the twelve month period ended 31 March 2013: 3.18p).
• During the Reporting Period CGH secured 52 additional 
city piped gas projects.
• As at 31 March 2014 CGH had a total of 237 city gas 
projects with exclusive concession rights, twelve long 
distance natural gas pipeline projects, one natural gas 
development project, two coal bed methane projects,  
98 liquefied petroleum gas distribution projects and had 
completed the construction of 353 compressed/liquefied 
natural gas refilling stations for vehicles.
• During the twelve month period to the 31 March 2014  
CGH sold a total of 8.0 bcm of natural gas, an increase 
of 18 per cent over the same period of the previous  
year (for the twelve month period ended 31 March  
2013: 6.8 bcm).
• As at the 31 March 2014, CGH had 2,714 industrial 
customers, 59,479 commercial customers and  
10.3 million residential users with the connectable city 
populations covered by CGH gas projects increasing  
to 75.5 million.
19 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 strategic report
• CGH has continued FGIH’s construction of the first 
permanent LNG ship refuelling station on the Yangtze 
River near Chongqing and agreement has been reached 
with several ship operators to commence conversion  
of their ships to operate with LNG dual fuel technology 
in commercial operations.
• Within CGH the Fortune Liulin Gas Company Limited 
has completed the construction of the gas gathering 
system on the northern area of the Liulin CBM and 
linked to the natural gas wholesale station where  
the CBM will be dispatched for sale. 
Outlook
• CGH is one of the largest city natural gas companies  
in China and, with 237 city gas concessions, is well 
positioned to take advantage of Chinese government 
policies to switch from coal to natural gas.
• Household natural gas penetration rates of only 44 per 
cent means that there is potentially a large opportunity 
to expand connections and gas supply volume in CGH’s 
city concessions.
• China’s Natural Gas Utilisation policy emphasises the 
priority development of gas in the vehicle and marine 
sectors. This policy is stimulating the development of 
natural gas filling stations, which is one of the priority 
focuses of CGH.
• CGH target is to increase pipe gas volume to 10 bcm  
by 2015 and 12 bcm by 2016.
resources
Fortune Oil is pursuing investment opportunities  
to capitalise on China’s growing demand for energy 
and resources.
It has been a difficult year for the mineral resources industry. 
Iron ore prices have decreased 30 per cent due to the 
slowdown in economic growth globally, particularly in China 
and at the same time new iron ore production has come  
on stream. As a consequence of higher than expected rail 
freight costs and the softening in the long term iron ore 
price, Fortune Oil has recognised a non-cash impairment 
loss of £41.0 million in respect of the assets in the Armenian 
iron ore project.
The Group will not make any material investment in the 
development of this project unless there is an economically 
viable investment case. Nevertheless the Group will 
continue to evaluate options to improve the economics of 
these assets and is working with the Armenian authorities 
and the Armenian and Georgian rail companies to determine 
if this is possible. The Group is also in discussions with 
customers in the neighbouring countries since transport 
costs will be reduced significantly if the iron ore concentrate 
product can be sold to local steel producers, avoiding the 
need to export overseas.

Health, Safety and Environment (“HSE”)
The safety of our staff and the communities where  
we operate is our top priority. We manage safety risk 
through controls and compliance systems coupled with  
a safety-focused culture. We regularly inspect, test and 
maintain our facilities to ensure they continue to meet  
our standards. We expect everyone working for us to 
intervene and stop work that may appear to be unsafe.  
If employees break these rules they will face disciplinary 
action up to and including termination of employment.
In the Reporting Period there were no Lost Time Injuries  
or fatal accidents in the Company’s subsidiaries (where  
we have operational control).
Environment and Society
Fortune Oil has a policy of minimising the impact of its 
operations on the environment. We aim to apply best industry 
practices wherever we operate, to improve environmental 
performance and to foster close relationships with the local 
community. The requirements of our environmental and 
sustainability policy are incorporated through the planning, 
operations and closure of projects and this also covers the 
Resources developments in Armenia.
Oil and gas emissions
Our primary environmental focus is to prevent the release  
of hydrocarbons. Fortune Oil has clear requirements and 
procedures to prevent spills and programmes in place to 
maintain and improve our facilities and pipelines to reduce 
the risk of any potential leak or spill. We have a number of 
recovery methods in place to minimise the impact in the 
event of any spill or release. In the Reporting Period there 
were no significant spills or releases from our operations.
Climate change
The Group’s direct emissions of greenhouse gases are 
small, mainly being methane releases when equipment is 
maintained, flaring of gas from our Liulin wells (as required 
under NDRC guidelines for reserves certification), the 
combustion of gas for power production and the use  
of diesel and petrol for vehicles.
Fortune Oil was one of the first operating companies in the 
oil and gas sector in China to measure its own emissions 
with the aim of bringing about awareness among staff and 
customers of the importance of minimising emissions, and 
increasing the efficiency of our operations.
Equity share of emissions
We report GHG emissions on a carbon dioxide-equivalent 
basis (“CO 2e”). This includes CO 2 and methane for direct 
emissions. Our GHG reporting encompasses all Fortune 
Oil’s consolidated entities as well as our share of equity-
accounted entities other than Fortune Oils’ share of CGH.
These are categorised in accordance with UK government 
(DEFRA) guidelines and the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change (“IPCC”) Guidelines for National 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions and exclude secondary 
emissions by customers through utilisation of our fuels:
2013 2012
Direct GHG emissions (te CO 2e) 14,396 10,682
Intensity CO 2e te/£  
 Group Revenue (million) 14.6 14.4
Fortune Oil emissions are relatively small compared to other 
major oil and gas companies. The increase in emissions was  
a result of increased flaring from the Liulin CBM block. CGH 
emissions have not been included since the data is not 
available to report.
corporate and social responsibility
21 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 strategic report
Intensity
The ratio of our total greenhouse gas emissions to Group 
revenues included in our GHG reporting was 14.6 te/£ million 
for the twelve month period ended 31 December 2013 using 
the Group Revenue including shared results of JCEs and 
associates prorated for a twelve month period.
Water
Availability of water globally and in China is an area of 
increasing environmental concern. Fortune Oil assesses  
the risks of water scarcity and waste water disposal within 
our operations. We also recycle water in our operations  
to minimise water use.
Our Community
The Company’s operations are currently principally in  
the PRC although the Resources business has activities  
in Armenia. We ensure that the Company’s operations are  
in compliance with national and local laws and practices. 
Our ongoing success relies on the maintenance of excellent 
relationships and trust of the communities where we operate. 
Fortune Oil has a proven track record of safe and reliable 
operation. The Company remains one of the few international 
companies with both oil and gas activities in China. Many  
of the Company’s businesses are amongst the largest 
foreign-invested enterprises in that area and they provide  
a benchmark for other local companies. As part of their 
social responsibility programmes in China, our companies 
support community activities and provide training to 
customers regarding the safe use of fuels. We also interact 
with local and national government and associations to 
further the development of better policies. The Company 
follows the same principles and practices as it develops 
operations elsewhere in the world.
Business Ethics
Bribery and corruption are significant risks in the oil and gas 
industry. Our code of ethics requires that our employees or 
people working on behalf of Fortune Oil do not engage in 
bribery or corruption in any form whether in the public of 
private sectors. We are working to ensure we adhere to  
the standards arising from the UK Bribery Act. 
Our Employees
As at 31 March 2014, following the FGIH Transaction 
Fortune Oil directly employs 68 people. Our people are 
recruited, trained and recompensed according to our 
employment policy of attracting, developing and retaining 
talented people and to provide attractive long term career 
prospects for our employees. We have a culture that 
embraces diversity and fosters inclusion. We provide equal 
opportunities, career development, promotion, training and 
reward for all employees including those with disabilities.
The Company ensures that all its staff follow internationally 
recognised governance practices in its business dealings 
and if staff break these rules they will face disciplinary action 
up to and including termination of employment. There is 
also a process that enables employees to report any 
breaches of our Company’s code of ethics confidentially.

22 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 strategic report
Our business is supplying China with energy and resources, 
principally oil and natural gas. We face many risks and 
whilst we can manage some, we have to accept others as 
part of doing business. We face the usual economic risks – 
prices, interest rates, supply and demand for the products 
we produce and deliver which we cannot control. Outlined 
below are the principal risk factors that may affect the 
Group’s business. Our business is conducted through 
controlled subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and 
associates over which we have significant influence but  
not control. The risk below relate to the use of these forms 
of participation as well as the risks faced by the underlying 
businesses. Any of these risks, as well as the other risks 
and uncertainties discussed in this document, could have  
a material adverse effect on the business. In addition, the 
risks set out below may not be exhaustive, and additional 
risks and uncertainties may arise or become material in  
the future.
The Group does not have Control of all of  
its Investments
A significant portion of the Group’s business is conducted 
through associate or jointly controlled entities and in certain 
of these operations, the Group does not have board control 
or control of day-to-day operations. The Group is therefore 
dependent upon the decision-making processes and 
internal controls put in place by its investment partners and 
operated by the staff of the associates or jointly controlled 
entities. If incorrect business decisions are taken or, through 
lack of overriding internal controls, assets and/or revenues 
may be lost, then the value of, and income and dividends 
received from, such associates and jointly controlled entities 
may be materially reduced. The Group seeks involvement in 
these decision-making processes, using its rights to appoint 
directors and/or managers, monitoring the results of internal 
controls and using its rights to access trading information to 
reduce the risk associated with such non-controlled entities. 
Concentration Risks
Our principal assets and operations are located in China 
and we sell all our products and services to China. Any 
adverse change in the economic or political environment  
in China would seriously affect the profitability and possibly 
viability of our entire business. We seek, through maintaining 
high level contacts and through providing high-quality 
services, to minimise any adverse consequences.
Exposure to underlying results of CGH
The Group effectively owns approximately 11.0 per cent  
of CGH. As at 31 March 2014, the investment in CGH 
represents 73.1 per cent of the Group’s total assets, hence 
its financial conditions and results of operations may be 
affected by the share price performance (which may lead  
to impairment testing on “Investments in Associates”), the 
issuance of new CGH shares (that the dilution effect may 
have impact on the Group’s profit from operations, for 
example the reduction in share of profit from CGH, which  
is based on the shareholding percentage), the sustainability 
of dividend pay-out ratio, the financial performance (which 
would have direct impact on Fortune Oil’s profit from 
operations), and the financial position of CGH.
Profit Guarantee Risk
Under the terms of sale and purchase agreement of the FGIH 
Transaction, the Group will compensate CGH on a dollar  
for dollar basis if the net profit for FGIH and its subsidiaries, 
jointly controlled entities and associates (the “Group’s natural 
gas business”) are less than HK$400 million (£32 million)  
for the twelve months ended 31 December 2014. Any 
adverse change in the operating, pricing, economic, political 
environment in China would seriously affect the profitability 
of the Group’s natural gas business. To mitigate this risk,  
we maintain our management team in the Group’s natural 
gas business, keep focused on the business environment, 
and stay close to the gas market, so that the Group can 
react to any adverse changes if necessary.
Pricing Risks
Our business sells products where we have little or no control 
over the price we achieve. The price we pay for products  
we on-sell is also largely out of our control. The interest rate 
we pay for debt and the interest we receive on surplus cash, 
and the exchange rates applying to transactions where we 
need to exchange currencies, are all set by international 
markets or by governmental regulation. Adverse movements 
in prices, interest rates or exchange rates can result in 
actual losses on transactions, increased costs or decreased 
revenues or losses on translation into our reporting currency. 
We seek to mitigate the effects of these risks through 
management of stocks of product in storage or transit, 
through currency matching of the costs of products sold  
to revenue produced and through holding cash in the 
currencies where expenditure is expected. We do not carry 
out hedging transactions in respect of these risks. 
principal risks and uncertainties,  
their effects and our management strategy
23 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 strategic report
Regulatory and Relationships Risks
The energy sector in China is subject to a variety of regulatory 
regimes covering many of the Group’s operations, both at 
the national and local government levels. The regulatory 
environment continues to evolve but includes restrictions  
on foreign ownership and participation in certain activities; 
land use and industry permitting; and health, safety and 
environmental obligations. Our operations are often carried 
out in joint ventures or through associated companies or,  
in the case of gas production, through production sharing 
contracts (“PSC”) or rely on medium term and long term 
supply agreements with state owned enterprises. If 
regulations change, or we or our partners fail to abide  
by regulations or meet the requirements of PSC or supply 
agreements, then we may lose rights or suffer fines or  
other penalties. Our management aims to be aware of  
any prospective changes in regulation and to ensure we 
comply, and to seeks to maintain a positive and constructive 
working relationship with our partners and with state owned 
companies so that decisions can be taken together to ensure 
compliance with regulation and PSC and supply agreements.
Health, Safety and the Environment
The Group operates facilities in the oil and gas industry 
where there is an inherent risk of accidents that may harm 
employees, assets, the community or the environment. 
Such accidents may have an adverse impact on the ongoing 
operations, revenues and profits of the Group. We seek 
through the Group’s HSE policies to observe all local and 
national legal and regulatory requirements. We also carry 
out pre-project and regular review risk assessments to 
ensure where possible that processes and procedures  
are in place to reduce and manage such incidents.
Attraction and Retention of Key Employees
We rely heavily on a small number of key individuals, in 
particular the executive directors at Group and subsidiary 
levels, for the operation of the Group’s day-to-day activities 
and implementation of its growth strategy. If a key employee 
left we could suffer disruption to projects or a business  
area until a replacement was recruited. We seek to set 
remuneration policies which will attract and retain suitably 
qualified employees but also seek to facilitate succession 
planning and ensure that there is a sharing of knowledge 
and contacts to minimise the impact of any one  
person’s departure.
Development Risks
As we grow the business we need to take on new 
developments of a long-term nature; these can be  
exploring and developing new reserves of gas or oil,  
building pipelines, storage and delivery facilities or 
converting existing transport equipment to use natural  
gas. All these require national and/or local government 
consents and need to obtain finance, to source appropriate 
equipment and services and to build the necessary 
infrastructure. Whilst we seek to take the investment 
decision based on the best available information, the actual 
process will be affected by delays or changes in regulation, 
reserves proving smaller or more complex than predicted, 
delays in delivery or construction, or facilities or technology 
not reaching expected performance. This may extend  
the completion of projects and delay the start of their 
income production beyond that planned or even make  
them uneconomic. To mitigate this we seek not only at  
the start but also during project implementation to work  
with regulators, financiers, partners and contractors to 
ensure that delays are minimised and projects are kept 
economically viable.
uninsured Risks
We operate with hazardous products and we are not in 
control of all operations in which we participate. In the  
event of an accident, substantial damages may be claimed 
against us due to our actions or omissions or those of  
a partner or sub-contractor. Any indemnities the Group  
may receive from such partners or sub-contractors may be 
difficult to enforce if they lack adequate resources or have 
themselves not put in place adequate insurance cover. We 
seek to manage this risk by selecting good quality, financially 
secure partners and sub-contractors and ensuring they 
confirm that they have appropriate safety procedures and 
insurance cover, and by seeing that our insurance cover  
is reasonable based on the costs of cover and the risks 
associated with our business and industry practice.

Disposal Group Held for Sale and  
Discontinued Operations
Following the decision to dispose of FGIH to CGH the 
natural gas business has been classified in the balance 
sheet as held for sale starting at 31 December 2012. As  
a consequence of this classification and completion of its 
disposal in August 2013 and since the old SPM business 
(“MKM”) is in dissolution following the expiration of the  
joint venture contract in February 2013, the results of the 
Group’s natural gas business and the old SPM business  
are presented as discontinued operations in the income 
statement and cash flow statement for the 15 months ended 
31 March 2014, and the results for the twelve months 
ended 31 December 2012 have also been presented on  
the same basis.
In order to provide a more comprehensive review of all of 
the Group’s operations, on a basis comparable with that 
provided to shareholders in previous periods, the discussion 
of financial results below relates to continuing operations 
and discontinued operations combined. The income 
statement distinguishes the results of discontinued 
operations from those of continuing operations.
Accounting Treatments
Disposal of natural gas business
Upon Completion, the Group derecognised the assets and 
associated liabilities of natural gas business, which were 
held for sale in the balance sheet, derecognised the carrying 
amount of the non-controlling interests, recognised the fair 
value of the consideration receivable, reclassified to the 
income statement cumulative foreign currency translation 
adjustments and recognised the resulting difference as  
a gain on disposal of the natural gas business (see “Other 
Gains and Losses” below for detail) in profit or loss 
attributable to the parent. 
The result of the natural gas business has been 
consolidated to the Company’s accounts until the 
Completion, which was also the date that FGIH and  
its sub-group ceased to be subsidiaries of the Group.  
Please refer to “Natural Gas” of Segmental Reporting  
(note 29 to the accounts at page 90) for detail.
Investment in CGH
As a result of having significant influence through 
exercisable the nomination rights of managing director  
and an additional executive director in CGH granted at  
the CGH Transaction together with the CGH shares held  
by Fortune Oil, CGH has been treated as an associate  
of the Group and equity accounting has been adopted  
since Completion.
The investment in CGH is divided into two layers: (i) direct 
holding by wholly owned subsidiaries; and (ii) indirect 
holding by CGG, a jointly controlled entity between the 
Company and Mr Liu Ming Hui. The accounting treatments  
in these layers are discussed as follows:
Treatments in the Group’s wholly owned subsidiaries
Following the Completion, the Group has applied equity 
accounting by recognising CGH’s net profit according  
to the Group’s shareholding percentage in the income 
statement. (See the summary in “Profit contribution from 
investment in CGH” for details).
As at 31 March 2014, Fortune Oil directly holds 
184,119,463 CGH shares via Fortune Oil PRC Holdings 
Limited and First Marvel Limited, both wholly owned 
subsidiaries of the Company. Since CGH is an associate  
of the Group, and thus accounted for under the equity 
method, the market value of the investment in CGH is  
no longer directly reflected in the Group’s balance sheet, 
however, any future decrease in CGH’s share price,  
which is significant and prolonged, is objective evidence  
of impairment, which would be charged to the income 
statement directly in the relevant future period.
Treatment in CGG
Following Completion, CGG has applied equity accounting 
by recognising CGH’s net profit according to CGG’s 
shareholding percentage in the income statement. CGG’s 
income statement also recognises a gain in fair value of 
CGG’s investment in CGH, previously recognised in equity 
up to the date when CGH became an associate, which is 
disclosed separately as “Other Gains and Losses” under  
the “Share of results of Jointly Controlled Entities”, and 
accrued administrative expenses and finance costs to 
compute its net profit. Since Fortune Oil has a 50 per cent 
shareholding in CGG the Group treats CGG as its jointly 
controlled entity and recognises 50 per cent of CGG’s net 
profit by adopting equity accounting for the Group. In terms  
of cash flow, cash received from dividends declared by CGH 
has partially off-set the finance costs and other administrative 
expenses incurred by CGG. (See the summary in “Profit 
contribution from investment in CGH” for details).
25 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 strategic report
As at 31 March 2014, CGG holds 732,446,000 CGH shares, representing 14.7 per cent of CGH’s total issued share capital. 
As discussed above, since CGH is an associate to CGG and CGG is a jointly controlled entity to the Group, and thus 
accounted for under the equity method, the market value of the investment in CGH is no longer directly reflected in the 
Group’s balance sheet, however, any future decrease in CGH’s share price, which is significant and prolonged, is objective 
evidence of impairment which would be charged to the income statement of CGG directly in the relevant future period.
Profits contribution from investment in CGH
CGH became an associate in August 2013, and, since then, equity accounting has been adopted. In June 2014, CGH 
announced its audited annual results for the year ended 31 March 2014. Since CGH is a listed company in Hong Kong,  
due to sensitive information reasons, instead of applying unpublished CGH’s figures, the Group has pro-rated CGH’s annual 
net profit in order to estimate the share of results in associate/jointly controlled entity to the Group since Completion, the 
directors being satisfied that this is a materially accurate approximation. As discussed above, the Company has changed  
its financial year-end date to 31 March in order to align that with CGH, so that the actual result of CGH can be obtained  
and used in the future.
Based on the accounting treatments discussed above, the profit contribution from the investments in CGH for the Reporting 
Period can be summarised in the following table:

owned subsidiaries 100% of CGG

*** Future shortfall in cash should be covered internally in CGG by: (i) an expected increase in dividend received in cash from CGH;  
(ii) CGG using a new bank loan which charges a lower interest rate, to replace part of the existing facilities.
Maoming SPM business
Since the expiration of the joint venture contract of Maoming King Ming Petroleum Company Limited (“MKM”) in February 
2013, the net amount expected to be recovered on dissolution of the joint venture of £0.8 million has been included in the 
“Trade and other receivables”. Although the SPM facility continues to operate, the Group has not recognised the results of  
the Maoming SPM business following the expiration as SPM was essentially held 100 per cent by Sinopec during that period.
In 2013, Fortune Oil entered into a new joint venture agreement with Sinopec in respect of the Maoming SPM business. Under 
the new shareholding structure, the Group’s shareholding interest in the new Maoming SPM business is 33 per cent. Accordingly, 
Fortune Oil no longer holds a controlling equity stake in the joint venture. However, due to its significant influence, the Group 
treats this Maoming New King Ming Petroleum Company Limited (“New MKM”) as an associate and therefore, equity accounting 
has been adopted. The Group has started recognising its share of results in the new Maoming SPM business from 1 January 
2014 onwards.
26 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 strategic report
Other Gains and Losses (including share of other 
gains in jointly controlled entities)
Other Gains and Losses (including share of other gains  
in jointly controlled entities) were £171.7 million for the 
Reporting Period. Since the Armenian iron ore project 
impairment loss (see below for discussion) is shared with 
the third parties non-controlling interests in the various 
companies, its effect on net profits is reduced. As a result 
the “Other Gains and Losses” (including share of other gains 
in jointly controlled entities) has a net impact of £178.8 million 
on the net profit from all operations attributable to owners of 
the parent for the Reporting Period.
Other Gains and Losses (including share of other gains in 
jointly controlled entities) represent the combined effect of  
(i) the gain on disposal of the Group’s natural gas business; 
(ii) the gain on revaluation of CGH shares to the date of 
treating CGH as an associate; and netting off (iii) impairment 
in assets, mainly relating to the Armenian iron ore project. 
Further detail is as follows:
Gain on disposal of the Group’s natural gas business 
As at the date of the completion of the FGIH Transaction,  
a net gain of £119.7 million on disposal of FGIH and its 
sub-group (the “FGIH Group”) has been realised. The net 
gain was the result of the consideration of the FGIH 
Transaction, less the combined effect of the shareholder’s 
equity of the FGIH Group as at the completion date and 
costs and expenses of the FGIH Transaction.
Gain on revaluation of CGH shares on the date of  
treating CGH as an associate
Following Completion, CGH became an associate. As a 
result, part of the net gain in fair value of available-for-sale 
investments in jointly controlled entities previously recognised 
in “Other reserves” in the Group’s balance sheet has been 
recognised in the Group’s income statement on the date 
when CGH became an associate. However, the further  
gain generated by CGH shares transferred from Fortune 
Max Holdings Limited, a private company controlled and 
beneficially owned by Mr Daniel Chiu, to CGG at acquisition 
in April 2013 has not been reclassified to the income 
statement due to it being considered capital in nature. 
Fortunes share of this gain is £33.6 million and has been 
recognised in equity. The total gains in fair value changes  
of CGH shares reclassified to the Group’s income statement 
for the 15 months ended 31 March 2014 were £95.3 million, 
which has been shown under the “Share of Results of 
Jointly Controlled Entities – Other Gains”.
Impairment of assets
Impairment of assets of £43.2 million (including the non-
controlling shareholders share of the loss of £7.1 million)  
was mainly a result of the Armenian iron ore project. For  
the Reporting Period, the Company has completed an 
extensive assessment of the Armenian iron ore project, 
which indicated that the iron ore assets may not be 
developed economically. As a consequence, Fortune Oil 
recognised an impairment charge in respect of assets in  
the Armenian iron ore project of £41.0 million (including  
the non-controlling shareholders’ share of the loss of  
£7.1 million). The Armenian iron ore project’s impairment  
is the result of the increased transportation costs to  
move the iron ore concentrate from Armenia to potential 
buyers and the softening of the long term iron ore prices 
predicted when the Armenian iron ore assets could enter 
commercial operations.
Other gain in 2012
The other gain of £4.6 million for the twelve months ended  
31 December 2012 arose from the disposal of the Group’s 
available-for-sale investments in respect of shares held  
in CGH in February 2012. The shares were held by a  
wholly owned subsidiary and were sold to CGG, a jointly 
controlled entity. 
Other Comprehensive Loss/Income
Other comprehensive loss was £57.1 million for the Reporting 
Period, compared with other comprehensive income of 
£32.6 million for the twelve months ended 31 December 
2012. This is mainly due to exchange losses arising on 
translation of foreign operations of the Group of £16.8 
million; the share of net gain in fair value of available-for-sale 
investments in jointly controlled entity of £54.9 million; and 
the cumulative gains in fair value of CGG’s investment in 
CGH being reclassified from equity to the income statement 
on the date when CGH became an associate of £95.3 million. 
The other comprehensive income for the twelve months  
31 December 2012 was mainly due to the net gain of  
£40.3 million in fair value of available-for-sale investments  
in respect of CGH shares held by CGG, less the combined 
effect of exchange differences arising on the translation of 
foreign operations of the Group and the sale of its investments 
in respect of CGH shares to CGG during the period. 
Fortunes share of this gain is £33.6 million and has been 
recognised in equity.
Financial Position
The net assets of the Group as at 31 March 2014  
were £343.2 million, compared with £246.8 million as at  
31 December 2012. Investments in jointly controlled entities 
of the Group at 31 March 2014 were £240.7 million, compared 
with £135.5 million as at 31 December 2012. The increase 
was mainly the combined result of the revaluation of  
CGH shares (disclosed within the “Other Gains and 
Losses”), deducting the dividend received from CGH, 
inclusion of the share of CGH’s results, and subtracting  
the administrative expenses and finance costs in CGG.
Upon the Completion of the FGIH Transaction, the assets 
and associated liabilities of natural gas business were 
eliminated against the consideration received from CGH 
before recognising as a gain on disposal in the income 
statement. The consideration received was partly in cash 
and partly in CGH shares, which have been recognised as 
“Investments in Associates”.
The intangible assets of the Group as at 31 March 2014 
were £0.4 million, compared with £38.5 million as at  
31 December 2012. The decrease was mainly due to  
the impairment on the Armenian iron ore project discussed 
in “Other Gains and Losses” above.
27 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 strategic report
The net borrowing position as at 31 March 2014 was  
£50.6 million compared with £61.1 million (after excluding  
net cash of £13.1 million in the natural gas business) as at 
31 December 2012. With a cash balance of £58.3 million  
as at 31 March 2014, together with the syndicated loan 
facility that has been drawn in April 2014 and the expected 
positive cash flow generated from operations, the Group 
envisages no difficulties in meeting both current loan 
repayment obligations and investment commitments.
As a result of consideration received from the FGIH 
Transaction and the revaluation of CGH shares held by  
the Group, the net gearing ratio (after deduction of cash)  
for the Group decreased to 14.8 per cent as at 31 March 
2014 against 24.7 per cent as of 31 December 2012.
Capital Expenditure
For the Reporting Period, the Group invested £11.9 million 
as capital expenditure, which mainly consisted of the 
expansion of gas pipeline networks, construction of natural 
gas refuelling stations, and additions to exploration and 
evaluation assets in respect of the iron ore mining licence  
in Armenia. The Company has also increased its loan to 
CGG by £24.2 million during the period. 
Ordinary Shares and Share Premium
In October 2013, an aggregate of 599,639,580 new ordinary 
shares of 1 pence each (the “New Ordinary Shares”) have 
been allotted and issued to Fortune Dynasty Holdings Limited 
(“FDH”). The New Ordinary Shares were issued at a price  
of 7.81 pence each. FDH is a private company owned by 
First Level Holdings Limited and Vitol Energy (Bermuda) 
Limited, two of the major shareholders of the Company.  
The New Ordinary Shares consisted of: i) 500,266,580 
ordinary shares issued in connection with the acquisition  
of Wilmar International Limited’s US$60 million interest in 
the total US$400 million consideration receivable as a result 
of the FGIH Transaction; and ii) 99,373,000 ordinary shares 
issued in connection with a loan settlement to FDH of 
US$12 million. Further details is included in note 28.
The issue of New Ordinary Shares has increased the share 
capital and share premium of the Company by 1 pence and 
6.81 pence, respectively.
Finance Costs and Tax
Finance expenses for the Group from all operations  
were £5.7 million in the Reporting Period, compared with 
£6.1 million for the twelve months ended 31 December 
2012, mainly due to the decrease in the weighted average 
Group borrowing throughout the period and the exclusion of 
finance expenses in the Group’s natural gas business  
after the completion of the FGIH Transaction.
The Group’s total tax charge in the Reporting Period from  
all operations was £5.2 million (for the twelve months ended  
31 December 2012: £8.2 million) representing an effective 
tax rate of 22 per cent (after excluding non-taxable capital 
gains and losses of £171.7 million), compared with 29 per 
cent for the twelve months ended 31 December 2012. The 
decrease in the effective tax rate was mainly the result of 
the exclusion of the income tax charge of the Group’s natural 
gas business after the completion of the FGIH Transaction 
and because profits of jointly controlled entities and 
associates are included in the income statement net of tax.
Foreign Exchange
The revenues and expenses of the Group are mainly 
denominated in China’s renminbi (RMB). The remaining 
expenses are denominated either in pounds sterling (£)  
or in Hong Kong dollars (HK$), which is pegged to the US 
dollar, or in US dollars (US$). On average for the Reporting 
Period, the RMB appreciated against the US$ by 2.7 per 
cent and the pound sterling depreciated by 0.4 per cent 
against the US$, hence there was an overall 3.1 per cent 
depreciation of the pound sterling against the RMB. This 
currency movement has had the effect of increasing our 
profits as measured in pounds sterling.
The assets and liabilities of the Group are also primarily 
denominated in RMB, with our Armenian investment  
being denominated in US$. The remaining balance, which 
represents a small proportion of the assets and liabilities,  
is denominated in pounds sterling and HK$. As at 31 March 
2014, the closing pound sterling appreciated against the 
RMB and US$ by 2.5 per cent and 3.0 per cent, respectively.
The Group does not have a policy to hedge currency risk 
and therefore any changes in the RMB/£ exchange rate are 
likely to affect the Group’s results, which are presented in 
pounds sterling.
Capital Structure
Most of the Group’s investments and expenses take place 
in the PRC and are held through Fortune Oil PRC Holdings 
Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company 
incorporated in Hong Kong. To facilitate inter-company 
restructuring, most of the investments in China are held 
through subsidiary Hong Kong registered companies.  
The Group’s interests in Armenia are held through a 
separate investment structure. The Group’s UK operations 
consist only of local representation as a direct expense  
to the Company.
Refinancing
In October 2013, Fortune Oil PRC Holdings Limited signed 
a US$300 million (£180 million) loan agreement. The facility 
is denominated in US$ with a term of three years and  
a margin of 2.75 per cent over LIBOR. The facility is 
guaranteed by Fortune Oil PLC and secured by share 
charges over its various Hong Kong subsidiaries.
The purpose of this is to maximise the borrowing capacity 
and to lock in low-cost financing at current levels before  
liquidity has been tightened in the loan market. This new 
facility, which has been partly used to repay the previous 
syndicated loan of US$180 million (£113 million) signed in 
April 2011, will provide the Company with working capital, 
and finance new investment.
Dividend
A special interim dividend of 2.36 pence per ordinary share 
was paid to shareholders on 25 October 2013. 
A final dividend of 0.16 pence per ordinary share was paid 
to shareholders on 15 August 2013, in respect of the year 
ended 31 December 2012.

liquidity and capital resources
Statement of Cash Flows
Net cash used in operating activities in the Reporting Period 
was £16.4 million, £32.4 million lower than 2012 for which 
there was a cash inflow of £16.1 million. This decrease 
mainly reflected the substantial increase in trade receivables 
and trade deposits paid. Net cash from investing activities 
was £34.0 million in the Reporting Period, an increase from 
£45.1 million used in for the twelve months period ending  
31 December 2012. The increase was mainly the result  
of the disposal of a subsidiary.
Net cash used in financing activities in the Reporting Period 
was £31.8 million (2012: £21.6 million). This included payment 
of dividends to the Company’s shareholders of £48.1 million 
(2012: £3.4 million).
Cash and cash equivalents were £58.3 million at 31 March 
2014 (31 December 2012: £50.7 million after excluding cash 
balance of £23.1 million in natural gas business).
Acquisition and Disposal
The Company has completed the “FGIH Transaction” in 
August 2013 and results are reported including the trading 
results of FGIH for the period prior to this date and excluding 
its trading for the period after this date.
Fortune Oil entered into a new joint venture agreement with 
Sinopec in respect of the Maoming SPM business (“New 
MKM”). Under the new shareholding structure, the Group’s 
shareholding interest in the Maoming SPM business is 33 
per cent. The total investment cost was £10.9 million.
Return On Average Capital Employed (“ROACE”)
ROACE measures the efficiency of the Group’s utilisation  
of the capital that it employs. In this calculation, ROACE  
is defined as income for the period adjusted for after-tax 
interest expense as a percentage of the average capital 
employed for the period. Capital employed consists of total 
equity, current debt and non-current debt. The tax rate is 
derived from calculations at the published segment level.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting 
All disclosures concerning the Group’s greenhouse gas emissions, as required to be disclosed under regulations introduced

statement on page 81.

The Company’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position,

the factors: the Group’s ability to generate cash flows, the financial resources available to it, headroom under bank covenants 
and exposure to credit risk. Based on the Group’s cash flow forecasts and projections and taking into consideration a range 
of potential scenarios and sensitivities and how these may impact on cash flows, facility headroom and bank covenants, the 
Board is satisfied that the Group has reasonable expectation to operate within the level of its facilities for the foreseeable 
future. The Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its preparing its Annual Report and accounts. 
32 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 directors’ report
Strategic Report Approval Statement 
The Strategic Report, outlined on pages 1 to 29, gives a fair and balanced review on the state of the business and 
incorporates key performance indicators, our strategy, market outlook, business model, performance review, financial review, 
corporate and social responsibility and the risks and risk management. 
Dividend Policy
As stated in the Strategic Report on page 7, the Board has considered the Company’s dividend policy and how to apply it to 
the unusual period; a special dividend of 2.36 pence was paid to shareholders in October 2013.
The dividend policy adopted since April 2011 has been a pay-out ratio of appropriately 20% of net post tax profits attributable 
to shareholders. In view of the changes to the business structure the Company is principally an investment holding company 
at the present time with dividend income from each business unit as the core cash inflow to the Company. The Board has 
reviewed its dividend policy in light of these changes, the overall Group profitability, as well as the future cash flow position  
of the Group, and has therefore concluded not to recommend any further dividend for the 15 month period ended 31 March 
2014, having already paid out in excess of 20 per cent of earnings for this Reporting Period.
Financial Instruments 
The Group’s policy in respect of financial instruments is set out within the Accounting Policies and details of credit risk, capital 
risk management, liquidity risk and interest rate risk are given respectively in note 25 to the financial statements.
Corporate Governance Statement and Remuneration Report under the Transparency Rules (DTR) 7.2.1R
The Disclosure & Transparency Rules require certain information to be included in the Corporate Governance Statement in  
the Directors’ Report. Information that fulfils the requirements of the Corporate Governance Report on pages 42 to 55 and  
is incorporated into this Directors’ Report by reference. 
Approval of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
The report on directors’ remuneration (the “Remuneration Report”) is set out on pages 56 to 74.
The Company will propose at the 2014 Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) an ordinary resolution to seek shareholder approval 
of the Remuneration Report for the financial period ended 31 March 2014 (other than the part containing the directors’ 
remuneration policy which will be covered by a separate resolution). The vote on the Remuneration Report is advisory  
in nature and the directors’ entitlement to remuneration is not conditional on its being passed.
For the first time this year, the Company will also propose at the AGM an ordinary resolution to seek shareholder approval  
of the directors’ remuneration policy set out on pages 57 to 66 of the Remuneration Report for the financial period ended  
31 March 2014.
The Companies Act 2006 requires the remuneration policy to be put to shareholders for approval annually unless the 
approved policy remains unchanged, in which case it needs only be put to shareholders for approval at least every three 
years. The remuneration policy sets out how the Company proposes to pay the directors and includes details of the 
Company’s approach to recruitment remuneration and loss of office payments.
The vote on this new resolution is binding and, if passed, will mean that the directors can only make remuneration payments 
in accordance with the approved policy unless such payments have been approved by a separate shareholder resolution.

retire at the forthcoming AGM and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election.
Louisa HO, MAO Tong and LIN Xizhong, having been appointed since the 2011 AGM, are required by the Articles of

There are no other contracts with the Company or its subsidiaries in which a director of the Company has any interest, other

The Board has given consideration to the balance of skills, knowledge and breadth of experience on the Board and the 
manner in which each of the retiring directors contributes to that balance. Following the performance evaluation of the Board, 
its Committees, individual directors and chairman, conducted shortly after the year end, the Board is satisfied that all the 
Directors including the chairman continue to contribute effectively and demonstrate commitment to their roles on the Board 
and the Board Committee. The remaining directors unanimously recommend the re-appointment of each director standing  
for re-election.
Directors’ Interests in Shares
The interests of directors and their connected persons in the issued capital of the Company are given in the Remuneration 
Report on page 69. 
34 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 directors’ report
Share Capital 
The Company currently has only one class of shares and the shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
The Companies Act 2006 abolishes the requirement for a company to have an authorised share capital and the New Articles 
reflect this. Directors will still be limited as to the number of shares they can at any time allot because allotment authority 
continues to be required under the Companies Act 2006, save in respect of employee share schemes.
Details of the share capital and shares issued together with details of the movements in the Company during the year are 
shown in note 22 of the Group financial statements.
On 3 October 2013, the Company issued 599,639,580 new ordinary shares on the completion of the acquisition of First 
Marvel Holdings Limited and on the redemption and certain loan notes. The 599,639,580 shares of 1p each were issued and 
admitted to the standard listed segment of the Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange’s Main Market for 
Listed Securities. As at the date of this Report, 2,587,106,295 ordinary shares of 1p each are fully paid and being the total 
number of Fortune Oil PLC shares with voting rights. 
Details of changes to share capital as at 31 March 2014 and of options under the Group’s employee share schemes are 
shown in notes 22 and 23 to the Group financial statements.
As at 1 January 2013, 10,772,676 ordinary shares were held in the Company’s Employee Benefit Trust subject to option 
granted to employees (none of whom are directors). 
During the year, options over 1,306,579 ordinary shares exercisable at 6.32 pence per share between 8 June 2008 and  
7 June 2015 under the 2004 Unapproved Scheme were exercised on 16 October 2013.
As at 31 March 2014, 9,466,097 ordinary shares were held in the Company’s Employee Benefit Trust subject to options 
granted to employees (none of whom are directors) as follows:
(1) 860,000 ordinary shares with respect to the options exercisable at 6.32 pence per share which are exercisable between  
8 June 2008 and 7 June 2015 under the 2004 Unapproved Scheme;
(2) 1,150,000 ordinary shares with respect to the options exercisable at 11.75 pence per share which are exercisable 
between 25 June 2011 and 24 June 2018 under the 2004 Unapproved Scheme;
(3) 1,709,000 ordinary shares with respect to the options exercisable at 12.75 pence per share which are exercisable 
between 8 June 2014 and 7 June 2021 under the 2004 Unapproved Scheme; 
(4) 5,444,982 ordinary shares with respect to the options exercisable at 9.41 pence per share which are exercisable between 
4 October 2014 and 3 October 2021 under the 2004 Unapproved Scheme; and
(5) 302,115 ordinary shares with respect to the options exercisable at 9.93 pence per share which are exercisable between  
4 October 2014 and 3 October 2021 under the 2004 Approved Scheme,
or, in each case, if earlier, exercisable on the date of cessation of employment with a Participating Company as defined in the 
rules of the 2004 Unapproved Scheme or the 2004 Approved Scheme, as relevant (as detailed in the Remuneration Report). 
The share options referred to in (1) to (5) were granted by the Trustees of the Company’s Employee Benefit Trust on the 
recommendation of the Remuneration Committee of the Board.
In respect of (4) and (5), there is a financial performance condition attaching to the exercise of options which is a growth in 
profit attributable to equity shareholders (“Attributable Profit”) by the Group of 15% per year on average over the three year 
period from the date of grant to the earliest exercise date.
35 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 directors’ report
The two 2004 Share Schemes have terminated in 2014 following the tenth anniversary of its adoption by the Company at the 
AGM in June 2004. Although the Schemes have terminated as regards further grants of options the last options granted in 
2011 will remain unexercisable until October 2021. Options granted under these Schemes will lapse if they have not been 
exercised within ten years of their date of grant and also on termination of an option holder’s (none of whom are directors) 
employment with the Group. 
Following approval by shareholders at the AGM on 18 June 2013, the Company renewed two new Employee Share Option 
Schemes namely Fortune Oil PLC 2013 Company Option Share Plan and Fortune Oil PLC 2013 UK Share Option Plan. The 
share options under both 2013 Employee Share Schemes will be granted by the Trustees of the Company’s Employee Benefit 
Trust on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee of the Board. Currently they are as follows: 
i. Fortune Oil PLC 2013 Company Option Share Plan (“COSP” i.e. Approved Plan)
 An approved share option plan must comply with the legislation and requires HMRC approval and as such, the rules of 
the plan must fall within the HMRC guidelines in order to obtain HM Revenue & Customs approval. These are options, 
which can be granted to an eligible employee up to £30,000 worth of shares (based on the market value of the shares  
at the date the options were granted). CSOP Scheme rules must be approved by HMRC before options can be granted. 
The COSP has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs on 15 January 2014.
 There is no income tax liability on exercise if the date of exercise is at least three years from the date of grant if the right to 
exercise arises because of the option holder ceasing employment due to disability, injury, redundancy or retirement and 
the option is exercised within six months of leaving.
ii. Fortune Oil PLC 2013 UK Share Option Plan (i.e. Unapproved Plan)
 Unapproved share option plan will not attract the tax advantages of an approved plan, since it is not approved by HM 
Revenue & Customs. In situations where the awards offered cannot all be accommodated within an approved share plan  
(for example, the £30,000 CSOP limit), the Unapproved Plan can be used as a top-up scheme to provide the excess  
equity rewards. 
 As long as the option has to be exercised within ten years of its grant, there will be no tax or national insurance charge 
when the option is granted. These options are not subject to tax at grant. Employees are given options to acquire a 
number of shares at a future date at a price agreed at date of grant. On the exercise of the option there will be an income 
tax liability on the difference between the market value of the shares at that date, and the price paid for them.
 This type of option is tax inefficient, but flexible and simple to administer and an unapproved share option plan offers the 
company the opportunity to benefit directors, senior executives and employees more extensively than an approved CSOP.
 
The principal terms of the two Share Schemes were given in the Notice of Annual General Meeting 2013.
There was no grant of options in the 2013 share schemes for the period ended 31 March 2014.
During the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 March 2014, there were no grants of options under any of the 2004 or 2013 
Employee Share Schemes.
Employee Benefit Trust (the “EBT” or “Trust”)
The EBT is capable of acquiring shares, by purchase or by subscription, at a price not less than the nominal value of an 
ordinary share of 1p each in the Company and of using any such shares for the purposes of satisfying options under the 
Company’s 2004 Approved Scheme, 2004 Unapproved Scheme, 2013 Company Option Share Plan and 2013 UK Share 
Option Plan and of the Senior Executive Incentive Plan (the “SEIP”), or as otherwise determined by the Trustees. No shares 
were acquired by the EBT during the year. 
Usually, the right to receive the shares that have not yet vested is conditional upon the individual remaining an employee of 
the Group for a period of at least two further years from the dates of award. The value of shares may increase depending on 
whether the Company performance criteria are met and the date on which the individual exercises the option. Performance 
conditions attaching to awards made under the SEIP are detailed in the Remuneration Report.
36 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 directors’ report
During the Period, 
(1) the remaining three Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) participants (none of whom are directors) in the 2007 awards 
removed from the EBT their 611,292 shares to which they were beneficially entitled. There was no further increase in  
the number of awarded shares on or after 5th anniversary of the initial award as the KPI target of growth in the profit 
attributable to equity shareholders (before other gains) was not met for the financial year ended 31 December 2012.
(2) Of the shares awarded in 2009 pursuant to the SEIP, there were 3,984,594 shares vested unconditionally in 2012; of 
which 478,338 shares were transferred out of the EBT by the beneficial owner and five LTIP participants (two of whom  
are Directors) did not withdraw their 3,506,256 shares from the EBT. In June 2013, four LTIP participants received a  
40% increase in number of shares which had vested in June 2012 (being 3 years following the date of the initial award) 
resulting in an additional 922,668 shares being beneficially owned by the three continuing participants. One of the 
participants withdrew his 523,168 shares. There was no increase in number of shares held for a participant (who was  
a director) whose shares vested in October 2012. In November 2013, two participants (both of whom are directors) 
withdrew their 2,859,420 shares to which they were entitled. The other two LTIP participants chose not to remove their 
1,046,336 shares from the EBT so as to be entitled to benefit from another possible increase in the number of awarded 
shares on or after 5th anniversary of the initial award subject to the performance of the Company. In respect of the 
October 2009 award the performance period ran from 14 October 2009 to 13 October 2012, the Company performance 
targets under the SEIP were not met for the performance period so there was no top up due in respect of October 2009 
award. There was no increase in number of shares held for a participant (who was a director) whose shares vested in 
October 2012. The director concerned has not withdrawn his ordinary shares from the EBT. 
 The market share price at close of businesses for two sets of options prior to the dates of award in 2009 was 6.50 pence 
per share and 8.10 pence per share respectively prior to the dates of vesting in 2012 was 10.25 pence per share and 
8.95 pence per share respectively. 
 The nil-cost options remain exercisable and under the Plan the number of awardable shares could increase for 
participants still employed by the Group, depending on the performance of the Company for the three-year period from 
the date of the initial award in 2009. There is no consideration for this additional award and all these additional shares are 
already in issue and are held in the EBT. 
(3) In respect of the 2010 awards, 2,743,216 ordinary shares had vested unconditionally and only 2,064,944 shares were 
transferred out of the EBT by four LTIP participants (two of whom are directors) and three LTIP participants chose not to 
withdraw their 678,272 shares from the EBT so as to be entitled to benefit from another possible increase in the number 
of awarded shares on or after 4th anniversary of the initial award subject to the performance of the Company.
All the other nil cost options still remain exercisable under the SEIP and the number of additional shares to be awarded will 
depend upon the decision taken by each beneficiary as to when they remove their shares from the EBT.
The Company also announced the number of ordinary shares over which the options granted to executive directors and 
senior executives conditional on personal performance targets for the Company and the executives being met for the 
performance year 1 June 2012 – 31 May 2013 (i.e. 2012 set) based on the notional bonus granted in June 2012 can buy  
on the first anniversary of the date of the option.
There was no grant of options in LTIP pursuant to the SEIP in 2013.
The holding of the EBT at 1 January 2013 was 85,496,806 shares. As detailed above 611,292 shares were withdrawn from 
the EBT in respect of 2007 LTIP awards, 3,382,588 shares in respect of 2009 awards and 2,064,944 shares in respect of 
2010 awards. A further 1,306,579 shares were transferred out of the EBT for the purposes of satisfying the exercise of 
options granted under the Company’s 2004 Unapproved Scheme. 
During the period, 1,724,977 shares ceased to be subject to LTIP options due to the cessation of employment by a 
participant (who was a director) who ceased to be a director and an employee on 31 December 2013 and at that time his 
rights under the SEIP ceased.
As at 31 March 2014, the EBT held 78,131,403 shares of which 910,534,145 ordinary shares have been allocated to options 
granted under the Plan: 1,724,608 shares unconditionally vested and not withdrawn in the Plan and a further 8,809,537 
shares conditionally vested; and a further 9,466,097 shares allocated to satisfy options granted to employees (none of whom 
are directors) under the Company’s Share Option Schemes. The balance of 58,131,161 shares is available for further awards. 
37 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 directors’ report
The market value of the 78,131,403 ordinary shares held in the Trust at 31 March 2014 was £9,766,425 (31 December 2012: 
85,496,806 ordinary shares, £8,977,165). It is intended that these shares are continued to be used to provide bonus shares 
and any share options exercised under any of the 2004 and 2013 Share Schemes; and the 2009 LTIP.
The number of unallocated ordinary shares held within the EBT as at 31 March 2014 was 56,406,184 (2.18%) (31 December 
2012: 64,354,136, 3.24%) and this represented less than 5% best practice limit as endorsed by the ABI.
The Trustees of the EBT is free to exercise the voting rights attributable to all shares held by the Trust as they think fit. Neither 
the Board nor the Remuneration Committee has indicated to the Trustees whether or how they would wish the Trustees to 
vote on any matters.
Shares acquired through the employee share schemes and the SEIP rank equally with other shares in issue.

Additional Information for Shareholders 
The rights attaching to the ordinary shares are detailed in the Company’s Articles of Association, the following provides the 
additional information required for shareholders as a result of the implementation of the EU Takeover Directive into UK law.
Articles of Association
The Company adopted new Articles of Association (the “New Articles”) at the AGM in 2010. These were adopted primarily  
to take account of changes in English company law brought about by certain provisions of the Companies Act 2006, which 
came into force on 1 October 2009 and the implementation in the UK of the Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 
2009 on 3 August 2009. 
The board of directors may exercise all the powers of the Company, subject to the provisions of relevant statutes, the articles 
and any directors given by special resolution. 
The articles, for instances, contain certain specific provisions and restrictions regarding the Company’s power to borrow 
money. Powers relating to the issuing and buying back of shares are included in the articles and are subject to such 
authorities being approved annually by shareholders at the AGM, should the directors recommend that it remains appropriate 
to retain such flexibility. The rules for the appointment and replacement of directors are set out in the articles, the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Companies Act 2006 and related legislation. The articles can only be changed by a special 
resolution passed in a general meeting of shareholders.
All members who hold ordinary shares are entitled to attend and vote at the AGM. On a show of hand at a general meeting 
every member present in person and every duly appointed proxy shall have one vote and on a poll, every member present  
in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every ordinary share held or represented. It is intended that voting at the 2014 
AGM will be on a show of hands. The Notice of the Meeting specifies deadlines for exercising voting rights. 
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of 
securities and voting rights. There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the Company other than certain 
restrictions imposed by laws and regulations (such as insider trading laws and market requirements relating to close periods) 
and requirements of the Listing Rules whereby directors, officers and certain employees of the Company require the approval 
of the Company to deal in the Company’s securities. 
Appointment and Replacement of Directors 
The Articles provide that directors may be appointed by an ordinary resolution of the shareholders or by a resolution of  
the directors, provided that, in the latter instance, a director appointed in this way retires at the first AGM following his 
appointment and may be re-appointed. 
The Articles require that every director submit himself for re-appointment every three years and will retire and seek  
re-appointment at the next AGM. The Company’s shareholders may remove a director before the expiration of his period  
of office by passing an ordinary resolution of which special notice has been given. 
Change of Control
There are no significant agreements to which the Company is a party that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change  
of control following a takeover bid.
The Company does not have agreements with any director or officer that would provide compensation for loss of office  
or employment resulting from a takeover, except that provisions of the Company’s share schemes may cause options and 
awards granted under such plans to vest on a takeover.
39 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 directors’ report
Directors & Officers Liability Insurance
The Company has purchased and maintained appropriate insurance cover for its directors and officers and those of its 
subsidiary companies under a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy, as permitted by the Companies Act 2006.
Directors’ Interests and Indemnity 
At no time during the financial period ended 31 March 2014 did any director have a material interest in any contract of 
significance with the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings other than the service contract and letters of appointment 
between each of the directors and the Company, and certain transactions set out in note 28.
As at the date of this Report, qualifying third party indemnity provisions under the Companies Act 2006 are in force under 
which the Company has agreed to indemnify the directors, to the extent permitted by s.234 Companies Act 2006 as 
applicable, against any claims from third parties in respect of certain liabilities arising out of, or in connection with, the 
execution of their powers, duties and responsibilities, as directors of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
Neither the insurance nor the indemnity provides cover in the event that the director is proved to have acted fraudulently  
or deceitfully. 
No claims have been made either under the indemnity or the insurance policy.
Directors’ Conflicts of Interest
Provisions in the Articles permit the Board to consider and, if thought fit, to authorise situations where a director has an 
interest that conflicts, or may possibly conflict, with the interests of the Company. Directors are required to give advance 
notice of any conflict issues to the Board via Company Secretary to declare situational conflicts that can be considered for 
authorisation by the remaining members of the Board. Directors are excluded from the quorum and the vote in respect of  
any matters in which they have an interest.
Auditor
Deloitte LLP provide non-audit services to the Group, which are set out in note 4 to the Group financial statements.  
The directors are satisfied, and will continue to ensure, that Deloitte’s services are in compliance with the relevant ethical 
guidance of the accountancy profession and do not impair the judgement or independence of the auditor.
The Audit Committee continues to review the auditor’s independence and effectiveness. The auditor is subject to  
re-appointment on an annual basis. 
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office as auditor of the Company and ordinary resolutions 
re-appointing Deloitte LLP as auditor and authorising the directors to set their remuneration will be proposed at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

41 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 corporate governance
The uK Corporate Governance Code Compliance 
The Fortune Oil Board is accountable to shareholders for the Group’s activities and is responsible for implementing 
appropriate corporate governance practices within the Group. This section sets out the Group’s corporate governance 
arrangements. 
Listed companies with a premium listing of equity shares in the UK are required under the Listing Rules to describe how they 
have complied with the Main Principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code, published by the Financial Reporting Council 
in September 2012 (“the Code”). The Code recognises that not all of its provisions are necessarily relevant to smaller listed 
company and the Code states that departures from its provisions should not be automatically treated as breaches of the 
Code. Despite having transferred to Standard Listing on 20 March 2013, the Company has continued to provide this report  
in accordance with the requirements applicable to a premium listed company. Good corporate governance remains a focus in 
delivering the Group’s objectives and the Board is committed to maintaining an appropriate corporate governance structure. 
This report, together with the Directors’ Report and the Remuneration Report on pages 32 to 41 and 56 to 74, describes how 
the Board applied the principles of good governance and complies with the Code.
Compliance Statement
The directors consider that the Company has complied with the Main Principle requirements of the Code throughout the 
financial period ended 31 March 2014 and to the date of this report. Where the Code allows flexibility for smaller companies, 
the Board believes the Company has been in compliance with the provisions set out in the Code with the following 
exceptions, which the directors do not consider to be fundamental to the practice of good corporate governance. 
Areas of Non-Compliance
Provision B.1.1 provides that the Board should determine whether a non-executive director is independent in character  
and judgement and whether there are relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect,  
the director’s judgement. The Company acknowledges that six non-executive directors are not considered to be independent 
as defined in the Code.
The Board is satisfied that all six non-executive directors show independent judgment and they demonstrate continued 
commitment to their role, and these do not affect the independence of these non-executive directors who are not considered 
as independent as defined in the Code.
Provision B.2.1 states that the Board should establish a Nomination Committee comprising a majority of independent 
non-executive directors to make recommendations to the Board on all new Board appointments. The Board has not 
established a separate Nomination Committee, but as a vacancy occurs a Nomination Panel comprising appropriately 
qualified directors and non-executives is constituted to conduct the initial search process and to present the whole Board 
recommendations such that the whole Board performs the function of selecting and appointing new directors. The Nomination 
Panel is instructed to produce recommendation on merit, against objective criteria set for the particular position, with due 
regard to the benefits of diversity, including gender, of the Board. The Board considers that the diverse requirements for  
the recruiting of executive directors and senior management involve materially different skills and backgrounds. The Board 
considers that a Panel constituted specifically for each recruitment process enable the appropriate Board members to be 
involved in the initial setting of the requirements and employment terms for the prospective employee and to the initial 
screening of candidates to provide the whole board with a short list.
The Company has not complied with provision D.2.1 which requires the Remuneration Committee to comprise two 
independent non-executive directors. The Remuneration Committee comprises three non-executive directors and the 
Chairman although he does not chair the Remuneration Committee. None of the three non-executive directors is considered 
independent as defined by the Code. The chairman was considered independent when he was appointed as chairman, but 
was thereafter considered to be considered independent by virtue of holding the position of chairman. The Board considers 
that the non-executive directors have the right knowledge of international business and the specific conditions in which the 
Group operates to properly manage the setting of remuneration and other benefits and that the reasons why they are not 
independent are not such as to cause them to be ineffective in performing the remuneration and benefit setting function.
The Company has not complied with provision D.2.2 which requires the Remuneration Committee to be responsible for 
setting the chairman’s remuneration. The setting of the chairman’s remuneration is the responsibility of the Executive 
Committee which the Board believes to be more appropriate.

The Board and Independence of the Board
As the date of this Report, the Board comprises 12 directors: three executive directors and nine non-executive directors 
including the chairman. Biographies of all the Board members appear on pages 30 to 31 of this Annual Report.
The three executive directors are Daniel CHIU (Vice-Chairman), TIAN Jun (Acting Chief Executive) and LI Ching.
QIAN Benyuan is the non-executive chairman.
There are three independent non-executive directors, Frank ATTWOOD, MAO Tong and LIN Xizhong. Frank ATTWOOD is the 
senior independent director. With the Company being a “smaller company” as defined by the Code, the requirement for having 
more than two such directors is fulfilled. 
The non-executive directors who take a role in Board Committee meetings are QIAN Benyuan, Frank ATTWOOD, WANG 
Jinjun, Dennis CHIU, Louisa HO, Ian TAYLOR and MAO Tong. Frank ATTWOOD is the Chairman of the Audit Committee and 
WANG Jinjun is the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. 
MAO Tong and LIN Xizhong are members of the Risk Monitoring Panel of which Frank ATTWOOD is also a member.
The other Non-executive director is YUAN Jun, a president at ZhenHua Oil Co., Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary company 
of North China Industries Corporation (NORINCO) which owns 1.31% of the issued shares of the Company.
No shareholder has the right to request the appointment of a director.
Given their knowledge of the business and industry and their integrity, the Board strongly believes all non-executive directors 
continue to make a valuable contribution to the Company. 
Diversity
The Board recognises the benefits of diversity and the Board’s focus remains on promoting equality, attracting the right 
talents and skills irrespective of gender or ethnicity. The Board has a good record of gender diversity such that women 
comprise 17% (the year ended 31 December 2013: 17% ) of the Board. Within senior management women represent 
approximately 21% (the year ended 31 December 2012: 23%) of managers and 40% at employee level (excluding the  
Gas division). The composition of the Board also reflects a diversity of nationalities such as to reflect the operating locations 
of the Group. The Board includes increasing diversity among its directors and senior executives as a criterion for new 
appointments, however there is not a formal policy in place in respect of gender diversity targets. 
Board Responsibilities and Procedures
The Board is collectively responsible for promoting the success of the Company and for providing entrepreneurial leadership 
within a framework of prudent and effective controls that enable risk to be assessed and managed. It has ultimate responsibility 
for the management direction and performance of the Group and its businesses. The directors’ biographies demonstrate that 
the directors have a range of experience and are of sufficient calibre to bring independent judgment on issues of strategy, 
performance and resources.
The Board is the decision making body for all matters material to the Company’s finances, strategy and reputation. It has 
adopted a formal schedule of matters, which are required to be brought to it for decision, thus ensuring that it maintains full 
and effective control over appropriate strategic, financial, organisational and compliance issues. These matters include:
• The adoption of new Group strategy including major acquisitions and financing considerations;
• The adoption and regular monitoring of the annual Group business plan;
• Major capital expenditure, acquisitions and divestments that diverge from the adopted Group strategy or business plan;
• Approval of the publication of the annual and half-year financial results and interim management statements;
• Supervision of the internal control system and risk management;
• Approval and monitoring of the Health, Safety and Environment policies;
• Board appointments and removals and the related terms;
• Company Secretary appointment and removal;
• Senior management structure, responsibilities and succession plans;
• Consideration of directors’ conflicts of interest; and
• Dividend Policy.
43 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 corporate governance
To enable the Board to discharge its duties, all directors are provided with relevant information in a timely manner by means 
of briefing papers distributed in advance of Board meetings and on an ad hoc basis where necessary. The Board meets  
both physically and by teleconference and at these meetings the Board reviews business performance, ensures adequate 
financing, sets and monitors strategy, examines investment and acquisition opportunities. Authority for implementing the 
strategy and decisions taken by the Board is delegated to the executive directors and senior executives of the Group (“the 
Executive Committee”). The Executive Committee is responsible for the day-to-day running of the Group’s business and 
reports the performance of the Group to the Board and provides timely and accurate information to enable the Board to  
make decisions. Other responsibilities are delegated to the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee, which 
operate within defined terms of reference.
The Board as a whole rather than a Nomination Committee considers new Board appointments. In making appointments  
the Board considers the recommendation from a Nomination Panel comprising qualified directors selected from time to time 
to pre-vet potential appointees and to set parameters as regards the particular skills, knowledge and experience that would 
most benefit the Board and may use external recruitment consultants to provide a shortlist of potential interviewees and 
recommendations for the Board to consider. The Board is responsible for considering succession planning and the 
appointment and removal of its own members.
Regarding the appointment of two directors, the Company did not use an external recruitment consultant.
Dr TIAN Jun was selected by way of internal appointment to act as acting chief executive based on his skills and range of 
experience whilst working for the Group.
Through the Group’s connections within China, the Nomination Panel recommended Mr YUAN Jun as non-executive director 
on the Board based on his significant experience of working with Chinese based entities in similar industries. 
The Nomination Panel will continue to identify and recommend candidates for the position as independent non-executive 
directors. 
Chairman and Acting Chief Executive 
The roles of chairman (Non-executive) and acting chief executive are separate, ensuring a clear division of responsibility.  
The chairman, assisted by the vice-chairman, is responsible for the leadership and the effective working of the Board, while 
the acting chief executive is responsible for development and implementation of the strategy and policy with respect to the 
Group‘s business, with the assistance of the management team and for the day-to-day operations of the Group.
Senior Independent Director
The senior independent director is available to shareholders if they have concerns which have not been resolved through the 
normal channels of chairman, acting chief executive; or in circumstances where the normal channels are inappropriate. 
 
Board Support
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary (whose appointment or removal is a matter  
for the Board as a whole) who is responsible for ensuring Board procedures are followed and that all applicable rules and 
regulations are complied with. All directors, including non-executive directors, are able to take independent professional 
advice if necessary, at the Company’s expense, in the furtherance of their duties as directors.
Induction and Professional Development
On appointment, new directors receive a comprehensive induction to the Group’s business including site visits, meetings with 
senior management across the business and Group functions and meetings with major shareholders. The Company Secretary 
also provides new directors with an overview of their duties as directors, including corporate governance responsibilities, as 
part of induction programmes. As an ongoing process, directors visit operating divisions and local management on a regular 
basis. Directors are briefed and kept informed of changes and developments in the business and on legislative and regulatory 
issues, as appropriate.
44 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 corporate governance
The training needs of directors are periodically discussed at Board meetings and additional training requirements are identified 
through an annual performance evaluation process. During the period to 31 March 2014, Directors attended an in-house 
training session on “Responsibility for Compliance with The City Code on Takeovers and Mergers” in London. Training plans 
for directors were implemented in a more personalised approach with a specific budget allocation, taking into account their 
individual professional development.
Non-executive directors are encouraged to visit the Group’s project sites to meet management and employees to deepen 
their understanding of the operation.
Executive Directors’ External Directorships
The Board has not imposed a formal policy in relation to the number of external directorships that an executive director may 
hold. However, as part of their on-going development, the executive directors may seek an external non-executive role on a 
non-competitor board, for which they may retain the remuneration in respect of the appointment. In order to avoid any conflict 
of interest, all appointments are subject to the Board approval and the Board monitors the extent of directors’ other interests 
to ensure the effectiveness of the Board is achieved. 
Mr Daniel CHIU is non-executive director of a Hong Kong listed company and also the founder of Harrow International School 
in Bangkok, Beijing and Hong Kong. The fee retained for his non-executive directorship of the Hong Kong listed company  
in the Far East Consortium International Limited, for the period ended 31 March 2014 was £2,000 per annum (HK$25,000). 
The Board is satisfied that the executive vice-chairman’s other commitments have no material effect on the time which he  
has available to commit to the Company.
On 10 January 2014, Ms LI Ching, an executive director, was appointed as an executive director to China Gas Holdings Limited, 
a Hong Kong listed company, which is an associate company of the Company, following completion of the transfer of Fortune 
Gas Natural Gas Businesses to China Gas Holdings Limited. Ms LI’s responsibilities include overseeing the Company’s interest 
in respect of the Fortune Gas businesses following the completion of the sale to CGH in 2013. She does not receive any fee 
for her appointment as director at CGH although she has been granted share options under the China Gas Holdings Executive 
Share Scheme. The Board is satisfied that this appointment did not affect Ms LI’s ability to commit sufficient time to her role 
at Fortune Oil. 
Independence/Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive directors are appointed for specified terms of two years, subject to a maximum of up to one month’s notice 
within that period and also subject to re-election and to Companies Act provisions relating to the removal of directors.  
Each of the non-executive directors, including the chairman, currently has a letter of appointment with the fixed time 
commitments of not less than 36 days a year. The terms and conditions of appointment of non-executive directors are 
available for inspection and a sample letter of appointment is available on the Company’s website, www.fortune-oil.com.  
The Board is also kept informed of the directors’ other significant commitments and is satisfied that these do not conflict  
with their duties as a director of the Company.
As required by Code provision B.3.1, the Board has considered the chairman’s other significant commitments, which are his 
directorships of the China Society of State-owned Assets Administration, the China Environment Culture Promotion Association 
and his vice-chairmanships of the China Association of Energy and the CBM Industry Association of Shanxi Province, China. 
The Board is satisfied that these appointments do not conflict with the chairman’s ability to carry out his duties and 
responsibilities and to perform his role as chairman effectively.
All new directors are required by Company’s Articles of Association to be elected by shareholders at the first Annual General 
Meeting after their appointment by the Board. Subsequently they are subject to re-election by shareholders every three years. 
A non-executive director who has served on the Board longer than nine years is subject to annual re-election in accordance 
with the Code. The Board is satisfied that all the directors standing for re-election continue to perform effectively and to 
demonstrate commitment to their role. The directors seeking re-election at the 2014 Annual General Meeting are noted  
in the Directors’ Report on page 32 of this Annual Report and in the Notice of AGM.
45 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 corporate governance
Indemnities
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, directors have been granted an indemnity permitted by law in 
respect of liabilities incurred as a result of their office. The indemnity would not cover where the relevant director or officer  
has acted fraudulently or dishonestly. Throughout the year the Company has also maintained directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance cover in respect of legal action against the directors and other officers of the Group.
Board Performance Evaluation 
The Board completed an internal performance evaluation of its own performance and of its Board Committees, chairman  
and individual directors for the period ended 31 March 2014. The performance evaluation involved a written questionnaire 
followed by discussion in order to evaluate the success of the changes made and identify points to be addressed in the next 
twelve months. When setting the context, the specific circumstances of the Company were taken into consideration. A Review 
Panel comprising the chairman, the senior independent director and a non-executive director discussed their views and gave 
feedback based on individual questionnaires. The results of the evaluation were reported to the Board and where areas for 
improvement have been identified, actions have been agreed. Relevant matters considered in discussion with directors and 
Board performance included:
• Size, composition and independence of the Board
• Strategy
• Risk management and internal controls
• Relationships with stakeholders
• Time management
• Communication
• Effectiveness of the Board/Committees/Panels
• Corporate governance
The directors concluded that the performance evaluation identified areas where some non-executive directors felt that they 
required further management input or exposure to the operating businesses and that the Board focuses more on the strategic 
planning and identification of steps required to achieve its medium term objectives. As part of the evaluation process, the 
Board considers the balance of skills, knowledge, experience and independence to ensure the Board and committees 
effectively discharge their duties and responsibilities. The performance evaluation concluded that in general the Board and its 
Committees operated effectively and the individual directors were each contributing to the overall effectiveness of the Board. 
The evaluation of the chairman encompasses the general management and conduct of Board meetings, the quality of 
discussion and the extent to which Board meetings are focusing on the right issues. The senior independent director and  
a non-executive director reviewed and evaluated the performance of the chairman. They concluded that the chairman 
continues to perform effectively and demonstrated commitment to the role of chairman.
Succession Planning
The Board has determined that a structured focus on succession planning as part of the Group’s overall business 
development strategy is necessary with consideration being given to both the Board and senior management. The current 
developments in the Group’s business and the range of possibilities that exist for growth and methods of financing make  
this a complex exercise and, whilst careful consideration of the developing management requirements of the Group will be 
considered, early decisions in this area are unlikely pending clarification of some opportunities. The Board is satisfied that  
the individuals currently fulfilling key senior management positions in the organisation have the requisite depth and breadth  
of skills, knowledge and experience.
46 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 corporate governance
Directors’ Conflicts of Interest
A register of conflicts is maintained by the Company Secretary. Directors are required to notify the Company Secretary of any 
potential conflicts of interest when they are appointed to the Board and, following appointment, as new potential conflicts 
arise. These notifications are then considered and where appropriate authorised by the Board. The Board considers the 
extent to which such notified conflicts should be authorised and such authorisation can only be done in advance.
Prior to finalising an appointment, a new director is required to confirm his existing commitments of directors held outside the 
Company and discuss the time commitment required to deal appropriately with the affairs of the Group. Significant changes 
in a director’s outside commitments are discussed with the Board prior to a director accepting further appointment.
These procedures have been applied during the year and are included as a regular item for consideration by the Board at  
its meetings.
Directors Duties in Relation to s.172 of the Companies Act 2006
The provisions of the Companies Act 2006 relating to the duties of directors create a statutory obligation to act in good faith 
and to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members as a whole, and in doing so have regard to certain 
matters set out in s.172 of the Companies Act 2006. These matters include having regard to the interests of the Company’s 
employees, the need to foster the Company’s business relationships with supplier and others, the impact of the Company’s 
operations on the community and environment and the desirability of the Company maintaining a reputation for high 
standards of business conduct. In reaching decisions on the operations and development of the Group the directors 
recognise these factors in their decisions as follows:
1. Employees
The Company is committed to equal opportunities in recruitment, training and career development and in the fair treatment of 
all employees regardless of their nationality, age, ethnic group, race, religious beliefs or gender, with selection only subject to 
satisfying the operational requirements in the country of deployment.
The Company believes that health and safety for our staff and our community are paramount. The Company’s policies and 
philosophies for Health, Safety and the Environment (HSE) are incorporated in the Staff Handbook and are available on the 
Company’s website, www.fortune-oil.com
2. Ethical and community business practice
The Company expects employees to have high ethical standards in all activities and the Staff Handbook details the Company’s 
code of conduct and anti-corruption measures including that for business gifts. Offering or receiving bribes is not permitted 
and all employees are required to maintain fair commercial behaviour with good judgment and a whistleblowing policy is in 
place for any concerns. 
The Code of Ethical Principles approved by the Board is available on the Company’s website, www.fortune-oil.com for the 
operations where the Group has direct management control. They are:
• Obeying the laws and regulations in the countries which the Group operates;
• Conducting operations in accordance with accepted principles of good corporate governance;
• Managers and employees respect the dignity of the individual and follow the ILO Core Conventions;
• Business dealings should respect the Group’s business principles;
• Open communications within the bounds of commercial confidentiality and regulatory constraints;
• Business integrity;
• Full disclosures in any circumstances that could give rise to a potential conflict of interests;
• Promoting and defending the Company’s legitimate business interests;
• Operations in accordance with the principles of fair competition; and
• Making a positive social contribution to the community.
47 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 corporate governance
Employees are made aware that obligations apply to them as a Group, whether working in China, Hong Kong, UK or 
elsewhere. These include maintaining confidentiality of the Company’s operations, precluding insider trading and acting  
in an ethical manner and avoiding conflicts of interest. The Group’s operating companies also provide assistance to their  
local community, for example through organising safety training programmes for gas customers and promoting local  
cultural activities.
Where the Group does not have direct management control it seeks to ensure that equivalent ethical standards are adopted 
and maintained at least to the level required in the relevant country of operation.
3. Relationship with customers and suppliers
Long-term business relationships are always built on trust, quality, innovation and flexibility. The Company recognises  
its responsibilities and carries out its business with high integrity with both customers and suppliers. For over 20 years 
Fortune Oil has been developing and operating projects for the safe and reliable supply of fuels to business and households; 
the joint venture partners in these businesses typically include state-controlled companies who are long-term suppliers of 
fuels to the projects.
4. Environment
The Company assesses its impact on the environment as part of its operational controls, for example through assessment  
of greenhouse gas emissions. Environmental impact studies and permits are required for certain projects, which have to be 
agreed with regulatory authorities.
Board Committees
The Board may delegate any of its powers to any committee consisting of at least two directors. The Board has established 
an Executive Committee, a Remuneration Committee and an Audit Committee with delegated duties and responsibilities. 
Whilst only Committee members are entitled to attend meetings, other directors are invited to attend from time to time to 
ensure the Committees’ responsibilities are undertaken with access to the Board’s full breadth of knowledge and experience. 
The Company Secretary is the secretary for all these Committees. The terms of reference of the Audit Committee and 
Remuneration Committee are available on the Company’s website, www.fortune-oil.com.
Board and Committee Meetings 
The Company’s non-executive directors are considered as either “management non-executive” or “investment partner 
non-executive.” While the management non-executives are encouraged to take an active role in the management of the 
Company, the investment partner non-executive was appointed to the Board for his connections in China which assist  
the Group’s business operations. The investment partner non-executive does not normally attend Board meetings of  
the Company and is not a member of Board Committees of the Company.
The Board holds regular scheduled meetings during the year as well as on ad hoc basis, as required by the business need. 
The Board determines the Company’s business strategy and monitors achievement of strategic aims and overall performance. 
The Board has delegated principal responsibility for the implementation of its objectives to the Executive Committee.
The Executive Committee directors meet informally with individual non-executive directors on a regular basis to obtain their 
views on Board and business matters. In addition, when directors are unable to attend a meeting, they are advised of the 
matters to be discussed and given an opportunity to convey their thoughts and make their views known to the chairman or 
vice-chairman prior to the meeting. It should be noted that the time commitment expected from non-executive directors is  
not limited to attendance at Board meetings. Their time is spent visiting the Group’s businesses and attending Company events. 
48 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 corporate governance
During the period, the non-executive directors have met without the presence of executive directors being present. Such 
sessions help to give a balanced overview of the Company. They have a particular responsibility to challenge independently 
and constructively the performance of the executive management. The executive directors and non-executive directors  
also meet outside formal meetings to discuss business issues. The investment partner non-executive is also available for 
consultation on specific issues falling within his particular fields of expertise. The Board is satisfied that all the directors are 
able to devote sufficient time to their duties to the Group.
The total number of Board and Committee meetings held between 1 January 2013 and 31 March 2014 and individual 
attendance by directors are shown below:

49 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 corporate governance
In addition to the Board members, a number of senior managers attend relevant sections of Board meetings by invitation.
The Board has delegated day-to-day operational development, implementation of its objectives for the Group and business 
management control to the Executive Committee, which comprises the executive directors and the senior managers of the 
Group. The Executive Committee is responsible for implementing Group policy, monitoring performance of the business and 
reporting to the Board thereon.
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by WANG Jinjun and additionally comprises Dennis CHIU, QIAN Benyuan and Ian 
TAYLOR. The names and qualification of each of the members are set out on pages 30 to 31. It determines on behalf of the 
Board the remuneration and benefits of the executive directors of the Company and senior executives of the Group. It also 
ensures that the annual review of the levels of awards remain appropriate in light of the Group’s current performance and 
prospects and aligned with the strategy and objectives of the Group. The Board as a whole determines the level of fees of  
the non-executive directors. 
The Remuneration Committee adopted terms of reference as required by Code provision D.2.1. The Remuneration 
Committee’s full report appears on pages 56 to 74.
The Audit Committee is chaired by Frank ATTWOOD, a chartered accountant, also the senior independent non-executive 
director, and additionally comprises of Ian TAYLOR, Louisa HO and MAO Tong. Each member for the committee brings 
relevant expertise and financial experience at a senior executive level. The names and qualifications of each of the members 
are set out on pages 30 to 31. The Audit Committee meets at least three times in a financial year and its agenda is linked  
to events in the Company’s financial calendar. Additional meetings are called whenever it is considered appropriate. The 
Committee invites relevant executive directors and management to attend the meetings as considered appropriate for  
the matters being discussed. The Board is satisfied that the Committee has the resources and expertise to fulfil effectively  
its responsibilities, including those relating to risks and controls. Further training can be provided to the members of the 
Committee as and when required.
Frank ATTWOOD is considered by the Board to have the significant, recent and relevant financial experience required for the 
provisions of the Code and the DTR7.1R of the Listing Rules.
The members of the Audit Committee are expected to have an understanding of the principles of and developments in 
applicable accounting standards as well as key aspects of the Group’s policies. They must use judgement in the presentation 
of annual accounts and any potential audit adjustments or the level of errors identified.
The role of the Audit Committee includes to:
– review the scope and cost of the external audit;
– consider any material matters affecting the Company and its financial reporting and reviewing significant financial  
reporting judgments;
– review the accounting presentation and carrying values for all material investments; 
– review the effectiveness of the internal financial control and internal audit activities;
– oversee the relationship with external auditor;
– consider the external auditor’s report and the findings of their work and confirmation that all significant matters had been 
satisfactorily resolved;
– review the Group’s whistle blowing policy, which allows staff to raise concerns in confidence about possible improprieties 
which would be addressed with appropriate follow-up action;
– meet with the external auditor to review planning of the nature and scope of the audit and update on relevant accounting 
developments; 
– review the outcomes of the work performed by the external auditor, any recommendations arising therefrom and the 
response of management;
– review the consistency of, ongoing appropriateness of, and changes to, accounting policies, consider the methods used 
to account for significant or unusual transactions; and
– monitor the Group’s relationship with its external auditor, the terms of engagement including engagement for non-audit 
services, and their independence and performance. 
50 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 corporate governance
The full committee meets with the external auditor at each of its’ meetings, and the chairman has additional meetings without 
management being present.
In discharging its responsibilities the most significant issues addressed by the Audit Committee in respect of the financial 
period as follows:
Matters reviewed and discussed during the Period included
In planning its work, the Audit Committee takes into account the significant financial reporting matters during the period 
which are likely to impact the financial statements and assess whether management have made appropriate judgements and 
estimates in respect of these matters. In forming these conclusions, the committee reviews reports by the external auditor 
which detail the audit work performed in respect of key judgements and the subsequent findings. 
During the Period, the Audit Committee has considered the following key matters, relating to:
– the impact and clarity of disclosure of the transaction with China Gas Holdings Limited;
– accounting for the joint ventures relating to the MKM Single Point Mooring facility; and 
– the need for impairment of the carrying value of the Armenia iron ore project.
China Gas Holdings Limited (CGH)
The completion of the sale of the Group’s gas business and the continuing participation in CGH as an associated company 
has been seen to require both judgement and careful presentation to shareholders. For part of the period the Group held a 
gas subsidiary, with a substantial gain realised on its disposal, and subsequently held investments in the CGH associate and 
hence was required to account the Group’s share of CGH’s results and dividends received.
There is a significant judgement around whether CGH should be recognised as an associate from Completion. The committee 
have considered whether the group, and separately its jointly controlled entity China Gas Group Limited, demonstrate 
significant influence over CGH. In support of this conclusion, the Committee have reviewed evidence of the group’s right to 
appoint executive directors in CGH and concurred with this affording such significant influence.
The Committee have discussed the methodology used by management, including the judgements made, to determine the 
provisional fair values allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities within CGH on recognition of the associate and the 
assumptions made in determining the Group’s share of CGH’s results. In addition, the Committee has discussed with the 
external auditors their work in respect of accounting for these key areas of audit focus. 
The Committee also considered the progress of its former gas business towards achieving the profit guarantee of HK$400 million 
for calendar year 2014. In assessing management’s judgement that the possibility of compensation is unlikely, the Committee 
have reviewed actual results for FGIH for the first six months of 2014 and forecast results for the year, and considered whether 
future performance expectations are achievable and the risks that could cause the guaranteed profit level not to be achieved.
The Committee endorsed the view that as well as reflecting profits relating to the CGH transaction in the income statement 
and statement of comprehensive income, it is useful to shareholders to present the profits from the Group’s interests in CGH 
in a separate table (on page 28) to facilitate a more meaningful analysis of the total contribution from the CGH investment. 
Impairment 
The Committee has considered whether the carrying value of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets may  
be impaired, and reviewed management’s report outlining the basis for the full impairment provision made in respect of  
the Group’s iron ore project in Armenia, as outlined in note 5 to the financial statements. As part of the assessment, the 
Committee has confirmed management’s intention to cease development activities in light of adverse project economics  
and has undertaken an in-country visit by the chairman of the Audit Committee to review this information on site and 
participate in discussions with relevant third parties. This served to confirm the difficulties of the market and of the key 
negotiations, such as to support the approach taken.

The Committee have assessed the judgements made by management in accounting for the dissolution and the new MKM 
joint venture, with a focus on the appropriateness of the classification of the new venture as an associate and the decision  
not to recognise post dissolution profits from the first joint venture through to the new joint venture as an associate. In forming 
these conclusions, the Committee discussed the status of negotiations with the joint venture partner with management and 
considered the constitution of the new joint venture.
On the basis of the above, together with confirmations from management and a report from the external auditor, the 
committee is satisfied that the judgements made by management are appropriate and that the required financial statement 
disclosures have been included and the committee is not aware of any material misstatements or unadjusted errors in the 
group financial statements.
Non-audit Services 
Deloitte LLP and its affiliates may be permitted to undertake certain non-audit services under the approval of the Board and 
Audit Committee, provided that the Board does not regard these non-audit services to threaten the auditor’s independence, 
given that the external auditor’s knowledge of the Group’s affairs provides significant advantages which other service 
providers would not have. The provision of non-audit services is assessed on a case-by-case basis to safeguard audit 
objectivity, and may involve a partner other than the audit engagement partner when appropriate. The Audit Committee set 
the following policy in respect of non-audit work to be undertaken by the auditor:
(1)  non-audit work costing less than £50,000 total in a year may be approved by management;
(2)  where non-audit work will exceed this amount such excess shall be approved only after consultation with the chairman  
of the Audit Committee; and
(3)  any non-audit service in excess of £100,000 is to be subject to consideration of competitive tender and the appointment 
should be approved by the CFO and the Audit Committee.
The on-going level of such fees will be monitored by the Finance Department, in consultation with the chairman of  
Audit Committee.
The total fees paid to Deloitte LLP in the period ended 31 March 2014 were £738,000 (at the year ended 31 December 2012: 
£355,000). The fees related to audit were £352,000.
The types of non-audit services to be performed by the external auditor may include assurance services, tax services – 
planning and compliance, due diligence and accounting consultations and support. No other services, e.g. selection, design 
or implementation of major financial systems, maintaining or preparing financial accounts; provision of out-sourced financial 
system or operational management function; valuation services, litigation support, any other services specifically prohibited  
by UK or other relevant legislation or regulation may be performed by the auditor. 
The objective is to ensure that the provision of such services does not impair or is not perceived to impair the external 
auditor’s independence or objectivity. 
It is recognised that the external auditor has a significant understanding of the Group’s business and finances and that this 
knowledge and experience can be utilised to the Group’s advantage in many areas. The external auditor also has a professional 
code of conduct, which deals with managing any conflicts of interest.
However, there is a need to balance these advantages against the need to maintain safeguards in those areas where there 
could be an external perception that the external auditor independence and judgment may have been impaired through the 
award of non-audit work.
During the financial period ended 31 March 2014, Deloitte twice provided non-audit services which are set out in more detail 
below. At both the half year and the interim report for twelve months ended 31 December 2013, Deloitte LLP confirmed that 
their independence and objectivity had been maintained. In addition, the Committee also reviewed these engagements to 
ensure that Deloitte LLP brought relevant skills and experience to the tasks undertaken, that adequate safeguards were in 
place to maintain the objectivity and independence of the audit, and that the fee levels relative to the annual audit are 
proportionate for the tasks being undertaken.
52 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 corporate governance
The non-audit fees were £386,000 (2012: £5,000) of which £200,000 were related to the services provided in respect of 
2012. As stated in the last annual report, the final fees for the non-audit services related to corporate finance services in 
respect of reporting accountants for the Class 1 transaction on the disposal of the Company’s natural gas business to China 
Gas Holdings Limited were subject to negotiation and would be billed and reported as non-audit fees in 2013. In 2013 
non-audit services represented the agreed upon procedures on two interim financial statements and reporting accountant 
services provided in relation to the issue of new ordinary shares as a loan settlement.
Further disclosure of the non-audit fees paid during the period ended 31 March 2014 can be found in note 4 to the Group 
financial statements.
Deloitte LLP has been the Group’s external auditor since 2008. The Audit Committee has recommended to the Board  
that Deloitte LLP is reappointed as external auditor. In making the recommendation it has taken into consideration the 
independence matters noted above and the past service of the auditor. The Board and the Audit Committee acknowledge  
the importance of, and greater investor scrutiny in respect of, tendering policy for the appointment of external auditor  
and will continue to monitor changes to the provision in the Corporate Governance Code and the findings of the  
Competition Commission.
In assessing the effectiveness of the external auditor, the audit committee carries out an evaluation on an annual basis, 
including assessment of independence, experience and expertise. As part of this assessment, the Committee discussed  
and agreed the audit plan scope with the external auditor, including their assessment of significant risks, monitored their 
performance against this plan and evaluated the quality of delivery of audit services and how key accounting and audit 
judgements were addressed.
In considering the year-end planning, the Audit Committee is satisfied that the Board has monitored and responded to 
changes in external risks. The external auditor conducted an audit planning meeting with the Audit Committee to discuss  
key audit matters and any concerns from either side. Impairment tests have been performed where necessary and due care 
and diligence has been applied in evaluating key judgement. These tests have been reviewed as part of the audit process.
The Audit Committee adopted terms of reference as required by Code provision C.3.2. which are available on the company 
website www.fortune-oil.com.
Internal Controls and Risk Review 
In accordance with the principles of the Code, the Board has overall responsibility for the internal control system of the Group 
with an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks. The risk management system in place 
is regularly reviewed by the Board and accords with the Code guidance. The system is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risks of failing to achieve business objectives and can provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
Risk management and corporate governance continue to be a priority on the corporate government agenda. The Group has 
an on-going risk management process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced and continues to 
embed a risk awareness and management culture throughout the Group. Risk Assessment and evaluation take place as an 
integral part of the Group’s annual cycle and this includes identification and consideration by senior management of major 
business risks.
A Risk Monitoring Panel comprises three non-executive directors: Frank ATTWOOD, MAO Tong and LIN Xizhong. It monitors 
management’s reviews covering material risk controls including governance, strategic, operating, regulatory, financial and 
funding for each of the Group’s business areas, which are classified into nine areas: six existing operations, one discontinued 
operation, one developing project and office management. Risk assessment scores based on standardised methodology 
were used at each of these areas. They provide guidance to the Group’s businesses in risk management and control systems. 
Mitigation plans were required to be in place to manage the risks identified. The assessments provide a mechanism for 
identifying any controls which may require strengthening and the Risk Monitoring Panel will support implementing and 
monitoring action plans to address any control weaknesses. These risk assessments are also to be reviewed as part of  
the Group’s internal audit process.
By these means a review of the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls is conducted at least annually. During 
the course of its review of the system of internal control for the financial period ended 31 March 2014 and the period to the 
date of this Annual Report, the Board has not identified or been advised of any failings or weaknesses which it has deemed  
to be significant. Therefore a confirmation in respect of necessary actions is not required.
53 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 corporate governance
The Group has monitored its position in relation to volatility in the financial markets, including its exposure to liquidity risk and 
counterparty default risk. Cash flow forecasts for the Group are prepared for the ensuing 18 months and key risks assessed, 
such as the ability to meet bank loan payments and covenants. Reporting arrangements seek to ensure that high-quality, 
well-controlled and timely management data is available together with regular management reports. With the cash resources 
of the Group and the undrawn borrowing facilities currently in place, the Committee is satisfied that management has put in 
place necessary arrangements reasonably to cover unexpected funding needs.
The Group has a proven system of internal financial controls and reporting procedures, which integrate the financial reports  
of the joint ventures and associate companies other than CGH, which is discussed separately below. The Board has 
established a process to examine and update these controls and procedures on an ongoing basis. There was no actual fraud 
or suspected fraud or alleged fraud found during the financial period or to the date of this Annual Report. The Executive 
Committee meets regularly to review the budgets, financial reports and forward cash flow projections for the Group, including 
its principal joint ventures and associate companies. The joint venture companies prepare monthly, six monthly and annual 
accounts. The Executive Committee is responsible for examining the formal system of internal controls and reports and 
modifying the system where changes in business activities and/or the external environment dictate.
The Group has an internal audit function. Internal audit reports are distributed to both executive directors and the Audit 
Committee to enable them to assess the effectiveness of the system of internal control. In addition, management actively 
participates in and conducts internal audits of joint ventures and associated companies on a periodic basis. Bluesky 
maintains its own internal audit function which reports to its Board.
The Executive Committee is responsible for establishing guidelines and procedures for the evaluation and development of 
new investment proposals open to the Group. The Executive Committee formally reviews the financial projections and the 
risks inherent in new proposals before submitting significant capital expenditure projects to the Board for its approval.
Most of the Company’s activities are conducted through subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated companies which have 
their own boards of directors, management structures and accounting/reporting procedures. In all the joint ventures, the 
Company has directors on the boards and its own staff members seconded to key management positions, such that the 
Company can monitor and has the ability to influence operational decisions. The Company has developed and implemented 
internal systems, risk assessments and controls similar to those already in place elsewhere in the Group to support the 
Group’s move into natural resources outside China.
In view of the sale of the Company’s natural gas business to CGH, we have assessed the risks in various finance functions 
through a Separation Plan exercise. The finance functions being assessed included organisation, financial reporting, budget 
and forecast, management reporting, taxation, internal controls and treasury & cash management. The finance function within 
Fortune Oil remained unchanged post completion save that additional resources (temporary and/or permanent) might be added 
to cover the need to maintain a watch on Fortune Gas post completion for profit claw back control. Within Fortune Gas, the 
finance function has been integrated with that of CGH but the representative director of Fortune Oil on the Board of CGH 
have access to ensure appropriately independent accounts for the Company’s natural gas business for calendar years 2013 
and 2014 have been and will be prepared in accordance with the Sale and Purchase Agreement. 
A significant proportion of the Group’s profits arise from their interest in CGH and in these operations the Group does not 
have dominant board control or control of day-to-day operations. The Group is therefore dependent upon the decision 
making processes and internal controls put in place by CGH. CGH is a company listed in the Main Board of Hong Kong Stock 
Exchange and it has complied stated that with the code provisions set out in the Code on Corporate Governance as contained 
in Appendix 14 of the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited, except for 
Code provision A.4.1., the requirement that non-executive directors should be appointed for a specific term and be subject to 
re-election. The Group seeks involvement in these decision making processes, using its right to appoint directors, monitoring 
the results of internal controls and using its right to access trading information to reduce the risk associated with such 
non-controlled entities. In addition, the external auditor report issued by CGH’s auditors has been circulated to the Group’s 
audit committee and certain members have met with CGH’s audit committee to further the Group’s understanding of the 
internal controls and processes of CGH and representatives of management.

55 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 Introduction
This report addresses the activities of the Remuneration Committee for the fifteen month period from 1 January 2013 to  
31 March 2014 (“the Reporting Period”). It sets out the remuneration policy and remuneration details for the executive and 
non-executive directors of the Company and is presented in accordance with Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts & Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 (‘the Regulations’). This is the first time the 
Group has prepared a report in accordance with these Regulations. This report also meets the relevant requirements of the 
Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority and the principles of The UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’).
Accordingly, we have divided this report into three sections, the Remuneration Committee Chairman’s Annual Statement,  
the Directors’ Remuneration Policy and the Annual Report on Remuneration. The Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be 
subject of a binding shareholder vote at the 2014 AGM and, subject to shareholder approval, the policy will take effect  
from 26 September 2014. It is expected that the policy will be applied for a term of three years. However, if there is a review 
of remuneration arrangements, any change to the policy will be put forward for shareholder approval. The Annual Report  
on Remuneration, which sets out how our directors were paid in the period ended 31 March 2014 and details plans for 
implementation of policy going forward and other regulatory-required information. It will be subject to an advisory shareholder 
vote at the 2014 AGM.
The Companies Act 2006 requires the auditor to report to shareholders on certain parts of the report and to state whether  
in their opinion, those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Regulations. The parts of the 
Annual Report on Remuneration that are subject to audit are indicated in that report. The Annual Statement and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy are not subject to audit. 
unaudited Information
Remuneration Committee Chairman
This is the first Remuneration Report presented by your Company since the implementation of the new statutory regulations. 
It is also the first report following the very significant China Gas transaction and the First Marvel Investments Limited series of 
transactions. These events have changed the dynamic of the Group with the reduction of the proportion of assets and income 
which are directly controlled by the Group on one side and on the other side the level of control that large shareholders are 
able to exert. The Remuneration Committee has started to work through the implications of these changes for the Group 
going forward in line with the development of the Group’s operating strategy. However, the impact on remuneration policy,  
if any, has not yet been reflected in changes in the policies brought forward from previous years and it is not yet clear whether 
there will need to be changes in overall policy rather than a realignment of individual director’s remuneration structure.
Remuneration for executive directors is structured to relate to the overall performance of the Group. The Group has established 
a relatively simple remuneration structure and the Committee consider that this continues to serve the Group well. A mix of 
personal and Group performance targets drive performance based remuneration. However, where there is a very material 
transaction being undertaken that will have a significant effect of the overall return to shareholders it is considered that a 
special arrangement for incentivising management may be appropriate.
The Committee also takes into account the need to maintain safe and environmentally considerate operations but with the 
move towards a much greater part of the Group’s operations no longer being directly controlled encouraging rather than 
enforcing standards has had to become the approach and therefore the incorporation of such non-financial measures within 
the matrix for executive directors has become more difficult. 
During the Reporting Period the Committee considered individual performance criteria and awards for executive directors of 
options and benefits under the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). It also considered the impact of the change of year end and 
the financial period being 15 months this time and it approved administrative changes in respect of time related awards. The 
decision by TEE Kiam Poon to step down as chief executive raised difficult questions in a time of flux as highlighted earlier. 
The decision was taken to appoint Dr TIAN Jun as acting chief executive pending finalisation of the strategic considerations  
of the shape of the Group for the next few years and the role and functions of a Group chief executive going forward. No 
definitive decision has been taken on this matter. In addition, the appointment of Ms LI Ching as an executive director  
to the Board of China Gas has raised issues that are also being considered. Whilst the Company is still in the temporary 
period during which the performance of the Group’s former Gas Division may have an impact on the right of China Gas to 
reclaim part of the consideration from the Company it was felt that Ms LI continuing as an executive of the Company was 
considered appropriate. This matter will be considered again in 2015.

Group Performance section of the Strategic Report of this annual report on page 13 has provided a detail discussion of  
the performance of the Group (please refer to that section for explanation).
As a public limited company, the Company has a fiduciary responsibility to maximise long term value for shareholders.  
Thus, variable elements of remuneration are dependent upon the achievement of performance measures that are identified  
as key sustainable growth drivers for the business and that are aligned with the creation of shareholder value. The 
remuneration package links corporate and individual performance and this incentivise executives to meet the specific 
Company’s key objectives.
During the Reporting Period, special bonuses have been made for those employees who were responsible for delivering key 
elements of the disposal of the gas business to China Gas Holdings Limited. A further payment is expected to be made upon 
the meeting of profit guarantee target from the Group. Basic salaries have roughly been remained constant when comparing 
the annualise basic salaries for the 15 months ended 31 March 2014 with those for the twelve months ended 31 December 
2013. No options and/or LTIP have been granted to any of its directors or employees for the 15 months ended 31 March 
2014. For the year ended 31 March 2015, management expects that basic salaries should remain unchanged.
The Committee welcomes any feedback from shareholders to understand whether this report meets with their expectations. 
As the remuneration policy is unchanged we have not consulted with shareholders on policy matters during the Period, but 
will do so in the future when appropriate.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy
Overview
The policy is structured to ensure it supports shareholders’ interests and aligns the interests of shareholders and management. 
In addition, the remuneration packages for executive directors and senior executives are designed to attract, retain and 
motivate individuals of the highest calibre to further the success of the business and to link the rewards of executives to  
the long-term success of the Group through incentive share and bonus scheme arrangements linked to appropriate Key 
Performance Indicators and strategic aims.
Remuneration Policy Table
This table describes the key components of the remuneration arrangements for executive directors for the Period and 
beyond. No changes to the structure of remuneration are proposed for financial period 2014-15.
Element and links to strategy
Base salary
To attract and retain directors who have the 
capability to implement Group strategy and 
control Group operations.
To reflect the value of the individual and to 
recognise individual responsibility.
Operations 
Salaries are reviewed annually or following a significant change  
in responsibility.
Salary levels take into account the role, performance and general  
growth in salaries across the senior management team and the industry  
in relevant locations.
Opportunity and performance metrics 
Salary increases are applied in line with the outcome of the review.
In respect of existing executive directors salary increases are expected to  
be in line with the general increase of salaries of the senior management. 
However, in the case of a material change of role and responsibility the 
Committee may consider an exceptional increase in line with such change.

Annual bonus
All directors, executives and regular 
employees are eligible to participate  
in the scheme (non-executive directors  
may not participate in the scheme).
Operations 
The annual bonus is set at the start of each year to be earned as a result  
of the achievement of personal goals which are set to drive achievement  
of individual and Group annual business goals.
Opportunity and performance metrics 
Personal performance and contribution to business objectives linked to 
corporate profitability.
The bonus for achieving on-target performance is a maximum of  
25 per cent of basic salary. The maximum bonus is 50 per cent of basic 
salary for significant over-achievement, except for employees in the Trading 
Department whose bonus is based on certain percentage of annual trading 
profits and therefore bears no reference to basic salary. The total amount  
of all bonuses payable shall not exceed 10% of gross annual profit; and
Two types of performance criteria will be considered in connection with  
the award of the annual bonus and they are:
Personal Performance Criteria
The personal performance criteria of the executive directors and senior 
executives are the same as those defined in the Long Term Incentive Plan, 
the 2004 Share Schemes and their annual work objectives.
Financial Performance Criteria
The financial performance criteria are based wholly on challenging financial 
performance targets. For executives and employees assigned to business 
units and joint ventures, the financial performance criteria are tied to the 
annual budget of their business units or joint ventures, which is approved  
by the appropriate board.
For head office executives and employees, the financial performance criteria 
are tied to the profit attributable to equity shareholders (“Attributable Profit”). 
For this purpose, 15 per cent growth per annum is considered the target.
Special bonus
The Committee may make discretionary 
special bonus awards where exceptional 
performance results in significant benefits 
to the Group. Such bonuses are considered 
on a case-by-case basis and the payment 
of a material part of any such bonus is 
dependent upon continuing exceptional 
performance over a pre-determined number 
of years and/or achievements of key tasks.
Operations 
To provide linkage between exceptional projects or situations and the 
delivery of value for shareholders.
Upon a special situation arising the key executives involved and the value  
to shareholders will be determined and a decision taken on the extent of  
any special bonus and its terms.
Special bonuses are limited to no more than 100% of salary and may  
be paid in either cash or shares with extended vesting periods at the 
Committee’s discretion.
Opportunity and performance metrics 
Special bonus payment terms will be set prior to the start of the project 
although a determination as to the extent that such payments are made  
in cash or shares is made when the size of the total and the period over 
which the project is expected to show its value in known.

Benefits
To assist directors to perform their duties 
more effectively. 
Operations 
Benefits are based on local legislation and market practice and whether  
the executive is based in his/her home country or posted or recruited  
from abroad. The principal benefits are the provision of an accommodation 
allowance, club membership fees, car park allowance and reimbursed  
driver expenses.
Opportunity and performance metrics 
Benefits vary by role, location of the executive and local practice.
Benefits are set upon recruitment or upon appointment to a new role. 
Benefits are not usually amended or rebased unless a new role or  
location occurs.
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards in Senior Executive Incentive Plan (SEIP)
To align shareholder interests with 
executives and to incentives executives  
to achieve long-term performance and 
commitment to the Group. The aim of the 
SEIP is to motivate individuals to achieve 
profitable and sustainable growth for the 
Company by giving them an opportunity  
to accumulate a meaningful participation  
in the share capital of the Company,  
as a reward for achieving outstanding 
returns for shareholders.
Operations 
Conditional nil cost share awards are made following recommendations 
made by the Committee. The awards normally vest at the end of  
the three-year performance period, subject to the achievement of  
the performance conditions and continued employment with possible 
increase of the awards between the 3rd and 6th anniversary.
The number of shares, if any, over which the options granted pursuant to  
the Plan is subject to personal and Company performance criteria being 
met. If the personal performance criteria are achieved then the share option 
will give the director or executive conditional rights over a certain number  
of shares. If the Company performance criteria are achieved then the 
number of shares subject to the option will be increased. Failure to meet  
the Company performance criteria will not reduce the number of shares over 
which the director’s or executive’s option subsists by virtue of the personal 
performance targets having been met. Each option is a nil cost option over 
ordinary shares in the Company.
Other than in exceptional circumstances, options will only be exercisable 
after three years from the grant. They will lapse after the tenth anniversary  
of grant if not exercised before that date. When an option is exercised on  
or after the third anniversary of the grant and the Company’s performance 
criteria in that three year period have been met then the number of shares 
under the option will be increased. If the director or executive delays 
exercising the option until four or five years from the date of grant and  
the Company’s performance criteria in the three year period have been  
met then the number of shares under the option will be further increased.
The personal performance criteria are an objective measure of productivity  
of the individual and all people working directly for that director or  
executive. They are set at the time the option is granted and will have  
two thresholds reflecting:
(i) good (significantly above average) performance; and
(ii) exceptional performance
The Remuneration Committee determines whether the performance levels 
have been met, based on personal objectives for the year and in line with  
the Company’s Key Performance Indicators and strategic aims.
The Company performance criteria are an objective measure of economic 
performance of the Company. The performance criteria are set at the time 
the option is granted and will have two thresholds reflecting:
(i) good (significantly above average) performance; and
(ii) exceptional performance

Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards in Senior Executive Incentive Plan (SEIP) continued
The Company’s performance criteria chosen by the Remuneration 
Committee for options granted are weighted 60% in respect of increased 
Attributable Profit and 40% in respect of total shareholder return (“TSR”). 
TSR is measured as being the increase in share value plus all dividends  
paid. In relation to TSR, the performance of the Company is considered  
to be “good” where TSR increases by 15 per cent or more per annum  
on average and “exceptional” performance is where TSR increases by  
20 per cent or more per annum on average. In relation to Attributable  
Profit, the performance of the Company is considered to be “good” where 
Attributable Profit increases by 15 per cent or more on average per annum 
and “exceptional” performance is where Attributable Profit increases by  
20 per cent or more on average per annum.
Opportunity and performance metrics 
Awards are conditional upon continued employment and achievement  
of profitable and sustainable growth for the Group, Profit Attributable to 
Equity Shareholders and Total Shareholder Return.
The maximum number of shares over which awards may be made is restricted 
to 5% of the issued share capital of the Company from time to time.
The maximum award made to the executive directors and senior executives 
was 50% of base salary and the minimum was 25% of base salary.
The LTIP rules also prevent individuals from receiving shares if their 
cumulative entitlement would exceed 3.5% of the issued ordinary shares  
of the Company, from time to time.
The number of shares over which the nil cost option is over is increased 
dependent upon the company performance and how long after the end of 
the 3rd anniversary the vested share are removed from the EBT as follows:
On or after 3rd anniversary but before 4th anniversary
Good performance 20% Excellent 40%
On or after 4th anniversary but before 5th anniversary
Good performance 40% Excellent 100%
On or after 5th anniversary but before 6th anniversary
Good performance 100% Excellent 200%

management contributing to overall 
Company performance.
Awards are made by the Committee and 
are over shares held by the Employee 
Benefit Trust (EBT).
The 2004 Approved Scheme and the 2004 
Unapproved Scheme expired in 2014, 
being ten years after their adoption by 
shareholders although share options that 
were granted under their rules will remain 
exercisable until the last of their normal 
lapsed dates, which is October 2021.
Operations 
The two share option plans are open to employees who do not have (or  
have not had in the last twelve months) a material interest in the Company 
(i.e. more than 25% of the ordinary share capital). The exercise price is 
specified at the time the options are granted and must not be significantly 
less than their market value at that time. An option will normally be 
exercisable following the third anniversary of grant and before the tenth 
anniversary of its grant, provided the participant remains in employment  
and subject to satisfaction of the performance conditions set by the 
Remuneration Committee from time to time.
Opportunity and performance metrics 
For the CSOP the market value of shares for which a participant may hold 
unexercised options is limited to £30,000, calculated at the time the option 
is granted. In principle, an individual cannot be entitled to shares under 
option to a value of more than six times his earnings. The total number  
of shares over which options are granted in any ten year period (whether 
exercised or not), when added to all such options granted under all other 
share schemes of the Company including the SEIP, shall not exceed 10%  
of the fully diluted ordinary share capital of the Company in issue at that time.
The Unapproved Plan has the same rules as the CSOP save that the 
statutory limit of £30,000 worth of share options per participant does not 
apply. However, no participant may receive options worth more than one 
times their annual salary in any one year and no participant may receive  
an option whereby the number of shares received under this scheme,  
when aggregated with the shares under any other scheme including the 
senior executive Incentive Plan, exceeds 3.5% of the issued ordinary share 
capital of the Company, from time to time. The exercise price on grant may 
be set at a level other than the market value of the shares at the time of 
grant of the option. In principle, an individual cannot receive options if he 
would be entitled to shares under option to a value of more than six times  
of his earnings.
Notes to the Remuneration Policy Table
Payment from Existing Awards – executive directors are entitled to receive payments or other benefits from any award prior  
to the approval and implementation of the Remuneration Policy.
Remuneration Policy for Other Employees – The Company’s approach to annual salary review, annual bonus etc. is consistent 
across the Group and is applied to senior executives who are not executive directors. Given the complexity of the Group’s 
cross border structure share incentives are not generally awarded to employees who are not senior executives.
Remuneration for Founding Executives – the Group vice chairman is a founding director. He and the Committee continue to 
hold the view that the significant shareholding held by him provides a sufficient alignment of his interests with those of the 
Company. In light of this his remuneration package consists of a below market rate salary and limited benefits and he does 
not participate in any LTIP or share schemes.
61 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 remuneration report
Explanation of Performance Metrics Applied
The Company’s performance criteria chosen by the Committee for options granted under the LTIP are weighted 60% in 
respect of increased Attributable Profit and 40% in respect of total shareholder return (“TSR”).
TSR is measured as being the increase in share value plus all dividends paid. In relation to TSR, the performance of the 
Company is considered to be “good” where TSR increases by 15 per cent or more per annum on average and “exceptional” 
performance is where TSR increases by 20 per cent or more per annum on average. In relation to Attributable Profit, the 
performance of the Company is considered to be “good” where Attributable Profit increases by 15 per cent or more on 
average per annum and “exceptional” performance is where Attributable Profit increases by 20 per cent or more on average 
per annum.
The Committee is not aware of any listed companies of similar size and composition whose main business activities are 
comparable in nature to that of Fortune Oil PLC. As a result, there were no comparator group of companies or sectors whose 
performance were considered appropriate to be used to benchmark the performance of management. These performance 
criteria were chosen by the Committee after consultation with the Company’s financial and legal advisers. The Committee is 
satisfied that these criteria represent a challenging and transparent financial measure which can be calculated from published 
accounting information.
Application of the Policy Illustrations
The charts below provide estimates of the potential future reward opportunities for each executive director, and the potential 
split between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: “Minimum”, “In line with 
expectation” and “Maximum”. These calculations exclude any effect on share awards of appreciation in the Company’s share 
price or of the Committee determining that a special opportunity exists and putting in place a special bonus. In addition, 
these calculations do not include any benefit that may arise by a decision taken by an executive in respect of past LTIP 
awards that are left in the EBT after the third anniversary of grant.

Internal Appointments
Remuneration for new executive directors appointed by way of internal promotion will similarly be determined in line with  
the policy for recruiting from external. Where an individual has commitments made prior to his promotion to the Board,  
the Company will honour these pre-existing arrangements in accordance with their original terms.
Policy on External Appointments
Executive directors may accept external appointments with the prior approval of the Board as non-executive directors of 
other companies and retain any related fees paid to them. These appointments must not be with a competing company  
and their duties must not materially dilute or adversely affect the executive director’s contribution under the terms of his/her 
appointment with the Group. Directors may usually retain payments arising from such appointments. 
Daniel CHIU, the executive director, retained fees for acting as a non-executive director for a company listed in Hong Kong.
During the Period, LI Ching, an executive director has accepted an appointment as an executive director of China Gas Holdings 
Limited (CGH), an associate of the Company following completion the transfer of the Fortune Gas business to CGH. This was 
one of the terms of the transfer and Ms LI was nominated to become one of the two directors to the board of CGH to oversee 
the Company’s interest in respect of Fortune Gas businesses. Her appointment in CGH was effective on 10 January 2014.
The Board is satisfied that the external appointments do not interfere with the performance of Mr CHIU and Ms LI’s duties for 
the Company.
63 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 remuneration report
Termination Policy
The Company’s policy is to limit termination payments and not make any payments save in accordance with the terms of  
their service contract or in compliance with its legal obligation if more generous. Where the executive has accrued rights 
under any incentive plan the Committee will make such payment or release such shares as is in accordance with the rules 
which in general permit all fully vested rights to be paid, options exercised or removed if shares. Where the Committee has 
discretion over whether to permit either unfettered or restricted continuation of rights such discretion will be utilised so as  
to balance the reward for the performance by the executive and the failure to continue in employment throughout the term  
of an award or to reach performance criterion. In certain circumstances the exercise of such discretion may be done only  
with the consent of shareholders. 
The Company applies in general the principle of mitigation in the event of early termination on its own particular merit. The 
Committee expects directors and senior executives to mitigate any losses arising on termination but will tailor its approach  
to individual cases. In any event under relevant law and regulations applicable to these senior executives the notice to be 
given is less than twelve months and any payment in lieu of notice would be equal to or less than the basic salary for the 
notice period.
Non-executive Directors
Non-executive directors are appointed by letters of appointment and do not have contracts of service or contracts for service. 
Non-executive directors appointments will be for a fixed term not exceeding three years and, following the implementation  
of the Companies Act 2006, those appointments are normally renewable, with the consent of both parties, for terms not 
exceeding two years, and subject to election and re-election by the Company’s shareholders in accordance with the 
Company’s articles and the Code. Their letters of appointment setting out their duties and the time commitment expected.
Their appointment may be terminated on one month’s notice by either the director concerned or the Company with no 
predetermined compensation amount on termination.

Policy on Remuneration of Non-executive Directors and the Chairman
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Performance metrics 
To attract and retain non-executive 
directors of the highest calibre with 
relevant experience. 
Fee level are reviewed against market 
rates and market conditions, time 
commitment and responsibility.
Any fee increases are applied in  
line with the outcome of the review.
The policy on remuneration of  
non-executive directors is determined 
by the Board.
By reference to market practice  
in companies similar in size to  
the Company.
The fees payable to six non-executive 
directors are ratified by the Board  
after discussion between the  
executive directors.
Fixed fees plus reimbursement of 
expenses for attending Board and  
other meetings.
No additional fees are payable  
for acting as senior independent  
director or as chairman or member  
of Board Committees.
Non-executive directors are not eligible for performance-related bonuses or awards under the Company’s SEIP or any of the 
Company’s share option schemes.
The setting of the chairman’s remuneration is the responsibility of the executive directors and not the Remuneration 
Committee in accordance with the Code D.2.2. The fees paid to the chairman include his time for performing his additional 
role on the Remuneration Committee.
Pursuant to the Company’s articles of association, the fees payable to non-executive directors are limited to £400,000 per 
annum in the aggregate. This level was established following approval by the shareholders at the AGM held in 2007. The total 
fees paid to non-executive directors were £236,000 for 15 month period ended 31 March 2014 (2012: £182,000).
Approach to Recruitment Remuneration
When setting the remuneration package for a new executive director the Committee would seek to apply the same principles 
and implementing the Policy framework set out in the tables above.
Base salary would be set at a rate appropriate to the role and experience of the director being appointed. This may include an 
agreement on future increases up to a market rate in line with increased experience and responsibilities. Any future increases 
would be subject to a performance review being completed satisfactorily.
The Committee may also make an award in respect of a new appointment to “buy out” incentive arrangements forfeited on 
leaving a previous employer. In doing so, the Committee will consider relevant factors including any performance conditions 
attached to these awards and the likelihood of those conditions being met to ensure that the value of the buy-outs are no 
greater than the fair value of the awards they replace.
In the case of internal appointments the remuneration for new executive directors will similarly be determined in line with  
the policy for external appointees, as detailed above. Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their 
promotion to the Board, the Company will continue to honour these arrangements. Incentive opportunities for below Board 
employees are typically no higher than for executive directors, but measures may vary if necessary.
In recruiting a new non-executive director, the Committee will use the policy as set out above. A base fee would be payable 
for Board membership, with additional fees payable for acting as senior independent director or as chairman or member of  
a Board Committee as appropriate.
65 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 remuneration report
Consideration of Conditions Elsewhere in the Group
The Committee considers the pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group when determining remuneration  
for executive directors. Whilst the Committee does not currently consult specifically with employees on the Executive 
Remuneration Policy, it consults with and receives updates on employee pay arrangements from the Group’s Human 
Resources Department and takes this into consideration when reviewing executive remuneration.
Consideration of Shareholders views
When determining remuneration, the Committee takes into account best practice guidelines issued by institutional 
shareholder bodies. The Committee is open to feedback from shareholders on Remuneration Policy and will continue to 
monitor trends and developments in corporate governance and market practice to ensure the structure of the executive 
remuneration remains appropriate. Further detail on the votes received on the 2012 Directors’ Remuneration Report is 
provided in this Annual Report on Remuneration on page 67.
Audited Information
Annual Report on Remuneration
Remuneration Committee Membership in 2013
The Committee members are WANG Jinjun (Chairman), Dennis CHIU, QIAN Benyuan and Ian TAYLOR, all of whom are 
non-executive directors of the Company.
The Board is satisfied that none of the Committee members have any personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, 
in the matters to be decided and no conflicts of interest arising from cross directorship. Each member has been determined 
by the Board to be independent in character and judgement and no director plays a role in deciding his own remuneration. 
No member of the Committee has been an executive director or employee of any Group company.
Role of the Committee
The Committee determines the remuneration policy as applied to the executive directors of the Company and senior 
executives of the Group. The Remuneration Committee is also responsible for approving changes to the Company’s share 
option schemes and also for approving share option grants. In determining the executives to participate in share option 
schemes, the extent of such participation and the conditions attaching thereto the Committee consults with the executive 
vice-chairman and an appropriate executive director. 
The Remuneration Committee’s terms of reference are available at www.fortune-oil.com.
Advisers to the Committee
The Committee has access to professional advice from appropriate internal and external sources, as it considers necessary. 
The Company did not in the Period retain any external remuneration consultants.

Incentive Outcomes for Financial Period to 31 March 2014
During the Period, no general business activity bonuses were paid to executive directors. At the commencement of the period 
it was determined that the successful closing of the Gas Division sale and the integration of the Gas Division into China Gas 
would warrant special bonuses. Such special bonuses were determined as being up to 50% of executives’ salaries and given 
the varied input into the process and the non-financial assessment of the level of success, e.g. closing could occur on the 
planned day or could be delayed for regulatory reasons not being correctly handled, the assessment of the quantum to be 
applied was subject to non-objective testing.
All the bonuses detailed in the schedule “Single Figure Table of Remuneration for Executive Directors in 2013/2014” on  
page 67 relate to Gas Division sale activities and were all paid in cash during the Period.
Scheme Interests Awarded in the Period
The Remuneration Committee considered whether it was appropriate to make awards of option under the LTIP in the SEIP. 
Following due consideration and on consulting the vice-chairman, it was agreed that no awards of LTIP options should  
be made for the Reporting Period in the SEIP as the Group failed to achieve three out of six of the KPIs and share price 
performance had been unsatisfactory.

 In respect of the 2009 awards the performance period was from 29 June 2009 to 23 June 2012, based upon the parameters for determining 
the quantum of any additional awards the Remuneration Committee of the Board advised the Trustees of the EBT that the performance for 
this period was “Excellent” and that they authorised the increase in the number of ordinary shares in June 2013 the subject of relevant options. 
There was no consideration for this additional award. The number of shares to be awarded will depend upon the decision taken by each 
beneficiary as to when he/she remove their shares from the EBT. Ms LI Ching has removed 474,240 shares out of the EBT in November 2013.
There were no grants of options in LTIP pursuant to the SEIP in the Reporting Period.
LTIP awards were made in the form of nil cost options. They depend on the satisfaction of personal performance targets 
measured over a one-year personal performance period. The 2012 notional bonus awards made by the Company’s 
Remuneration Committee for the performance period 1 June 2012 to 31 May 2013 under the SEIP were as follows:

 All employee salary and bonuses are computed by taking the total earnings of all employees for the relevant period less executive directors 
and dividing by the average number of employees for that period. For the Period the amount so computed was reduced by taking 12/15ths 
to reflect the fact that the Period was 15 months.

WANG Jinjun
Chairman, Remuneration Committee
24 July 2014
74 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors are 
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law). Under Company law the directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them  
to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding  
the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and  
other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair  
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
• the strategic report, which is incorporated into the directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken  
as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

75 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 Opinion on financial statements of Fortune Oil PLC 
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at  
31 March 2014 and of the Group’s profit for the period then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and,  
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the lAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Other Comprehensive 
Income, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Financial Position, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement  
and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Parent Company Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders’ 
Funds and the related notes 1 to 32. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group 
financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Going concern
We have reviewed the directors’ statement on page 32 that the Group is a going concern. We confirm that:
• we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial 
statements is appropriate; and
• we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as  
a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy,  
the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team:
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Investment in China Gas Holdings Limited (CGH)
During the period, the Group completed the sale of the 
Fortune Gas Group to CGH, resulting in Fortune owning  
a significant stake in CGH, held in part through subsidiaries 
of the Group, and in part through China Gas Group (CGG), 
a jointly controlled entity. Management has concluded that 
the Group and CGG have significant influence over CGH 
and therefore it is an associate. This is a key judgement.
Having determined CGH to be an associate, the application 
of equity accounting in the Group’s consolidated financial 
statements requires fair values to be allocated to the 
identifiable assets and liabilities within CGH at the date of 
acquisition, including determination of values of the acquired 
intangible assets and goodwill, which requires significant 
judgement. Provisional fair values have been estimated and 
will be finalised within twelve months of the acquisition date. 
We have obtained the signed sale and purchase agreement 
for the transaction and reviewed the key terms, paying 
close attention to factors relevant to Fortune’s ability to 
influence CGH, such as Fortune’s right to appoint directors 
and Fortune’s ability to participate in CGH’s decision making 
processes. Based on the evidence obtained, we evaluated 
management’s conclusion that CGH should be accounted 
for as an associate.
We assessed whether management’s determination of the 
provisional fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities of 
CGH was based on reasonable methods and assumptions 
and the underlying data used. We checked management’s 
calculations to determine the gains arising from the 
transactions and their share of results of CGH, including 
amortisation charges in respect of the provisional fair value 
adjustments and including assumptions used in respect of 
the cut off date from which equity accounting was applied.
independent auditor’s report to the members  
of Fortune Oil PLC
76 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Assessment of the fair value of the potential liability  
under the profit guarantee requires management to  
makes estimates about the expected future results  
for the gas Group which impact the resulting valuation.  
No fair value has been recorded on grounds of materiality. 
In evaluating management’s conclusion in respect of  
the fair value of the potential profit guarantee obligation,  
we reviewed actual results and forecast future results for 
FGIH and performed sensitivity analyses on management’s 
assessment of the range of potential settlements and their 
associated probabilities.
Impairment
Assessment of the recoverability of the carrying value  
of the Group’s non-current assets, including fixed assets, 
exploration and evaluation assets and investments, is 
judgemental and requires estimates of future cash flows, 
which are based on management’s view of future business 
prospects and operational decisions, as well as future costs 
and commodity prices and appropriate discount rates. The 
outcome of impairment assessments could vary significantly 
if different assumptions were applied. The Group’s Armenian 
Iron Ore Project was fully impaired, following an impairment 
assessment during the period. 
We have evaluated management’s assessment of whether 
there are any indicators for impairment, including external 
and internal factors such as declining commodity prices, 
adverse market conditions or fall in the value of investees’ 
net assets below their carrying value. Where impairment 
tests were required, we challenged the significant 
assumptions underpinning management’s estimates, 
including discount rates, growth rates, future commodity 
prices and forecast prospects of the business, including 
comparing future metal price and cost assumptions to 
current levels and market forecasts and benchmarking 
discount rates against comparable companies.
Our work included assessment of the latest status and 
future plans for the Armenia Iron Ore Project through 
discussions with operational staff, as well as review  
of capital expenditure plans and budgets.
Expiry and renewal of MKM Joint venture Agreement 
The term of Fortune’s “joint venture” Single Point Mooring 
Facility (SPM) with Sinopec, MKM, expired during the period 
and was subsequently renewed under revised terms, 
resulting in a decrease in the Group’s shareholding to 33%. 
In order to account for the revised venture, management was 
required to assess the level of control or influence the Group 
has over the new venture. Management concluded that the 
new MKM venture should be accounted for as an associate, 
rather than as a subsidiary or jointly controlled entity.
Further judgement and complexity was involved in 
assessing the Group’s entitlement to MKM’s net assets  
on dissolution and participation in the profits of the  
SPM business during dissolution.
We assessed management’s judgement that the Group  
has significant influence over the new venture, and that  
the venture is an associate. Our work included obtaining 
and reading documentation in respect of the new venture, 
including the association agreement, focusing on the key 
factors relevant to Fortune’s ability to influence the new MKM.
In respect of Fortune’s share of distribution of assets on 
dissolution, we obtained latest documentation relating to  
the dissolution of the previous MKM venture and assessed 
management’s estimate of the amount receivable.
Furthermore, we evaluated management’s judgement not  
to recognise any share of profits from the SPM between 
expiry of the previous MKM venture and formation of the 
new venture. significant degree of uncertainty around their 
distribution. In assessing this, we reviewed the venture 
agreement for evidence of provisions determining how  
such profits should be shared and assessed the status 
The Audit Committee’s consideration of these risks is set out on page 51.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a 
whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not 
modified with respect to any of the risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
independent auditor’s report to the members of Fortune Oil PLC
77 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the 
scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £5 million, which represents approximately 2.5% of pre-tax profit, and below 
1.5% of equity. Materiality has been determined using a combination of net assets and profit before tax based metrics as  
the basis as no single benchmark was deemed appropriate following the significant changes to the Group during the period, 
which had a significant impact on both consolidated income statement and consolidated balance sheet.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £100,000 as 
well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the 
Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, 
and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level.
Based on that assessment, we identified four components, which together comprise the Group’s continuing business, plus 
the discontinued operations. Each of these four continuing components was subject to a full scope audit. Two of these 
components were audited directly by the Group audit team by visiting the Group’s head office in Hong Kong while the remaining 
two were audited by separate component audit teams working in both Hong Kong and mainland China. Audit work at these 
components was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each component, up to a maximum component materiality  
of £2.5m, which is lower than Group materiality.
Our work in relation to the discontinued operations was performed by the Group team and was focused on testing the 
accounting for the disposal transaction, together with substantive analytical procedures on the pre-disposal period.
The Group audit team followed a programme of planned visits that has been designed so that the Senior Statutory Auditor  
or a senior member of the Group audit team visits the component auditors during the course of each audit. In performing the 
audit for the period ended 31 March 2014, the Senior Statutory Auditor visited the component auditors in Hong Kong twice.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial period for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns. We have nothing to report arising from these matters.
independent auditor’s report to the members of Fortune Oil PLC
78 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report 
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information  
in the annual report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the 
course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired 
during the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and 
whether the annual report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the audit committee which we 
consider should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements. 
Other matters
Although not required to do so, the directors have voluntarily chosen to make a corporate governance statement detailing  
the extent of their compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. We reviewed the part of the Corporate Governance 
Statement relating to the company’s compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have 
nothing to report arising from our review.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of  
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express  
an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. We also 
comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that 
our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated 
professional standards review team, strategically focused second partner reviews and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and/or those further matters we have expressly agreed to report to them  
on in our engagement letter and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report,  
or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial 
and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements  
and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

84 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 General information
Fortune Oil PLC is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act. The address of the registered 
office is given on the back cover page. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the 
strategic report on pages 4 to 29.
1. Accounting policies
Basis of accounting
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)  
and related interpretations from the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and those parts  
of the Companies Act applicable to companies reporting under IFRSs. The financial statements have also been prepared  
in accordance with IFRSs adopted for use within the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU  
IAS Regulations.
The Company has changed its financial year-end date from 31 December to 31 March. Accordingly, the Company’s statutory 
accounts will be in respect of the 15 months to 31 March 2014. The change is to align the Company’s financial year-end  
with China Gas Holdings Limited (“CGH”) to facilitate the efficiency of preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial 
statements and accounts.
Following the decision to dispose of the Group’s shareholding in Fortune Gas Investment Holdings Limited (“FGIH”) and  
its sub-group to CGH (the “FGIH Transaction”), it has been classified in the consolidation financial position as held for sale 
starting at 31 December 2012 until completion of its disposal in August 2013 and in addition the Maoming SPM business is  
in dissolution following the expiration of the joint venture contract in February 2013. Consequently, the results of the Group’s 
natural gas business and the Maoming SPM business are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated income 
statement and cash flow statement for the 15 months ended 31 March 2014, and the results for the year to 31 December 
2012 have also been presented on the same basis.
Adoption of new and revised standards
In the current year, the Group has applied, for the first time, the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations, 
which are effective for the Group’s financial period beginning 1 January 2013, but have not had any significant impact on  
the financial statements.
IFRS 1 (amended)  Government loans
IFRS 7 (amended)  Disclosures: Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
IFRS 13  Fair value measurement
lAS 1 (amended)  Presentation of financial statements — other comprehensive income
lAS 19 (revised)  Employee benefits
lAS 32 (amended)  Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
Annual improvements to IFRS 2009-2011 cycle (various standards).
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations, which have not been 
applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective:
From the year beginning 1 January 2014
IFRS 10  Consolidated financial statements
IFRS 11  Joint arrangements
IFRS 12  Disclosure of interests in other entities
lAS 27 (revised)  Separate financial statements
lAS 28 (revised)  Investments in associates and joint ventures
From the year beginning 1 January 2015
IFRS 9 Financial instruments Classification and measurement

for the period ended 31 March 2014
85 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 notes to the group financial statements
for the period ended 31 March 2014
1. Accounting policies continued
The Group did not early adopt any of these new or revised standards, amendments to standards and interpretations to 
existing standards. The Group is in the process of assessing the impact of these new or revised standards, amendments to 
standards and interpretations to existing standards on the Group’s results and financial position in the future. The directors  
do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the 
Group in future periods, except as follows:
1. IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments;
2. IFRS 10 may impact the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements as it provides a single basis for 
consolidation with a new definition of control;
3. IFRS 11 may result in changes in the accounting of the Group’s jointly-controlled entities that are currently accounted  
for using proportionate consolidation. Under IFRS 11, a joint arrangement is classified as either a joint operation or a joint 
venture, and the option to proportionately consolidate joint ventures has been removed. Interests in joint ventures must  
be equity accounted; and
4. IFRS 12 will impact the disclosure of interests Fortune Oil has in other entities such as subsidiaries, joint arrangements, 
associates and/or unconsolidated structured entities.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until  
a detailed review has been completed.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of certain properties, 
available for sale investments and share-based payments. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings and 
include the results of jointly controlled entities and associates. The results and net assets of subsidiary undertakings acquired 
or disposed of during a financial year are included in the Group income statement and statement of financial position from the 
effective date of acquisition or to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. All intra-group transactions, balances, income 
and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the 
Group’s equity therein. 
Subsidiary undertakings have been consolidated using the acquisition method of accounting and jointly controlled entities  
are included in accordance with the accounting policies noted below. For each business combination, the interests of 
non-controlling shareholders may be initially measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share  
of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition 
basis. Where the Group has acquired assets held in subsidiary undertakings that do not meet the definition of a business 
combination, purchase consideration is allocated to the net assets acquired and the interests of non-controlling shareholders 
are initially measured at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the net assets value of the acquiree’s identifiable 
net assets. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at 
initially recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income  
is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

1. Accounting policies continued
Where the Group increases its ownership interest in a subsidiary undertaking, goodwill may arise and is calculated as  
the difference between the consideration paid for the additional interest and the carrying amount of the net assets of  
the subsidiary. A gain or loss may arise where the Group decreases its interest in a subsidiary without the loss of control, 
calculated as the difference between the consideration received and the carrying amount of the interest disposed of including  
a proportionate share of goodwill. 
Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity  
transactions. The carrying amount of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the 
changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling 
interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed  
to the owners of the Company.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the 
aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous  
carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), less liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. Amounts 
previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary are accounted for (i.e. reclassified to profit 
or loss or transferred directly to retained earnings) in the same manner as would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities 
are disposed of. The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded 
as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement or, when applicable, the costs on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity.
Going concern
The Company’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, 
are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 15 to 20. The financial position of the Company, its cash flows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities are described in the Strategic Report (Financial Review) on pages 25 to 29.
In presenting the financial statements on a going concern basis, the directors have considered both the business activities 
and key risk and uncertainties as set out in the Strategic Report on pages 23 to 24. In addition, the directors have considered 
the factors: the Group’s ability to generate cash flows, the financial resources available to it, forecast compliance with bank 
covenants and exposure to credit risk. Based on the Group’s cash flow forecasts and projections and taking into consideration 
a range of potential scenarios and sensitivities and how these may impact on cash flows, facility headroom and bank covenants, 
the Board is satisfied that the Group has reasonable expectation to operate within the level of its facilities for the foreseeable 
future. The Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its preparing its Annual Report and accounts. 
Investments in the PRC
In respect of major infrastructure projects, the Group’s investment in an undertaking in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) 
is made with one or more other parties under a “joint venture” arrangement, with the parties involved taking an agreed interest 
in the issued share capital of the undertaking. The arrangement is intended to provide necessary financial and operational 
support to the project as well as providing strong local connections and typically an arrangement will include at least one 
representative from the PRC. The arrangement is supported by a “joint venture agreement” between the parties that specifies 
the terms of the arrangement, including details regarding the structure and composition of the board of directors and practical 
working arrangements. The amount of equity interest and the terms of the joint venture agreement will generally determine 
whether the investment is recorded as a subsidiary or jointly controlled entity, primarily based on the control of the board and 
the ability to control the strategic financial and operating policies of the undertaking.
87 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 notes to the group financial statements
for the period ended 31 March 2014
1. Accounting policies continued
Subsidiary undertakings
The Group’s interest in subsidiary undertakings comprises investments in undertakings where the Group either holds in 
excess of 50 per cent of the issued share capital of the undertaking and owns more than half of the voting power or where 
the Group otherwise has the power to control the strategic, financial and operating policies of the undertaking concerned.
Jointly controlled entities
The Group’s interests in jointly controlled entities comprise investments in undertakings where the Group does not control  
the undertaking but exercises joint control of the strategic financial and operating policies of the undertaking concerned by 
agreement. Jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Associates
The Group’s interests in associates comprise investments in undertakings where the Group exercises significant influence, but 
neither joint control nor control, over the strategic financial and operating policies of the undertaking concerned. Associates 
are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Equity method
Under the equity method, investments in jointly controlled entities and associates are carried in the consolidated balance 
sheet at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any 
impairment in the value of individual investments. The net assets of the jointly controlled entity or associate used under  
the equity method are adjusted to fair value at the date of acquisition using similar principles to those applied on acquisition 
of a subsidiary, as described below. Losses of a jointly controlled entity or an associate in excess of the Group’s interest in 
that jointly controlled entity or associate are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive 
obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. Where a group entity transacts with an associate of the Group, 
profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the relevant jointly controlled entity and associate.
Because of the importance of jointly controlled entities and associates to the Group, the Group presents revenue including 
share of jointly controlled entities and associates as additional information on the income statement, to facilitate a fuller 
understanding of the Group’s results.
Other investments
Investments are recorded at cost less provision for impairment to the extent considered necessary.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair 
value less cost to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and 
the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the 
sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
When the Group is committed to a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all of the assets and liabilities of that 
subsidiary are classified as held for sale when the criteria described above are met, regardless of whether the Group will 
retain a non-controlling interests in its former subsidiary after the sale.

1. Accounting policies continued
Goodwill arising on acquisitions
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). 
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests  
in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over the net of the 
acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill arising from an acquisition is allocated to each of the relevant  
cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. 
A cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an 
indication that the unit may be impaired. When the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying 
amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit first, 
and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment 
loss for goodwill is recognised directly in the consolidated income statement. An impairment loss for goodwill is not reversed 
in subsequent periods.
On subsequent disposal of the relevant cash-generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill capitalised is included in  
the determination of the amount of profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisition before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UKGAAP amounts 
subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated as to write off the cost of assets less their residual values over their expected 
useful lives using the straight-line basis method, as follows:
Motor vehicles, fixtures and fittings and yacht 3 to 6 years
Single point mooring buoy and related equipment  6 to 18 years (over the term of the contract)
Leasehold property/improvements  over the leasehold period
LPG tanks and facilities  20 years
Storage tanks and jetty  3 to 38 years
Pipelines  20 to 30 years (over the term of the contract)
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.
Oil and gas development assets
Oil and gas development assets represent the cost of developing the commercial reserves discovered and bringing them into 
production, together with exploration and evaluation (“E&E”) expenditures incurred in finding commercial reserves transferred 
from intangible E&E assets.
Depreciation is calculated on the net book values of producing assets using the unit of production method from the date  
of first commercial production. The unit of production method refers to the ratio of production in the reporting year as a 
proportion of the proved and probable reserves of the relevant field, taking into account future development expenditures 
necessary to bring those reserves into production.
Producing assets are generally grouped with other assets that are dedicated to serving the same reserves for depreciation 
purposes, but are depreciated separately from producing assets that serve other reserves.
89 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 notes to the group financial statements
for the period ended 31 March 2014
1. Accounting policies continued
Intangible assets
The intangible assets have definite useful lives. Such intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the  
following periods:
Software  5 years
Club debentures  10 years
Technology rights  40 years
Distribution rights  28 – 30 years
Software, gas distribution rights and technology rights
Software, gas distribution rights and technology rights are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation which is charged  
to the income statement over the estimated life of the intangible asset. Amounts acquired from third parties are initially 
recognised at fair value and then amortised.
Exploration and evaluation assets
The Group adopts the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas related exploration and evaluation costs,  
and similar policies are applied to the Group’s mining activities. All licence acquisition, exploration and evaluation costs  
and directly attributable administration are initially capitalised in well, field or exploration area cost centres, as appropriate. 
Interest payable is capitalised insofar as it relates to specific exploration and development activities. These costs are  
then written off unless the exploration and evaluation activity is related to an established discovery for which commercially 
recoverable reserves have already been established or at the balance sheet date, exploration and evaluation activity has not 
reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of commercially recoverable reserves. Pre-licence 
costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Capitalised exploration and evaluation costs are not amortised. 
At a future date, when it is determined that these costs will be recouped through successful development and exploitation,  
it is intended that expenditure will be transferred to property, plant and equipment.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
The carrying amount of the Group’s assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is 
recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised  
in the income statement.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
Prepaid lease payments
Prepaid lease payments represent the purchase cost of land use rights in the PRC and are charged to the income statement 
on a straight-line basis over the terms of the relevant leases.
Leasing
The Group as lessor
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
The Group as lessee
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Inventories
Inventories held in the trading business are valued at net realisable value. Other inventories are valued at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated 
selling expenses. Cost is determined on the first-in first-out basis and includes all costs incurred in acquiring the inventories 
and bringing them to their present location and condition.

Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the board of directors of the 
Company who are responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the period/year comprises both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the expected tax payable 
on the taxable income for the period/year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, and any 
adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all deductible temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary 
differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in jointly controlled entities where the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary difference cannot be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse  
in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset  
is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised.
Under the prevailing PRC income tax law and its relevant regulations, foreign corporate investors are levied PRC dividend 
withholding tax at a rate of 5% or 10%, unless reduced by tax treaties or arrangements, on dividends declared by PRC-resident 
enterprises for profits earned subsequent to 1 January 2008. Deferred tax liabilities have been recognised in respect of the 
undistributed earnings to the extent that remittance is probable in the foreseeable future.
Foreign currencies
The functional and presentation currency of Fortune Oil PLC is pounds sterling. The functional currencies of foreign 
operations are the currency of that primary economic environment in which it operates. In the financial statements of 
individual Group companies, the Group translates foreign currency transactions into the functional currency at the rate of 
exchange prevailing at the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated  
into the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising are 
taken to profit and loss.
Exchange differences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is  
neither planned nor likely to occur, which form part of the net investment in a foreign operation, are recognised in the 
translation reserve.
As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are retranslated into the presentation currency of 
Fortune Oil PLC at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and their income statements are translated at the 
average exchange rate for the period/year. The exchange differences arising on the retranslation are taken directly to a 
separate component of equity. On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that  
particular foreign operation shall be recognised in the income statement.
The Group has elected not to record cumulative translation differences arising prior to the transition date as permitted by 
IFRS 1. In utilising this exemption, all cumulative translation differences are deemed to be zero as at 1 January 2004 and  
all subsequent disposals shall exclude any transaction differences arising prior to the date of transition.

Financial instruments
Trade receivables and payables
Trade receivables do not generally carry any interest and are normally stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate 
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. Trade payables are generally not interest-bearing and are normally stated at 
their nominal value.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments  
that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liability and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements  
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after  
deducting all of its liabilities.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group has entered into derivative financial instruments by granting options for future investment in Fortune subsidiary 
undertakings. Further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in note 25.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the share subscription agreement was entered into and are 
subsequently re-measured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit  
or loss immediately.
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is 
recognised as a financial liability. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining 
maturity of the instrument is more than twelve months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within twelve months. 
Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Transaction costs are incremental costs  
that are directly attributable to the issue of a financial asset or financial liability, including fees and commissions paid to 
agents, advisers, brokers and dealers, levies by regulatory agencies and securities exchanges, and transfer taxes and duties. 
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and 
the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest 
method except for borrowing costs capitalised for qualifying assets.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Available for sale financial assets
Available for sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated or not classified as financial assets at fair 
value through profit or loss, loans and receivables or held-to-maturity investments.
For available for sale equity investments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair value 
cannot be reliably measured and derivatives that are linked to and must be settled by delivery of such unquoted equity 
instruments, they are measured at cost less any identified impairment losses at each balance sheet date subsequent to  
initial recognition.
Available for sale financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets are 
impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of 
the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the financial assets have been impacted. For an available for sale equity 
investment, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of that investment below its cost is considered to be objective 
evidence of impairment.
On de-recognition of available for sale financial assets, gains and losses previously recognised in the available for sale reserve 
are recycled to the income statement.

1. Accounting policies continued
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of  
the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the 
balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. When a provision is measured 
using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flow.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for 
goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and sales related taxes. Sales of gas are 
recognised when goods are delivered and title has been passed. In respect of oil trading transactions, where the Group  
does not act as the principal, then only management fees and commission are recognised as revenue.
Revenue from connection fees is recognised in full once the connections work has been completed as the Group remaining 
obligation is inconsequential. For those projects which span more than one accounting period, revenue is recognised in 
proportion to the stage of completion of activity.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established 
(provided that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be  
measured reliably).
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate 
applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial 
asset to that asset’s net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Share-based payments
The cost of providing share-based payments to employees is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of  
the related share options or share allocations. The cost is based on the fair value of the options or shares granted and the 
number of awards expected to vest. The fair value of each option is determined using an appropriate pricing model at the 
date of granting. Market related performance conditions are reflected in the fair value of the share. Non market related 
performance conditions are allowed for using a separate assumption about the number of awards expected to vest.
Treasury shares
Company shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trust are presented within reserves until such time  
as the interest in shares is transferred unconditionally to the employees. Costs of administering the trust are charged to  
the income statement as incurred.
Pensions
The Group does not operate any pension schemes that carry obligations similar to defined benefit arrangements. 
Contributions to social benefits for employees are charged to profit as incurred.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, 
seldom equal the related actual results. The main estimates and judgements that have the most significant effect on the 
amounts recognised in the financial statements are as follows:
a) Acquisition of business assets
IFRS 3 Business Combinations applies to a transaction or other event that meets the definition of a business combination. 
When acquiring new entities or assets, the Group applies judgement to assess whether the assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed constitute an integrated set of activities and thus whether the transaction constitutes a business combination,  
using the guidance provided in the standard. In making this determination, management evaluates the inputs, processes  
and outputs of the asset or entity required.
b) Carrying value of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets
The Group reviews the carrying value of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets each year to ascertain if 
there are any indications of impairment. This assessment, and any impairment testing, requires the use of certain judgements 
and estimates regarding the future cash flows expected to arise from the asset and a suitable discount rate. The carrying 
amount of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets at 31 March 2014 are shown in notes 11 and  
12 respectively.
c) Recoverability of exploration and evaluation assets
Determining whether an exploration and evaluation asset is impaired requires an assessment of whether there are any 
indicators of impairment, including by reference to the specific impairment indicators prescribed in IFRS 6 Exploration for  
and Evaluation of Mineral Resources. If there is any indication of potential impairment, an impairment test is required based 
on the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell of the asset. The calculation requires the entity to estimate the 
future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present 
value. The carrying amount of exploration and evaluation assets at 31 March 2014 is shown in note 12.
d) Taxation
Tax provisions are made based on the Group best estimate of the amount expected to be paid. Tax legislation is open to 
interpretation and accordingly, tax provision may change as agreement is reached with the relevant taxation authority. Full 
provision is made for deferred taxation at the rate of tax prevailing at the period end dates unless future rates have been 
substantively enacted. Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is considered more likely than not they will be recovered, 
taking into account the nature of the losses, and the certainty of the relevant offsetting income streams.
e) Reserve estimates
Proven and probable reserve estimates are based on reviews undertaken using standard recognised valuation techniques. 
The amount that will ultimately be recovered cannot be known with certainty until the end of the asset life.
94 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 notes to the group financial statements
for the period ended 31 March 2014
1. Accounting policies continued
f) Profit guarantee
As part of the FGIH Transaction, the Group will compensate CGH on a dollar for dollar basis where the net profits for the 
natural gas business for FY2013 are less than HK$200 million (approximately £16 million) or are less than HK$400 million 
(approximately £32 million) in 2014. This compensation agreement is not subject to any cap.
As FGIH’s profit for 2013 is over HK$200 million, there is no liability in respect for the 2013 clause. Management believe  
the FGIH business within CGH is on target to meet the profit guarantee for 2014 and the possibility of the compensation  
is unlikely and the fair value of the obligation has been estimated on the basis of the weighted average of the possible 
outcomes to be immaterial, no liability for compensation has been recognised as at 31 March 2014.
g) Accounting for CGH as an associate – significant influence
The assessment of whether or not CGH is an associate involves judgement as to whether significant influence exists. As  
the Company does not direct control at least 20% of the voting rights, there is a presumption that there is no significant 
influence. However, management regards CGH as an associate primarily by virtue of the Group’s nomination rights and its 
participation in CGH’s decision making processes together with the Group’s voting rights. As part of the FGIH Transaction, 
the Group has a right to appoint the managing director and another of the executive directors of CGH. Mr Liu was already  
the existing executive chairman, managing director and president of CGH at the date of completion of the FGIH Transaction. 
Subsequently, the Group also nominated Ms Li Ching a director of the Group to the Board of CGH. The right to appoint  
two directors, combined with the fact that these directors actively participate in Board meeting indicates that the Group  
has significant influence over CGH.
h) Accounting for CGH as an associate – fair value assessment
As CGH is regarded as an associate, the Group and CGG are required to apply equity accounting to their investments  
in CGH. Equity accounting requires the Group and CGG to restate net book value of identified assets and liabilities within  
the associate to fair value at the initial recognition and to recognise any goodwill within the associate. The assessment is not 
yet complete at the date of the annual report, therefore, the management has used provisional fair value estimates for the 
purposes of the Group’s 31 March 2014 financial statements and amortised fair value uplifts to property, plant and equipment 
and intangible assets over 25 years. Provisional fair values allocated will be finalised in the twelve months following completion 
of the transaction.
i) Deferred consideration on acquisition of Everthriving Energy
The purchase agreement for Beijing Everthriving Energy Technology Co. Ltd (“Everthriving Energy”) in 2010 specifies that 
additional consideration of RMB 50 million (£4.8 million) is payable after certain conditions are met, including receipt of 
government approval for refitting marine diesel oil-LNG dual fuel technology, execution of not less than 1,500,000 tons of 
marine diesel oil-LNG dual fuel refitting, and obtaining government approval for six LNG refuelling stations along Yangtze river. 
The directors consider it probable that all of the conditions will be met by September 2020 based on the development of the 
project to date, and therefore a provision for additional consideration of £1.3 million has been recorded from the date of 
acquisition, using a discount rate of 17.8%.

2. Segmental reporting
The Group has adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments to identify eight operating segments on the basis of internal reports 
about components of the Group which are reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker in order to allocate 
resources to the segment and to assess its performance.
The Group has classified the operating divisions and the reportable segments under IFRS 8 as “Investment in China Gas 
Holdings Ltd”, “Natural Gas”, “Single point mooring facility”, “Aviation Refuelling”, “Trading”, “Products Terminal”, “Resources” 
and “Others”.
Information regarding these segments is presented below.

In November 2013, CGH allotted and issued 184 million ordinary shares to the Company’s subsidiaries (representing 3.68%  
of CGH’s share capital), to satisfy the second tranche of consideration for the FGIH Transaction (US$200 million equal to 
£142.2 million). This amount includes the amount receivable by non-controlling interest of FGIH as the Group acquired that 
entity’s rights and obligations under the FGIH Transaction in October 2013 (see notes 28 and 29).
As explained further in note 1(h), CGH has been treated as an associate of CGG and of the Group from completion.
Following dissolution of Maoming King Ming Petroleum Company Limited (“MKM”), a new venture “New MKM” was formed  
as an associate of the Group to continue the Single Point Mooring business (see note 30).

From Completion of the FGIH disposal, CGH became an associate of the Group and CGG and thus became accounted for 
under the equity method. Under the equity method, the Group and CGG recognise their respective shares of the profit, net 
assets and other equity movements of CGH but after adjusting the net assets of CGH to fair value at Completion. This uplift 
to fair value is applied to the separately identifiable individual assets and liabilities of CGH after which any further uplift to 
reflect the fair market value of the CGH shares at Completion is treated as goodwill within the associate. This uplift creates  
a disconnect between the carrying value of CGH in the Group’s balance sheet, which is higher than the corresponding share 
of CGH’s net assets as reported by CGH. These fair value adjustments have been determined provisionally as at 31 March 
2014, and will be finalised during the twelve months following Completion with any adjustments arising reported at the next 
reporting date.
From Completion onwards, under equity accounting the market value of the investment in CGH is no longer directly reflected 
in the Group’s balance sheet, however, any future decrease in CGH’s share price, which is significant and prolonged, is 
objective evidence of impairment which would be charged to the Group’s income statement in the future period in which the 
impairment arises. Absent any such impairment, the fair value uplift adjustments will be amortised generally over the lives of 
the underlying assets and liabilities of CGH that were uplifted to fair value, as an additional charge against the Group’s share 
of CGH’s profit.
Therefore, the share of CGH’s results and net assets reflected in the Group’s financial statements cannot be connected 
directly to those reported by CGH itself.

in order to fund the Group’s near-term capital expenditure, particularly the capital expenditure relating to FGIH through to  
the date of disposed, and to provide additional general working capital. The Loan Notes were settled by way of the issue of 
the 99,373,000 ordinary shares of the Company, with the balance of approximately US$80,000 of principal and all accrued 
interest paid in cash in October 2013.
In October 2013, the Group entered into a new loan facility of £180 million (US$300 million) with Morgan Stanley Asia Limited 
(“Morgan Stanley”), of which £72 million (US$120 million) had been drawn down by the Group at 31 March 2014 and £108 
million (US$180 million) remains undrawn. The loan is guaranteed by the Company, secured over various of the Group’s 
subsidiaries. It is with a term of three years and a margin of 2.75 per cent above LIBOR. The loan has been used to repay  
the existing syndicated loan, provide the Group with working capital, and finance new investment.
The Group has fully complied with the covenants attached to all bank loans. These covenants relate to total equity, net 
borrowings to total equity and EBITDA to gross interest paid of the Group.

At the balance sheet date the Group had unused tax losses of £8,887,000 (2012: £4,207,000) arising from operations in  
the PRC, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom. No deferred tax asset was recognised in respect of such tax loss due to 
unpredictability of future profits.
Other deferred tax principally relates to undistributed profits. From 2008, dividends distributed overseas by foreign invested 
enterprises in China were subject to tax. The tax rate is 10% for Bluesky and Maoming Single Point Mooring dividends and 
5% for West Zhuhai Terminal. There are no material temporary difference associated with investments in subsidiaries, 
associates and interests in jointly controlled entities for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised.

In 2011, the Group acquired an interest in three mining licences. Part of the purchase consideration includes a payment of 
£6.7 million deferred until 2015, which has been discounted at a risk free rate at 1.95%.
The purchase agreement for Everthriving Energy in 2010 specifies that additional consideration of RMB50 million  
(£4.84 million) is payable after certain conditions are met, including receipt of government approval for refitting marine  
diesel oil-LNG dual fuel technology, execution of not less than 1,500,000 tons of marine diesel oil-LNG dual fuel refitting,  
and obtaining government approval for six LNG refuelling stations along Yangtze river. The directors consider it probable, but 
not certain that all of the conditions will be met by September 2020 based on the development of the project to date, and 
therefore a provision for additional consideration of £1.3 million (2012: £1.2 million) has been recorded, using a discount rate 
of 17.8% to reflect the uncertainty.

For 15 months ended 31 March 2014, the Group recognised a charge of £299,000 (for twelve months ended 31 December  
2012: £700,000) related to share-based payments transactions, which included the LTIP charge. Disclosures required  
under IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’ in respect to the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”), which details are included  
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report, have been omitted because the amounts involved are not material.
24. Reserves
Foreign currency translation reserve 
The foreign currency translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial 
statements of the PRC, Hong Kong and Armenian operations. 
Treasury shares 
The shares are held by JTC Trustees Limited as the trustee for future distribution to employees.
Following the shareholder approval at the AGM on 25 June 2004, the 2004 Senior Executive Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) had 
been operated by the trustee of the Company’s Employee Benefit Trust, subject to the rules of the Long Term Incentive Plan 
(the “LTIP”) as amended in 2004. On 24 June 2009, shareholders have approved the renewal of the LTIP and Plan at the AGM 
(with details on pages 59 to 60). There is a specified Remuneration Committee Policy in relation to the operation of the Plan 
under the LTIP rules.
The total number of shares held in the name of JTC Trustees Limited is 78,131,403 (2012: 85,496,806). The nominal value  
of these shares is £578,000 (2012: £678,000). 
At 31 March 2014, the investment represented 3.0 per cent (2012: 4.3 per cent) of the called up ordinary share capital of 
Fortune Oil PLC. Additional details are given in the Remuneration Report. 
The market value of shares was £9,571,097 at 31 March 2014 (2012: £8,977,165).
Other reseves 
As at 31 March 2014, other reserves are comprised of share of capital contribution on acquisition of available for sale financial 
assets in jointly controlled entities and share of other reserves in jointly controlled entities and associates (see note 28(5)).

25. Financial instruments
Significant accounting policies
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted (including the criteria for recognition, the basis of
measurement and the bases for recognition of income and expenses) for each class of financial asset, financial liability
and equity instrument are disclosed in note 1.
a) Categories of financial instruments
Amount in £’000 31.03.14 31.12.12

Financial liabilities at amortised cost 131,514 143,115 
Derivative financial liabilities – 68 
Financial liabilities 131,514 143,183 
Financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on 
the degree to which the fair value is observable:
• Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets 
or liabilities;
• Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liabilities 
that are not based on observable market date (unobservable inputs).
The fair value of the derivative financial liabilities were determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models  
based on the fair value of Fortune Liulin Gas Company Limited. The fair value measurements were derived from valuation 
techniques that include inputs that are not based on observable market data and as such have been classified as a Level 3 
fair value measurement.
There are no transfers between levels during the year.

Market risk
i) Currency risk
At present, no foreign exchange hedging is undertaken by the Group. However, management monitors the related foreign 
currency exposure closely and will consider hedging significant foreign currency exposure should the need arise. The carrying 
amount of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents and borrowings denominated in foreign currency is as follows:
Cash and cash equivalents Borrowing
Amount in £’000 31.03.14 31.12.12 31.03.14 31.12.12
US dollars 16,769 14,897 102,566 104,844
HK dollars 382 7,727 – –
Chinese renminbi 39,997 50,703 6,409 16,991
The following table details the Group sensitivity to a 5% increase and decrease in the relevant foreign currencies against GBP. 
5% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents 
management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The table shows the decrease in 
equity that would result from a 5% strengthening of the GBP against the relevant currency. A 5% weakening of the GBP 
against the relevant currency would increase equity by an equivalent amount.

The following table details the Group sensitivity to a 5% increase and decrease in the relevant foreign currencies against 
RMB. 5% is the sensitivity rate use when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and 
represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The table shows the 
impact on profit of a 5% strengthening of the RMB against the relevant currency. A 5% weakening of the RMB against  
the relevant currency would have an equivalent, opposite impact on profit.

Profit or (loss) (1,111) (39) (1,412) (1,108)
ii) Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk in relation to variable-rate bank borrowings. (See note 18 for details of 
these borrowings).
The Group’s borrowings at the balance sheet date were as follows:
Amount in £’000 31.03.14 31.12.12
Non-interest bearing – –
Floating rate 108,975 111,792
108,975 111,792
The Group cash flow interest rate is mainly concentrated on the fluctuation of LIBOR, HIBOR and the PRC prevailing 
borrowing rate.
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for variable-rate. If interest  
rates had been 0.5% higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the period ended  
31 March 2014 would decrease or increase by £681,000. (2012: decrease or increase by £559,000).
114 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 notes to the group financial statements
for the period ended 31 March 2014
25. Financial Instruments continued
iii) Commodity price risk
The Group generally considers the volatility in commodity prices to be part of its business environment and accordingly does 
not hedge market risk resulting from fluctuations in gas and oil prices. The Group holds no financial instruments which are 
sensitive to commodity price risk.
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the 
Group. Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalent and trade and other receivables.
For cash and cash equivalent, the Group deposits money into state-owned banks and regional banks, with high credit-ratings 
assigned by international credit-rating agencies. For trade and other receivables, the Group has adopted a policy of only 
dealing with creditworthy counterparties, and monitors the credit risk by scrutinising customers’ profiles and periodical review 
of ageing of amounts due. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated. 
Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by the management.
The maximum exposure to credit risk in 2014 is £107,707,000 (2012: £75,229,000) which is the total cash equivalents and 
trade and other receivables.
Liquidity risk management
In the management of liquidity risk, the Group monitors and maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents deemed adequate 
by the management to finance the Group’s operations and mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows. In addition, the 
Group has aggregate letter of credit facilities, which are floating rate, of £352,489,000 (US$586,541,000) (2012: £115,183,000 
(US$186,136,000)) as at 31 March 2014.
The average interest rate incurred on debt for the period ended 31 March 2014 is 4.31% p.a. (2012: 4.62%).

Maturity profile of financial liabilities
The maturity profile of the carrying amount of the Group’s non-current borrowings is as follows:
Amount in £’000 31.03.14 31.12.12
One to two years 36,058 43,581
Between two and five years 32,098 –
68,156 43,581
Interest 3,959 3,273
Cash flows 72,115 46,854
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives are to return capital to shareholders while leaving the Group with sufficient funds to progress its short, 
medium and long-term growth plans as well as preserving the financial flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they 
may arise. This policy remains unchanged. Following disposal of the major subsidiary, FGIH during the year, the main source 
of future funding will be dividend income from jointly controlled entities and associates which will be used to partially fund 
acquisitions and the ongoing development of the Group. In addition, the Group utilises external borrowings, which were 
renegotiated in the prior year, as detailed in note 18.
The Group actively reviews and monitors its capital structure on a regular basis to maintain a healthy gearing ratio which is 
net debt/(cash) divided by shareholders’ funds. For this purpose the Group defines net debt/(cash) as borrowings less cash 
and cash equivalents. The Group’s total cash is held in demand and term deposits. Shareholders’ funds comprise share 
capital, share premium and reserves attributable to the Company’s shareholders as shown in the consolidated statement of 
financial position. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the payment of dividends, issue 
new shares, raise new debt financing or sell assets to reduce debt.

Externally imposed capital requirement
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Profit guarantee
As part of the FGIH Transaction, the Group will compensate CGH on a dollar for dollar basis where the net profits for the 
natural gas business for FY2013 are less than HK$200 million (approximately £16 million) or are less than HK$400 million 
(approximately £32 million) in 2014. This compensation agreement is not subject to any cap.
As Management believe the FGIH business within CGH is on target to meet the profit guarantee and the possibility of the 
compensation is unlikely, and the fair value of the obligation has been estimated on the basis of the weighted average of the 
possible outcomes to be immaterial, no liability has been recognised as at 31 March 2014.

Sub notes
1. Loans of £3,606,000 (December 2012: £5,349,000) comprised mainly loans to the non-controlling shareholders. A £1,450,000 loan to  
the non-controlling shareholders of Beijing Everthriving Energy Technology Company Limited at 31 December 2012 (and at the end of the 
period, full amount was impaired) is unsecured, interest free and without fixed payment terms. A £3,606,000 (December 2012: 
£3,899,000) loan to the non-controlling shareholders of Bounty Resources Armenia Limited is guaranteed, interest bearing at a margin of 
4% over LIBOR p.a. and repayable in June 2014.
2. Maoming Petrochemical Corporation (MPCC) is a corporate shareholder of the Group’s former subsidiary, Maoming King Ming Petroleum 
Company. Throughputting turnover from MPCC prior to dissolution amounted to £1,602,000 (December 2012: £16,397,000) of which £nil 
was owed at 31 March 2014 (December 2012: £876,000). Processing fee to MPCC amounted to £442,000 (December 2012: £5,404,000) 
of which £nil was owed at 31 March 2014 (December 2012: £1,585,000).
3. The shareholder loans are part of shareholders’ investment in the jointly controlled entities. These are common methods of making an 
investment in jointly controlled entities in the PRC.
 £74,692,000 (December 2012: £55,878,000), of which £20 million are unsecured, interest bearing of HIBOR plus 4.72% p.a. and 
repayable on October 2015, was loaned to China Gas Group Limited which is established in Hong Kong and £142,000 (December 2012: 
£146,000) was due from Zhuhai Special Economic Zone South China Petroleum Company Limited.
4. Purchase from jointly controlled entity – Jining Qufu New Fu Hong Gas Limited amounted to £1,650,000 (December 2012: £2,310,000). 
Sales from Group’s subsidiary, Xinyang Fortune Gas Company Limited and Beijing Fuhua Natural Gas Limited to Group’s jointly controlled 
entity, Xinyang Fortune Vehicle Gas Company Limited and Beijing Fuhua Natural Gas Logistics Limited, amounted to £2,706,000 and 
£139,000 (December 2012: £4,241,000 and £nil) respectively. The above mentioned jointly controlled entities and subsidiaries were no 
longer the jointly controlled entities and subsidiaries but were part of disposed of gas group.
 Current account due to Vitol Energy (Bermuda) Limited, a shareholder of the Company, amounted to £nil (December 2012: £476,000).
5. Fortune Max Holdings Limited (“FMH”) is a private company controlled and beneficially owned by Mr Daniel Chiu. During 2012, FMH had 
entered into arrangements with lenders to finance the purchase of China Gas Holdings Limited (“CGH”) shares, and then entered into  
a verbal understanding to sell any such CGH shares to CGG, at all cost associated with the purchase and financing of any CGH shares 
acquired as and when these are transferred to CGG, and any losses arising on the CGH shares acquired by FMH. In April 2013, CGG has 
acquired all the 207,968,000 CGH shares previously purchased by FMH by its own financing capacity. Under the terms of the agreement 
with CGG, FMH generated neither profit nor incurred any loss from its transaction in CGH shares, however CGG recognised a gain in 
equity of over £67 million based on the market value at the date of transfer, with the Group’s share being £33.5 million.
6. On 7 August 2013, the Group entered into a conditional sale and purchase agreement to purchase the entire issued share capital of  
First Marvel Investment Limited (“First Marvel”) which had been incorporated for the purpose of acquiring Wilmar International Limited’s 
US$60 million interest in the total US$400 million consideration receivable as a result of the FGIH Transaction (the “Wilmar Consideration”) 
(see note 29). First Marvel was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fortune Dynasty Holdings Limited (“FDH”), a joint venture company then 
owned 55 per cent by First Level Holdings Limited, which is in turn controlled by Mr Daniel Chiu, an executive director of the Company.
 The conditional sale and purchase agreement included consideration of £39.1 million (US$60 million), and an unsecured fixed rate loan 
note instrument with FDH. Under the Loan Instrument, FDH was agreed to subscribe in cash at par for £7.9 million (US$12 million) nominal 
amount of fixed rate unsecured loan notes issued by the Group (the “Loan Notes”). Interest was payable on the Loan Notes at a rate of  
7% per annum until they were settled through the subscription for shares (see below).
 On 25 September 2013, the Company announced that the acquisition of First Marvel and the amendment of the loan received from FDH 
amounting to US$12 million were approved by shareholders in the General Meeting, such that it would be repayable in shares in Fortune 
Oil (the “Loan Settlement”) with the balance of approximately US$80,000 of principal and all accrued interest paid in cash.
 On 3 October 2013, Fortune Oil issued 599,639,580 new ordinary shares of the Company for the acquisition of First Marvel and the  
Loan Settlement.
7. Certain assets included in property, plant and equipment of £1.6 million were transferred at cost by way of trust & deed from two 
companies controlled and beneficially owned by Mr Daniel Chiu.
8. Included in trade and other receivables is an amount of £0.8 million that represents the net amount expected to be recovered on 
dissolution of the joint venture in Maoming King Ming Petroleum Company Limited that was dissolved on 5 February 2013. From this date 
control has been lost and therefore consolidation is no longer appropriate.
9. The investment in CGH is divided into two layers: (i) direct holding by wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company; and (ii) indirect holding 
by CGG, a jointly controlled entity between the Group and Mr Liu Ming Hui. In October 2013, the Group loaned £21.5 million to CGG to 
further purchase 30,000,000 ordinary shares of CGH from Mr Liu Ming Hui.
10. By virtue of their directly and indirectly shareholding of 51.2%, First Level Holdings Limited is considered to be the ultimate controlling 
party of the Group.
118 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 notes to the group financial statements
for the period ended 31 March 2014
29. Disposal of subsidiaries
On 17 December 2012, the Group conditionally agreed to inject its natural gas business into CGH for a total consideration of 
£262.5 million (US$400 million) (the “FGIH Transaction”), of which the Group share was then £223.1 million (US$340 million), 
with the balance payable to Wilmar International Limited, the holder of a non-controlling interest in FGIH. Subsequently, the 
Group acquired the right to Wilmar share of the FGIH consideration (see note 28). The FGIH Transaction was completed in 
August 2013 on which date control of FGIH passed to CGH.
Upon Completion, a gain on disposal of £119.7 million arose as described further in the table below. 
In addition to the gain on disposal, the portion of the US$400 million consideration received in CGH shares was not received 
until three months after Completion in November 2013, however, at Completion Fortune already held an investment in CGH 
via its jointly controlled entity, CGG. CGH became an associate of CGG and the Group upon Completion, principally triggered 
by board nomination rights over CGH acquired under the terms of the FGIH Transaction. Whilst this change in status from 
available for sale investment to associate did not have any immediate effect on the carrying value of the CGH investment 
reflected in the Group’s balance sheet, it did trigger the recycling from equity to the income statement of cumulative fair value 
gains amounting to £95.3 million (see note 13). This amount of £95.3 million represents Fortune’s 50 per cent share of £190.7 
million gain recycled within CGG. 
Since Completion the Group has applied equity accounting to its investments in CGH. CGG’s investment in CGH is reported 
in the Group’s financial statements as “share of jointly controlled entities” and the further CGH shares received in part 
settlement of the US$400 the FGIH Transaction consideration are reported as “share of associates” (see note 13).
As part of the FGIH Transaction, the Group will compensate CGH on a dollar for dollar basis where the net profits for the 
natural gas business for FY2013 are less than HK$200 million (approximately £16 million) or are less than HK$400 million 
(approximately £32 million) in 2014. This compensation agreement is not subject to any cap (see notes 1(f) and 25).

30. Dissolution of a subsidiary
Maoming King Ming Petroleum Company Limited (“MKM”), a former subsidiary of the Group, is in dissolution following expiry 
of the joint venture agreement on 5 February 2013. From this date control was lost and the subsidiary was deconsolidated, 
with an amount expected to be recovered upon dissolution recorded in trade and other receivables at £0.8 million pending 
finalisation of the dissolution procedure.
A new venture was subsequently in formed, Maoming New King Ming Petroleum Company Limited (“New MKM”), this time  
as an associate of the Group (see note 13) through which the Group resumed its participation in the Single Point Mooring 
business since January 2014. 
The Group’s financial statements do not reflect any participation in the Single Point Mooring business between dissolution of 
MKM in February 2013 and participation in New MKM from January 2014.

2. 500,266,580 ordinary shares of 1p each were issued as the consideration of US$60 million (equal to £39.1 million) for the 
acquisition of First Marvel. First Marvel was acquired to obtain the rights and obligations of the non-controlling interest 
holder in FGIH accruing to it under the FGIH Transaction. First Marvel then received ordinary shares of CGH included in 
the cost of investments in associates (see note 28(6)).
3 99,373,000 ordinary shares of 1p each were issued to settle Loan Notes of US$12 million (£7.5 million) (see note 28(6)).
4. CGH allotted and issued 184 million shares to satisfy the second consideration of the FGIH Transaction (US$200 million 
equal to £131.2 million) (see note 13(c)).
32. Litigation
In April 2012, an action was commenced in the High Court of Hong Kong by Caspian Resources Development Pte Limited 
(“CRDPL”) against Fortune Oil, Giant Global Development Limited (“GGDL”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Fortune Oil, and 
George Howard Richmond in relation to the validity of the sale and purchase of a 16.7 per cent shareholding in Caspian 
Bounty Steel Limited (“CBSL”) by Mr Richmond to GGDL in January 2011. CBSL is the company through which Fortune Oil 
holds part of its interests in an iron ore mining project located in Armenia. A writ of summons was served on GGDL in April 
2012 and on Fortune Oil in March 2013. GGDL and Fortune Oil will strenuously defend the action. GGDL successfully applied 
in September 2012 to the High Court of Hong Kong for security for costs to be given by CRDPL. Fortune Oil will similarly  
seek security for costs.
Fortune is currently unable to quantify the potential damages that could arise from this claim. However, the directors  
believe that the Group and GGDL have reasonable prospects in successfully defending the action and that therefore  
no provision has been made in the financial statements as this claim is not expected to result in any material loss to  
the Group. At 31 March 2014, the carrying value of the assets in the Armenia iron ore project has been fully impaired  
(see note 5).

Warning to shareholders
unsolicited mail
Fortune Oil PLC is obliged by law to make its share register

unsolicited calls or correspondence
We are aware that a small number of shareholders have 
received unsolicited telephone calls concerning their 
investment in Fortune Oil PLC. These calls are from 
overseas based organisations who offer to buy Fortune Oil 
PLC shares for considerably more than the current market 
price. In some cases the caller has suggested that there is 
currently a takeover offer for Fortune Oil PLC. There is no 
such offer and we suspect that the calls were bogus.
129 Fortune Oil PLC annual report 2014 shareholder information
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any  
unsolicited investment advice, offers of free company 
reports. Operations, commonly known as “boiler rooms”, 
are targeting UK shareholders are callers can be very 
persistent and extremely persuasive. We are aware that  
they attempt to persuade individuals to provide email 
addresses or other personal information; shareholders  
are strongly advised not to provide any such details.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
•	 check 	 that 	 they 	 are 	 properly 	 authorised 	 by 	 the 	 Financial	
Conduct Authority by visiting http://www.fca.gov.uk/
register/home.do and contacting the firm using the details 
on the register;
•	 report 	 any 	 suspicions 	 to 	 the 	 FCA 	 either 	 by 	 calling	 
0800 111 6768 or by completing an online form  
at http://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/scams/ 
investment-scams/share-fraud-and-boiler-room- 
scams/reporting-form; or
•	 inform 	 Capita 	 Asset 	 Services 	 on 	 0871 	 664 	 0300	 
(Calls cost 10p per minute plus network extras.  
Lines are open from 9am-5.30pm, Monday-Friday)  
or email ssd@capita.co.uk. They are not able to 
investigate such incidents themselves but will record  
the details and pass them on to us; and

Electronic and web communications
At the annual general meeting of the Company held  
on 15 June 2010, resolutions were passed, whereby 
shareholders’ consent was obtained and the new  
articles of association were adopted, to enable the 
Company to communicate with shareholders by electronic 
communications further to the web communication since 
July 2007.
The Companies Act 2006 permits UK registered companies 
to send, or make available to their shareholders, their annual 
reports and accounts, notices of general meetings and 
other communications (the “Company communication”)  
by electronic means rather than by means of hard copies 
sent through the postal service (except to those who have 
specifically elected to receive a paper copy). Receiving your 
communications electronically offers advantages in terms of 
speed and convenience and is a secure method of obtaining 
your shareholder documentation, which also allows the 
Company to communicate in a more environmentally friendly 
and effective way.
Notices of general meetings and the Reports and Accounts, 
in Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format (PDF), are 
supplied via the Company’s website (www.fortune-oil.com) 
to shareholders who have not requested a hard copy of 
these documents.
Relating to beneficial owners of shares with 
“information rights”
Please note that beneficial owners of shares who  
have been nominated by the registered holder of those 
shares to receive information rights under section 146  
of the Companies Act 2006 are required to direct all 
communications to the registered holder of their shares 
rather than to the Company’s registrar, Capita Asset 
Services, or to the Company directly.

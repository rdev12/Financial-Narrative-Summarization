“I am delighted to report on a successful year with
double-digit percentage growth in turnover, adjusted
operating profits and adjusted earnings per share.”
Roger Parry, Chairman
Summary 
I am delighted to report on a successful year with
double-digit percentage growth in turnover, adjusted
operating profits and adjusted earnings per share. 
The Future Network has grown by both launch and
acquisition; and the Company is announcing its 
first dividend.
The strength of The Future Network is the focused
effort and dedication of our staff. Their enthusiasm
and talent continues to underpin the success 
and popularity of our magazines. We now have 
more than one thousand people, producing 
98 monthly magazines.
Financial results for 2003 compared with 2002
Group turnover rose by 11% to £182.7m; adjusted
operating profit rose by 24% to £22.5m; and adjusted
earnings per share rose 11% to 4.9 pence per share. 
The Future Network has again been strongly 
cash generative and ended the year with net cash 
of £13.4m. This is despite spending £18.4m 
on acquisition activity – the benefit of which starts 
to become more evident in 2004.
Against this strong financial background the Board
recommends a first dividend, amounting to 1.25
pence per share for the full year 2003. It is also the
current intention of the Board to recommend a final-
only dividend of 1.25 pence per share for the
nine months to 30 September 2004, in the absence
of exceptional circumstances and following our
proposed change of year end which I explain later.
Business growth
Over the last two years, we have significantly
expanded our business. Since the beginning of 2002,
we have launched 28 monthly magazines, acquired 
a further eight, and closed or sold a total of 14. This
brings our portfolio of monthly special-interest
consumer magazines to a total of 98 at the end of
2003. From this broader base of games, computing
and entertainment titles, we have been able to drive
profitability further.
It is pleasing that progress has been made in each of
The Future Network’ s four countries, most notably in
the US in 2003.
In seeking to develop the business further , the Board
has spent time reviewing strategic priorities and the
Chief Executive’ s Review on page 8 summarises our
growth strategy. 
Chairman’ s statement
The Future Network has grown
by both launch and acquisition;
and the Company is announcing
its first dividend. 5 The Future Network plc Annual Report 2003
Board and corporate governance
On 12 March 2003 John Mellon and Lisa Gordon
joined the Board as independent non-executive
Directors, bringing the number of independent 
non-executive Directors to five. John has had a
successful business career in magazine publishing,
including as Chairman of IPC Magazines. 
Lisa was the Corporate Development Director 
of Chrysalis Group for eight years.
With effect from 16 September 2003, Colin Morrison,
who was Chief Operating Officer , resigned as a Director
of the Company and subsequently left the Group 
on 31 December 2003. Colin joined the Company in
January 2001 as Chief Operating Officer and also 
filled the position of UK Managing Director from July
2001. The role of Chief Operating Officer has now
ceased. The Board is grateful to Colin and wishes him
the very best for his next challenge.
We continue to note corporate governance
developments. An important aspect of this is the
composition of the Board and I believe that The Future
Network has a good balance between executive 
and non-executive Directors, and that our Board is
effective. I welcome observations from shareholders
on any aspect of governance.
Annual General Meeting 2004
Our 2004 Annual General Meeting will be held on
Thursday 13 May in Bath and the business for 
that meeting will include 11 resolutions. I should like
to highlight two significant new proposals. 
Having paved the way last year to enable the 
payment of dividends, and with the strong financial
performance for 2003 summarised opposite, the 
Board has recommended a first dividend, amounting 
to 1.25 pence per share for the full year 2003. The
payment of this dividend is subject to shareholder
approval at the Annual General Meeting. 
The Board also proposes to change the financial 
year end of the Group from 31 December to 
30 September . The October to December period
generates a significant proportion of revenues 
and profits and makes forecasting performance 
during the year a challenge. Changing the year end 
will facilitate the management of the business 
and build in more certainty in predicting outcomes. 
It is pleasing that
progress has been made
in each of The Future
Network’ s four countries
in 2003.
It is also notable that within this busiest trading
quarter the business prepares detailed operating
budgets for the ensuing financial year; reviews
staff salaries; and monitors closely the financial
implications of any deviation from budget arising in 
the last quarter of the financial year . 
By changing the financial year end to 30 September ,
we believe that we will achieve a more balanced and
effective management of the business internally,
whilst also providing a better framework for managing
the business as a public company.
The Board therefore proposes to shorten the current
financial reporting period by three months, so that 
the Company’ s next audited results would be for the
nine months to 30 September 2004.
The proposed change of financial year end is not a
matter which requires the approval of shareholders.
However , consistent with our views on aspiring to best
practice in corporate governance, we have decided 
to invite shareholders to vote in favour of this change
at the 2004 Annual General Meeting.
Current trading and prospects
Current trading for January 2004 has been in line 
with internal expectations and we regard our trading
prospects positively.
The Future Network is an international business which
has traded well in 2003. It is growing, and is in a 
strong position in the field of special-interest consumer
magazine publishers. We have valuable consumer
properties managed by a talented and motivated team.
I am optimistic that our shareholders’ confidence 
in The Future Network will continue to prove justified in
the years to come.

Special-interest consumer magazine publisher
The Future Network’ s publishing philosophy is based
on providing quality editorial products that are defined
by the depth of understanding of special-interest 
areas that meet the needs of defined groups of
readers. The magazines are characterised by editorial
authority, quality of content and high value. In a market
place where readers are ever more demanding,
The Future Network is recognised for the excellence 
of its magazines.
Our business model is typically based on premium
price, premium quality. And when the highest-priced is
also the biggest-selling, then there is an even more
attractive business opportunity. In turn, this creates an
appealing audience for advertisers: sector-leading
volumes of readers who have demonstrated their depth
of interest via purchasing high cover-price magazines.
Additionally, the scale of our magazines can also be
attractive for non-endemic advertisers.
And specialist is not a proxy for small. Our Official
PlayStation 2 Magazine in the UK is the ninth highest
ranking of all UK monthly magazines in terms of
consumer spend.
Games
We continued to drive our long-term success 
in the games sector in 2003. As signalled a year 
ago, the sector now accounts for 46% of Group 
revenues and 45% of Group profit (as measured 
by gross contribution). 
The Future Network is the worldwide leader in games
magazines, with 2003 revenues of £85m (2002:
£76m). Our largest-selling magazine is now the US
Official Xbox Magazine, with current monthly sales of
403,000, and we now publish editions of the Official
Xbox Magazine in five countries with licensed editions
in a further four . Our largest-selling UK magazine is
Official PlayStation 2 Magazine which sold a monthly
average of 188,000 copies in 2003, and we also
publish the Official PlayStation 2 Magazine in France. 
Overview
2003 was another successful year for The Future
Network. In this report I highlight several important
matters in addition to those set out in our operating
and financial review. I also provide an update on our
corporate strategy.
Management of the Group 
I am proud to have led the Group through a successful
year . I should like to start by recording my thanks to the
many creative and commercial people we employ, who
together are responsible for the very good progress we
have made in 2003.
Last year I outlined our ambition to launch new titles 
in 2003 and to make further acquisitions. In both
cases we have made real progress. We have expanded
our portfolio by doing both: launching in each of 
our four countries, and acquiring in the UK, the US 
and in France.
I am particularly pleased with the progress made
overseas, led by our country Managing Directors. In
the US, Jonathan Simpson-Bint has done a remarkable
job in leading strong growth in circulation, revenues
and profits. This underpinned our confidence to invest
in the acquisition of sector-leading guitar magazines 
in New Y ork in the autumn. 
Sari Zaimi has worked hard to ensure both operational
improvements in our French business as well as
effective integration of the titles we acquired last year
from Hachette. Our Italian business is now in a 
robust state under the strong leadership of Bernardo
Notarangelo. As a result of progress in both countries,
in terms of adjusted operating profit our Mainland
European businesses are now once more profitable.
Since September I have been acting Managing
Director of the UK business. Our UK results show a
business with very good margins – amongst 
the best in our industry. From here, our task is to
stimulate further growth in what has been our
strongest business.
It is interesting to note that The Future Network’ s
combined international sales – owned businesses,
licences and exports – exceed those in the UK,
further underpinning the improved quality of the
Group’ s earnings.
“Ever wake up dreading going to work? I don’t! As an
artist and a game lover what more could I possibly 
ask for than being the Art Director of my favorite game
console magazine at one of the best companies I’ll
ever work for ...not much. ”
Juliann Brown, Art Director , Official Xbox Magazine,
Future Network USA. 8 The Future Network plc Annual Report 2003
Computing
Computing titles provided 32% of our 2003 magazine
revenues. The Future Network is a significant publisher
of computing magazines in its four territories, with
2003 revenues of £58m (2002: £54m).
Once again we have increased our total computing
revenues, despite difficult market conditions. Our
teams, who are highly focused, have found smart ways
to develop new business and it is pleasing that some 
of our newer digital titles have grown strongly. There
are some signs that technology markets are finally
beginning to pick up again, particularly in the US, which
should prove beneficial to a company with a strong
technology element such as The Future Network.
Although it is very early days, we are pleased 
with the recent launch in the US of Mobile PC, our 
first significant launch in the US for two years. 
Entertainment
The Future Network’ s UK entertainment portfolio
comprises a number of separate special-interest
magazines, ranging from music-making to film 
and mountain-biking, from stitching to technology and
modified cars. T ogether with our recently acquired
guitar titles in the US, they provide us with a diversified
magazine portfolio. In 2003 our entertainment titles
performed strongly overall and we intend to expand
further in these areas, building on our long-term
success in these special-interest areas of the market.
The Future Network has been sector leader in guitar
magazines for almost a decade in the UK. We have
achieved growth once more this year , and this durable
success in a familiar special-interest area encouraged
us to enter the US guitar market in 2003. In two
separate deals last autumn, we bought the number
one and number three best-selling magazines for 
a combined £11.5m, to become worldwide leaders of
an attractive sector . 
UK magazine distribution
The UK’ s largest magazine distributor , Marketforce,
will be distributing our magazines with effect from 
May 2004. We are pleased with this appointment 
and believe that having the benefit of their scale and
experience will help our UK business.
Corporate strategy
The Board seeks to enhance shareholder value 
by maintaining our pace of growth, which has seen
substantial growth in Group value since 2001. 
T o this end, we have a clear strategy:
• T o exploit the significant growth opportunities in 
our core area of expertise – special-interest
consumer magazines
• T o focus new investment on the UK and 
US businesses
• Further to increase the diversity of our magazine
portfolio, thereby reducing our dependence on any
single sector
• T o use the Group’ s strong balance sheet and 
cash generative qualities to pursue acquisitions
• T o build on our established track record of
launching new titles.
We have been focused in 2003 on seeking to improve
the business in every area. We have continued to 
make significant progress, which has been beneficial
to shareholders and to Future people alike. We look
forward with confidence.

Future has had long-term success in a variety of entertainment
sectors. In 2003 our entertainment titles performed strongly
overall and we intend to expand further in these areas. 
In the UK Total Film continued its impressive growth record 
with a 13th successive circulation rise, a year-on-year increase 
of 5.4% to 90,580. All Future’ s guitar titles increased with 
Total Guitar up 12.1% year on year while modified car magazine
Redline was up 9.8% year on year at 72,106.
“We have achieved greater profitability through
increased sales, improved margins, an expanded
portfolio and bolt-on acquisitions funded from
surplus cash.”

Operating and financial review
With significant growth in 
adjusted earnings per share and 
a strong balance sheet, this 
is the right time for us to start
paying dividends.  11 The Future Network plc Annual Report 2003
Magazine portfolio
By the end of the year , the Group
published 98 special-interest consumer
magazines in four countries as 
shown in figure 2. These can be further
analysed by sector: see figure 3.
During the year 15 titles were launched
and eight were acquired. The amount
spent on magazine launches was £2.0m
(as measured by losses at the gross
contribution level), which is within the
estimate provided by management in
September . The net cash consideration
paid for magazine acquisitions
amounted to £18.4m. Magazine launch
activity is discussed below and
magazine acquisitions are discussed
later in this report.
£1.3m was spent on magazine launch
activity in the UK and Mainland Europe.
T en magazine titles were launched 
in the UK. The most expensive of these
launches was Bang, an alternative
music magazine, which did not achieve
the required volume of sales to justify
continued publication. Accordingly,
this magazine was closed in December
2003. The financial performance of
magazine launches in France and Italy
was satisfactory.
In the US, £0.7m was spent on the 
set-up costs of Mobile PC, which 
went on sale in January 2004. All staff,
promotional and other expenses
relating to this title incurred during
2003 were expensed against 2003 
US profits.
During the last two years, the Group has
launched a total of 28 magazines 
and acquired a further eight. Magazines
closed or sold in the same period
number 14. This represents net
expansion of 22 magazines, and the
Group plans to expand further in 2004. 
In relation to magazine launches, the
Group anticipates a similar level of
financial commitment to that incurred 
in 2003 (£2.0m of net losses as
measured at the gross contribution
level). This level of investment in the
development of the Group’ s portfolio
can readily be funded from the Group’ s
cash resources.

results for 2003. It is also intended 
to help readers to assess the future
performance of the Group by setting out
the Directors’ analysis of the business.
Accordingly, I comment on business
trends evident in 2003; on accounting
policies that have required the exercise
of judgement in their application, and 
to which the results are most sensitive;
and on the measures used by the
Directors as key performance indicators
in managing the business. 
As last year , this review focuses on
adjusted figures which are presented 
to provide a better indication of overall
financial performance and to reflect how
the business is managed on a day-to-
day basis. The only adjustments made
are to remove goodwill amortisation and
other operating income. 
Looking forward, I also comment 
on our aspirations to achieve further
growth in earnings, our dividend policy,
the planned change of financial year
end in 2004, and the likely impact 
of International Financial Reporting
Standards in 2005/2006. 
Structure and size of the Group
By the end of 2003, the Group published
98 special-interest consumer magazines
and operated subsidiary companies 
in the UK and three overseas countries:
the US, France and Italy. In addition,
the Group licensed local editions of its
magazines in a further 31 countries.
The Group’ s progress in comparison
with 2002 can be seen in figure 1.

“After thinking I was wasting time playing my 
PlayStation 2 instead of studying at university, I got 
a job getting paid for it! Of course the writing is 
important too … I can’t think of anything better than 
writing about what interests you.”

Official PlayStation 2 Magazine, Future Publishing. #Some of Future’s newer UK digital titles showed double-digit 
growth in 2003. Microsoft Windows XP: The Official Magazine (left)
was up 34.6% at 67,767 copies sold per month, Digital Camera
Magazine was up 14.4% to 33,221 and Linux Format increased
11.5% to 26,044.
#In the computing sector our teams have found smart ways 
to develop new business. We are pleased with the important
January 2004 launch in the US of Mobile PC, developed to reflect
the growth in mobile technology and our first significant launch 
in the US for two years. It’ s very early days but we’ve made good
progress so far.
$Future is the worldwide leader in games magazines. Our largest-
selling magazine is now the US Official Xbox Magazine with 
current monthly sales of 403,000. We now publish editions 
of the Official Xbox Magazine in five countries with licensed 
editions in a further four.
"Improvement and growth in our French business – Future France.
The integration of the four magazines – PlayStation 2, Le 
Magazine Officiel, Joypad, Joystick and DVD Magazine – acquired
from Hachette in France last year has been successful.
$Future entered the US guitar market in 2003. Future has been
sector leader in guitar magazines for almost a decade in the UK.
This durable success encouraged us to enter the US guitar market
and in two separate deals we bought the number one and number
three best-selling guitar magazines to become worldwide leaders of
this attractive sector. Shown here are members of Future’ s new
New York-based guitar editorial teams. GROWING

There are however several areas 
within the 2003 Group accounts which
required the exercise of judgement 
by management, notably the areas 
of revenue recognition, bad debt
provisions and provisions in respect of
onerous property leases which have
reduced during the year .
Revenue recognition 
As in previous years, circulation and
advertising revenue relating to 
a magazine is recognised with effect 
from the date the issue goes on 
sale. For example, the results for each
year include revenue relating to
magazines which went on sale during
December , but which did not come 
off sale until during January. Because
magazines are distributed to retail
outlets on a sale-or-return basis, an
estimate is made of expected sales;
this is later corrected to actual sales
when these are known. 
Appropriate adjustments were made 
to the results for 2003 (and for each
previous year) in order to update initial
estimates to reflect the latest available
returns information. 
Review of the Group profit 
and loss account
Group turnover
Group turnover for the year was
£182.7m, an increase of 11% on 2002
(see figure 4). In 2003 turnover of
£7.8m was generated from acquisitions
made during the year whilst the
increase in turnover from continuing
operations was £9.6m or 6%. 
All turnover was derived from the
Group’ s principal activity, of publishing
special-interest consumer magazines
serving the games, computing and 
a number of entertainment sectors.
Analyses of turnover by territory,
type, sector and half year are shown
opposite in figures 5 to 9.
Key performance indicators used 
by management
The Directors monitor the Group’ s
progress by reference to circulation and
advertising revenue by territory, by 
type and by sector. For management
accounts purposes, each magazine 
has its own profit and loss account,
detailing magazine revenues and (after
deducting direct magazine-related
costs) the resulting gross contribution.
Any magazine which produces a
negative gross contribution is
considered carefully, to ensure that such
a result is justified in business terms: 
for example, that early losses following 
a magazine launch are running within
acceptable parameters. 
Overheads are reviewed as a block of
expenditure on a country-by-country
basis. Gross contribution less overheads
(excluding goodwill amortisation) results
in adjusted operating profit, which 
the Directors regard as the single most
important performance measure in
assessing the Group’ s profitability at 
the operating level.
In addition, the Directors monitor
central costs, financial commitments,
the management of treasury risk and
taxation liabilities. 
The Board’ s overall aim is to achieve
growth in adjusted earnings per share.
Accounting policies 
The Group’ s accounting policies are
explained on pages 52 and 53 and
remained unchanged compared with 
the previous year. Accordingly, no
accounting policy changes had any
impact on the measurement of the
Group’ s pre-tax profits for 2003.

“As a former bike shop manager and mechanic, being
able to go into work every day to ride all the latest bikes
and tinker with new parts all day is a dream come true.
When you tell people that you get paid to write about

them the four test bikes you currently get to play with
and most wonder why they do their boring 9 to 5.

INTERNATIONAL 18 The Future Network plc Annual Report 2003
Export activity
The largest export markets for Future’ s
UK magazines are the US and Australia.
We are pleased to have grown total
export sales from the UK to £10.9m, an
increase of 12% on the £9.7m in 2002.
Licensing
We also significantly increased
international licensing of Future’ s
magazine portfolio by 29% during 
the year . The UK portfolio had licence 
revenues totalling £2.4m (2002:
£1.8m) and the US portfolio had 
licence revenues of £0.3m 
(2002: £0.3m) giving a Group total 
of £2.7m (2002: £2.1m).
The Group licenses 103 editions 
of its magazines in 32 countries,
in addition to those published by Group
companies in the UK, US, France and
Italy. T3 remains the Group’ s most
licensed title, with local editions sold 
in 17 different overseas countries. 
Mainland Europe performance for year
Combined turnover from France and
Italy was £38.6m including £5.4m 
from the Hachette (HDP) titles acquired
in April 2003. Excluding these, the
increase in turnover was 13%. The
average value of the Euro against
Sterling strengthened by 9% compared
with the previous year , so that this
revenue growth in Euro terms was 2%.
For 2003, 75% of revenue came from
circulation and 24% from advertising.
Circulation revenue (excluding HDP)
grew by 13% and advertising revenue 
by 11% compared with 2002.
The adjusted operating profit of £0.7m
represents an adjusted operating profit
margin of 2% as shown in figure 13 and
is stated after (a) intra-Group licence
fees for the year of £1.8m (2002:
£1.4m) and (b) integration costs of 
HDP amounting to £0.2m.
During the year , the Group acquired 
HDP , a subsidiary company of Hachette
Filipacchi Presse S.A. for a cash
consideration of £3.5m. Prior to the
year end, the legal entity of HDP was
merged with Future France. 
The HDP titles together contributed
£5.4m of turnover and £0.2m of
adjusted operating profit. This is before
the anticipated full-year effect of cost
savings which have been targeted 
at £0.75m.
UK performance for year
Turnover for the year amounted 
to £100.3m, an increase of 3%
compared with 2002. (See figure 10).
Circulation revenue increased by 3%
compared with 2002 and advertising
revenue increased by 3% compared 
with 2002. The proportion of turnover
derived from circulation revenues
remained the same at 73% (2002: 73%).
Turnover for the computing and
entertainment sectors showed modest
year-on-year increases of 5% and 
6% respectively whilst games turnover
increased by 1% on the prior year . 
(See figure 11).
The UK adjusted operating profit 
was £17.0 m, representing an adjusted
operating profit margin of 17% 
(2002: 17%). The split of UK profits
(as measured by gross contribution)
by sector is shown in figure 12.
UK magazine portfolio
During the year , Future launched 
10 monthly magazines including What
Guitar, which has been added to 
the UK’ s already successful portfolio 
of guitar magazines; Digital Camera
Shopper, supplementing Digital Camera
Magazine which was launched in 
2002; Windows XP Answers and Laptop
Magazine and the aforementioned
Bang. The UK also launched a
successful Masterclass series of
‘bookazines’, large magazine-format
manuals sold at newsagents.
In November , Future acquired the UK
trading subsidiary of Computec 
Media AG for a cash consideration of
£3.2m and a licensing arrangement
with Computec Media in Germany. 
The principal magazines acquired were
PSW and Xbox World and these are 
now published by Future in the UK.
In February 2004 Future published the
latest ABC audited circulation figures
covering 48 titles in its UK portfolio of 61
monthly magazines. Average monthly
sales in the UK for the audited titles
were slightly up at 1, 787 ,825 copies. 
The UK trends for Future’ s portfolio were 
(i) growth in entertainment; (ii) enhanced
position within games; (iii) respectable
performance for computing titles in
difficult market conditions.
The UK performance overall was
satisfactory, and we have expanded the
UK magazine portfolio by both launches
and acquisitions.

US performance for year
T urnover for the year amounted to
£46.2m, an increase of 14% (in Sterling
terms) compared with 2002. The
increase in turnover from continuing
operations was £3.6m or 9%. 
In September and October respectively,
Future acquired Guitar World (and
associated titles) and Guitar One
magazines for a total consideration 
of £11.5m. These magazines together
contributed £2.1m of turnover and
£0.1m of adjusted operating loss 
and gave rise to goodwill amortisation 
of £0.7m.
The average value of the Dollar against
Sterling declined by 9% compared 
with 2002, so that revenue growth in
Dollar terms was 24% overall and 
19% for continuing operations. Most 
of the increase in turnover came 
from increased circulation (up 30% in 
Dollar terms) with advertising revenue
(in Dollar terms) up 19%.
Adjusted operating profit for the year
totalled £7.5m, representing an
adjusted operating margin of 16% 
of turnover (see figure 14).
In February 2004 Future published 
the latest circulation figures for its 
US magazines. Overall, audited US
circulation increased by 23.6% year 
on year to 1,906,828 copies, including
Guitar World and Guitar One.
Future’ s US games magazine circulation
growth has been driven by a 39%
increase from Official Xbox Magazine,
which is now Future’ s largest selling
magazine of any sort at 403,222 
copies per month.
Of total US turnover , 51% came from
circulation and 46% from advertising.
Subscription revenue in the year
accounted for 21% of US turnover
(2002: 24%).
The different business model applicable
in the US is evident from the turnover
splits noted above. Unlike UK
magazines, most of which are sold 
at newsstands, over 70% of Future’ s
magazine sales in the US are achieved
by subscription. 
Magazine publishers estimate in
advance the total number of magazine
sales for a given period (known as 
the ‘rate base’) and it is on the basis 
of such estimates that advertising
bookings are sold. The most recent
circulation statistics covering the 
six months to December 2003 show
that all our titles sold at least their 
rate base numbers. This has been 
the case throughout the life of Future
Network USA. 
The US operation had a strong year 
in 2003, with revenues, profits and
margins all well beyond management
expectations. The strength of the
portfolio, the recent launch of Mobile PC
and the newly acquired guitar magazines
in New Y ork mean that the outlook 
for 2004 is promising. 
However, after such a strong year 
in 2003, the Group does not expect 
to achieve significant profit growth 
in 2004, when the loss-making phase 
of Mobile PC magazine will continue 
to impact the result. 
Operating profitability as measured 
by adjusted operating profit
Apart from launches, virtually all of the
Group’ s magazines achieved a positive
gross contribution in 2003 and
magazines acquired during the year also
recorded a positive gross contribution.
Overheads in each country remained
under control throughout the year . Splits
of gross contribution by sector and
adjusted operating profit by territory and
half year are shown in figures 15 to 17.
Adjusted operating profit achieved 
by the UK for 2003 was £17.0m and
that achieved by overseas subsidiaries
was £8.2m, giving a combined total 
of £25.2m. After deducting Group
central costs of £2.7m (2002: £3.1m),
adjusted operating profit for the year
was £22.5m (2002: £18.2m) on
turnover of £182.7m (2002: £165.3m)
representing an adjusted operating
profit margin of 12% (2002: 11%) 
on turnover .
The Group’ s aim is for an adjusted
operating profit margin of 15% in the
mid-term and the improvement achieved
in 2003 is consistent with that aim. 
Operating and 
financial review

“The best part of being a musician is performing live.
I’ve been doing it every weekend for 20 years,
and the thrill and satisfaction I get from relating to 
an audience is priceless! I’ve had the great pleasure 
of interviewing and jamming with some of my musical
heroes, including John Paul Jones, David Gilmour ,
Steve Howe and Dickey Betts. My other passion is
teaching. It’ s very fulfilling to be able to inspire
students and successfully communicate elusive
artistic concepts to them.”
Jimmy Brown, Music Editor , Guitar World,
Future Network USA. 23 The Future Network plc Annual Report 2003
Other operating income
No such income arose during 2003.
During the previous year , the UK
business received £2.2m from HM
Customs & Excise in respect 
of VAT overpaid in years prior to 2001.
Most of this refund related to amounts
reclaimable following a review of the
complex rules relating to VAT applicable
to magazines featuring covermounts.
Goodwill amortisation
In respect of continuing operations,
the charge for the year was £10.4m 
(2002: £10.3m). Goodwill amortisation
charged in relation to acquisitions
totalled £2.6m and this reflects
particular amortisation periods,
which are explained overleaf (under
‘Intangible fixed assets’).
Net interest receivable and 
similar items
Net interest receivable and similar
items totalled £0.1m for the year . 
This represents bank interest receivable
of £0.6m, exchange gains of £0.1m
less other charges totalling £0.6m. 
Pre-tax profit
The Group’ s pre-tax profit of £9.7m
(2002: £10.7m) comprises pre-
amortisation profits of £22.7m (2002:
£21.0m) less goodwill amortisation 
of £13.0m (2002: £10.3m).
Tax
The tax charge for the year amounted 
to £7.0m on pre-amortisation profits 
of £22.7m, giving an effective tax rate
for the year of 31% (2002: 21%). 
The lower rate in the prior year reflected
the recognition of a deferred tax asset
in the US and certain prior year tax
credits. The current year rate of 
31% is consistent with the estimate 
provided when the Group announced 
its half year results. 
The Group’ s current estimate of the
effective tax rate likely to apply to
taxable profits for calendar year 2004 
is in the region of 30%.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share for the year
amounted to 0.8 pence (2002: 
1.9 pence). The reduction arises as 
a result of the increased amortisation
charge in 2003 and the fact that 
in 2002 the earnings benefited from
£2.2m of other operating income 
as discussed above. 
Adjusted basic earnings per share
reflects earnings before goodwill
amortisation and other operating
income. Adjusted basic earnings 
per share for the year amounted 
to 4.9 pence per share (2002: 4.4
pence per share), an increase of 11%.
Dividends
During 2003, we took the necessary
preparatory steps to enable the
payment of dividends. This involved the
cancellation of the Company’ s share
premium account, which was effected
on 12 June 2003 following the approval
of shareholders at the Annual General
Meeting held on 15 May 2003 
and Court approval. As a result, the
Company now has significant
distributable profits. 
In light of the strong financial
performance for the year , the Board
recommends a final dividend, payable 
in respect of the full year 2003, of 
1.25 pence per share. If approved at the
2004 Annual General Meeting to be
held on 13 May 2004, this first dividend
will be payable on 24 May 2004 
to shareholders on the register as at 
23 April 2004. 
Dividend policy and dividend cover
The Board’ s intention is that dividends
should be covered at least twice 
by adjusted earnings per share. These
amounted to 4.9 pence for 2003,
providing more than adequate cover 
for the proposed first dividend of 
1.25 pence. 
It is also the current intention of 
the Board to recommend a final-only
dividend of 1.25 pence per share 
for the nine months to 30 September
2004, in the absence of exceptional
circumstances and following our
proposed change in financial year end.

Proposed change of financial year end
The Board proposes to change the
financial year end of the Group from
31 December to 30 September . The
October to December period generates
a significant proportion of revenues 
and profits and makes forecasting
performance during the year a
challenge. Changing the year end will
facilitate the management of the
business and build in more certainty 
in predicting outcomes. 
It is also notable that within this busiest
trading quarter the business prepares
detailed operating budgets for the
ensuing financial year; reviews staff
salaries; and monitors closely the
financial implications of any deviation
from budget arising in the last quarter 
of the financial year . 
By changing the financial year end
to 30 September , we believe that we 
will achieve a more balanced and
effective management of the business
internally, whilst also providing a 
better framework for managing the
business as a public company. 
The Board therefore proposes to shorten
the current financial reporting period
by three months, so that the Company’ s
next audited results would be for the
nine months to 30 September 2004.
Figure 18 illustrates that a 31
December year end results in a 25:75
split in adjusted operating profits
(comparing H1 with H2). With a
September year end, as shown in figure
19, this will change to an estimated
60:40 split of adjusted operating profits
(comparing H1 with H2). 
The proposed change of financial year
end is not a matter which requires the
approval of shareholders. However ,
consistent with our views on aspiring to
best practice in corporate governance,
we have decided to invite shareholders
to vote in favour of this change at the
2004 Annual General Meeting.
If approval is given, our reporting plan
will be as shown in figure 20.
The next audited financial statements
would be those for the nine months to
30 September 2004.
These would be accompanied by pro
forma financial statements for the
twelve months to 30 September 2003
and 30 September 2004. These pro
forma financial statements would
encompass the Group profit and loss
account, Group cash flow statement,
and notes to the financial statements
concerning the Group profit and loss
account (the equivalent of Notes 1 to 8
in this Annual Report). All this pro 
forma financial information would be
accompanied by a report prepared 
by the Company’ s auditors.
Cash flow and funding
Net cash position
The Group started the year with net
cash of £16.8m and ended the year
with £13.4m. The year was significantly
cash generative for the Group and the
net cash inflow from operating activities
was £22.6m (2002: £27.0m). The
Group has maintained its bank facility,
currently amounting to £27.5m 
and has borrowings under the facility
denominated in US Dollars totalling
£5.1m thereby leaving more than
adequate headroom for the operational
funding requirement of current
activities. 
Hedging policy on interest rates
No hedging arrangements were 
entered into during 2003 and none 
was outstanding from previous years.
Hedging policy on foreign 
exchange rates
The Group is exposed to exchange 
rate fluctuations in the US Dollar and 
the Euro. The Board has developed
policies in order to manage the
exposures effectively. These policies
include consideration being given to
currencies negotiated in cross-border
contracts and the use of spot and
forward contracts as appropriate. 
No other instrument may be used
without the approval of the Board. 
At 31 December 2003 there were no
outstanding contracts with banks or
other third parties in respect of foreign
exchange hedging arrangements.
The Group’ s exposure to foreign
currencies from a balance sheet
perspective is set out in note 18.

Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure amounted to £1.4m
in 2003, compared with £0.7m in
2002. For 2004 capital expenditure is
not expected to exceed £2.0m.
Review of the Group’s balance sheet
The Group’ s net assets amounted 
to £111.9m (2002: £112.0m) at 
31 December 2003. The most
significant change in the make-up 
of the Group’ s balance sheet is 
the reduction in net current assets,
a consequence of the £18.4m of cash
spent on acquisitions during the year
which is reflected in the increase in
intangible fixed assets. Consequently
the net current assets at 31 December
2002 of £5.8m have been reduced 
to net current liabilities of £7.0m
(including a creditor of £4.0m for the
proposed dividend). However the Group 
continues to have net cash, which 
at 31 December 2003 amounted 
to £13.4m (2002: £16.8m). 
Intangible fixed assets
Intangible fixed assets at the year end
were carried on the balance sheet at
£117.3m compared with £108.6m at
the previous year end. During the year ,
additions totalled £12.9m in respect 
of the titles acquired in the US, Guitar
World and Guitar One; £4.7m in respect
of the acquisition of HDP in France; 
and £3.8m in respect of the business
acquired from Computec in the UK. 
The Group also acquired a number 
of smaller titles and subscriptions 
lists which amounted to £0.4m.
The amortisation charge for the year
amounted to £13.0m, compared 
with £10.3m in the previous year . The
charge reflects goodwill amortisation
over different periods, appropriate 
to the circumstances of each case. 
These periods are shown in figure 21. 
As at 31 December 2003, the £117.3m
analysed by territory is shown in figure
22. The estimated likely goodwill
amortisation charge in respect of 2004
is £15.8m.
Tangible fixed assets
The carrying value of the Group’ s
tangible fixed assets at the year end
increased from £3.2m to £3.3m. 
This net increase reflects capital
expenditure of £1.4m; a depreciation
charge of £1.4m; and a net exchange
gain of £0.1m.
Working capital
The Group had stocks of paper and
other raw materials at the year end,
and work in progress in relation to
magazines scheduled for publication 
in 2004. The total of these amounts
was £3.5m, compared with £3.6m 
at December 2002. 
Group debtors at 31 December 2003
amounted to £42.4m (2002: £33.3m)
and included trade debtors of £34.1m
(2002: £24.5m). The majority of this
increase is attributable to the increased
scale of the business following the 
four acquisitions made during 2003. 
In terms of average debtor days
outstanding at the balance sheet 
date these remained at 56 days 
(2002: 56 days). 
Net cash
As at 31 December 2003 the Group’ s net
cash position was £13.4m represented
by (i) cash at bank and short-term
deposits totalling £20.1m; (ii) borrowing
in US Dollars totalling £5.1m, and (iii)
other loans of £1.6m. The Group cash
flow statement on pages 50 and 51
explains the movements for the year .
Property provisions
The consolidated balance sheet
contains provisions totalling £1.3m
(2002: £2.9m) representing provisions
against onerous lease commitments
and dilapidations in respect of property.
The property provision reduced during
the year mainly as a result of rental
payments in respect of vacant property
and the net release of other provisions
amounting to £0.5m.
During the year the Group paid a total 
of £3.6m (2002: £4.1m) in relation 
to leasehold property, of which 
£2.8m (2002: £2.7m) was in respect 
of occupied property and £0.8m 
(2002: £1.4m) was in respect of
unoccupied property.
By the end of 2003, all UK property was
fully occupied and accordingly the Group
is no longer paying for any unoccupied
property in the UK.

Segmental reporting
Segmental reporting is potentially more
extensive under IFRS than at present
but we believe that we already provide
comprehensive segmental analysis 
of the Group’ s business.
Cash flow reporting
Future is a strongly cash generative
business and the Group’ s cash flow
statement is therefore important to a
proper understanding of the business.
The main changes to cash flow
statements envisaged by IFRS are
presentational in nature.
Among Future’ s other assets and
liabilities, we do not foresee any
particular reporting difficulties arising. 
It is worth noting that Future does 
not have any financial instruments or
defined benefit pension schemes,
both of which can give rise to particular
accounting complexity.
In our Annual Report 2004 we will
continue to monitor developments in
this area and to summarise the more
significant implications for financial
reporting of the Group’ s results.
Summary
We have achieved greater profitability
through increased sales, improved
margins, an expanded portfolio,
and bolt-on acquisitions funded from
surplus cash. With significant growth 
in adjusted earnings per share and 
a strong balance sheet, this is the right
time for us to start paying dividends. 
At the same time, we will continue 
to seek growth both organically and 
by pursuing appropriate opportunities 
to expand.

Impact of International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS)
We have been planning carefully 
the steps required to ensure that the 
Group will be able to comply with 
the introduction of IFRS following these
becoming mandatory in 2005. Future 
is a relatively straightforward business
and accordingly we expect to be able 
to comply with IFRS in the Group’ s
financial statements for the year ending
30 September 2006, which will be 
the first period to which IFRS will apply. 
Alongside the audited figures for 
that year will be comparative figures 
for the year ending 30 September
2005. I note below the main areas 
of impact to Future.
Intangible assets
The most significant item on Future’ s
balance sheet is goodwill which will
need to be reassessed under current
IFRS proposals in order that the total
carrying value should be split under 
the following indicative headings:
– T rademarks
– Non-compete
– Subscription lists
– Goodwill
Whilst the values allocated to
trademarks, non-compete and
subscription lists will be amortised 
over the appropriate periods, the
goodwill element will not be amortised
but will instead be subject to annual
impairment testing. It is therefore
possible that fluctuations to reported
earnings could occur in the event 
of impairment reviews concluding that
impairment has taken place. 
Share based payments
Since its Initial Public Offering in June
1999, Future has issued a significant
number of share options. Our initial
review of the impact of IFRS on
accounting for share-based payments
concludes that the likely charge against
Group profits in this respect will not be
more than £0.5m per annum. Additional
charges would arise to the extent that
further share options or shares are
awarded in the future.

8 Principal activity and business review 
The Group’ s principal activity is the publishing of special-
interest consumer magazines, notably in the games,
computing and entertainment segments of the consumer
magazine market. The Company’ s subsidiaries operate
principally in the UK, US, France and Italy. A review of 
the activities of the year, the position at the year end and
likely future developments, is set out in the Chairman’ s
statement, Chief Executive’ s review and the operating 
and financial review.
Financial results
The audited financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2003 are set out on pages 46 to 74. Details 
of the Group’ s results and proposed dividend are set out 
in the Group profit and loss account on page 46 and in 
the notes to the financial statements. 
Proposed first dividend 
No dividends have been paid by the Company to date. 
During 2003, the Company took the necessary preparatory
steps to enable the payment of dividends. This involved 
the cancellation of the Company’ s share premium account,
which was effected on 12 June 2003 following the approval
of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 
15 May 2003 and Court approval. As a result, the Company
now has significant distributable profits. In light of the 
strong financial performance for the year, the Board
recommends a final dividend, payable in respect of 2003,
of 1.25 pence per share. If approved at the 2004 Annual
General Meeting to be held on 13 May 2004, this first
dividend will be payable on 24 May 2004, to shareholders 
on the register on 23 April 2004. The ex dividend date will 
be 21 April 2004.
Dividend policy and dividend cover
The Board’ s policy is that dividends should be covered at
least twice by adjusted earnings per share. These amounted
to 4.9 pence for 2003, providing more than adequate 
cover for the proposed dividend of 1.25 pence. It is the
current intention of the Board to recommend a final-only 
dividend, of 1.25 pence per share for the nine months 
to 30 September 2004, in the absence of exceptional
circumstances and following our proposed change in
financial year end.
Proposed change of financial year end
As explained in the Chairman’ s statement and on page 24
of the operating and financial review, the Board proposes 
to change the financial year end of the Group from 
31 December to 30 September. The Board therefore
proposes to shorten the current financial period by three
months, so that the Company’ s next audited results would 
be for the nine months to 30 September 2004. Consistent
with our views on aspiring to best practice in corporate
governance, we have decided to invite shareholders to 
vote in favour of this change at the 2004 Annual General
Meeting, details of which are set out on pages 31 and 32.
Share capital
Details of all movements in share capital are given in 
note 19 on page 67. As at 31 December 2003 the number of
Ordinary shares in issue was 322.5 million. This represents
an increase of less than 1% compared with the number of
Ordinary shares in issue on 31 December 2002. All of the
new shares were issued following the exercise of share
options. No shares were issued in relation to the Group’ s
acquisitions made during 2003.

interest in any contract of significance to the Group. 
Corporate governance 
The Board supports best practice in corporate governance.
The Board’ s report on this subject, which includes the
Directors’ statement of responsibilities for the preparation
of the accounts, is set out on pages 40 to 43.
Employees
Employee motivation and communications are important to
the Group, which seeks to encourage employee involvement
in all areas of the business. Management meets regularly
with employees to discuss matters of common interest and
to provide opportunities for an open exchange of ideas.
Employee policies
Good communications are encouraged by the use of Future’ s
intranet, e-mail, regular briefing meetings and staff surveys
to ensure that all employees are informed about the Group’ s
trading, the financial and economic factors affecting the
performance of the Group and other matters of importance
to them and in order that views of employees can be taken
into account in making decisions which are likely to affect
their interests.
The quality, commitment and effectiveness of the Group’ s
employees are crucial to its success. Staff policies are
designed to encourage employees’ interest in the business
and employee share ownership is encouraged through
savings-related and other employee share schemes.
Employment policies do not discriminate between
employees or potential employees on the grounds of age,
colour, race, ethnic or natural origin, sex, marital status,
religious beliefs or disability. If an employee became
disabled whilst in employment and, as a result, was unable
to perform his or her duties, every effort would be made to
offer suitable alternative employment and assistance with
re-training. All employees are encouraged to discuss career
prospects and training needs with their managers and
opportunities are not restricted on the basis of age, colour,
race, ethnic or natural origin, sex, marital status, religious
beliefs or disability. Environmental policy
As a publisher and non-manufacturer, the Group’ s main
products are based on intellectual property. However, the
Board is mindful of the potential impact on the environment
of Group activities and recognises its responsibility to the
environment in terms of its purchase of paper and print for
magazines, and the disposal of waste. The Group’ s energy
consumption represents less than 1% of costs but,
nevertheless, efforts are being made to minimise wastage. 
a) General
This policy defines the key environmental standards to be
applied throughout the Group:
– The policy is communicated to all employees via induction
training and the intranet, and to suppliers via purchasing
staff, contract documentation and the Internet. 
– Ultimate responsibility for adherence to policy rests 
with the Managing Directors of each operating company,
who report on compliance to the Chief Executive. 
– We are committed to monitoring and auditing 
our performance in the areas of paper, print, and the 
disposal of waste.
b) The purchase of magazine paper and print
Paper is by far the largest raw material for the Group. In the
selection of paper and paper suppliers we take account 
of supplier’ s environmental credentials and in particular: 
– we are working towards a minimum 90% (by tonnage) 
of our paper usage being derived from either managed 
and sustainable forests where at least one tree is planted
for every tree felled, or from re-cycled fibre.
– we actively encourage our suppliers to work towards one 
of the internationally recognised and independently
audited certification schemes for environmental care in
forest management and conservation. During the year
2003 the procurement of paper for the Group’ s UK trading
company was audited by the FSC (Forestry Stewardship
Council) to assess the company’ s control systems for
ensuring that its supply chain for FSC papers cannot be
diluted by the entry of non-FSC papers. The company was
awarded FSC Chain of Custody certification.
In the selection of print suppliers, we also factor in
environmental considerations. We ensure, via pre-
qualification audits and contract reviews, that appointed
printers have procedures in place to minimise waste at 
all stages of the production process. 
c) The disposal of waste
We comply with our obligations under the Producer
Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) (Amendment)
(England) Regulations 2002 in the UK and we ensure
compliance with the equivalent regulations, where they apply,
in the other countries in which the Group has companies.
We constantly work with print suppliers to ensure the safe
and clean disposal of toxic waste (especially inks) and the
re-cycling of waste papers. 
Social responsibility
As noted above, the importance of environmental
responsibility is recognised and although it is considered
that the nature of the Group’ s activities has a minimal 
direct effect on the environment, the Group does seek to 
act responsibly in environmental matters.
With regard to health and safety issues, all of our operating
subsidiaries have a Health and Safety Policy, designed to
encourage good practice by employee and employer alike.
One particular risk can emerge for publishing companies,
namely the risk of libel claims. Although this is an insured
risk, our publishing subsidiaries have procedures in place 
to ensure that any potentially contentious issues are
checked first, with legal advice where appropriate, before
being published.
Supplier payment policy
The policy of the Company and the Group, in relation to all of
its suppliers, is to agree payment terms when an order is
placed, and to abide by those terms provided that goods and
services are supplied in accordance with agreed terms and
conditions. The Company and Group do not follow any code
or standard on payment practice, but it is the policy to pay all
suppliers when their invoices become contractually due for
payment. At 31 December 2003 the Group as a whole had 
50 (2002: 55) days of purchases outstanding. The Company
had no trade creditors at the year end.
Charitable and political contributions
During the year the Group has made charitable contributions
amounting to £22,000 (2002: £9,000). £14,000 represents
payments made by the Group under the charitable match
policy which was formalised in 2003. Under this scheme,
the Group matches contributions raised by employees for
charitable purposes (that qualify under the rules of the
policy). These payments were made to a number of charities
including, in particular, cancer charities. £6,000 represents
payments to other US charities and £2,000 was for UK
charities local to the Group’ s head office in Bath. In addition,
during the course of 2002 and 2003, the Group’ s UK
operations donated surplus computer equipment to 
33 schools and community groups in the Bath and North 
East Somerset area, where the Group’ s headquarters 
are situated. The Group also makes regular deliveries 
of free magazines to a number of surgeries, health centres,
hospitals and other community organisations within 
the region.
Consistent with its policy on political contributions,
no political contributions were made (2002: Nil).

30 The Future Network plc Annual Report 2003 Annual General Meeting
The Company’ s fifth Annual General Meeting will be held 
on Thursday 13 May 2004 at 11a.m. at the Wessex Suite,
Francis Hotel, Queen Square, Bath BA1 2HH. There are 
11 items of business to be considered at the Annual General
Meeting, as explained below. The notice of Annual General
Meeting can be found on pages 76 and 77.
Ordinary Business
Ordinary resolution 1 – Financial statements
Shareholders will be asked to approve the financial
statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December
2003, together with the reports of the Directors and
auditors. The audited financial statements appear on pages
46 to 74.
Ordinary resolution 2 – Directors’ remuneration report
Consistent with best practice and regulation, shareholders
will also be asked to approve separately the Directors’
remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2003,
which is set out at pages 33 to 39. 
Ordinary resolution 3 – Declaration of a dividend
The Directors propose a dividend of 1.25 pence per share 
to be paid on 24 May 2004 to shareholders on the register 
on 23 April 2004. The background to and reasons for the
recommendation to pay a dividend are explained on page 28.
Ordinary resolutions 4 and 5 – The Directors
Under Articles 14.1 and 14.2 of the Company’ s Articles of
Association, John Bowman (Group Finance Director) and
Roger Parry (non-executive Chairman) both retire by rotation
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and, being
eligible, offer themselves for re-election. Biographical details
in respect of John Bowman and Roger Parry are set out 
on page 27. An explanation as to why other members of the
Board believe Roger Parry should be re-elected is set out 
in the corporate governance report on page 40.
Ordinary resolutions 6 and 7 – Auditors
Resolutions proposing the re-appointment of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors of the Company,
and authorising the Directors to determine their remuneration
will be submitted to the Annual General Meeting.
Special business
Ordinary resolution 8 – Change of financial year end
It is proposed that the Company’ s financial year end be
changed from 31 December to 30 September, with effect
from 30 September 2004. The reasons for the proposed
change of year end are explained on page 28. The change 
is not a matter that requires the approval of shareholders 
but, consistent with our views on aspiring to best practice 
in corporate governance, we have decided to invite
shareholders to vote in favour of this change at the Annual
General Meeting.
If this resolution is approved, the Company’ s next accounting
reference period will be shortened to the nine-month period
from 1 January 2004 to 30 September 2004.
Ordinary resolution 9 – To authorise the Directors to issue
and allot new Ordinary shares
There may be circumstances where it would be appropriate
for the Company to issue new Ordinary shares, such 
as an acquisition where it might be appropriate for the
consideration to be settled in whole, or in part, by the 
issue of new Ordinary shares.
Under the provisions of section 80 of the Companies Act
1985, the Directors may allot and issue Ordinary shares
(other than pursuant to employee share schemes) only if
authorised to do so by the Company’ s Articles of Association
or by shareholders at a Shareholders Meeting. Authority is
being sought to allot Ordinary shares having an aggregate
nominal value of up to £1,066,000, such authority to expire
on 12 May 2009. This is equivalent to just under 33% of 
the issued Ordinary share capital of the Company as at 10
March 2004. If granted, this authority would replace all
previous authorities granted in this connection.
The Directors do not have any present intention of exercising
this general authority.
Special resolution 10 – Disapplication of statutory 
pre-emption rights
Resolution 10 will be proposed to renew the Directors’
existing authority to allot new Ordinary shares for cash other
than pro rata to existing shareholdings. Section 89 of the
Companies Act 1985 requires that equity securities issued
for cash must first be offered to the Company’ s existing
holders of securities in proportion to their existing holdings. 
The authority now sought would permit the allotment of
Ordinary shares up to the amount covered by Resolution 
10 in connection with a rights issue (or other pro rata Ordinary
share issue) and otherwise up to an aggregate nominal
amount not exceeding £161,500, equivalent to just under 
5% of the issued Ordinary share capital of the Company 
as at 10 March 2004. If granted, this authority would replace 
all previous authorities granted in this connection.
Special resolution 11 – Purchase of own shares
The Company currently has no authority to purchase its 
own shares. In line with common market practice and as
permitted by the Articles of Association, it is proposed 
that the Company be authorised to use its available cash
resources to acquire its own shares in the market for 
either cancellation or to hold them as treasury shares. 
The maximum number of Ordinary shares which may be
purchased will be 32,000,000, representing approximately
10% of the issued Ordinary share capital of the Company.
The minimum price payable for shares will be the nominal
value of 1 pence per share and the maximum price will not
be more than 5% above the average of the middle-market
quotation of the Company’ s Ordinary shares as derived from
the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the five
business days preceding the day on which the shares are
purchased. This authority, if granted, would expire following
the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the
Company to be held in 2005.
31 The Future Network plc Annual Report 2003 Whilst the Board has no current intention to use the power
proposed, it considers that it is desirable to have this power
each year, as there could be circumstances in which the
purchase by the Company of its own shares would be in the
best interests of the Company and its shareholders
generally. The Companies (Acquisition of Own Shares)
(Treasury Shares) Regulations 2003 (the ‘Regulations’)
came into force on 1 December 2003. The Regulations
enable certain listed companies to hold shares in treasury,
as an alternative to cancelling them, following a purchase 
of own shares by the Company in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985. Shares held in treasury may
subsequently be cancelled or sold for cash or used to satisfy
share options awards under the Company’s share option
schemes. Once held in treasury, a company is not entitled 
to exercise any rights, including the right to attend and vote
at meetings in respect of the shares. Further, no dividend 
or other distribution of a company’s assets may be made 
to that company in respect of the treasury shares. If the
Directors exercise the authority conferred by Special
Resolution 11 to purchase Ordinary shares in the Company,
they will consider holding those shares in treasury, rather
than cancelling them.

32 The Future Network plc Annual Report 2003 Compliance with best practice
The Board seeks to apply best practice in remuneration
policy. This is in line with the standards set out in the new
Combined Code issued in July 2003 (and the preceding
Combined Code issued in June 1998) which is the current
Combined Code of which the Board must report compliance 
in this Annual Report and appended to the Listing Rules of
the Financial Services Authority.
Remuneration Committee
Four independent non-executive Directors sit on the
Remuneration Committee. Michael Penington, the Senior
Independent Director, is its Chairman and the other
members are Patrick Taylor, John Mellon (from 12 September
2003) and Lisa Gordon (from 12 September 2003). Roger
Parry resigned from the Committee on 12 September 2003. 
The Committee is responsible for determining the basic
annual salaries, incentive arrangements, service contracts
and all other terms and conditions of employment of the
executive Directors and under the new Combined Code, the
remuneration of the Chairman. The Committee also monitors
the level of and makes recommendations to executive
Directors on significant policies affecting the remuneration,
performance and development of senior management 
below Board level. The Committee is responsible for
approving the policy terms of all employee share incentive
arrangements subject to shareholder approval for all 
new share incentive plans. No Director is involved in deciding 
his or her own remuneration.
Advisers to Remuneration Committee
New Bridge Street Consultants are independent advisers 
to the Committee, having first been appointed in 2002 by 
the Committee. They have provided advice to the Committee
principally in relation to the Company’ s plans for Directors’
remuneration for 2003 and 2004 and in respect of the Long
Term Incentive Plan which received shareholder approval 
at the Company’ s Annual General Meeting on 15 May 2003.
The total fees payable to New Bridge Street Consultants
during 2003 did not exceed £3,000. No other services have
been provided by them to the Company or to any Director 
of the Company and they have no other connection with 
any Director or the Company.
Compliance with the current and new Combined Codes
The Board has applied the ‘Principles of Good Governance’
contained in the current Combined Code issued by the UK
Committee on Corporate Governance as they relate to
Directors’ remuneration, in the manner described in this
report. In addition the Board has taken steps to comply with
the new Combined Code and reports on such compliance 
in this report and the corporate governance report on pages
40 to 43. In relation to the Company’ s performance-related
remuneration policy, the Committee has followed Schedule 
A of each Combined Code, and in relation to disclosures 
of Directors’ remuneration, the Committee has complied
with Schedule B of each Combined Code.
Policy on remuneration of executive Directors
In determining the Company’ s policy on executive Directors’
remuneration, the Committee has regard to:
a) The objective for remuneration packages offered to executive
Directors to be competitive, being comparable with packages
available within other groups operating in similar markets and
on a similar scale, including competitors.
b) The desirability of remuneration packages, including 
long-term incentive plans, to be fixed for individual
executive Directors so as to attract, retain and motivate
executives of the highest calibre, and at the same time 
to optimise the interests of shareholders by ensuring 
that a significant portion of remuneration links rewards 
to performance as set out below.
c) The remuneration packages of senior management 
within the Group.
Annual rewards and long-term incentives contain a
significant element of performance-related remuneration,
and are therefore aligned with the Group’ s achievement 
of results, and individual executive Directors’ contributions
towards that achievement.
Details of the key elements of basic annual salary, annual
performance-related bonus and pensions for 2003 are given
on page 37. Details of Directors’ share options are given on
page 38. Directors’ shareholdings are given in the Directors’
report on page 29.
In terms of policy, the following are the key elements of the
remuneration packages for the executive Directors:
a) Basic annual salary
In assessing the level of basic annual salary for each
executive Director, account is taken of the pay practices 
of such other companies as the Committee and its 
external remuneration advisers consider appropriate,
the responsibilities of each executive Director, and 
pay awards elsewhere in the Group. Salaries are reviewed
annually by the Committee.
b) Performance-related bonuses
For 2002 and 2003, performance-related bonuses were
dependent on growth in Group operating profit compared
with the previous year. For this purpose, operating profit was
measured by adjusted operating profit and the final figures
were £10.0m for 2001, £18.2m for 2002 and £22.5m 
for 2003. The Committee is satisfied that these figures were
not materially affected by the impact of acquisitions made
during 2003. Having reviewed the targets set in light of 
the completion of the annual audit, the Committee has
confirmed the award of bonus to each executive Director 
and details for each Director are given on page 37. 
For 2004, the Committee has decided that performance-
related bonuses will be paid according to growth in earnings
per share actually achieved in 2004 compared with that
recorded for 2003. For this purpose adjusted earnings per
share will be used and this measure excludes the impact 
of annual goodwill amortisation.
Directors’
remuneration
report
for the year ended 
31 December 2003
33 The Future Network plc Annual Report 2003 Performance-related bonuses are paid only after the
completion of the audit of the Group’ s financial statements
and the maximum amount payable to any one executive
Director in respect of such bonus is limited to 100% of 
basic annual salary.
c) Long term incentive plans (‘LTIPs’) 
The Board considers that it is right to align the interests 
of executive Directors with those of shareholders generally
by encouraging Directors to hold shares in the Company,
and by the grant of appropriate share incentives to both
executive Directors and senior executives. 
The Board considers that interests will be more closely
aligned with shareholders through the LTIP scheme than the
grant of options, and therefore no longer intends to consider
the grant of share options to senior managers and executive
Directors each year. At the Company’s Annual General
Meeting 2003, an LTIP was adopted and it is anticipated 
that invitations under that LTIP will be issued for the first
time during the period of 42 days following the publication 
on 10 March 2004 of the Group’ s annual results.
In the event that invitations are issued to senior managers
and executive Directors to participate in the LTIP, it is
envisaged that new shares in the Company will be issued
in due course, subject to the attainment of performance
criteria over a three year period. After such three year period
the Company will match the number of Ordinary shares
purchased by each participant on the basis of growth in pre-
goodwill amortisation earnings per share from 50% if growth
is equal to RPI plus 3% per annum up to 100% if growth is
equal to RPI plus 7%, and pro rata on a straight-line basis
between the two. The issue of such shares would result in
dilution of shareholders’ equity and the Board will therefore
comply with the guidelines on this subject published by 
the Association of British Insurers (ABI) in December 2003.
d) Share option schemes
In granting share options during the year the Committee has
complied with the latest guidelines on this subject published
by the ABI, including by limiting the value of share options
granted during the year 2003 to no more than the amount of
one times basic annual salary.
The last significant award of share options was made on 
18 April 2003, during the 42-day period following the
publication on 11 March 2003 of the Group’ s results for 
the year 2002. The Company granted share options at 
a price of 52.5 pence per share, over a total of 5,020,000
shares including 400,000 in respect of Greg Ingham 
and 350,000 in respect of John Bowman. 400,000 share
options were granted to Colin Morrison and following his
resignation from the Board (see page 29) these options 
have lapsed. Details of all share options are given on 
pages 68 and 69.
The options granted on 18 April 2003 vest based on
performance criteria set by the Committee at the date of
grant. The criteria were set with reference to growth in the
Company’ s total shareholder return over a three year period
relative to a comparator group of companies, described as
UK companies whose shares are listed in the Media and
Entertainment sector of the London Share Service of the
Financial Times newspaper. A full list of these companies is
given on page 75. The performance criteria are considered
challenging by the Committee and are considered consistent
with the Company’ s media sector peer group. 
e) Pensions
Retirement benefits, which comprise only pensions, are
based on contributions paid under a Group Personal Pension
Plan by the employer and the employee. Greg Ingham and
John Bowman are members of this money purchase plan.
The only element of remuneration which is pensionable is
basic annual salary, excluding all bonuses and benefits-in-
kind. Employer’ s pension contributions were payable in 2003
at 10% of basic annual salary and employee contributions
were payable at 5%.
Policy on non-executive Directors’ remuneration
The remuneration of non-executive Directors (except the
Chairman) is determined by the Board. Fees are paid at 
a standard annual rate for non-executive Directors, in order
to reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of the
roles, with additional amounts payable to those who chair
Board Committees. The Chairman’ s fee is determined by 
the Remuneration Committee.
Non-executive Directors will not be granted share options,
nor participate in any share or incentive scheme without
prior shareholder approval, nor any pension arrangements
with the Company. However, exceptionally, Patrick Taylor 
was granted an option over 100,000 Ordinary shares at 
an exercise price of 47 pence on 19 November 2001 in
satisfaction of a contractual commitment made when he
joined the Board as a non-executive Director in April 2001.
The Board considers that this award of share options does
not affect Patrick Taylor’ s independent status as set out 
on page 40 of the corporate governance report.
It is the Company’ s policy to review levels of remuneration 
for non-executive Directors at least every three years.

34 The Future Network plc Annual Report 2003 Policy on Directors’ service contracts 
and termination payments
a) Service contracts of executive Directors and compensation
Each executive Director has a service contract with the
Company, which is terminable on one year’ s notice.
Compensation for early termination is limited to one year’ s
basic salary and the Director would be required to mitigate
his loss.
Policy on external appointments
The Company recognises that exposure of its executive
Directors to other boards can broaden their experience and
knowledge. Executive Directors are therefore permitted to
accept a non-executive appointment, with the Board’s
approval. As at 31 December 2003, neither of the executive
Directors held any external appointment on the board of 
any other publicly listed company.

Company at any time during the relevant financial year

b) Service contracts of non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors have three year service contracts
with the Company which are terminable on three months’
notice by either party. It is the policy of the Company that
non-executive Directors stand for re-election every three
years and that their initial terms will be staggered to avoid
retirement simultaneously.
Retirement and re-election
Following due consideration by the Nomination Committee,
John Bowman and Roger Parry will retire from the Board, and
will be offered for re-election as Directors, at the forthcoming
2004 Annual General Meeting in accordance with Articles
14.1 and 14.2 of the Company’ s Articles of Association
which determine that (a) one third of the Directors (or if the
total number of Directors is not an integral multiple of three,
the nearest number to, but not exceeding one third) shall
retire and stand for re-election each year, and (b) no Director
should serve for more than three years without retiring and
standing for re-election. 
Performance graphs
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) against FTSE Media and
Entertainment Sector Index (UK Companies)
Regulations introduced during 2002 require Directors’
remuneration reports to publish a graph showing the 
TSR of the Company during the previous five years. As the
Company has been listed for only four and a half years as at
31 December 2003, the Committee has opted to publish the
graphs (overleaf) for three different periods. In each case,
these show the TSR on a holding of shares in the Company
compared with a hypothetical holding of shares made up of
shares of the same kinds and number as those by reference
to which the FTSE Media and Entertainment Sector Index
(UK Companies) is calculated.
Graph 1 shows the TSR since the Company’s Initial Public
Offering on 25 June 1999. Graph 2 shows the TSR since 
9 November 2001, the record date of the Company’ s Rights
Issue. Graph 3 shows the TSR during the calendar year 2003.
The reasons for selecting the FTSE Media and Entertainment
Sector Index (UK Companies) for these purposes are 
that it is the index in which the Company is classified and it
contains the companies which make up the comparator
group used by the Company for options granted on or since
19 November 2001 for performance criteria under its share
option schemes. The Sector Index currently comprises the
39 companies which are listed on page 75. 36 The Future Network plc Annual Report 2003

to arise in relation to the Group’ s performance for 2003. The negotiated settlement amounted to £166,000. A further £10,000 was paid in relation
to benefits and £23,000 in relation to pension entitlement.

Notes
1 In accordance with the rules of the Schemes mentioned above Colin Morrison may exercise his options granted on 19 November 2001 up until 
15 September 2004 (336,170 options) or up until 19 May 2005 (63,830 options) as at the date of his resignation the performance criteria under 
the scheme had been met with the Company ranking above the 75th percentile of the comparator group for the relevant period.
2  In accordance with the rules of the Scheme Colin Morrison’ s options granted on 18 April 2003 have lapsed as the performance criteria at the date 
of resignation were not met with the Company ranking below the 50th percentile of the comparator group for the relevant period.
Share options granted to Directors in 2001, 2002 and 2003
Following the 2001 Rights Issue, share options were granted
to each of Greg Ingham, Colin Morrison and John Bowman on
19 November 2001 at an exercise price of 47 pence, under
The Future Network plc 1999 Inland Revenue Approved Share
Option Scheme and The Future Network plc 1999 Senior
Management Share Option Scheme. Also on 19 November
2001, share options were granted to Patrick Taylor under an
Option Deed at an exercise price of 47 pence.
These options are subject to performance criteria which
require that options vest if the growth in the Company’s 
TSR over a three year period from the date of grant,
relative to a comparator group of companies, described 
as companies whose shares are listed in the Media and
Entertainment sector of the London Share Service of the
Financial Times newspaper, reaches the following targets:
i) If the Company ranks above the 75th percentile of the
comparator group the options will vest in full.
ii) If the Company ranks above the 50th percentile of the
comparator group one half of the options will vest.
iii) If the Company ranks below the 50th percentile of the
comparator group the options do not vest.
No share options were granted to Directors in 2002.
On 18 April 2003 share options were granted to each of 
Greg Ingham, John Bowman and Colin Morrison at a price 
of 52.5 pence each under The Future Network plc 1999
International Share Option Scheme. These options are
subject to the same performance criteria as those granted 
on 19 November 2001 set out above.
Directors are encouraged to hold their shares for a further
period after exercise, subject to the need to finance any
costs of acquisition and associated tax liabilities.
All shares under option under the above schemes have been
granted at the market value of the shares at the time of grant.
Numbers of share options granted and to be granted are
limited to numbers which fall within the current ABI guidelines.
Details of options held by executive Directors and one 
non-executive Director in the Ordinary shares of The Future
Network plc as at 31 December 2003, and movements
during the year, are shown below.

Sharesave Plan
The Company’s Sharesave Plan is open to all eligible
employees at the date an invitation is made. Full details 
of the Sharesave Plan are given in note 20. Such options
have been granted in previous years by the Board and on 
16 September 2003 the Board issued an invitation to all 
UK employees. A total of 269,418 share options were
granted in accordance with the Plan rules on 4 October 
2003 at an exercise price of 53 pence, representing a 
20% discount to the prevailing market price on the 
date of invitation.
In total, under the Company’ s Sharesave Plan there were 
as at 31 December 2003, share options outstanding over
1,886,402 Ordinary shares. Included in this total are
options in respect of executive Directors in the table below.
It is the Board’ s intention to continue to consider the issue 
of invitations to eligible employees each year, normally within
the period of 42 days following the publication of the Group’s

Approved by the Board of Directors and signed on its behalf by:

Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
10 March 2004 Best practice in corporate governance
The Board supports best practice in corporate governance.
The Board confirms that the Company complied throughout
the financial year with the provisions of ‘The Combined
Code: Principles of Good Governance and Code of Best
Practice’ adopted in June 1998 and appended to the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority. This is the current
Combined Code on which the Board must report compliance
in the Annual Report. However the Board has also taken
steps during the year towards compliance with the
provisions of the new Combined Code issued on 23 July
2003, and as at 31 December 2003 the Board considers
that it is able to report compliance with such provisions.
The Board
The Board is responsible for the Group’ s operations and 
met six times during the financial year 2003. In each case,
there was full attendance by each Director with the exception
of Colin Morrison’s absence from the September Board
meeting. The Board has established a pattern of holding
informal, private dinners on the evening before Board
meetings, and during 2003 five such dinners were held,
enabling informal discussion to be held about business
topics the evening before the following day’ s Board meeting.
All Directors have found this process useful.
The Board currently comprises two executive Directors: 
Greg Ingham (Chief Executive) and John Bowman (Group
Finance Director). Colin Morrison resigned as a Director 
with effect from 16 September 2003, having been Chief
Operating Officer until that date. There are five non-executive
Directors: Roger Parry (non-executive Chairman), Michael
Penington (senior independent non-executive Director),
Patrick Taylor, Lisa Gordon (appointed on 12 March 2003)
and John Mellon (appointed on 12 March 2003). The Board
considers that there is a strong presence of both executive
and non-executive Directors on the Board.
The non-executive Directors, led by Michael Penington,
met during the year without the presence of the Chairman 
in order to assess the performance of the Chairman and 
in doing so, they took into account the views of the executive
Directors. As a result, all the Directors (except the Chairman)
recommend that he should be re-elected as the Chairman 
at the Annual General Meeting. The Chairman met with 
the non-executives during the year without the presence 
of the executive Directors in order to assess the performance
of the executive Directors. In 2003, a process of informal
meetings between the Chairman and each Director, followed
by a Board discussion, was undertaken to evaluate the
performance of the Board, its committees and individual
Directors. In 2004, a further formal and rigorous evaluation 
of performance will be undertaken.
Following the two appointments mentioned above and the
resignation of Colin Morrison, the Board of seven Directors
comprises an independent non-executive Chairman, a senior
independent non-executive Director, three other independent
non-executive Directors, and two executive Directors.
Accordingly the Company complies with the provisions of
both the current and the new Combined Code in respect 
of the composition of the Board.
The Company will ensure that, in accordance with its 
Articles of Association, no Director serves for a period longer
than three years without retiring at the appropriate Annual
General Meeting. Those retiring at the 2004 Annual General
Meeting by rotation are Roger Parry and John Bowman.
Since the Company listed on the London Stock Exchange 
it has had in place insurance cover in respect of legal action
against Directors of the Group.
Non-executive Directors and independence
In the view of the Board, the non-executive Directors bring
strong, independent judgement and considerable knowledge
and experience to the Board’ s deliberations. 
The terms of appointment of the non-executive Directors
were updated and documented in March 2003. These 
terms of appointment, which comply with the requirements
of both the current and new Combined Codes, are available 
for inspection at the Company’ s registered office and at 
the Annual General Meeting. All non-executive Directors
serve for three-year terms, terminable by either party on
three months notice subject to their re-election or removal
pursuant to the provisions of the Companies Act. There is 
no current limit to the number of terms which may be served,
but the Company has been listed on the London Stock
Exchange for less than five years in total. 
The Board reviewed the independent status of each 
non-executive Director during the year and considers that 
all of its non-executive Directors are independent for 
the purpose of each of the current and the new Combined
Codes. In coming to its decision the Board carefully
considered the factors which, under the new Combined
Code, could affect independence but in the opinion of the
Board do not do so. 
a) Patrick Taylor has a number of outstanding share options
consequent to a contractual undertaking given in 2001,
when he joined the Board. He is not financially dependent
on the Company in any way. 
b) Michael Penington served as interim Finance Director to
the Company on a consultancy basis for seven months,
prior to the Company’ s successful 2001 Rights Issue. He
is not financially dependent on the Company in any way.
Executive Directors
As noted in the Directors’ remuneration report on page 35,
the notice period for all executive Directors is one year and 
in the event of termination each executive Director is entitled 
to 12 months’ notice and only basic annual salary is used 
to calculate any contractual termination payment.
Greg Ingham was last re-elected as a Director at the
Company’ s 2002 Annual General Meeting.
John Bowman was elected as a Director at the Company’s
2002 Annual General Meeting and will stand for re-election at
the Company’ s 2004 Annual General Meeting. Biographical
details for John Bowman are set out on page 27.

40 The Future Network plc Annual Report 2003 Company Secretary and advisers 
All Board members have access to the advice and services
of the Company Secretary, who is a qualified solicitor, and 
a procedure has been agreed by the Board for all Directors 
to take independent professional advice if necessary,
and at the Company’ s expense, in the furtherance of their 
duties as Directors and committee members. The Company
Secretary is the secretary for the Audit, Remuneration 
and Nomination committees. 
The Board continued its review of advisers during 2003. 
In addition to using its nominated advisers, as listed on 
page 78, the Company has made considered use of a
greater number of legal advisers selected for their expertise
in certain fields; and has used firms of accountants other
than its auditors to advise on certain matters. During 2003,
following a detailed review of insurance arrangements 
and brokers, the Company appointed AON Limited as its
insurance brokers in the UK and mainland Europe.
Committees
The Board has three permanent committees, in line with
best practice: these are the Audit, Remuneration and
Nomination Committees, each of which has formally
delegated duties and responsibilities. The Board sets the
terms of reference for all committees and reviews these
terms at least annually; the terms of reference for all three
committees having been reviewed and updated in the light 
of provisions of the new Combined Code in January 2004.
The terms of reference of all three Committees are available
on the Company’ s website. The Board believes that the
composition of each of the Committees complies with the
provisions of the new Combined Code, and the membership 
of the Committees was refreshed during the year with the
appointment of Lisa Gordon and John Mellon to the Audit
and Remuneration Committees and the resignation of 
Roger Parry from each.
The Audit Committee comprises Patrick Taylor (Chairman 
of the Committee, who has recent and relevant experience),
Lisa Gordon (since 12 September 2003), John Mellon 
(since 12 September 2003) and Michael Penington. Roger
Parry resigned from the Committee on 12 September 2003.
The members of the Audit Committee are considered by the
Board to be independent. The Audit Committee met three
times during 2003 and all members were present at each
meeting with the exception of Roger Parry being absent for
one meeting. The Committee’ s terms of reference cover the
points recommended by the new Combined Code, and 
it is, inter alia, responsible for:
– Reviewing the operation of internal controls.
– Reviewing the measurement and reporting of the financial
performance of the Group.
– Reviewing financial statements before publication and
making recommendations to the Board on the
appointment of the external auditors.
– Reviewing the scope and results of the auditors’ work,
their independence and objectivity, and the audit fee. 
The Finance Director and other members of the financial
management team attend by invitation. The Group’ s auditors
attend each meeting and the Audit Committee considers
reports from the Finance Director and from the auditors. 
The Audit Committee meets with the auditors without the
presence of executive Directors at least once each year. 
The Remuneration Committee comprises Michael Penington
(Chairman of the Committee), Patrick Taylor, Lisa Gordon
(since 12 September 2003) and John Mellon (since 
12 September 2003) and determines the remuneration
packages of the executive Directors, including their
performance-related awards; and of the Chairman. 
In addition, the Committee monitors and recommends
remuneration levels for senior management. Roger Parry
resigned from the Committee on 12 September 2003. 
The Directors’ remuneration report is set out on pages 
33 to 39 and explains the previous membership of the
Committee and the remuneration policies applicable for
2003. The Remuneration Committee met five times during
the year and all members were present at each meeting. 
The Nomination Committee comprises Roger Parry
(Chairman of the Committee), Michael Penington and 
Patrick Taylor. The Committee has responsibility for 
making recommendations to the Board in relation to Board
appointments and succession planning issues. The
Committee met once during the year and all members 
were present at this meeting. For Board appointments
the Nomination Committee will typically use recruitment
agents to search for appropriate candidates. 
The Nomination Committee met with Lisa Gordon and John
Mellon individually prior to recommending and approving
their appointment to the Board. The Committee annually
reviews the time required from a non-executive Director 
to satisfy his or her role and reviews the structure, size 
and performance of the Board as a whole, with a view to
making recommendations to the Board as to any changes
which may be desirable. The Committee recommended 
and approved that John Bowman and Roger Parry should
retire and stand for re-election at the Company’ s 2004
Annual General Meeting in satisfaction of the requirements
set out in Article 14.1 of the Articles of Association.
As a general principle, the Board regularly appoints a sub-
committee consisting of at least two Directors in order 
to finalise and approve particular matters if they have been
approved in principle by the Board and are subject only to
final amendments. 
During the year, the Board also appointed a permanent 
sub-committee of at least two Directors to approve 
the issue and allotment of new shares in satisfaction 
of employee share option exercises. 
41 The Future Network plc Annual Report 2003 Internal control framework
The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for the
systems of internal control established by the Group and 
for reviewing their effectiveness. The control structure is
designed to manage rather than to eliminate business risks,
and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss. The Board has taken
further steps during the year, which are detailed below, to
enable it to comply with the new Combined Code.
Board meetings take place a minimum of six times per year 
and all Directors are provided in advance, with written packs of
Board papers containing papers for decision, papers for
discussion and others for information. Board packs are usually
circulated one week in advance of Board meetings to allow
proper time for consideration. The same process of issuing
packs of information applies to Committee meetings. 
All new Directors receive an induction regarding the Group 
on joining the Board and the Company provides or pays
for appropriate training for Directors on an ongoing basis.
As in the previous year, the Board was also provided each
month with a timely written report on trading and other
business issues, accompanied by financial information
analysing the previous month’ s trading and key performance
indicators. Management accounts are reviewed monthly
against both prior year and budget figures. By this means,
all Directors are kept aware of business developments 
and trends as they occur. These reports are subsequently
discussed at formal Board meetings. 
Executive Directors meet each week and discuss key
business matters. They pay close attention to operational
matters and areas of business development; and also to
foreseeable business which requires approval by the full
Board. In this connection there is a formal List of Matters
Reserved for Decision by the Board. The list includes
approval of interim and annual results, the Group’ s budget,
shareholder circulars, major investments or financial
commitments, magazine launches if the net loss to be
incurred in the first year is planned to exceed £500,000,
share incentive schemes, acquisitions and disposals of
trading businesses and dividend policy.
During 2002, a full review of the Group’ s treasury functions
was carried out. After discussion with the Board, changes
were made to treasury policy; local banks were changed in
two overseas territories; and a new Group treasury manual
was issued in order to increase the efficiency of this
important aspect of internal financial control. 
In 2003, a number of Group policies and procedures were
implemented or updated, and the Group has adopted an
ongoing system of Network Control Documents which are
developed by Group finance staff following consultation 
with finance staff in subsidiary operations and Group legal.
Group legal staff have carried out a review of the Group’s
more significant legal contracts; the potential exposure
arising from such contracts; and a review of terms and
conditions of business. An IT acceptable use policy was
implemented in the UK during the year and this is being
extended across the Group. 
Monthly finance review meetings are held with each
operating subsidiary in order to provide a proper opportunity
for financial results and other business and operational
issues to be explored and addressed. During the year 2003,
many important issues were reviewed and progressed.
Group management make regular visits to overseas
subsidiaries to review financial and business matters. 
The Group has continued to review its risk management
procedures, including the implementation of a UK business
continuity plan. A review of insurance brokers was carried
out during the year and, as stated above, AON was appointed
as new broker to review the Group’ s existing insurance
policies. Following such review, a number of new policies
were implemented and improvements in cover were made.
Ensuring that the Group employs management of suitable
experience and calibre is critical to both achievement of
commercial success and management of business risk. Senior
management in each territory is continually assessed and
reviewed and the Managing Directors of each subsidiary of the
Company present to the full Board at least once per year .
Results of the Board’s annual review of internal controls
The Board has conducted an annual review for 2003 as 
to the effectiveness of its system of internal control. It has
concluded that significant assurance can be drawn from 
the existing systems, which have developed further during
the year. As a result the Board considers that it fully
complied with the Turnbull recommendations for all of the
year 2003 and that it has taken the steps necessary 
to comply with the provisions of the new Combined Code.
Internal audit function
During the year 2003 the Audit Committee and the Board
each reconsidered the need for an internal audit function and
concluded that an independent internal audit department with
the necessary technical and language skills is not justified
by the current size of the Group.
The Board’ s preference has been to ensure that the Group
allocates sufficient time and resources to manage the many
business risks faced by the Group, including but not limited 
to financial risks. The Board continues to embed this important
aspect of corporate governance within the operating Boards
of the four countries, as well as the parent company Board.
Directors’ responsibilities for the preparation of 
financial statements
The Directors are required by law to prepare financial
statements for each financial year which give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group
as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss 
of the Group for that year. In preparing those financial
statements, the Directors are required to:
– Select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently.
– Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent.
– State whether applicable accounting standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed
and explained in the financial statements.
Corporate
governance
report
continued 
42 The Future Network plc Annual Report 2003 The Directors confirm that they have complied with these
requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for the keeping of proper
accounting records, which disclose with reasonable accuracy
at any time the financial position of the Company and the
Group and enable them to ensure that the financial
statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are
also responsible for the safeguarding of the assets of the
Company and of the Group, and for the taking of reasonable
steps to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are also responsible for the maintenance and
integrity of the Group’s website. Information published 
on the Internet is accessible in many countries with different
legal requirements. Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Relations with shareholders
The majority of the Company’ s shares are held by institutions,
with the remainder held by private shareholders. There 
is a regular dialogue with shareholders through a planned
programme of investor relations which includes formal
presentations of the Group’s half year and annual results 
by the executive Directors. The Company’s website,
www.thefuturenetwork.plc.uk contains up-to-date information
on the Group’ s activities and the investor relations section
includes a full copy of the annual results, powerpoint
presentations provided to analysts, and an audio recording of
the most recent such presentation made by executive Directors.
Group management also meets with institutional investors
and analysts on a regular basis, except during close periods
(the period of two months preceding announcement of half-
year and annual results) and there is regular communication
with all shareholders through the Interim and Annual Reports.
The Chairman and Senior Independent Director have, in
accordance with the provisions of the new Combined Code,
considered the need to make themselves available to
shareholders. During the most recent round of shareholder
meetings with executive Directors, it has been emphasised
that both the Chairman and Senior Independent Director
would be pleased to meet with shareholders on request; but
the Board’ s view at present is that no formal schedule of
regular meetings with the Chairman and Senior Independent
Director is either necessary or desirable. Any shareholder
who would like to meet with the Chairman or the Senior
Independent Director is invited to contact the Chairman or
Senior Independent Director, as appropriate. 
In order that all Directors are aware of the views of
shareholders, any such views from meetings held by
Director(s) with shareholders or reported to the Directors
through the Company’ s brokers, together with copies of
analysts notes, press articles and other relevant information
are included in Board packs.
All Directors are required to be present at the Company’s
Annual General Meeting.
Going concern basis
The Directors are satisfied that the Company and the 
Group have adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason 
they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the
financial statements.
Auditors’ responsibilities
Auditors’ responsibilities in relation to the financial
statements are included in the Independent Auditors’ Report
to the members of The Future Network plc on page 44.
Auditors’ fees
The Audit Committee has reviewed the remuneration
received by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for non-audit work. 
The fees for non-audit work largely comprise work in respect
of taxation and due diligence carried out on acquisitions. 
The Audit Committee has concluded that no conflict of
interest exists between PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP audit 
and non-audit work and that their involvement was the 
most effective way of conducting the Group’s business
during the last year.

are set out in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities.
The Directors are also responsible for preparing the
Directors’ remuneration report.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and
the auditable part of the Directors’ remuneration report in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements
and United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the

or if information specified by law regarding Directors’
remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report
and consider the implications for our report if we become aware
of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies
with the financial statements. The other information comprises
only the Directors’ report, the unaudited part of the Directors’
remuneration report, the Chairman’ s statement, the operating
and financial review and the corporate governance report. 
We review whether the corporate governance report reflects
the Company’s compliance with the seven provisions of 
the Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report 
if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the
Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks 
and controls, or to form an opinion on the effectiveness 
of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its 
risk and control procedures. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing
standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant 
to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
and the auditable part of the Directors’ remuneration report.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates
and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation 
of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the Company’ s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all 
the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence 
to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements
and the auditable part of the Directors’ remuneration report
are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion
we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation
of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
– The financial statements give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at
31 December 2003 and of the profit and cash flows of 
the Group for the year then ended.
– The financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
– Those parts of the Directors’ remuneration report
required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act
1985 have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985.

Accounting
policies
Basis of preparation of accounts
The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost
convention, and in accordance with accounting standards
applicable in the United Kingdom. The principal accounting
policies have been consistently applied.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated accounts comprise the Company and 
all of its subsidiary undertakings. The principal operating
subsidiary undertakings are listed in note 28 to the
accounts. The results of subsidiary undertakings are
consolidated from the effective date of acquisition and
businesses sold are included up to the date of disposal.
Interests in associated companies are included in 
the consolidated accounts using the equity method 
of accounting.
Intangible assets
On acquisition of a subsidiary, associated undertaking or
business, the purchase consideration is allocated between
the underlying net assets on a fair value basis, with any
excess purchase consideration representing goodwill. The
purchase consideration is stated at fair value. Purchased
goodwill is capitalised and amortised on a straight-line
basis over the estimated useful life of each acquisition.
Internally developed goodwill and other intangible assets
are not capitalised. 
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation. No depreciation is provided on freehold land. 
For other tangible fixed assets depreciation is calculated 
to write down the cost of the tangible fixed assets to their
estimated residual values by equal annual instalments over
the period of their estimated useful lives, which are
considered to be:
Freehold buildings – 50 years
Leasehold properties – 50 years or period 
and improvements of the lease if shorter
Plant and machinery – between one and five years
Equipment, fixtures – between one and five years
and fittings
Impairment of fixed assets 
Fixed assets including goodwill are reviewed to determine
whether their value appears to have been impaired. Where 
a fixed asset has been impaired, the impairment is charged
to the profit and loss account, and the asset is carried at its
recoverable amount.
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at 
the fair value of consideration payable including related
acquisition costs. Other fixed asset and short-term
investments are stated at the lower of cost and net
realisable value. 
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the 
rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction, or
where forward exchange contracts have been arranged,
at the contracted rate. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies, where a contract rate
does not apply, are translated at the exchange rates ruling
at the balance sheet date, and any exchange differences 
are taken to the profit and loss account.
Profits and losses of overseas subsidiaries that have
currencies of operation other than Sterling are translated
into Sterling at average rates of exchange ruling during 
the period, except for material items that are translated at
the rate ruling at the date of transaction. Differences
between the profit and loss accounts translated at average
rates and at balance sheet rates are shown as a movement
on reserves and in the statement of total recognised gains 
and losses. 
Where practicable, the Group’ s overseas equity investments
are financed by borrowings in the currencies in which those
assets are denominated. Exchange differences arising from
the retranslation of overseas net investments, including
goodwill and any related loans together with the related tax
effect, are dealt with through reserves and the statement of
total recognised gains and losses to the extent permitted
under SSAP20. Other exchange differences are taken to the
profit and loss account.
Financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are used by the Group to
reduce exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
A derivative instrument is considered to be used for hedging
purposes when it alters the risk profile of an existing
underlying exposure of the Group.
Payments and receipts under any interest rate swaps are
accrued within net interest payable. The swaps are not
revalued to fair value or shown in the Group balance sheet
at the year end unless the exposure which they were
hedging no longer exists or the swaps are no longer
considered necessary by reference to the stated policy 
of the Board. 53 The Future Network plc Annual Report 2003
Stocks and work in progress
Stocks and work in progress are stated at the lower of cost
and net realisable value. For raw materials, cost is taken to
be the purchase price. For work in progress and finished
products cost is calculated as the direct cost of production.
Turnover
Turnover is the amount derived from the provision of goods
and services falling within the Group’ s ordinary activities
after deduction of trade discounts, provision for returns and
value added taxes. The circulation and advertising turnover
relating to a magazine issue is recognised with effect from
the date that the issue goes on sale. 
Deferred Income
Subscription payments received are held in the balance
sheet and recognised in the profit and loss account on
publication of each related issue.
Leases
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the profit and
loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
When a leasehold property ceases to be used in 
the business, provision is made to the extent that the
recoverable amount of the interest in the property is
expected to be insufficient to cover future obligations
relating to the lease.
Capitalisation of finance costs and interest
All borrowings are initially stated at the fair value of the
consideration received after deduction of issue costs. Issue
costs together with finance costs are charged to the profit
and loss account over the terms of the borrowings and
represent a constant proportion of the capital repayments
outstanding. Accrued finance costs attributable to
borrowings where the maturity at the date of issue is less
than 12 months are included in the accrued charges within
current liabilities. For all other borrowings, accrued finance
charges and issue costs are added to the carrying value of
those borrowings.
Development and subscription costs
Launch, development and subscription costs are written off
in full as incurred.
Pensions
Contributions payable in respect of defined contribution
schemes are charged to the profit and loss account as they
are incurred.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided in full on all material timing
differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised when their
recovery is considered more likely than not. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Share schemes
When an employee is granted options to subscribe for
shares, any difference between the fair value of those
shares at the date the grant is made and the option price
payable by the employee is charged to the profit and loss
account over the period from the date of grant to the date 
at which the employee becomes unconditionally entitled 
to the shares. 
The only exception to this is in respect of options granted
under the Future Network plc UK Inland Revenue Approved
Sharesave Plan. Under this plan options may be granted 
at a discount of 20% to the market price. In line with UITF17
this discount is not charged to the profit and loss account.
Employer taxes on options and share-related benefits are
accrued over the performance period of the option in
accordance with UITF25: ‘National Insurance contributions
on share option gains’. 1. Segmental reporting

tax losses.

Basic earnings per share are calculated using the weighted average number of Ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share have been calculated by taking into account the dilutive effect of shares that would be issued on
conversion into Ordinary shares of options held under employee share schemes.
The adjusted earnings per share removes the effect of the amortisation of intangible assets and other operating income 
from the calculation as follows:

The goodwill arising on acquisitions is being amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives 
of the acquired businesses, being in the range one to 20 years. These periods are the periods over which the Directors
estimate that the values of the underlying businesses acquired are expected to exceed the values of the underlying assets.
Further details of the acquisitions during the year are given in note 24.

Vacant property and dilapidations
Following the reorganisations and significant downsizing which took place in 2001, the Group has obligations under short
leasehold agreements on a number of vacant properties. The provision made represents the following:
i) The best estimate of the discounted future net cash flow arising from the net shortfall on each of the leases held. 
ii) The best estimate of dilapidation obligations on termination of specific leasehold agreements.
At 31 December 2003 the total amount of the provision was £1.3m (2002: £2.9m). The leases against which the provisions
have been made will terminate by December 2017. The provisions have been discounted at a rate in line with the Group’ s
cost of capital.
Restructuring 
The restructuring provisions as at 31 December 2003 relate to restructuring at the Group’ s European subsidiaries.
18. Financial instruments
a) Treasury overview
The Group uses financial instruments to raise funding for its operations and to manage the financial risks arising from those
operations. The agreements governing the principal instruments entered into were approved by the Board.
At the year end, the Group’ s principal financial liabilities comprised £5.1m under its committed revolving multi-currency
facility (2002 : £Nil), £1.6m (2002: £1.8m) in respect of a loan made to Future Network USA, Inc. prior to the Company
acquiring Future Network USA, Inc. in June 1999, £0.7m (2002: £1.3m) deferred consideration payable for acquisitions 
and £1.3m (2002 : £2.9m) for property and dilapidation provisions. The Group had no drawings outstanding on short-term
overdraft facilities at the year end (2002 : £Nil ). 
At the year end, the Group’ s financial assets comprised cash of £11.3m (2002: £12.4m) and short term deposits of £8.8m
(2002: £6.2m). 
The Directors have considered the principal risks arising from the Group’ s financial instruments and have mitigated them 
as follows:
Credit risk 
The Group has a number of authorised counterparties with whom cash balances are held in the countries in which the Group
operates. The Group’ s aim to minimise credit risk is achieved by considering the credit standing of potential bankers before
selecting them. 
Liquidity risk 
The aim of the Group’ s liquidity policy is to provide flexibility. The Group currently has positive net cash balances and a facility
of over £27m.
Market price risk
The Group had disposed of its fixed asset investments as at 31 December 2003.
Interest rate risk 
In September and October 2003 the Group drew down debt under its revolving credit facility to finance its US acquisitions.
However before, on and since that date the Group has had net cash balances. To the extent that debt funding is required
going forward the Board has adopted the following policy:
– To the extent that net debt remains below £10m there is no requirement to hedge against interest rate fluctuations on
the balance of the gross debt.
– To the extent that net debt rises above £10m then a minimum of 25% of the balance of the gross debt and a maximum 
of 50% of the balance of the gross debt should be hedged.
In applying the above policy, management will take full consideration of cash flow projections to fix the period for which any
hedging arrangements are entered into.
63 The Future Network plc Annual Report 2003 18. Financial instruments continued
Currency risk
A proportion of the Group’ s activities are carried out in countries outside the United Kingdom where transactions are carried
out in that country’ s own functional currency. Movements in exchange rates can therefore have a significant impact on the
Group’s total cash flows, whilst the translation of the results, assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries into Sterling can
have a significant effect on the Group’ s reported profits and balance sheet. The main exposures are to movements in the 
US Dollar and Euro against Sterling. 
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the overseas net investments including goodwill and any related loans
together with the related tax effect are dealt with as movements in reserves and in the statement of total recognised gains or
losses to the extent permitted under SSAP20. Other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
b) Short-term debtors and creditors
Trading short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures, other than the currency
profile of monetary assets and liabilities (table g).
c) Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities
The interest rate profile of the Group’ s financial liabilities at 31 December 2003 was:

Euro 1.3 – 1.3 –
At 31 December 2002 6.0 1.0 3.2 1.8 
The floating rate financial liabilities include bank borrowings, and deferred consideration, of which the bank borrowings 
bear interest at rates fixed in advance for a period of between 1 and 3 months by reference to LIBOR (in the case of Sterling
and US Dollar borrowings) and EURIBOR (in the case of liabilities denominated in currencies linked to the Euro) plus a 
margin of 1.0%.
The deferred consideration in respect of the Italian acquisition has been discounted at a rate linked to EURIBOR. 
Floating rate financial liabilities also include provisions for property and dilapidation provisions (see note 17) that are
discounted at rates in line with the Group’ s cost of capital.
The fixed rate financial liability reflects the loan made to Future Network USA, Inc. by its previous owner, prior to its
acquisition by the Group, which is denominated in US Dollars and bears interest at 7% per annum.

20. Share options
The Future Network plc operates 10 share option schemes being:
• The Future Publishing Holdings Limited Unapproved Share Option Plan, (‘Future Publishing Holdings Plan’).
• The Future Network plc 1999 Stock Option Plan for Imagine Employees, (‘1999 US Plan’). 
• The Future Network plc 1999 International Share Option Scheme, (‘International Scheme’).
• The Future Network plc 1999 Senior Management Scheme, (‘Senior Scheme’).
• The Future Network plc 1999 Approved International Share Option Scheme (‘Approved Scheme’).
• The Future Network plc 2000 US Stock Option Plan (‘2000 US Plan’).
• The Future Network plc International Sharesave Scheme (‘International Sharesave Scheme’).
• Addendum to the Future Network plc International Sharesave Scheme (‘Addendum’).
• The Future Network plc UK Inland Revenue Approved Sharesave Plan 2000 (‘Sharesave Plan’).
• The Future Network plc Employee Benefit Trust.
As at 31 December 2003, options had been granted under all of the above schemes except for The Future Network plc
Employee Benefit Trust. 
The Future Publishing Holdings Plan
The Future Publishing Holdings Plan was provided to grant options to employees who were employed by Future Publishing
Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries. There are no performance criteria attached to options granted under this plan. Since
the Listing of the Company, no new options have been granted under this plan.
The 1999 US Plan
Under the Imagine Media, Inc. (now Future Network USA, Inc.) Acquisition Agreement in June 1999 stock option and stock
appreciation rights holders’ interests in Future Network USA, Inc. capital were converted into new options under a new stock
option plan (1999 US plan). All options and stock appreciation rights to purchase shares in the Common stock of Future
Network USA, Inc. were converted automatically (subject to certain conditions) into options to purchase Ordinary shares in
the Company, and the Company has assumed all obligations subject to the 1999 US Plan. Conversion was essentially on the
same terms and conditions as those prescribed under the original plans, including vesting criteria. There are no performance
criteria attached to options granted under this plan. Since the Listing of the Company, no new options have been granted
under this plan. All options outstanding under the 1999 US Plan will expire in June 2004. 
67 The Future Network plc Annual Report 2003 20. Share options continued
The International Scheme
The International Scheme is used for the grant of options to all employees, save for those persons entitled to participate in
the Senior Scheme. 
Options granted under this scheme up until 2 May 2001 vest in eight equal tranches, one tranche every six months following
publication of the annual and interim results of the Group, depending on the satisfaction of performance criteria that require
the normalised earnings per share of the Group to grow by at least 3% per annum above the increase in the Retail Prices
Index over the relevant period. For options granted in June 1999, the final vesting period was the six months to 30 June
2003. In this period the performance criteria were not met. Accordingly one-eighth of the options have lapsed unvested.
For all other option grants, for the six months ended 31 December 2003 the performance criteria have been met. On a
cumulative basis performance criteria have now also been met for the 6 months ended 30 June 2003.
Options granted in November 2001, April 2002, September 2002 and April 2003 under the International Scheme will all vest
three years after the date of grant, subject to satisfaction of performance criteria that require that the total shareholder
return of the Company, for the three year period following date of grant, must rank in the top quartile of UK companies whose
shares are listed in the Media and Entertainment sector of the London Share Service of the Financial Times newspaper. If the
Company ranks in the second quartile of this comparator group, then only one half of the options will vest; if the Company
ranks below the 50th percentile of this comparator group, then none of the options will vest.
The Senior Scheme
The Senior Scheme was used historically for the grant of options to the Board. Details of options outstanding under this
scheme and the performance criteria relating to these options are given in the Directors’ remuneration report. 
The Approved Scheme
The Approved Scheme is used for the grant of options to all UK employees up to a value of £30,000.
Options granted under this scheme up until 2 May 2001 vest in eight equal tranches, one tranche every six months following
publication of the annual and interim results of the Group, depending on the satisfaction of performance criteria that require
the normalised earnings per share of the Group to grow by at least 3% per annum above the increase in the Retail Prices
Index over the relevant period. For the six months ended 31 December 2003 the performance criteria have been met. On a
cumulative basis performance criteria have now also been met for the 6 months ended 30 June 2003.
Options granted in November 2001, September 2002 and April 2003 under the Approved Scheme will all vest three 
years after the date of grant, subject to satisfaction of performance criteria that require that the total shareholder return of the
Company, for the three year period following date of grant, must rank in the top quartile of UK companies whose shares are
listed in the Media and Entertainment sector of the London Share Service of the Financial Times newspaper. If the Company
ranks in the second quartile of this comparator group, then only one half of the options will vest; if the Company ranks below
the 50th percentile of this comparator group, then none of the options will vest.
The 2000 US Plan
The 2000 US Plan, which was adopted at the Company’ s first Annual General Meeting held on 21 June 2000, is used for the
grant of options to employees of the Company’ s US business.
Options granted under the 2000 US Plan up until 2 May 2001 typically vest as to 25% of the shares under option on the 
first anniversary of an employee joining (or, where options are granted under the US Plan to an existing employee, on the
anniversary of the grant of such options). The balance of 75% will vest in equal monthly tranches over the three year 
period commencing on the first vesting date. Whilst the Company had the right to impose performance conditions up 
until 19 November 2001, none was imposed as the Board’s view was that it was unusual for options granted by 
US competitors to their US employees to contain such criteria.
Options granted in November 2001 and April 2003 under the 2000 US Plan will all vest three years after the date of grant,
subject to satisfaction of performance criteria that require that the total shareholder return of the Company, for the three 
year period following date of grant, must rank in the top quartile of UK companies whose shares are listed in the Media and
Entertainment sector of the London Share Service of the Financial Times newspaper. If the Company ranks in the second
quartile of this comparator group, then only one half of the options will vest; if the Company ranks below the 50th percentile
of this comparator group, then none of the options will vest.
The Sharesave Plan, International Sharesave Scheme and the Addendum (the Sharesave Plans)
Under the Sharesave Plans the option entitlement granted to participating employees is linked to the monthly contributions
which such employees have agreed to pay into the Sharesave Plans (up to a maximum amount of £250 per month). The
options granted under the Sharesave Plans vest on the third anniversary of the grant of such options (or in the case of the
Addendum applicable in the US, due to legal constraints, two years after the date of grant of such options). Where legal 
and regulatory constraints permit, the Company uses its discretion to offer options granted under the Sharesave Plans at a
discount to the market price in force at the date of the invitation being made.

The accounting policies applied by previous owners of the acquired businesses differed from those applied by the Group and
accordingly the pre-acquisition figures are not strictly comparable with those set out above for the year 2003. In addition,
foreign exchange adjustments limit the comparability of the two tables.
The total consideration for acquisitions during 2003 was as follows:

24. Acquisitions continued
i) Acquisition of Guitar World
On 10 September 2003 the Group’ s wholly owned US subsidiary Future Network USA, Inc. acquired certain assets and
liabilities relating to the magazine Guitar World and a number of related titles from Harris Publications Inc. for a cash
consideration of $16.25m. The consideration was funded by a combination of cash resources and bank debt. The purchase
is being accounted for as an acquisition.
The provisional fair values of the liabilities acquired are set out below:
Book and fair value

Accruals and deferred income (subscription liabilities) (0.7)
Net liabilities acquired (0.7)
Goodwill 10.9
Consideration 10.2
Consideration satisfied by:
Cash 10.0
Associated costs 0.2
Total consideration 10.2
The liabilities shown above have been translated into Sterling at $1.584, being the exchange rate at the date of acquisition. 
Prior to the acquisition of these titles, they were owned by Harris Publications, Inc. In the year ended 31 December 2002
turnover for these titles was £7.8m and estimated trading profit attributable to these titles was £1.3m. This profit is
presented before corporate charges, interest and taxation and any financing items which were dealt with on a group basis 
by Harris Publications, Inc as a whole. As only certain assets and liabilities of the group were acquired, it is not practical 
to provide any details of post-tax profits or recognised gains or losses for the financial periods pre-acquisition. 
Since acquisition the Guitar World titles have been fully integrated into the Group’ s existing US subsidiary. As a result it is
impractical to isolate the cash flows of the Guitar World titles.
ii) Other acquisitions
During the year, the following business combinations, which were all accounted for as acquisitions, also occurred:
a) On 28 April 2003, the acquisition of 100% of the shares of Hachette Digital Presse SA from Hachette Filipacchi Presse SA
for a consideration of £3.5m.
b) On 4 September 2003 the acquisition of 100% of the shares of Rho Holdings Ltd for a consideration of £0.1m.
c) On 31 October 2003 the acquisition of the title Guitar One in the US and an associated subscription liability for a
consideration of £1.5m.
d) On 21 November 2003 the acquisition of 100% of the shares of Computec UK Ltd incorporating the titles PlayStation
World and Xbox World for a consideration of £3.2m.
e) In November 2003 the purchase in France of a subscription list and associated liability for a consideration of 
less than £0.1m.
f) In January 2003 the purchase in the UK of a trademark of a closed title for a consideration of £0.1m.

Notes:
1 Licensing obligation – under the acquisition agreement of Computec UK, a subsidiary company of the Group will provide licensing and syndication
rights for a five-year period to Computec UK’ s former parent company, Computec AG. The value of this obligation has been fair valued with reference
to the Group’ s existing licensing contracts and discounted at a rate equivalent to the Group’ s cost of capital.
The fair value adjustments comprise:
2 The revaluation of fixed assets to reflect the market value of assets acquired at the date of acquisition.
3 The write off of the capitalised value of titles in line with the Group’ s accounting policies.
4 The revaluation of stock to take account of the capitalisation of direct cost salaries in work in progress in respect of magazine published after the
date of acquisition.
5 An amount of £0.2m to reflect liabilities incurred pre-acquisition in France in HDP but originally not recognised in the opening balance sheet.
6 A provision to reflect onerous employee contracts on the acquisition of HDP in France. Under French law certain classes 
of journalists have the right on the change of control of a company to demand favourable redundancy packages for an unlimited period after the
change of control. The provision reflects the potential cost of those eligible to claim redundancy and as at 31 December 2003, £0.4m of the
provision had been fully utilised. The remaining portion of the provision is expected to be fully utilised within 2004. 
73 The Future Network plc Annual Report 2003 25. Pensions 
The Group operates a defined contribution scheme for employees resident in the United Kingdom.
In the US the Group operates a Section 401(K) profit sharing defined contribution plan in respect of pensions, which covers
substantially all Future Network USA employees. The Section 401(K) plan allows employees to invest in eight funds run 
by T . Rowe Price, but the employees, not the employer, have complete control over what they invest in, although they have no
control over the stocks owned by the funds. 
During the year £0.7m (2002 : £0.6m) of contributions were made by the Group to these plans.
26. Commitments and contingent liabilities

At 31 December 2003 the Group had annual commitments under non-cancellable operating leases as set out below:

b) Contingent liabilities
At 31 December 2003, the Company had contingent liabilities outstanding in respect of counter-indemnities of £0.7m 
(2002: £1.3m) and guarantees given by it to the Group’ s bankers in respect of amounts outstanding from its subsidiaries
under the Group bank facility arrangements.
A number of trading subsidiaries are defendants in various legal actions. In the opinion of the Directors, after taking
appropriate legal advice, the outcome that such actions would give rise to a significant loss is considered remote. 
c) Capital commitments
There were no material capital commitments as at 31 December 2003.
27. Related party transactions
Transactions with those subsidiary undertakings where 90% or more of their voting rights are controlled within the Group,
and transactions that are eliminated on consolidation, are not disclosed as provided for in FRS8: Related Party Disclosures.

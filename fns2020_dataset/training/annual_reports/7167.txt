Directors’ report – Bus iness review:
areas of specialism people better equipped to win in the market conditions of today. 
All these investments position us extremely well to capitalise on 
the next phase of growth.
This year our strategy is focused on driving growth. In the 
international markets we will expand our business through 
organic replication of our operations, building greater scale in our 
existing business and entering a number of exciting new markets 
which we believe have high potential. In the UK, we will retain our 
focus on strengthening our market-leading position by driving 
efficiencies and building market share to ensure the business  
is well positioned to capitalise as trading conditions improve.
dividend
Our dividend policy is designed to support a sustainable dividend 
across the economic cycle, whilst also delivering a progressive 
dividend during periods of growth. After taking account of the 
improving trends in the second half of the year, the Board’s 
confidence in the outlook, and the strength of the Group’s balance 
sheet, the Board proposes to hold the final dividend at last year’s 
level of 3.95 pence. This would result in a full year dividend of 
5.80 pence (2009: 5.80 pence).
people
The past couple of years have been particularly tough for our 
people with many individuals having to take on additional roles 
and responsibilities as we have taken the measures necessary to 
navigate the downturn. However, these difficult times have been 
met at all levels with a level of commitment and determination of 
which I am extremely proud and on behalf of the Board I would 
like to offer our thanks to all our people around the world.
More encouragingly we began to increase our headcount in  
the second half of the year, bringing over 200 new people into 
the business. I welcome our new recruits and I am extremely 
confident that the high level of professionalism and enterprise 
within the business will provide a strong environment within 
which they can develop and build their careers. 
c orporate responsibility
Our approach to corporate responsibility covers a broad range  
of philosophies, activities and standards which are provided in 
detail later in the Annual Report. Again this year we have, as an 
organisation, undertaken numerous events to raise money for 
charity. We organised a fundraising day for the UNICEF Haiti 
Appeal across our global business. In the UK our ‘Beat the moon’ 
event saw over 100 employees climb, cycle, canoe and run across 
the Lake District for our designated UK charity, Action For 
Children. These represent just two of many events which took 
place during the year and which raised over £290,000. This 
characterises and pays testament to both the generosity and 
spirit that exists within the organisation.
Our business has an inherent agility 
and flexibility. Combined with the 
investments we have made we are 
well positioned to capitalise fully  
on the improving market conditions.
We entered the year facing the toughest markets on record  
with most parts of our business contending with reductions in 
demand of more than 40%. Against this background, our business 
achieved a good level of profitability, accruing the benefits of the 
early action taken to reduce the cost base in the previous year. 
In the first half of the year, consultant numbers were reduced 
further giving an overall reduction of 32% from peak levels.  
As we moved into the second half of the year, most of our 
markets started to recover and we rapidly responded by 
reinvesting, particularly in Asia Pacific where we increased  
the headcount by 17% during the second half. As a result,  
we achieved a considerably improved performance in the  
second half of the year and the Group returned to year-on-year 
growth in the fourth quarter. 
Whilst earnings per share* for the year decreased by 58%,  
we consider this to be a solid performance against a difficult 
backdrop. Our business has been thoroughly stress tested over 
the last 18 months and I am pleased to say that we have not only 
demonstrated that our business is built to withstand very tough 
market conditions but we have also delivered one of the leading 
financial performances in the sector.
Whilst we took all the actions necessary to manage the business 
in the downturn we have been extremely careful not to lose  
sight of our long-term objective of capitalising on the tremendous 
structural growth opportunities present in our markets.  
We protected our operational footprint by maintaining our 
geographical coverage and the specialisms offered in each of  
our markets. As reported to you last year, in spite of the difficult 
conditions in our markets we ring-fenced our investment in three 
key areas:
1. IT development programmes 
2. Brand enhancement 
3. People training and development.
As discussed in more detail later in the Annual Report, each of 
these is now beginning to deliver value with the major IT change 
programme concluding, the brand roll-out focused on ‘expertise’ 
as our key differentiator now featuring in all our markets and our 
return to gro Wth

Directors’ report – Bus iness review:
chairman’s statement oft investigation
On 30 September 2009, The Office of Fair Trading (‘OFT’) issued 
its decision, finding that Hays’ Construction & Property business 
in the UK had breached competition law in the period October 
2004 to November 2005. After cooperating fully with the OFT, 
Hays was fined £30.4 million. Whilst the investigation related to 
an isolated matter arising from the conduct of a single employee 
who is no longer with the company and affected only a small part 
of our UK Construction & Property business, we were incredibly 
disappointed to find ourselves involved in such an investigation 
and I can assure you the Board has taken the findings of the 
investigation extremely seriously. Immediately on learning of  
the investigation, we considerably strengthened the Group’s 
compliance and training in this area, and implemented a detailed 
training programme for all key employees. However, we also 
consider the level of the fine to be both arbitrary and wholly 
disproportionate to the activities to which it relates, and hence  
we are currently appealing the decision.
summary
As a shareholder, this is the first major recession during which  
you have been able to assess the resilience of our business  
model. This has been particularly demonstrated by our ability  
to defend profitability in the first half of the year and then focus 
on identified areas of growth in the second half. The inherent  
agility and flexibility of our business model, combined with  
our investment detailed above, position us to capitalise on  
the improving market conditions in nearly all our markets.
As announced on 15 July 2010, I shall be retiring at the  
Annual General Meeting in November and handing the reins  
to Alan Thomson. Since the announcement I have spent much 
time with Alan and he has an outstanding set of skills combined 
with the personality to lead Hays to even greater success.
Since joining the Board in 1998, I have witnessed the 
transformation of the Group into a focused professional 
recruitment business with an increasingly global footprint.  
Today, we are emerging from one of the deepest recessions of 
modern times and Hays, led by Alistair and his executive team,  
is well positioned to capitalise on the exciting opportunities for 
growth available in our markets. On a personal note, I have greatly 
enjoyed my time in the business. I have had exceptional support 
from the Hays team and the Group’s advisors and I do sincerely 
wish everyone all the success that is so richly deserved.

Financial s ta tements r emu neration r epo rt – Governance Directors’ r eport – Governance 1. Cash, profit and productivity maximisation
In the first half of the year, the clear priority was cost control. 
Where necessary, we reduced headcount and over the first half 
Group consultant headcount declined by 4%, bringing the total 
reduction from peak to 32%. Later in the year as we saw markets 
stabilise and recover, we quickly moved from cost reduction into 
investment mode, initially in Asia Pacific and then into other 
important markets including Germany and Brazil. Our ability  
to capitalise on this shift in the markets enabled us to increase 
operating profit by 23%* in the second half versus the first half.
At the same time, we maintained our focus on cash generation, 
delivering another strong cash performance for the year with  
97% conversion of operating profit** into operating cash flow***.
2. Increasing market share
Recessions provide opportunities for strong businesses to 
reinforce their market position and this is what we have achieved 
over the year. We have concentrated our resources on the more 
resilient parts of the market and developed our services to ensure 
they are relevant to our clients in an evolving marketplace. This 
has allowed us to continue to grow parts of our business despite 
the prevailing economic backdrop. Our Pharma business,  
for example, grew net fees by 35%* versus last year as we rolled 
out these services across our international network. Despite the 
pressures on the UK public sector, our Healthcare and Education 
businesses also grew at 29% and 4%, respectively, as we made 
further inroads into these markets.
Around the world, several of our larger clients have sought ways 
of consolidating their supplier base for their recruitment needs 
and looked to partner with organisations who can serve them 
across multiple job categories and sometimes multiple countries. 
This client-driven evolution in the market plays to our strength in 
international coverage and sectoral diversification and we have 
developed our capabilities to best address these opportunities. 
As a result we have further enhanced our market-leading position, 
for example winning multi-service contracts with Bank of America 
and JP Morgan in the UK financial services market, the Audit 
Commission and Department for Business, Enterprise and 
Regulatory Reform (BERR) in the UK public sector, Goodyear  
in China, JDSU across Europe and Asia, and Sony in Europe.  
Our strategy and ability to capture the majority of all professional 
recruiting needs for major organisations such as these will  
be a key driver of growth and market share as recruitment 
volumes recover.
Finally, as mentioned earlier, gaining market share means 
investing in our consultant base. By investing quickly in 
headcount growth in recovering markets around the world  
and redeploying consultants into more resilient markets,  
net fees grew by 8% in the second half versus the first half.
Throughout the recession, we have 
been unwavering in our commitment 
to build a stronger, broader based 
and more efficient business.
revie W o f 2010
2010 was a year of two very distinct halves. After a challenging 
2009, we started 2010 with markets continuing to present  
some of the most difficult conditions on record. The scale and 
pace of the decline in our markets during the downturn was 
unprecedented. In little more than 12 months our global 
permanent placement business halved. Our UK private sector 
fees declined by 58% from their peak and many parts of our 
international business suffered even more severely. Against this 
backdrop, our immediate goal was to defend our business as 
robustly as possible and protect profitability by controlling costs.
The second half of the year was very different as recovery in  
key markets started to gain momentum. The recovery started in 
Australia and Asia and, as the year progressed, broadened across 
Europe and the Americas. Our focus shifted accordingly and, for 
the first time in over 18 months, we started to reinvest in building 
our consultant base to ensure we captured the recovery fully  
in each market. It is very encouraging that these early signs  
of recovery have become more widespread and more firmly 
entrenched in most of our markets and consequently we 
delivered a material rebound in profits during the second half, 
finishing the year with a strengthening outlook in over 90% of  
the business.
strategic progress in 2010
Last year I set out four key areas of focus for the Group. These 
objectives were designed to balance the short-term necessities of 
cash, profit and productivity maximisation with the longer-term 
strategic goals of increasing market share, strengthening our 
brand and completing the roll-out of world-class IT systems.  
I am pleased to say that we have made considerable progress  
in each area.

Directors’ report – Bus iness review:
c hief executive’s strategic r evie W 3. Complete roll-out of IT systems
Technology is a key tool to allow our consultants to do a better, 
faster, and more expert job for their customers. Our ability to  
best match a client’s need with the very best person for the job  
is a function of our consultants’ skill, the calibre of candidates  
we attract and the quality of their systems to find that perfect 
match. Having the very best systems is an important competitive 
advantage and I am pleased to say we have now substantially 
completed the global roll-out of our new front-office systems.
We have also substantially completed our UK back-office 
automation project. The new system is live and provides 
automated timesheet, payment and billing processes as  
well as real-time management information for driving our 
business. We have taken considerable costs out of our UK 
administrative functions, improved our customer service and, 
importantly, put in place a system with real economies of scale 
which will deliver significant returns as UK volumes recover.
4. Strengthen our brand position
Leading companies have leading brands and 2010 saw the launch 
of our new brand positioning: ‘Recruiting experts worldwide’.  
By exploiting our brand we aim to raise the profile of our business 
wherever we operate, differentiate ourselves from our competitors 
and better communicate our unique expertise to our customers.
The real value of our brand though is in our ability to embed and 
deepen our expertise in everything we do to continually improve 
the service experience for our clients and candidates. The quality 
of our brand ultimately depends on the quality of the service our 
consultants provide and that is why a large proportion of our 
investment this year has been focused on further strengthening 
our training programmes.
This has ranged from standardising our induction and technical 
training for consultants, and deepening our sector expertise skills 
through to the launch of the ‘ManagementDirect’ to develop our 
management and leadership capability in conjunction with the 
Chartered Institute of Management and leading international 
business schools. The benefit of these investments will be realised 
through improved customer satisfaction which, in turn, will deliver 
increased market share and fees. However, it is rewarding to see 
our efforts recognised and we have won several industry awards 
including ‘Best Temp/Interim Recruitment Firm’ for Hays UK 
Financial Markets and ‘Best Use of Online Recruitment’ at the 
2010 UK Online Recruitment Awards.

† Measured by operating profit. priorities for 2011
Our unwavering objective is to build the pre-eminent global 
business in professional recruitment and we aim to do that 
regardless of the economic backdrop. To achieve this, our 
strategy revolves around four components: growing our business 
by replication, improving operational effectiveness, developing 
the best people in the industry and applying the ‘Hays Way’ of 
doing things consistently across the world. This translates into  
the following key areas of focus for 2011:
1. Continue international diversification
The long-term opportunities to develop a number of international 
markets are substantial. Over the years we have demonstrated 
our ability to capitalise on the structural changes in these 
markets, growing our international fees by 38% in 2007 and 54% 
in 2008. Five years ago we were a business dominated by our  
UK operations with only a quarter of our fees earned overseas. 
Today, 60% of our fees are delivered from our international 
markets and we expect this diversification to continue.
Our goal is to more than double our international consultant 
headcount within the next five years and we are on track to 
deliver that objective. We are continuing to add headcount across 
Asia Pacific, Germany and Brazil and expect to reinvest in the 
remainder of Continental Europe as the recovery gains traction. 
We also plan to expand into new geographies over the year.  
In the US, we will open operations in New Jersey to service our 
pharmaceutical clients initially. Following the tremendous success 
of our Brazilian business, we will commence our regional roll-out 
across South America with a launch in Mexico.
2. Drive productivity and efficiency gains
Having installed the core systems, we are now focussed on 
harnessing the full capacity of our new technology to drive 
consultant productivity, increase efficiency and enhance 
customer service.
We are also working on enhancing our online presence and 
providing our customers with a rich and user-friendly way of 
engaging with us via the internet. The internet is already a very 
important channel for us, but we aim to develop our online 
content and transactional capability further. Equally, our new 
state-of-the-art systems allow us to develop multiple platforms to 
communicate with clients and candidates in the way they choose. 
Hence, we have introduced applications developed specifically  
for the iPhone and iPad and we will continue to adapt our online 
presence for mobile platforms where appropriate.
3. Leverage the brand
Last year we launched the brand. This year we will entrench it  
into everything we do across the world. This means investment  
in more training, the development of new initiatives to enhance 
our customer service delivery, promoting our expertise in the 
professional employment marketplace and the development  
of thought-provoking and expert insights into key skills and 
employment issues in each of our markets around the world.  
Our entire business is based upon finding the right person for  
our clients’ needs. That is a hugely valuable service to provide  
and we intend to be the undisputed experts in the professional 
employment marketplace so all of our branding efforts will be 
directed at this goal.
4. Attract, retain and develop the best people
We are in an industry where the limiting factor on growth is not 
capital but people and their capabilities. Attracting, developing 
and retaining the best people is critical to our success. That is why 
we invested throughout the downturn to reinforce our training 
programmes and we will continue to do so as our business 
recovers. Our aim is to strengthen and broaden all aspects of  
our capability, from new consultants through to senior leaders, 
and ensure we can pursue more growth opportunities in parallel 
during the next cycle of growth.
bob l awson 
As we announced in July, Bob will retire from the Board and  
step down from his role as Chairman in November. On behalf  
of everyone at Hays I would like to thank Bob for the great 
commitment and leadership he has brought to the Group over  
the past 12 years. Bob oversaw the transformation of Hays from  
a conglomerate to a world-leading specialist recruitment business 
and was also instrumental in developing our company from being 
a principally UK business into an international group which now 
operates in 28 countries and generates the majority of fees from 
outside the UK. On a personal level I have immensely enjoyed 
working with Bob over the past three years and I would like to 
thank him for allowing me to benefit from his depth of knowledge 
and experience, together with his wise counsel and good humour. 
On behalf of all my colleagues, I wish him all the very best of luck 
in the future. 
“ This year will be about exploiting the opportunities in the upturn.  
We have dealt with the recession well, now we must capitalise on the 
momentum we are seeing in most of the markets in which we operate.”
12 Hays plc a nn ual r ep ort & Financial s ta tements 2010
Directors’ report – Bus iness review:
c hief executive’s strategic revie W I am also pleased to welcome to the Group Alan Thomson who 
will become our new Chairman following the Annual General 
Meeting in November. Alan brings a wealth and depth of 
international experience both from his current roles as Chairman 
of Bodycote plc, Senior Independent Director and Audit Committee 
Chairman of Johnson Matthey plc and non-executive director of 
Alstom SA. Alan joins us at a very exciting time in our journey and 
will bring a major contribution to our business.
summary
Throughout the recession, we have been unwavering in our 
commitment to build a stronger, broader based and more 
efficient business. Last year we ring-fenced and delivered on our 
key investment projects, despite tough trading conditions. This 
year our strategy remains substantially unchanged: to continue 
our international diversification and to build on the investments 
we have made in the areas of IT, marketing and people development. 
The key change is one of emphasis. Whilst last year was primarily 
about limiting the impact of the recession and strengthening the 
platform for future growth, this year will be about exploiting the 
opportunities in the upturn. We have dealt with the recession well, 
now we must capitalise on the momentum we are seeing in most 
of the markets in which we operate.

In Asia Pacific, net fees decreased by 2% (18% on a like-for-like 
basis*) to £146.3 million and operating profit decreased by  
15% (30% on a like-for-like basis*) to £52.0 million. The division 
represents 65% of Group operating profit, making Asia Pacific  
the largest contributing division. The difference between  
actual growth and like-for-like growth was mainly due to the 
appreciation in the Australian dollar. The business achieved a 
strong conversion rate of 35.5% for the year, with the second half 
conversion rate at 36.5%.
In our market-leading Australia and New Zealand business,  
net fees were down 21%* versus prior year. Net fees decreased  
by 18%* in the temporary placement business and by 25%* in the 
permanent placement business. Following a period of sequential 
net fee stability in the first quarter of the year we recorded three 
consecutive quarters of sequential net fee growth as we capitalised 
on the strong private sector recovery across all specialisms and 
states. The recovery was driven by the permanent placement 
business, which achieved 35%* sequential net fee growth in  
the second half, with a more modest recovery in temporary 
placement which achieved 4%* sequential net fee growth in  
the second half. The recovery has been broadly based across  
all specialisms, led by Financial Services and Resources & Mining 
with each of these specialisms achieving sequential net fee 
growth in excess of 30%* in the second half. In our public sector 
business, which accounts for 25% of net fees in Australia and  
New Zealand, net fees were sequentially stable through the year. 
Our Asian business, which accounted for 12% of the division’s net 
fees in the period, achieved net fee growth of 14%* versus prior 
year. Market conditions improved markedly through the year, 
driven by improved levels of demand across a broad range  
of specialisms, culminating in all-time record monthly net fee 
performances being achieved by Japan, China and Singapore 
during the year. We are aggressively pursuing our strategy of 
doubling the size of this business within the next two years and 
Asia is now operating at above its pre-downturn level.
Consultant headcount** in Asia Pacific increased by 14% during  
the year with significant headcount investment in the second half. 
In Australia and New Zealand, consultant headcount increased by 
12% in the second half with broad investment across all specialisms 
and regions. In Asia, consultant headcount was added aggressively 
and broadly in the second half, resulting in a 43% increase to  
175 consultants, which is 6% above the pre-downturn peak.

In Continental Europe & RoW, net fees decreased by 12% (16%  
on a like-for-like basis*) to £167.5 million and operating profit** 
decreased by 48% (50% on a like-for-like basis*) to £17.1 million. 
This division now represents 21% of Group operating profit**.  
The difference between actual growth and like-for-like growth 
was mainly due to the appreciation in the Euro. The conversion 
rate declined from 17.3% to 10.2% in 2010.
Our German business, representing 48% of the division’s net  
fees and the majority of the division’s profits, recorded a 12%* 
decrease in net fees versus prior year. Germany has been the 
Group’s most resilient country through the downturn and, on a 
sequential basis, net fees in Germany showed a stable trend in  
the first half of the year before recording 8%* sequential net fee 
growth in the second half, driven by a broad-based recovery of 
the temporary and permanent placement markets. Our German 
business continues to diversify into a broader range of specialisms 
including Accountancy & Finance, Construction & Property, Sales 
& Marketing, Legal and Pharma, which now account for 21% of 
total net fees in Germany (2005: 3%). Our market-leading position 
and increasing diversification of the business place us in a strong 
position to benefit from the improving market conditions. 
Our other businesses in this division, covering 19 countries, are 
focused principally on the permanent placement markets. After 
experiencing sequential net fee stability in the first half of the 
year, most countries returned to sequential growth in the second 
half as client and candidate confidence levels improved across  
our markets. Our businesses in Brazil, Portugal, Denmark and 
Hungary each achieved all-time record fee months during the 
fourth quarter of the year, with 14 countries across the region 
achieving net fee growth of over 10%* in this quarter. Our 
businesses in Southern and Eastern Europe, which currently 
contribute 11% of the division’s net fees, have seen no impact  
from the sovereign debt issues.
Consultant headcount*** decreased by 3% during the year. This 
comprised a 9% reduction in the first half which was partially 
offset by a 6% increase in the second half, with increases in 
Germany and Brazil. We currently plan to add headcount more 
broadly across the region after the summer vacation period. 
During the downturn we protected the infrastructure in these 
businesses and as a result we are well positioned to capitalise  
on the significant structural and cyclical growth that we expect  
to see in the coming years.

In the United Kingdom & Ireland, net fees declined by 26% to 
£243.9 million, and operating profit** declined by 82% to £11.4 million. 
Net fees decreased by 23% in the temporary placement business 
and by 32% in the permanent placement business. The conversion 
rate declined from 19.2% to 4.7% this year.
Overall, demand remained sequentially stable throughout the 
period with net fees in the second half of the year in line with  
the first half. In the private sector, net fees improved sequentially 
in the second half versus the first half with Pharma, Corporate 
Accounts and City-related recruitment all achieving particularly 
strong growth. As expected, performances in the public sector 
were mixed. In frontline service areas we continued to achieve 
growth, with net fees in our Healthcare and Education businesses 
up 29% and 4%, respectively, versus prior year. In contrast,  
the pressures on public finances impacted the remainder of our 
public sector business, particularly in Construction & Property 
and back-office functions. Overall public sector net fees, which 
currently represent 30% of our United Kingdom & Ireland net 
fees, decreased by 19% versus prior year, and are now more  
than a third below peak levels.
Consultant headcount*** in the United Kingdom & Ireland was 
reduced by 5% during the year with most of the reduction being 
undertaken near the start of the year. Throughout the year,  
we have supported growth in the private sector by redirecting 
resources from the public sector and we will continue to do  
this if current trends continue. As a result, we expect to broadly 
maintain headcount at current levels in the coming months. 
In the year, 38 offices were closed as we have continued to drive 
efficiency savings by consolidating operations in selected cities. 
We have also made excellent progress on our key efficiency 
investment programmes this year. Our new front-office system 
has been fully rolled out across the United Kingdom & Ireland 
business and we are now focused on leveraging this to increase 
consultant productivity and deliver enhanced client and candidate 
service. The back-office automation project will complete  
in October 2010. As a result of this implementation, and the 
reduction in volumes during the downturn, our back-office 
headcount will be reduced by around 50% from peak levels  
to around 300, of which a significant proportion will be based  
in India. We have also continued to strengthen our national 
corporate account management and recruitment outsource 
services. These investments have yielded several important client 
wins, including Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, The Audit 
Commission and Northampton County Council, during the year. 
These wins have consolidated our market-leading position, 
particularly in the City.

Directors’ r eport – Business r eview Di rectors’ r e port – Governance r emu neration r epo rt – Governance Financial s ta tements Hays plc a nn ual r ep ort & Financial s ta tements 2010 27 The temporary placement business, representing 58% of Group 
net fees, was more resilient through the downturn than the 
permanent placement business, with net fees decreasing by 18%*. 
This reflected a volume decrease of 9% and a 160 basis point 
reduction in the underlying temporary margin to 15.2% (2009: 
16.8%)****. Around half of the margin reduction was a result of  
the mix effect of a greater proportion of placements being made 
through large volume contracts, with the balance of the reduction 
resulting from modest pricing pressure impacting our major 
temporary placement markets, namely Australia, Germany and 
the UK. 
However, the margin remained broadly stable on a sequential 
basis across all markets in the second half of the year. On a 
sequential basis, Group temporary placement net fees increased 
by 4%* in the second half of the year driven by increased demand 
in our Australian, German and UK private sector businesses,  
and we continue to see improving trends in these markets.
Net fees in the permanent placement business, representing 42% 
of Group net fees, declined by 26%*, with permanent placement 
volumes decreasing by 19%. Average fees per placement 
decreased by 8%* compared to last year, primarily due to a less 
favourable mix. Market conditions were very difficult across all 
countries at the start of the year, however, in the second half of 
the year we saw improved levels of demand across nearly all  
our businesses, with particularly strong recovery in Asia Pacific. 
This drove sequential net fee growth of 15%* in our permanent 
placement business in the second half of the year with the 
momentum continuing into the current year. 
We saw a broad based recovery  
in the second half of the year and 
capitalised on this with sequential  
net fee growth of 8%* and operating 
profit** growth of 23%, * versus the 
first half.
The performance of the Group during the year has been impacted 
by tough trading conditions although market conditions improved 
markedly in the second half of the year. Overall, Group turnover 
increased by 5%*, net fees decreased by 17% (declining by 21%  
on a like-for-like basis*), and operating profit decreased by  
49% (53% on a like-for-like basis*). The results benefited from 
exchange rate movements, principally the Australian Dollar and 
the Euro, which had a favourable impact increasing net fees by 
£37.2 million and operating profit by £13.9 million. The increase  
in turnover was primarily due to significant corporate account 
wins, which include a high proportion of pass through third-party 
supplier revenues, and the withdrawal of Staff Hire Concession.

The Group’s cost base excluding exceptional items was 11%*  
lower than last year, principally due to the early actions taken at 
the start of the previous year to realign the cost base. However, 
lower placement volumes versus last year and the lower level  
of average consultant productivity achievable in a demand 
constrained market led to a reduction in the Group’s conversion 
rate, which is the proportion of net fees converted into operating 
profit**, from 23.6% in the last year to 14.4% this year. As the 
improvement in market conditions in the second half of the year 
led to an increase in consultant productivity levels, we achieved 
an improved conversion rate of 15.5% versus 13.3% in the first half.
Group consultant headcount***** at the year end was 1% below 
the position at the start of the year. This comprised an increase  
of 14% in Asia Pacific, as we rapidly invested to capitalise on the 
strong recovery in market conditions, offset by a 5% reduction in 
the United Kingdom & Ireland and a 3% reduction in Continental 
Europe & Rest of World, with most of these reductions being 
made near the start of the year.
exceptional costs
There is an exceptional cost of £41.4 million included in the 
Consolidated Income Statement in 2010. Of this, £29.0 million 
relates to The Office of Fair Trading’s (‘OFT’s) decision, as 
disclosed in the Half Year Report, which found that Hays’ 
Construction & Property business in the UK had breached 
competition law in the period October 2004 to November 2005. 
Hays co-operated fully with the OFT in its investigation under  
the leniency regime and was fined £30.4 million. The Group is 
appealing the decision and whilst in progress, the £30.4 million 
fine is being held on deposit by Hays. The remaining £12.4 million 
of the exceptional cost relates to a non-recurring restructuring 
cost which we disclosed in the fourth quarter trading update.  
This related principally to the back-office staff redundancy costs 
and non-cash asset write-downs following the near completion  
of the United Kingdom back-office automation project.
n et finance charge
The net finance charge for the year was £9.4 million (2009:  
£7.0 million). The average interest rate on gross debt during  
the year was 1.0% (2009: 3.2%), generating a net bank interest 
payable of £1.6 million (2009: £3.5 million). There was a non-cash 
net interest charge on the defined pension scheme obligations of 
£6.7 million (2009: £2.4 million) with the increase mainly due to 
the lower expected return on scheme assets, and a charge for the 
Pension Protection Fund levy of £1.1 million (2009: £1.1 million).  
It is expected that the net finance charge for the year ending  
30 June 2011 will be at a similar level to 2010.
t axation
Taxation before exceptional items** for the year was £26.6 million, 
representing an effective tax rate of 37.4% (2009: 29.9%).  
The increase in the effective tax rate was a result of the changing 
geographical mix of profits, the presence of unrelieved tax losses 
in some countries during the period and an increase in disallowable 
expenses. The Group also recognised a £3.5 million tax credit in 
respect of the exceptional restructuring cost incurred in the year, 
bringing the total tax charge in the year to £23.1 million. It is 
expected that the effective tax rate will reduce in 2011 to around 
34% as a number of countries return to profitability and available 
tax losses are utilised.
earnings per share
Basic earnings per share before exceptional items** decreased 
58% to 3.25 pence (2009: 7.72 pence). The fall in earnings per 
share reflects the reduction in operating profit, the higher net 
finance charge and the increase in the effective tax rate. Basic 
earnings per share post-exceptional items decreased 94% to  
0.48 pence.

Dividends paid in the year totalled £79.5 million and £3.3 million 
was paid out in net interest. Principally due to the payment  
of the dividend, net debt increased from a net cash position of 
£0.7 million at the start of the year to net debt of £77.2 million  
at the end of the year. During the recession we have reduced  
net debt by around £40 million, whilst maintaining the payment 
of the Group’s dividend, which demonstrates the consistency  
of the Group’s operating cash flow and the robustness of  
Hays’ business model. 
The Group completed the refinancing of its revolving credit 
banking facility on 1 July 2010. The new facility of £300 million 
provides considerable headroom versus current and future 
expected levels of Group debt. The covenants in the new facility 
require the Group’s interest cover to be at least 4:1 and its 
leverage ratio (net debt to EBITDA) to be no greater than 2.5:1. 
The Group has significant headroom within these covenants. 
c apital structure and dividend
The Board’s current priorities for our free cash flow are to fund 
Group development, maintain the strength of the balance sheet 
and to support a sustainable dividend policy. After taking account 
of the improving trading trends in the second half of the year,  
the Board’s confidence in the outlook and the strength of the 
Group’s balance sheet, the Board proposes to maintain the final 
dividend at last year’s level of 3.95 pence per share, equating to 
£54.2 million. This would make a total dividend for the full year  
of 5.80 pence per share (2009: 5.80 pence). The recommended 
dividend payment date will be 19 November 2010 and will be  
paid to shareholders on the register at close of business on  
22 October 2010.
c ash flow and balance sheet
Cash flow in the year was strong with 97% conversion of 
operating profit** into operating cash flow***, driven by continued 
close control of working capital. Overall, net cash generated  
by operations*** was £78.1 million (2009: £260.9 million).  
Cash outflow from working capital was £21.4 million, resulting 
principally from the £20 million payment to other agencies 
relating to the withdrawal of the staff hire concession at the  
start of the year which reversed the one-off cash inflow received 
in June 2009. Trade debtor days, at 35 days, remained in line with 
prior year (2009: 35 days). Tax paid was £22.1 million. 
Net capital expenditure was £29.8 million, reflecting the 
additional expenditure on the Group’s key IT projects. These IT 
projects are now substantially complete and therefore capital 
expenditure in the year to June 2011 will reduce to historic levels 
of around £15 million per annum. As a result of the expenditure on 
the IT projects, this year’s depreciation and amortisation charge 
increased to £14.6 million from £11.6 million last year, and we 
expect this to increase to around £22 million next year. In respect 
of the James Harvard acquisition, £18.7 million was paid in the 
year representing the final deferred consideration payment 
following the very strong post-acquisition performance of this 
business. In the year, the James Harvard acquisition generated 
£11.4 million operating profit which compares to a total 
consideration paid of £48.3 million.

“  After taking account of the improving trading trends in the second half  
of the year, the Board’s confidence in the outlook and the strength of the 
Group’s balance sheet, the Board proposes to maintain the final dividend  
at last year’s level.”
r etirement benefits
The Group’s pension liability under IAS 19 at 30 June 2010 of  
£67. 1 million (£48.3 million net of deferred tax) decreased by  
£42.1 million compared to 30 June 2009, primarily due to the 
greater than expected return from the scheme’s assets and  
the lower than expected level of underlying scheme liabilities, 
partially offset by a decrease in the discount rate. During the year, 
the Company contributed £5.5 million of cash into the defined 
benefit scheme, which included £1.2 million additional funding 
towards the pension deficit.
To address the pension deficit, Hays has agreed in principle with 
the Trustees of the pension scheme to increase its deficit funding 
into the scheme to £12 million per annum (£9 million net of tax), 
increasing thereafter by 3% per annum, with effect from the 2011 
financial year. This revised level of annual payments towards the 
deficit funding is at the lower end of the guidance previously 
given of between £10 million and £20 million per annum. 
c urrent trading
The outlook across 90% of our markets continues to improve, 
including the UK private sector. The agility and flexibility of our 
business, combined with the investments we have made during 
the downturn, ideally position us to capitalise on the significant 
growth opportunities that are increasingly present across  
our markets.
t reasury management
The Group’s treasury operations remain straightforward and 
uncomplicated with Group operations financed by retained 
earnings and bank borrowings. On 1 July 2010 the Group 
completed the renewal of its reduced £300 million revolving 
credit facility, in place until January 2014, and it uses this facility 
to manage its day-to-day working capital requirements as 
appropriate. All borrowings are raised by the Group’s UK-based 
treasury department, which manages the Group’s treasury risk  
in accordance with policies set by the Board. The Group’s treasury 
department does not engage in speculative transactions and 
does not operate as a profit centre.
Counterparty risk primarily arises from investment of any surplus 
funds. The Group restricts transactions to banks and money 
market funds that have an acceptable credit rating and limits 
exposure to each institution.

•	 The year-on-year growth in our net fees provides a measure  
of the business development and growth in each period.
•	 In 2010, net fees decreased by 21%* as a result of weak market 
conditions across the business, particularly in the first half  
of the year.
•	 The average net fees generated per sales consultant*** 
represents how productive fee earners are in the business. 
•	 In 2010, net fees per consultant increased by 1% as  
we benefited from the early actions taken to reduce  
the consultant headcount and from the improved market  
conditions in the second half of the year which enabled  
greater consultant productivity.
•	 The conversion rate is the operating profit** stated as a 
percentage of net fees and measures how effective the Group 
is at controlling the costs and expenses associated with its 
normal operations and its level of investment for the future.
•	 The conversion rate decreased in 2010 as the difficult market 
conditions resulted in an increased level of fixed cost in the 
business relative to net fees.

Directors’ r eport – Business r eview Di rectors’ r e port – Governance r emu neration r epo rt – Governance Financial s ta tements Hays plc a nn ual r ep ort & Financial s ta tements 2010 33 Dear shareholder 
The past year has been tough for the world economy. Yet  
against this background it is encouraging to see that corporate 
responsibility (‘CR’) has gained further momentum. Watchwords 
like governance, accountability, risk control, ethics and 
sustainability have taken on greater prominence. Put each of 
these words into a search engine and you will hit upwards of  
450 million web pages. For Hays, they are integral to the way we 
want to do business, building trust with people and organisations 
we rely on for our success.
Our whole business model is based on providing a service that  
is very relevant in the world we live in today, namely helping 
organisations find the people they need to flourish and helping 
individuals find the next role to further their own careers and 
livelihoods. We take our role in this process very seriously,  
not just because it drives our business but also because it is a 
meaningful and responsible role in society in general. This holds 
true wherever we operate, whether it be helping to solve local 
employment issues in any one of our many markets, helping 
multinationals tap into global talent pools or bringing our  
services to new markets such as Brazil and India.
We have continued to integrate CR into everything we do, for 
example, this year we have measured our global carbon footprint 
for the first time. While our business has a low environmental 
impact, we work to reduce it each year.
We also seek to use our scale to make our contribution toward 
national and international charitable appeals. I was proud of  
our response to the January Haiti earthquake appeal, which  
saw Hays employees from 22 countries working together to  
help earthquake victims, and within many of our regions we 
support local charities, by both volunteering and donating.
We have been operating our new CR business plan for a year 
now, co-ordinated by our Corporate Responsibility Steering 
Group. Already we have achieved a number of our early 
milestones. There remain many challenges ahead but I am 
confident that we will meet them with ingenuity and resolve.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT VALUES
We are the world’s leading recruiting experts in qualified, 
professional and skilled work. By truly understanding our 
candidates and clients, locally and globally, we help people 
and companies achieve lasting impact. Our values aim  
to reflect this promise. Our values underpin our skills, 
behaviours and way of doing business. These values are:
 Amb i t i ou s
As a results-orientated company we are continually driven 
to succeed. Our energy and dynamism makes us ambitious 
for our people, clients and candidates, and for the positive 
impact we know recruiting can have in their lives. 
Passionate About People
We are a people business so we’re passionate about 
creating valuable relationships with everyone we work  
with. Our enthusiasm compels us to find the right person, 
believing this is fundamental to improving their life and 
work, allowing people to be all they can be. 
 E x p e r t
As experts across many industry sectors and professions, 
our professional know-how and unique understanding of 
markets and people is shared with our clients, candidates 
and across our expanding global network. 
Inquisitive
We’re always curious, wanting to understand more about 
people and the world of work. That’s how we build deeper 
knowledge into what makes people fit culturally and how 
companies and people can achieve their full potential.
For information on our business principles and policies, 
please visit haysplc.com/hays/corporateresponsibility.
 
EMPLOYEES
Our business is dependent upon our employees, not only those 
who deal with clients and candidates, but also those who support 
them. As a consequence, our people strategy continues to focus 
on ensuring that we have the necessary capabilities, resources 
and work environment appropriate for a high-performing 
organisation. 
We want to attract, retain and develop the best people in the 
industry to work for Hays. In order to achieve this, we have 
focused on a number of key themes. In particular, 2010 has  
seen continued progress in the areas of employee engagement, 
succession planning, talent management and leadership 
development. 
Employee engagement 
Each year we receive a very good response to TALKback,  
our employee engagement survey, that runs across all the 
geographies in which Hays operates. 2010 participation levels 
were no exception with just over 70% of employees expressing 
their views and opinions in all aspects of their workplace 
environment, our brand, our values, our leadership and 
development activity and the work that we do for clients. 
Although slightly fewer employees participated in the 2010 
survey, it shows that the majority of employees want to share 
their views with us and see a value in doing so. 
Gathering our employees’ views enables us to understand and 
monitor levels of engagement and highlight any areas of concern 
that we need to address. Key drivers of employee engagement  
in Hays are career development, leadership and direction,  
culture and collaboration. Overall reported engagement levels 
were unchanged from the prior year, at 77%, reflecting positive 
responses to most of the items that make up this dimension. 
Given the amount of change that our employees have 
experienced during the year with new systems and ways of 
working, as well as the difficulties of operating in a challenging 
economic environment and the backdrop of the global financial 
crisis, this reflects the high level of commitment from our 
employees of which we are justly proud.
Kpi : employee engagement Employee engagement comprises a number of components that explore areas 
such as employees’ sense of belonging, discretionary eort, personal motivation 
and job satisfaction.

Our resourcing, training and development programmes  
are designed to ensure that we have a pool of well qualified,  
talented individuals, able to meet both the operational needs  
of our business and our clients, as well as the future strategic 
challenges facing the Company. We are committed to providing 
our employees with opportunities to develop and grow their skills, 
but we will also continue to bring in new capabilities to the 
business through targeted, external recruitment. 
Employees are encouraged to take a proactive approach to 
developing their careers. Employee training and development 
takes many forms, from the more traditional classroom teaching 
through to ‘lunch and learn’ sessions, e-learning, on-the-job 
coaching, development projects and secondments. In 2010  
we worked closely with the Chartered Management Institute  
and launched an online global e-learning and resource centre 
‘ManagementDirect’, which is available to all employees. This 
allows employees to develop their skills in a broad range of areas, 
explore a range of different media and learn at their own pace.
Additionally, Hays aims for all employees to have regular 
discussions with their managers regarding their performance, 
potential and their individual development needs. 
Hays conducts an annual succession planning process to assess 
the strengths and development opportunities of the Group at all 
levels globally. The picture of Group succession is built bottom  
up by specialism, country and region. Succession plans are 
maintained for key areas of the business and are reviewed 
annually by both management and the Board. 
Leadership development
The calibre of our leadership and management cadre is critical  
to the success of our business. 2010 saw the launch of ‘Fast 
Forward’, our flagship global executive development programme 
for our most senior leaders. This has been funded under the 
auspices of the Waxman Scholarship and combines formal 
classroom training at internationally renowned business schools 
with individual and team coaching, ‘live’ project-based work on 
global business issues and action learning. Work is also under way 
on developing our Advanced Management Programme, the  
‘Hays AMP’ to deliver a broader executive curriculum to our key 
senior management populations in each region. In order that  
our executive development activity remains closely tailored  
and aligned to the succession planning needs of the business,  
we have also completed the first phase of running global executive 
development centres. This ensures that we have an objectively 
benchmarked understanding as to where our strengths lie and 
that we address any capability gaps with targeted responses.
Values and behaviour 
Hays believes that the way our employees work is just as 
important as what they do in the workplace. To supplement  
our leadership and management development activity, we have 
focused on the behaviours and values that are important to  
the way that we run the business. The Hays Leadership and 
Management Competencies cover key areas of, and expectations 
around, behaviour and are being embedded into our key, 
people-related processes. 
Reward and recognition 
We seek to reward and recognise people’s contributions to  
the business appropriately, both as individuals and as a team. 
Programmes to achieve this are cascaded through the 
organisation to ensure that there is a focus on short and,  
where appropriate, long-term performance. Senior executive 
remuneration is linked to the Group’s annual and long-term plans, 
which is described in the Remuneration Report on pages 56  
to 61.
Diversity 
Hays believes that diversity is a key driver of the organisation’s 
effectiveness, both now and in the future. We actively encourage 
different viewpoints, styles and approaches, and are committed 
to providing a workplace free from discrimination of any kind.  
A notable success in this area has come in Australia, where once 
again we were awarded the ‘Employer of Choice for Women’ 
status for 2010. Hays was the first recruitment company to 
achieve this award and the only one to achieve it consecutively  
for eight years. This citation is awarded to non-government 
organisations that have demonstrated policies and practices that 
support women across the organisation and have had a positive 
outcome for both women and the business. This award 
strengthens our competitive edge and allows us to promote 
publicly our commitment to recruiting, developing and retaining 
women at Hays.
“ Our business is dependent upon our employees, not only those who  
deal with clients and candidates, but also those who support them.  
As a consequence, our people strategy continues to focus on ensuring  
that we have the necessary capabilities, resources and work environment 
appropriate for a high-performing organisation.”
Each year, EOWA, an Australian Government department, 
assesses applications from a range of organisations  
to create a list of great places for women to work. 
Organisations on this list need to meet a series of  
criteria each year designed to ensure their workplaces 
have a focus on ensuring equity for all female staff.
By applying for and receiving this citation, organisations are not only 
meeting the criteria, they are publicly declaring their commitment  
to making their workplaces equitable.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT MANAGING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF HAYS  
AND ITS SUPPLIERS 
Whilst our business has a low environmental impact,  
we are committed to achieving continuous improvement  
in environmental performance and to preventing pollution.  
We seek to minimise our impact by reducing our use of energy, 
water and raw materials, increasing efficiency and re-using 
wherever possible. 
Hays recognises that environmental initiatives do not work in 
isolation. So we are developing our environmentally-sensitive 
procurement arrangements that encourage suppliers and 
contractors to support our programmes and to minimise  
the impact of the goods and services that they provide to us. 
Before we select a large supplier in the UK, we establish by 
questionnaire, the supplier’s policy, practice and targets in the 
areas of corporate responsibility and environmental management.

target to cut London’s emissions by 60% by 2025. During  
the year, we were awarded the Green500 Gold Award in 
recognition of work undertaken since joining the scheme.
PROMOTING HEALTH AND SAFETY 
It is the policy of Hays that all reasonably practicable steps  
will be taken to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of its 
employees and the protection of others not in its employment. 
Hays recognises its statutory obligations to maintain standards  
of safety and its obligation to members of the public, contractors 
and visitors. 
Managers work to provide and maintain safe and healthy working 
conditions, carry out suitable risk assessments of all premises  
and tasks carried out within them and monitor safety procedures. 
They involve employees, who are required to co-operate fully  
in the operation of the health and safety policy. The policy is 
reviewed annually and is revised appropriately in the light of 
legislative or organisational changes.
POLICIES THAT SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS AIMS 
Our good conduct is a foundation for the trust our customers 
place in us. We are a commercial organisation and we will pursue 
the best possible economic return for our shareholders. However, 
in making economic decisions, we have regard to the impact of 
those decisions on other stakeholders, including society and the 
wider environment.

in the area of corporate responsibility and we will seek to develop 
the quality of our reporting year-on-year. We continue to keep  
the need for any further KPI disclosures under review. In the

USING OUR GLOBAL SCALE TO 
IMPROVE THE LIVES OF MANY
JUST SOME OF THE MANY Ex AMPLES  
OF OUR CHARITABLE SUPPORT
In January 2010, over 220,000 people 
died and 300,000 people were injured 
by the devastating Haiti earthquake. 
Hays employees from 22 countries joined 
together to raise £53,000 for the Unicef 
appeal. This money has gone towards 
Unicef’s relief projects giving safe water 
t o 	 333, 000 	 peop l e, 	 s u pp l y i ng 	 185, 000	
children with educational materials and

of the Haiti victims:
•	 	 Ha y s 	 S pa i n 	 or g an i sed 	 a 	 ‘ s o l i d ar i ty

Spain published all 45 client logos in 
El País.

Marketing Day was the focus of 
activity and for every job registered 
on the day, Hays donated $10 to  
the appeal.
HAITI
BRAZIL
In support of the Canadian Breast 
Cancer Foundation CIBC Run for the 
Cure, several Hays ‘Recruiters for 
Hooters’ teams participated in the 
annual run raising funds for breast 
cancer research, and education and 
awareness programmes.
Employees from offices in the Toronto 
area raised £5,400 for the WWF, 
climbing the 1,776 steps of the CN Tower, 
the world’s second tallest building.
In our Vancouver office, business 
clothing was collected for Dress for 
Success – which equips women seeking 
employment and self-sufficiency  
to confidently tackle job interviews.  
Hays Vancouver also supports a  
local women’s crisis shelter providing 
transition housing to rape and abuse 
victims and their children.
CANADA
Last Christmas, employees from the  
Rio de Janeiro office gave up their  
usual ‘Secret Santa’ tradition in order to 
shower the children of Lalec (Lar Amor 
Luz e Esperança da Criança) with a 
‘Social’ Secret Santa. Lalec is a shelter 
for abandoned children suffering from 
social vulnerability, giving care and hope 
to children until they are reintegrated 
into society.
Hays employees spent the day with the 
children, distributed gifts and donated 
some much needed items to the shelter. 
The team decided they had benefited 
more from this visit than the children 
themselves.

friends took part in the ‘Beat the Moon’ 
charity challenge in May 2010, raising 
over £55,000 matched by a Hays UK 
contribution of £40,000. The challenge 
required participants to complete a 
series of physical challenges over the 
course of one day: cycling for nine miles, 
a nine mile trek to the top of Scafell Pike 
(the highest point in England), a 
canoeing stint on Wast Water, before 
finishing with a one mile run to the  
finish line before the moon rose.

In May 2010, Hays Portugal celebrated  
10 years supporting the work of 
Fundação Gil, an organisation that 
provides social support to children 
hospitalised for long periods and shelter 
for children in need of non-medical help.
£12,000 donated in Australia – our 
involvement remains as strong as ever

charity using fun therapy to bring 
optimism and happiness to the lives of 
children and families affected by cancer. 
Camp Quality is known for its activity 
camps where cancer takes a back seat  
to allow ‘the kids to be happy kids again’. 
This outstanding effort has enabled us 
to fund camps for over 35 children.

Activities of the Audit Committee 
The Committee met four times during the financial year ended  
30 June 2010. Attendance at meetings is shown on page 51.
During the year, the Committee discharged its responsibilities  
as follows: 
Financial statements 
The Audit Committee reviewed the draft annual financial 
statements and half year report prior to recommending their 
approval to the Board. The Committee discussed with the 
executive directors and external Auditor the appropriateness  
of accounting polices adopted, significant estimates and 
judgements, whether the financial statements gave a true and fair 
view and the appropriateness of the going concern assumption. 
External Auditor 
The Audit Committee is responsible for recommending to the 
Board for approval by the shareholders the appointment of  
the external Auditor. Deloitte LLP is the external Auditor of  
the Company and, under ethical guidance, they are required  
to introduce a new audit partner every five years. The current 
audit partner has been in place for four years.
In line with its terms of reference, the Committee undertook a 
thorough annual assessment of the quality, effectiveness, value 
and independence of the audit provided by Deloitte LLP, seeking 
the views and feedback of the Audit Committee and fellow  
Board members, together with those of Group and divisional 
management. There are no contractual restrictions on the 
Committee as to the choice of external Auditor.
The Committee considered the scope and materiality for the  
audit work, considered the audit fee, reviewed the results of  
the Auditor’s work and considered the Auditor’s performance  
and effectiveness. The risk of the Auditor withdrawing from the 
market was also considered.

directors’ report – g ove rnance:
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT The Committee met the external Auditor twice during the year 
without management being present. 
The Committee reviewed the policy on the engagement of the 
Auditor for non-audit services and confirmed the applicability  
of that policy in satisfying itself that their independence and 
objectivity was not impaired. 
The key features of this policy are as follows: 
•	 w or k 	 c l o s el y 	 r el at ed 	 t o 	 t he 	 aud i t 	 ( e. g. 	 ta x at i on 	 or 	 fin anc i a l	
reporting matters) can be awarded to the Auditor by the 
executive directors provided the work does not exceed 
£150,000 in fees per item; and
•	 a l l 	 o t her 	 w or k 	 e i t her 	 r equ i r es 	 A ud i t 	 C omm i tt ee 	 appr o v a l	 
or forms part of a list of prohibited services where it is  
felt independence or objectivity may be impaired.
The Committee has reviewed the non-audit services performed 
by Deloitte LLP in the year and has concluded that the policy  
has been applied and their independence and objectivity has  
not been impaired as a result. Details of fees paid to Deloitte LLP 
and their associates during the financial year are set out in note 7 
t o 	 t he 	 fin anc i a l 	 stat emen ts 	 on 	 pa ge 	 7 8 .
After due and careful consideration, taking account of the 
processes above, the Committee has recommended to the Board 
that Deloitte LLP be re-appointed as the Company’s Auditor at  
the Annual General Meeting to be held on 10 November 2010.
Risk management and internal control
The Audit Committee reviewed the Company’s risk management 
and internal control systems by considering the Group’s  
risk assessment process which included detail of the extent  
of coverage, the assessment methods employed and the 
effectiveness of the controls to mitigate those risks. It also 
considered the results of testing performed by both the  
internal and external audit teams in evaluating the effectiveness 
of such controls. 
Internal Audit and risk
The Audit Committee oversees the risk management and 
assurance activities including the work of Internal Audit.
During the year, the Audit Committee reviewed the terms  
of reference of the Internal Audit function and no changes  
were necessary.
During the year, the Committee reviewed the performance and 
effectiveness of the Head of Internal Audit and the Internal Audit 
function through an internal review process, which sought views 
from a number of internal stakeholders. The Committee also 
reviewed the independence and objectivity of Internal Audit  
and its activities, including the annual audit plan and resource 
requirements. The plan has delivered both geographic and 
financial coverage, as well as risk-based assurance in support  
of non-financial topics such as HR processes, finance system 
implementations and contract management capabilities. 
Internal Audit reports include recommendations to improve 
internal controls and management action plans to address  
any issues. At each meeting, the Committee received details  
of outstanding audit recommendations and those that were 
overdue, with management comments on progress made. 
The Committee also met the Head of Internal Audit twice during 
the year without management being present.
Raising concerns in confidence 
The Audit Committee reviewed the Group’s procedures enabling 
employees to raise concerns in confidence. Employees are  
able to raise concerns or report compliance issues through an 
independent third-party organisation. The Committee receives 
reports of any serious concerns raised at each meeting. 
Audit Committee effectiveness 
The Audit Committee undertook its own annual performance 
evaluation, which concluded that the Committee has acted in 
accordance with its terms of reference, is operating effectively 
and met all legal and regulatory requirements.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee will be available at the 
2010 Annual General Meeting to answer any questions about  
the work of the Committee. 
On behalf of the Audit Committee.

THE BOARD AND ITS WORK ENTREPRENEURIAL LEADERSHIP
Board roles
The Board is organised to apply breadth and depth, in both 
experience and skills, to ensure the successful development of the 
business, deliver shareholder value sustainably over the long-term 
and to enable the Company to make a positive contribution to 
society. The Board sets the goals for the business, its culture  
and standards of conduct. The health of any business is measured 
in part by the extent to which reward and risk are balanced,  
how the business uses its strengths to reach its potential and  
how it effectively addresses its areas of weakness. Essentially,  
the Board establishes an entrepreneurial framework within which 
the business can flourish without promoting excessive risk-taking 
or disproportionately impacting the world’s resources. 
Bob Lawson manages and leads the Board as Chairman. The 
Chairman’s main objective is to ensure the Board performs all its 
functions effectively and sets the standard of leadership for the

The effectiveness of the Board and its committees is determined 
by the qualities and experience of the individual directors. 
The non-executive directors bring an independent view to  
the Board’s discussions and the development of the Company’s 
strategy. Their range of skills and experience ensures that the 
performance of management in achieving the business goals  
is appropriately challenged. They also ensure that financial  
controls and systems of risk management are both rigorous  
and appropriate for the needs of the business.
The following profiles demonstrate the range of experience, 
independent judgement and contribution each director brings  
to the Board.

Our governance framework How the Board operates
The Chairman, in conjunction with the Company Secretary, plans 
the agenda for each meeting, which is issued with supporting 
papers during the week preceding the meeting. Board packs 
contain monthly management accounts, briefing papers  
on commercial and operational matters and major capital 
projects, reports on relations with investors and updates on  
the implementation of key strategic plans.
The programme for visits to operations in the UK and overseas  
is agreed with the Chairman and scheduled by the Company 
Secretary. This provides the Board with the opportunity to 
broaden its understanding of the business and key markets 
year-on-year and to gain invaluable insights through direct 
contact with business managers and the operations.
A procedure exists for directors to take independent professional 
advice if necessary at the Company’s expense. All directors also 
have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary.

Board committees
Our non-executive directors play an important governance role  
in the work they carry out on our committees. The Chairman and 
members of each committee are detailed below. The Board has 
satisfied itself that at least one member of the Audit Committee 
has recent and relevant financial experience. The committees  
can seek professional advice at the Company’s expense.

Terms of reference  
The Board has agreed written terms of reference for each 
committee, which are available on the Company’s website, 
haysplc.com, and are also available upon request from the 
Company Secretary at the Registered Office. During the year,  
the Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee reviewed 
their terms of reference to ensure that they remained in line with 
best practice guidance and the Company’s policies and practices. 
Following the reviews, no changes were made to the terms of 
reference for the Audit Committee and the terms of reference for 
the Remuneration Committee were amended to take into account 
the ABI guidance issued in 2009 relating to the need to consider 
the risk-related aspects of remuneration policy and practice and 
the need to determine the salary and incentive arrangements of 
executive directors taking into account remuneration policy and 
practice across the Group.
Succession
The Nomination Committee periodically reviews the composition 
of the Board to ensure that it continues to meet the ongoing 
needs of the Company and is progressively refreshed over time. 
On 15 July 2010, we announced that Bob Lawson will retire from 
the Board following the Annual General Meeting to be held on  
10 November 2010. Alan Thomson will be joining the Board as  
a non-executive director on 1 October 2010 and will succeed  
Bob as Chairman following the Annual General Meeting. At the 
Annual General Meeting, shareholders will be asked to re-appoint 
Alan Thomson as a director.
Lesley Knox, as Senior Independent Director, led the Nomination 
Committee in the process for appointing the new Chairman. The 
Zygos Partnership, an external search consultancy, was engaged 
to lead the search. Lesley Knox briefed Zygos as to the personal 
attributes needed in the new Chairman with regard to the 
business and its future direction. The Board sought an individual 
with strong international experience, credibility with the 
investment community and sound interpersonal skills and people 
judgement, who would ensure the Board continued to work 
effectively and who would lead the Group through the next phase 
of its international growth and development strategy. Style and 
cultural fit with Hays were also important considerations.
Zygos produced a shortlist of candidates. All members of the 
Nomination Committee and the executive directors met with  
the candidates selected from the shortlist.
Alan Thomson was considered to be the ideal candidate given  
his background and experience and met the Board’s criteria.  
He is currently Chairman of Bodycote plc, the international 
provider of thermal processing services, the Senior Independent 
Director and Audit Committee Chairman of Johnson Matthey plc, 
a speciality chemicals company and a world leader in advanced 
materials technology, and a non-executive director of Alstom SA, 
the French power generation, rail transportation and electrical 
transmission equipment manufacturer. Alan is also President of 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland.
The Board is delighted that Alan will be joining the Company.

Responsibility for the management and operations of the 
business is delegated to the Chief Executive who operates 
through the Management Board. The Management Board is 
chaired by the Chief Executive and consists of the Group Finance 
Director, Regional Managing Directors, the Group HR Director, the 
Group Marketing Director, the Group IT Director and the Company 
Secretary and General Legal Counsel. Clear levels of authority 
exist for the Management Board in their day-to-day activities.
Each of the Company’s Regional Managing Directors operates 
through their regional operating boards. Each regional board  
is led by the regional managing director and consists of key 
management from the region’s operations and business 
functions, including Finance, HR and Marketing.
As far as possible, each business is given autonomy, whilst being 
required to operate within the internal control environment 
established through the Group Policies and Procedures Manual.
Managing risks and internal control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s risk management 
process, its system of internal control and for maintaining and 
reviewing their effectiveness. The Board annually reviews the 
nature and extent of significant risks identified by management 
and the status of mitigation plans. This exercise involves the 
presentation of risk findings to enable the Board to review and 
oversee the status of the key risks to the business. The Board in 
turn reflects on the level of risk appetite acceptable to the Group, 
in order to achieve the Company’s strategic objectives. In June 
2010, the Board reviewed the nature and extent of the significant 
risks in the Group and determined that the risks and their relative 
priority were appropriate and that the risk review process enabled 
risks to be prioritised. The Board also considered the key regional 
risks that had been identified by management.
Day-to-day management of risk is overseen by the Management 
Board, which operates a risk-management process involving 
assessment of key Group risks twice a year. The operating regions 
also conduct assessments of strategic and operational risks within 
each region. Each risk is assessed in terms of its likelihood to 
occur and the potential financial and reputational impact if it does 
so. Appropriate mitigation plans and strategies are put in place 
for those risks that are controllable. Progress on the management 
of risks is reported to the Management Board. During the year 
under review, the Management Board reviewed the progress  
of high priority risks, and also considered any new or emerging 
risks that were identified.
Risks are further controlled through delegated authorities and 
other written policies and procedures, which are approved  
by the Board and overseen by Group functional departments.  
The Group Policies and Procedures and Financial Reporting 
Manuals, which encompass all of the Groups’ operations,  
are designed to ensure that a minimum level of corporate, 
accounting, financial and operating controls are in place and  
allow matters to be appropriately and promptly escalated to 
senior management and the Board. The manuals are updated on 
an ongoing basis to reflect changes in procedures as and when  
they occur. The Group’s Code of Conduct & Ethics Policy outlines 
the way in which employees are expected to conduct themselves 
when carrying out their business activities.
The Group operates a comprehensive budgeting and financial 
reporting process. Annual budgets are reviewed and approved at 
business and Group levels. This process includes the identification 
and quantification of significant risks relating to markets and 
operations. Monthly performance is reported against budget  
and prior year. The monthly management accounts analyse and 
explain variances against budget and report on key indicators, 
with detailed explanations for variances and movements in 
forecasts provided to the Board. 
The Group’s Internal Audit department also focus on facilitating 
the identification of risks and undertake reviews and testing  
of the controls in place for their mitigation. The department’s 
resources are augmented with independent, expert external 
resource where necessary, to review risk and monitor compliance 
with the Group’s policies and procedures. Regular reviews of  
the most important controls are undertaken to ensure that key 
control objectives are achieved. Reports on the effectiveness  
of operational and financial controls are regularly presented to 
management and to the Audit Committee, and recommendations 
are agreed upon and implemented.
The Group’s systems and controls are designed to manage risks, 
safeguard the Group’s assets and to ensure the reliability of 
information used both within the business and for publication. 
Systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the  
risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide  
only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
The Principal Risks disclosed opposite represent the significant 
areas which the Board considers could most likely impact the 
Group’s financial performance and position.
Internal control statement
Responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal control has been delegated to the Audit 
Committee. The Audit Committee has reviewed the effectiveness 
of the Group’s system of internal control for the year ended  
30 June 2010, covering all material controls, including financial, 
operational and compliance controls and risk management 
systems and has concluded that it is in compliance with the 
revised Turnbull guidance – Internal Control: Revised Guidance  
for Directors on the Combined Code (October 2005) published 
by the Financial Reporting Council. This internal control statement 
has been reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee. 
Further details on the Group’s internal control system are 
reported in the Audit Committee Report on page 41.

directors’ report – g ove rnance:
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT PRINCIPAL RISKS
Risk Management actions to mitigate risk
Cyclical nature of our business
The performance of the Group is significantly 
impacted by the underlying rate of global 
economic growth and that of the United 
Kingdom, Australia, Germany and France.
The Group has diversified its operations to include a balance of both temporary and permanent placement 
r e c r u i t m e n t 	 s e rv i c e s 	 t o 	 p u b l i c - 	 a n d 	 p r i v a t e- s e ct o r 	 m a r k e ts, 	 a n d 	 o p e r a t e s 	 a c r o s s 	 2 8 	 c o u n t r i e s 	 a n d 	 1 7 	 s e ct o r 	 s p e c i a l i s m s.
The Group’s cost base is highly variable and is carefully managed to align with business activity.
The Group has ensured that the level of net debt has been kept low and manageable.
The Group is highly cash generative, requiring low levels of asset investment. Cash collection is a key priority  
and the Group has made appropriate investment in its credit control and working capital management processes.
Competitive environment
The Group continues to face competitor risk in 
the markets where the provision of permanent 
and temporary recruitment is most competitive 
and fragmented: namely the United Kingdom 
and Australia. In these countries there is strong 
competition for clients and candidates and  
we face pricing and margin pressures in  
our temporary business across our major 
specialist activities.
In addition, the nature of recruitment for  
some lower-skilled roles is becoming more 
online-based.
We have a rapidly increasing presence in emerging recruitment markets outside the United Kingdom and 
Australia where there are significant structural growth opportunities.
We are investing significantly in our IT systems and applications to both improve the efficiency of our business 
and to develop a market-leading online presence which provides a high quality and engaging customer experience.
We have leveraged our broad geographical and sectoral footprint to win a significant number of multi-specialism 
contracts with large corporate organisations. This has strengthened significantly our relationship with these 
clients, increasing our share of their recruitment spend and increasing our share of the markets in which  
we operate.
Candidate due diligence
Certain checks are required before we place  
any candidate into a role. For certain roles and 
industries those checks are more specific as set 
out by legislation. Failure to complete, maintain 
and renew applicable documentation to support 
those checks could lead to legal, financial and 
reputational risks.
All new employees receive training in respect of the relevant operating standards that are applicable to their 
particular recruitment role. The Compliance function is also available to provide support and guidance to 
recruitment consultants.
Our higher-risk specialisms such as Education and Healthcare have supplementary processes and controls in 
place to ensure that operational standards are complied with.
Dedicated compliance audit teams conduct spot checks on candidate records, to ensure that the appropriate 
vetting checks and due diligence is carried out in line with legal, contractual and other requirements.
Reliance on technology
The Group is increasingly reliant on a number of 
key systems to deliver its services to clients and 
uses third-party providers for support services. 
A large amount of confidential data is held in 
these systems.
Our relationships with third-party providers of IT services are monitored through service reviews and periodic 
audits to ensure business-critical processes are safeguarded.
Technology systems are housed in various data centres and the Group has capacity to cope with a data centre 
loss through the establishment of disaster recovery sites that are physically based in separate locations to the 
ongoing operations.
Data protection remains a key priority. Specific contractual provisions exist with regard to our data centres,  
to ensure we have sufficient handling and storage procedures around confidential data.
The Company has in place data protection and security policies and, where data protection legislation allows, 
email monitoring programmes are undertaken to highlight potential areas of concern, which are then 
investigated.
Talent
The Group is reliant on its ability to recruit,  
train and develop people to meet its future 
growth plans.
Our leadership development programme ‘Fast Forward’ has been launched to develop and fast track individuals 
with the potential to lead our business in the future.
The Hays ‘Advanced Management Programme’ and ‘Hays Academy’ have been introduced to provide technical, 
leadership and management training to our consultants and managers across the business.
An annual succession planning review is undertaken across all regions to identify key roles and successor 
options.
We maintain medium to long-term management incentive schemes to foster a commitment to the continued 
growth of the Group.
Contract risk 
The Company enters into contractual 
arrangements with clients, some of which  
can be onerous in terms of required activities.
During contract negotiations management seeks to minimise risk and ensure that the nature of risks and their 
potential impact is understood.
Our legal team has the depth of knowledge and experience to enable them to advise management on the level  
of risk presented in contracts.
Reviews are performed on a risk basis across key contracts, to identify and agree improvements to the way in 
which we deliver services to clients.
The Group Finance Director reviews and approves contracts with non-standard terms.
Changing legal and regulatory environment
The recruitment industry is affected by an 
increasing level of compliance and changes  
in legislation (particularly in the temp market, 
which is more heavily regulated) and this is  
a key area of management focus.
The legal and compliance teams keep the business informed as to changes in legislation that may impact the 
Group, and provide training and compliance programmes in key areas.
In those markets in which temporary recruitment is offered, the legal teams are sufficiently experienced to advise 
operations. Changes in temp-market legislation may impact profitability and therefore close monitoring is 
undertaken.
Project teams are established to implement, update or consult on new or changing legislation.
Foreign exchange
The Group has significant operations outside 
the UK and is therefore exposed to movements 
in exchange rates.
Profits from Australia and Euro-based markets have increased as a percentage of the Group. There is no active 
management of foreign-exchange risk. However, we continue to monitor our policies in this area.

Responsibilities
Hays gains insight into the views of shareholders and other 
stakeholders through a variety of means. Feedback received 
through these engagement channels is regularly reported to  
the Board.
Primary responsibility for engaging with shareholders rests with 
the Chairman, Chief Executive and Finance Director, supported  
by the Investor Relations and Company Secretarial departments, 
and external advisors.
Should shareholders wish to raise any concern where the normal 
channels have failed to resolve the issue or are inappropriate for 
any reason, Lesley Knox is available to shareholders in her role as 
Senior Independent Director. Lesley is a significant contributor to 
the Board on shareholders’ perspectives.
Our Investor Relations team ranked 7th out of 46 European 
support & business services companies in the 2010 Thomson 
Reuters Extel Pan-European Survey of investor relations 
associations.
This illustrates the importance we attach to effective 
communication with our shareholders.
How we engage with shareholders
During the year, the Board has maintained a regular and open 
dialogue with investors. We have formal arrangements for 
engaging with shareholders including those described below.
Investor meetings
The executive directors and the Investor Relations team regularly 
meet with analysts and major investors to discuss any concerns 
they may have and to explain the Company’s strategy.
The Group’s advisers maintain a dialogue with major shareholders 
and following each investor roadshow provide a report on  
the views of shareholders on key issues and management 
performance. A summary of this report is subsequently provided 
to the Board.
All non-executive directors are aware of the investor relations 
programme and are available should shareholders wish to meet 
them. Investors are offered the opportunity to meet the Chairman 
and Senior Independent Director.
Investor Day 2010
The Chairman, executive directors and senior management from 
across the Group’s operations met a large number of investors  
at the Investor Day held by the Company on 29 April 2010, which 
focused on the Group’s strong performance during the economic 
downturn and the strategic investments made during this period,  
and explained the Group’s strategy to capitalise on future growth 
opportunities. This was attended by approximately 140 analysts 
and investors who received presentations on performance, 
strategy and key objectives and were also provided with the 
valuable opportunity to meet with senior management from 
around the world.
Annual general meeting
The annual general meeting provides an opportunity to 
communicate with all shareholders and in particular with our 
private shareholders. The Chairmen of the Audit, Nomination  
and Remuneration Committees are also available at the Annual 
General Meeting to answer any questions shareholders may have.
The Notice of Meeting sets out the resolutions being proposed  
at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 10 November 2010.  
It is the Company’s policy at present to take all resolutions at a 
general meeting on a poll.
Formal consultations
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee consults with 
major investors and seeks their views on the proposed incentive 
arrangements for executive directors and senior management. 
From time to time, we specifically seek major shareholders’ views 
on other Company proposals.
Communications from shareholders and representative bodies
From time to time, we receive circulars directly from major 
shareholders and representative bodies, such as the Association 
of British Insurers, the National Association of Pension Funds and 
Pensions Investment Research Consultants. We also review the 
various environmental, social and governance reports published 
about us annually and endeavour to address any weaknesses  
or failings identified.
External advisors
Legal, financial, remuneration and communications advisors 
naturally have broad exposure to shareholder views and practice 
in the course of their research and work with their many  
clients. Appropriate external advice is sought by the Board,  
Board committees and Group departments when considering  
important issues.

Understanding the business
We consider that, to function effectively, all members of  
the Board need appropriate knowledge of the Company and  
access to its operations and staff. Presentations and reports  
on commercial initiatives, our markets, our competitive position 
and the general economic indicators are given periodically to  
the Board. In addition, we hold Board meetings away from the 
head office approximately twice a year, which allows focus on 
local markets and operations and enables the non-executive 
directors to meet the local management.
Board training and development
On appointment, directors receive a formal induction, which 
includes visits to relevant business units and functions and 
discussions with senior management. These are tailored to  
the needs of the individual director and continue throughout  
their tenure.
Briefing sessions on legislative and accounting developments  
are held for the Board when appropriate. During the year, the 
Board received updates from the Company Secretary regarding 
regulatory changes and new legislation and the Remuneration 
Committee received updates from their external advisors, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, regarding regulatory changes  
and recent developments in shareholder sentiments.
Performance evaluation
An external review of the effectiveness of the Board, its 
Committees and individual members in respect of the financial 
year was undertaken by Egon Zehnder. An external review was 
last undertaken in 2007, also by Egon Zehnder. Each director and  
the Company Secretary completed a questionnaire comprising 
questions relating to:
•	 board 	 st ruct u r e 	 and 	 c ompo s i t i on ;
•	 board 	 d y n am i cs 	 and 	 r el at i ons h i p s ;
•	 pr oc ess es, 	 i n for mat i on 	 flow s 	 and 	 dec i s i on 	 m ak i n g;
•	 r eport i n g 	 t o 	 s har eho l ders 	 and 	 o t her 	 stak eho l ders ;
•	 t he 	 A ud i t , 	 R emu ner at i on 	 and 	 Nom i nat i on 	 C o mm i tt ees ;
•	 peop l e 	 and 	 peop l e 	 pr oc ess es ;
•	 	 peop l e 	 e v a l u at i on 	 ( i nc l ud i ng 	 t he 	 perfor m anc e 	 o f 	 t he 	 Cha i r man	
and the effectiveness of the Senior Independent Director);
•	 r emu ner at i on 	 and 	 s uc c ess i on 	 p l ann i n g;

•	 cap i ta l 	 and 	 r i s k; 	 and
• 	 pr o g r es s 	 a nd 	 b e n c h m a r k i n g.
The completed questionnaires were sent to Egon Zehnder for 
evaluation. A representative from Egon Zehnder attended a  
full Board meeting as an observer and, following receipt of the 
completed questionnaires, met with each respondent individually 
to discuss their responses. The results of the performance 
evaluation were formally presented to the Board and discussed, 
following which individual one-to-one feedback was provided  
to each Board member, as required.
Details of the results of the performance evaluation review are 
provided opposite.
Board and committee performance
The external effectiveness review found that the Board has 
responded well to the recent economic challenges. Board 
members work with unity of purpose, focus and commitment. 
The structure of the Board is considered to be appropriate and 
relationships between Board members are constructive. The 
Chairman provides strong leadership, encouraging open debate 
and challenge and the Board is appraised of all material matters. 
The Board is aligned around the strategic objectives facing the 
business. The committees are well chaired and their structure  
and responsibilities are clear and appropriate. The process  
for the succession of the Chairmanship was particularly well 
managed by the Nomination Committee. Looking forward,  
the Board will continue to focus on ensuring that it has the 
appropriate level of skills and experience in relation to the 
strategic objectives of the business.
Various actions arising from the review will be addressed in the 
coming year, including increasing the time spent on strategic 
debate, facilitating more Board time with the executive directors 
outside scheduled meetings and further operational focus in 
relation to efficiency improvements.
The Audit Committee also undertook its own separate review, 
details of which are reported in the Audit Committee Report on 
page 41.
Individual performance
The effectiveness of each member of the Board was reviewed  
in respect of the financial year. The Chairman, along with  
the non-executive directors, reviewed the performance of  
the executive directors individually against their objectives.  
The remuneration of the executive directors is linked to their 
respective performances and is determined by the Remuneration 
Committee based upon the result of these reviews. Further details 
are reported in the Remuneration Report on pages 56 to 65.
Following the performance evaluation review, the Chairman  
is satisfied that the non-executives all remain independent in 
character and judgement. Shareholders will be asked to re-appoint 
William Eccleshare and Paul Stoneham, who will be retiring by 
rotation at the annual general meeting. As both directors will 
extend their terms of office beyond six years, the Nomination 
Committee has given their performances particular consideration, 
as required by the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘2010 
Code’), which applies to the Company from 1 July 2010, taking 
into account the need for progressive refreshing of the Board. 
Each of the rotating directors being put forward for re-appointment 
at the 2010 Annual General Meeting continues to be effective. 
Their ongoing commitment to the role is undiminished and  
they continue to make a valuable contribution to the Board  
and its committees. We are actively considering the 2010 Code 
guidelines regarding the annual re-election of directors and,  
in particular, whether and how to implement a policy of annual 
re-election. If we decide to adopt a policy of annual re-election, 
any necessary changes to the Articles of Association will be 
proposed at the 2011 Annual General Meeting.

Structure of share capital
Under the Companies Act 2006, companies are no longer 
required to have an authorised share capital and a resolution  
was passed by shareholders at last year’s Annual General Meeting 
to take advantage of this deregulating measure. Therefore,  
the Company no longer has an authorised share capital.  
As at 30 June 2010, the Company’s issued share capital of 
£14,640,965.66 comprised 1,464,096,566 Ordinary shares  
of 1p each. No shares were allotted during the year.
During the year from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010, the Company 
did not purchase any Ordinary shares of the Company.

to hold shares acquired by way of market purchase in treasury, 
rather than having to cancel them. The directors may use the 
authority to purchase shares and hold them in treasury (and 
subsequently sell or transfer them out of treasury as permitted  
in accordance with the Act) rather than cancel them, subject to 
institutional guidelines applicable at the time. At 30 June 2010,

During the year to 30 June 2010, 1,649,325 shares held in treasury 
were transferred to satisfy awards of shares under the Company’s 
employee share schemes and a further 147,327 shares were 
transferred to the Hays plc Employee Share Trust to satisfy  
future option exercises under the Hays UK Sharesave Scheme.  
No dividends have been paid on shares whilst held in treasury  
and no voting rights attach to the treasury shares. 
Rights and obligations of Ordinary shares
On a show of hands at a general meeting every holder of Ordinary 
shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall 
have one vote. On a poll, every member present in person or  
by proxy, shall have one vote for every Ordinary share held.  
In accordance with the provisions of the Articles of Association, 
holders of Ordinary shares are entitled to a dividend where 
declared or paid out of profits available for such purposes.  
On a return of capital on a winding up, holders of Ordinary  
shares are entitled to participate in such a return. 
Restrictions on transfers of securities 
The restrictions on the transfer of shares in the Company are  
as follows: 
•	 t he 	 Board 	 ma y , 	 i n 	 i ts 	 ab s o l u t e 	 d i s c r e t i on, 	 r e fus e 	 t o 	 r eg i st er 	 t he

that the refusal does not prevent dealing in shares in the 
Company from taking place on an open and proper basis;
•	 t he 	 Board 	 ma y 	 a l s o 	 r e fus e 	 t o 	 r eg i st er 	 t he 	 t r ansf er 	 o f 	 a

duly stamped (if stampable), at the Registered Office or at 
another place appointed by the Board accompanied by the 
certificate for the share to which it relates and such other 
evidence as the Board may reasonably require to show the 
right of the transferor to make the transfer;
•	 t he 	 Board 	 ma y 	 r e fuse 	 t o 	 r eg i st er 	 a 	 t r ansf er 	 o f 	 s h ar es 	 i n 	 fa v ou r

information requested by the Company in accordance with the 
Companies Act, the Board can in certain circumstances apply 
to the court for an order directing that the shares in question  
be subject to restrictions. If an order is so made, any transfer  
of (or any agreement to transfer) the shares will be void and  
no voting rights will be exercisable in respect of them;
•	 r est r i ct i ons 	 ma y 	 be 	 i mpo sed 	 on 	 c erta i n 	 Gr ou p 	 emp l o y ees 	 w ho

the Performance Share Plan and the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan, 
are subject to restrictions on the transfer of shares prior to vesting.
The Company is unaware of any arrangements between its 
shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of 
shares and/or voting rights. 
Exercise of rights of shares in employee share schemes 
Certain share awards under Company incentive arrangements  
are held in trust on behalf of the beneficiaries. Except where 
acting under instruction as a bare nominee, the Trustee of  
the Hays plc Employee Share Trust does not seek to exercise  
the voting rights on these shares. No voting rights are exercised  
in relation to shares unallocated to individual beneficiaries.
Restrictions on voting deadlines
The notice of any general meeting shall specify the deadline for 
exercising voting rights and appointing a proxy or proxies to vote 
at a general meeting. It is the Company’s policy at present to take 
all resolutions at a general meeting on a poll and the results of  
the poll are published on the Company’s website, haysplc.com, 
shortly after the meeting.

directors’ report – g ove rnance:
OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION Powers of directors
The directors are responsible for the management of the  
business and may exercise all powers of the Company subject  
to legislation, any directions given by special resolution and the 
Company’s constitution.
At the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on  
11 November 2009, shareholders authorised the directors,  
until the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to be held  
on 	 10 	 No v ember 	 2 0 10 , 	 t o 	 pu r c h as e 	 u p 	 t o 	 1 38, 210 , 080 	 Ord i nary	
shares of 1p each in the Company and to allot new shares  
up to an aggregate nominal amount of £4,607,002, being 
approximately one third of the Company’s issued share capital. 
The authority to allot shares was not used. Renewal of both 
authorities will be proposed to shareholders at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting. 
The Board intends to continue to return surplus cash to 
shareholders where circumstances allow and it is not required to 
finance the organic expansion of the business, acquisitions and 
dividend payments, via the on-market purchase of its own shares. 
Shares will only be purchased if to do so would result in an 
increase in earnings per share and it is in the best interests  
of shareholders generally. No share purchases are anticipated  
in the 2011 financial year. 
The Board will be seeking the approval of the shareholders to 
renew this authority at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting 
as detailed in the separate Circular to Shareholders. 
Appointment and replacement of directors
The Company may by ordinary resolution appoint any individual 
to the Board. The Board may appoint any individual willing to  
act as a director either to fill a vacancy or act as an additional 
director. The appointee can only hold office until the next annual 
general meeting whereupon he/she will be put forward for 
re-appointment.
The Articles of Association prescribe that there shall be no less 
than five and no more than 15 directors. Should the number 
reduce below five, then the Board shall, as soon as practicable, 
appoint an individual to fill the vacancy. The Company may  
by ordinary resolution vary the minimum number of directors. 
At each annual general meeting, not less than one third of the 
directors must retire by rotation and any director who has been  
in office for three years or more since his/her last appointment  
or re-appointment must retire by rotation. A retiring director is 
eligible for re-appointment.
Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association may only be amended by  
a special resolution passed by shareholders at a general meeting 
of the Company.
Directors’ indemnities and insurance
The Company continues to maintain directors’ and officers’ 
liability insurance. In accordance with the Company’s Articles of 
Association, it is the Company’s policy for each director and the 
Company Secretary and General Legal Counsel to be indemnified 
by deeds of indemnity. 
Employees 
The Group is committed to developing its employees and 
investing in training tailored to meet the needs of the business, 
including both structured training and on-the-job training and 
briefings. A leadership development programme for our top 
global leaders is underway as part of our continued commitment 
to developing talent in our business. 
As part of creating a stimulating place to work, there are a 
number of ways we ensure our employees are involved in  
the business and issues relating to its performance, including  
senior management briefings, employee briefing groups,  
email messaging and our global group intranet. To encourage 
employees to have a stake in the business, there are also  
a number of share schemes. 
As a responsible employer of thousands of people, the Group  
is committed to equal opportunities and its policy ensures that 
everyone has the opportunity to contribute to the business 
regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, physical 
appearance, religion, education and beliefs. 
The Group has a structured approach towards internal 
recruitment and promotion with decisions based on an 
individual’s ability to perform the role. This means that full 
consideration is given to disabled applicants where they have  
the right skills and abilities for the role. Should an employee 
become disabled whilst working for the Group, every effort is 
made to accommodate them or to find a suitable alternative role 
and to assist with any retraining. The Group’s commitment to 
training and development includes consideration of any special 
training needs of disabled employees. 
More information on the Group’s engagement with employees is 
set out in the Corporate Responsibility Report on pages 35 and 36. 
Payments to creditors
It is the Group’s policy to make payments to suppliers in 
accordance with agreed terms provided that the supplier has 
performed in accordance with the relevant terms and conditions. 
Creditor days for the Group for the year ended 30 June 2010  
were an average of 32 (2009: 31). The Company creditor days  
at 30 June 2010 were 32 (2009: 31).

Auditor
Deloitte LLP have indicated that they are willing to continue in 
office. Their re-appointment, at a remuneration to be agreed by 
the directors, will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting. 
Change of control — significant agreements 
As at 30 June 2010, the Company had entered into one significant 
agreement containing provisions that allow a counterparty to 
alter and amend the terms of the agreement following a change 
of control of the Company. This was an unsecured revolving  
credit facility with a number of banks for £460 million entered 
i n t o 	 on 	 8 	 F ebru ary 	 2 006. 	 In 	 t he 	 e v en t 	 o f 	 a 	 c hange 	 o f 	 c on t r o l	 
of the Company, the lenders are entitled to renegotiate certain 
terms. As at 30 June 2010, £315 million of this facility had not 
been drawn down. This agreement was renewed on 1 July 2010 
with a reduced facility of £300 million.
There are no provisions contained within the service contracts  
of executive directors that will trigger in the event of a change  
of control. 
54 Hays plc a nnu al r epo rt & f ina ncial s tat ements 2010
directors’ report – g ove rnance:
OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION There are a number of commercial contracts that would alter  
in the event of a change in control but none is considered to be 
material in terms of the potential impact on the Group in this event.
Certain of the Company’s share award plans contain provisions 
that permit awards or options to vest or become exercisable on  
a change of control in accordance with the rules of the plans. 
Conflicts of interest 
In line with the Companies Act 2006, the Articles of Association 
allow the Board to authorise actual and potential conflicts of 
interest and duties that may arise and to impose such limits and 
conditions as it thinks fit. Conflicts of interest and duties can only 
be authorised by those directors who do not have an interest in 
the matter being considered, and in making such decision, the 
directors must act in a way they consider, in good faith, will most 
likely promote the success of the Company. The Company has 
established a procedure whereby actual and potential conflicts of 
interest and duties are advised to the Company Secretary and are 
reviewed annually. Appropriate authorisations are sought for any 
ad-hoc notifications of any new conflicts of interest or duties, or 
any changes to existing conflicts of interest or duties. The Board 
has undertaken a review of these procedures and considers them 
to have operated effectively during the year. 
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on the going 
concern basis as the directors are satisfied that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Further details can be found in note 2 to the 
consolidated financial statements on page 73.
Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing the parent Company financial statements, the 
directors are required to:
•	 s el ect 	 s u i tab l e 	 ac c ou n t i ng 	 po l i c i es 	 and 	 t hen 	 app l y 	 t hem	
consistently;
•	 m ak e 	 j ud gemen ts 	 and 	 ac c ou n t i ng 	 est i m at es 	 t h at 	 ar e

and explained in the financial statements; and
•	 pr epar e 	 t he 	 fin anc i al 	 stat emen ts 	 on 	 t he 	 go i ng 	 c onc er n 	 bas i s	
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
•	 pr oper l y 	 s el ect 	 and 	 app l y 	 ac c ou n t i ng 	 po l i c i es ;
•	 pr esen t 	 i n for mat i on, 	 i nc l ud i ng 	 ac c ou n t i ng 	 po l i c i es, 	 i n 	 a	 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
•	 pr o v i de 	 add i t i onal 	 d i sc l o s u r es 	 w hen 	 c omp l i anc e 	 w i t h 	 t he	
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
•	 mak e 	 an 	 assess men t 	 o f 	 t he 	 C ompan y’ s 	 ab i l i ty 	 t o 	 c on t i nue 	 as	 
a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets  
of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for  
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
The Board confirms to the best of its knowledge that: 
•	 t he 	 fin anc i a l 	 stat emen ts, 	 pr epar ed 	 i n 	 ac c ord anc e 	 w i t h 	 t he

Dear Shareholder 
I am pleased to introduce the report of the Board covering  
the remuneration policy and practice for the Company. 
2010 performance and reward
This year has seen the toughest recruitment markets on record. 
However, we have acted rapidly and decisively to defend profits 
and maximise cash generation. We have managed the business 
effectively in the downturn, whilst continuing to implement the 
steps necessary to achieve our long-term objective of capitalising 
on the tremendous structural growth opportunities present in our 
markets. In our Preliminary Results we reported that the Group 
had returned to year-on-year growth in the second half of the 
year primarily driven by the international business which currently 
accounts for c.60% of the Group’s net fees. We remain committed 
to building a stronger, broader-based and more efficient business 
and are confident that we are well placed to capitalise fully on the 
opportunities for growth that we are seeing in many of our markets.
Whilst the market has been very challenging in 2010, the 
Committee believes that the Group’s results compare favourably 
with those of our competitors and it is appropriate that bonuses 
for targets achieved should be paid in accordance with the 
arrangements agreed last year for 2010 and beyond. Bonuses  
for executive directors for 2010 ranged between 110% (2009: 
142%) and 112% (2009: 152%) of salary. Of each bonus achieved, 
60% will be paid in cash and 40% will be satisfied in shares  
and deferred for a three-year period. The Committee retains 
discretion to reduce the number of shares vesting if the underlying 
financial performance of the Company has not been satisfactory 
over the period.
2010 Remuneration Committee activities
The Committee’s activities for the 2010 financial year have included:
•	  a review of potential additional performance measures for the 
PSP awards;
•	  structuring the executive bonus arrangements in light of the 
change in market conditions;
•	  considering the impact of the increase in marginal UK income 
tax rates from April 2010;
•	 considering the reward strategy in the context of Group risk; and 
•	 consideration of the relationship between executive reward and 
the reward structures in place for other employees.
2011 Remuneration arrangements
Given the continuing economic uncertainty and the current 
environment, base salaries for the executive directors have  
been frozen for the second year in a row.
The overall structure of the bonus arrangements remains 
unchanged, as does the maximum bonus potential at 125%  
of salary, with 40% of any bonus awarded deferred into shares. 
However, given the continued focus on earnings growth, the 
Committee has decided to increase the weighting of the EPS 
component of the annual bonus to 60% (2010: 40%) of the total 
bonus opportunity (the remainder of the bonus opportunity is 20% 
based on cash conversion and 20% based on personal objectives).
Last year, in light of the uncertain economic outlook, the 
Committee applied a single performance measure for the  
PSP award. However, following consultation with shareholders, 
the Committee does wish to put in place long-term incentives  
that will last a number of cycles. For the 2011 financial year and 
beyond, the Committee has decided to re-introduce EPS as a 
second performance measure alongside TSR for the PSP award. 
The Committee considered a number of measures and believed 
this measure to be the most appropriate given the continued 
focus on earnings growth. Therefore, 50% of the PSP award  
for this year will be based on TSR relative to a sector group  
and 50% on cumulative EPS measured over a three-year period. 
Vesting of the TSR component will be subject to satisfactory 
financial performance over the performance period as 
determined by the Committee.
The Committee has reviewed the executive remuneration 
arrangements in the light of recent publications from shareholder 
representative groups and the UK Corporate Governance Code 
and is satisfied that the arrangements are compliant.
The Committee unanimously recommends that shareholders  
vote to approve the Remuneration Report at the 2010 Annual 
General Meeting.

Composition and terms of reference of the Remuneration 
Committee
The Board has delegated to the Committee, under agreed terms 
of reference, responsibility for the remuneration policy and for 
determining specific packages for the executive directors, the 
Chairman and other senior executives. The Company consults 
with key shareholders in respect of remuneration policy and the 
introduction of new incentive arrangements. During the year the 
Committee reviewed its terms of reference. Certain changes were 
recommended to reflect the ABI guidance issued in 2009 relating 
to the need to consider the risk-related aspects of remuneration 
policy and practice and the need to determine the salary and 
incentive arrangements of executive directors taking into account 
remuneration policy and practice across the Group. These changes 
were approved by the Board and the revised terms of reference 
for the Committee are available on the Company’s website, 
haysplc.com, and from the Company Secretary at the  
Registered Office. 
The Remuneration Committee was chaired by Lesley Knox 
throughout the year under review. All members of the Committee 
are independent non-executive directors. William Eccleshare,  
Paul Harrison, Richard Smelt and Paul Stoneham were Committee 
members throughout the year. The Committee receives 
assistance from the Chairman, the Group HR Director and the 
Group Company Secretary, who attend meetings by invitation, 
except when issues relating to their own remuneration are being 
discussed. The Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director 
also attended by invitation on occasions. The Committee met 
eight times during the financial year ended 30 June 2010.  
Meeting attendance is shown on page 51 of this Annual Report. 
Advisors to the Remuneration Committee 
The Committee continues to engage the services of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’) as independent 
remuneration advisors. During the financial year, PwC advised  
the Committee on all aspects of remuneration policy for executive 
directors and members of the Management Board. PwC also 
advised the Company on tax, administrative and compliance 
issues relating to the operation of the Company’s share schemes 
around the world, and the Group’s transformational IT projects.
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP, who act as the Company’s 
principal legal advisors, provided legal advice to the Committee  
in the financial year. 
Remuneration policy 
The Committee determines the remuneration policy for executive 
directors and other senior executives for current and future years 
and this is reviewed on an annual basis. 
During the year, the Committee reviewed the remuneration policy 
and certain changes were made to reflect the Committee’s duty 
to take into account the risk-related aspects of remuneration 
policy. These changes are reflected in the Group’s remuneration 
policy below and overleaf.
The remuneration policy is designed to support the strategic 
objectives of the Company and to allow the business to attract, 
retain and motivate the quality of senior management needed  
to shape and execute strategy and deliver shareholder value. 
Reward arrangements are designed around the following principles: 
•	 link reward to individual director’s performance and Company 
performance taking risk into account, to align the interests of 
senior executives with those of shareholders; 
•	 base reward on both individual achievement and Group results 
to encourage a team approach;
•	 maintain a competitive package against businesses of a 
comparable size in the FTSE and comparable peer group 
businesses in the recruitment sector;
•	 mirror the incentive and performance philosophy throughout  
the business;
•	 encourage a personal stake in the business and focus on  
longer-term business objectives via a long-term incentive plan;
•	 encourage directors and senior executives to build and 
maintain a shareholding in the Company over a reasonable 
period of time; and

1.  The 2010 arrangements replaced the one-year transitional arrangements that were in place for 2009 only. See the 2009 Remuneration Report for full details.
2.  The bonuses paid to Mr A R Cox and Mr P Venables for the 2010 financial year as a percentage of base salary were 111.7% and 110.6% respectively. Details of the 
performance conditions for 2010 bonuses are set out in the table on page 60.
3.  Vesting of the TSR component is subject to satisfactory financial performance over the period as determined by the Committee.
•	 provide a balanced package that takes into account the 
associated risks of each aspect of remuneration – base salary, 
benefits, pensions, short-term cash incentives and longer-term 
equity incentives:
 − set base salaries at or around market median;
 − provide an annual bonus opportunity against stretching 
business targets. On-target performance will be rewarded 
at or around median level; 
 − superior performance and business returns will result in a 
total reward in excess of median and towards upper quartile;
 − provide a total reward package with a high percentage 
based on variable performance elements. Around 70% of 
the total cash/incentive package will be variable and based 
on performance elements; and
 − where appropriate, the Committee will review and agree 
one-off incentive arrangements to attract and retain 
individual directors.
How the executive directors were paid in 2010 
Details of the specific 2010 remuneration arrangements  
for the executive directors are set out in the table below.
It is the Company’s policy to take into account the pay and 
employment conditions of employees throughout the Group 
when determining directors’ remuneration. During the year,  
the Committee received a paper from the Group HR Director,  
and noted the pay freeze applicable in the Group’s main areas  
of operation in determining that there should be no increase in 
the executive directors’ base salary for the 2011 financial year.
The table below sets out the key elements of the Company’s 
remuneration policy for the 2010 and 2011 financial years.

Summary of share-based incentive schemes 
This section describes the design of the Company’s current 
share-based incentive schemes and how they were used in the 
2010 financial year. The Company’s long-term incentives primarily 
comprise the Performance Share Plan and the Deferred Annual 
Bonus Plan. 
The Company follows the guidelines laid down by the ABI. These 
restrict the issue of new shares (and transfers of treasury shares) 
under all the Company’s share schemes in any 10-year period to 
10% of the issued ordinary share capital (excluding shares held in 
treasury) and under the Company’s discretionary schemes to 5% 
in any 10-year period. As at 30 June 2010, the headroom available 
under these limits was 63.7% and 47.6%, respectively. 
Performance Share Plan
The Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) is designed to link reward  
to the key long-term value drivers of the business and to align  
the interests of the executive directors and the global senior 
management population with the long-term interests of 
shareholders. PSP awards are granted annually and vesting  
is dependent on the achievement of performance conditions 
measured over a three-year period. Awards below Management 
Board level were based on a one-year performance period and  
a further two-year holding period. Award levels for executive 
directors and other senior executives are determined each year 
by the Committee, but must not exceed 200% of a participant’s 
base salary in any financial year. Awards for the 2010 financial 
year were capped at 175% for executive directors and 120% for 
other senior executives. 
Approximately 350 key executives, including Alistair Cox,  
Paul Venables and seven other Management Board executives, 
participated in PSP awards made in October 2009. Other 
employees may be eligible to participate in future years at  
the discretion of the Committee. 
Bonus deferral arrangements
Bonus deferral promotes a stronger link between short-term  
and long-term performance through deferral of annual bonuses 
into shares for a three-year period. For the 2010 financial year  
and future years, no matching awards will be made.
Only the executive directors and other members of the 
Management Board currently participate in the Company’s  
bonus deferral arrangements. Other employees may be invited  
to participate in future years at the Committee’s discretion.
As they had previously deferred bonuses before deduction of tax, 
prior to the increase in the highest marginal rate of UK income  
tax to 50% in April 2010, the Committee permitted the executive 
directors and certain senior employees to waive certain pre-tax 
share awards for no monetary consideration. This arrangement 
was made available to all UK employees who had participated in 
t he 	 2 00 7 	 and 	 2 008 	 De f err ed 	 Annu al 	 Bonus 	 P l an 	 a w ar ds. 	 Purs u an t	
to minor amendments to the award terms, electing individuals 
were on 26 March 2010 granted vested special awards over an 
equivalent number of shares, with sufficient shares then being 
sold to discharge tax liabilities on vesting of the award. The 
post-tax number of shares in the vested special awards must  
be retained until the end of the relevant retention period of  
the original award in order for the individual to qualify, where 
applicable, for matching shares. Certain special awards are 
subject to forfeiture, together with an obligation to reimburse  
an amount equivalent to the tax liability paid on vesting of the 
special award, in the event that the director ceases employment 
in certain circumstances before the end of the relevant retention 
period. The Committee considered that this variation to the terms 
of the relevant awards was appropriate in light of the underlying 
commercial substance of the awards on these revised terms. 
Further information is set out in the tables on pages 62 and 63.
All-employee share schemes 
The Company has continued to operate the Hays UK Sharesave 
Scheme (which is HMRC approved and is open to all eligible staff 
in the United Kingdom) and the Hays International Sharesave 
Scheme (which is open to staff in certain other countries where 
the Group has operations). In the 2010 financial year, options over 
1,746,156 shares at a price of 93.0 pence per share, representing  
a 10% discount to market value, were granted to 446 participants 
under both Schemes. The overall participation rate for all current 
schemes remains high at 35.4% of eligible employees.
Both schemes were renewed in 2009 at the Company’s Annual 
General Meeting. 
The executive directors’ interests in outstanding options and 
awards, including performance conditions, are detailed in  
the audited section of this Report from page 62 onwards.
Performance targets on incentives 
The Committee considers that performance conditions for all 
incentives are suitably demanding, having regard to the business 
strategy, shareholder expectations, cyclicality of the recruitment 
markets in which the Group operates and on the basis of external 
advice. To the extent that any performance condition is not met, 
the relevant part of the award will lapse. There is no re-testing  
of performance. The bonus awards payable in respect of the  
2010 financial year, as reported on page 62, were agreed by  
the Committee having reviewed the Company’s results and the 
executive directors’ performance against their personal objectives.
Details of the targets used to determine 2010 bonuses for the 
executive directors are shown in the table overleaf.

Performance levels between threshold, target (where relevant) 
and maximum were graduated on a straight-line basis.
Notes
1.  The EPS target was set at entry at budget for FY 2010 and the maximum was 
set at market consensus. A fixed interest charge and fixed tax rate have been 
used. On this basis the EPS result for the 2010 financial year was 3.295 pence, 
which was between the threshold and maximum targets and, therefore,  
78 . 5% 	 o f 	 the 	 EPS 	 element 	 o f 	 the 	 bonus 	 has 	 been 	 paid.
2.  Cash conversion is the operating cash flow of the Company, after deducting  
net capital expenditure items (excluding capital expenditure incurred on the 
Group’s strategic IT projects) for the financial year, stated as a percentage of 
operating profit before exceptional items. The cash conversion result for the 
2010 	 fin ancial 	 year 	 o f 	 11 8 . 5% 	 was 	 abo ve 	 the 	 maximum 	 target . 	 F ull 	 pa yment 	 has	
been made in respect of this element. As stated in last year’s report, the 2009 
cash conversion result excluded a cash inflow of £20 million that was determined  
to be a one-off windfall and the corresponding cash outflow has therefore been 
excluded from the 2010 result.
3.  The personal objectives for the Chief Executive included key milestones relating 
to the strategic plans for the growth of the business, the global roll out of the 
Group’s marketing approach and new brand identity, the implementation of the 
new front-office IT technology and the Group’s leadership and development plans. 
Those for the Group Finance Director included a number of targets relating  
to debtors, Group reporting and investor strategies, the implementation of key 
back-office systems, the renewal of the Group’s revolving credit facilities and 
certain matters relating to the Hays defined benefit Pension Scheme. Progress 
against these objectives has been good but this element did not pay out in full. 
The performance conditions for outstanding long-term incentive 
arrangements can be found on page 64 of this Report. The 
emoluments of the executive directors and their share interests 
are set out on pages 62 to 65.
Incentive structure for the 2011 financial year 
The Committee Chairman’s introduction on page 56 and the 
po l i cy 	 tab l e 	 o n 	 page 	 58 	 s u mm ar i s e 	 t he 	 appr oac h 	 tak en 	 for 	 t he	
2011 financial year. This section provides more detail on the bonus 
and share incentive arrangements for 2011. 
Bonuses for 2011 financial year 
The structure of bonus arrangements for the 2011 financial year 
remains unchanged, although the respective weightings of the 
performance measures have changed.
Annual bonus structure  
  2010 2011
Maximum bonus as % of base salary 125% 125%
Proportion of maximum based on  
fi n a n cia l	 m e a su r e s:	 8 0 %	 8 0 %
 – EPS 40% 60%
 – Cash Conversion 40% 20%
Proportion of maximum based on  
personal objectives 20% 20%
Proportion of bonus payable subject to  
compulsory deferral 40% 40%
Last year the proportion of bonus based on financial measures 
was split equally between EPS and Cash Conversion. To reflect 
current market opportunities and the focus on earnings growth, 
the balance has been adjusted for 2011 so that three quarters of 
the financial measure is based on EPS and one quarter is based 
on Cash Conversion. 
Of any bonus awarded, 40% will be compulsorily deferred into 
restricted shares for a period of three years, subject only to 
continued employment. As in 2010, there is no matching award. 
The Committee retains discretion to reduce the number of 
deferred shares vesting if the underlying financial performance  
of the Company has not been satisfactory over the three-year 
deferral period.
Suitable stretching targets have been set in relation to budget. 
Similar bonus arrangements will be put in place for the 
Management Board members, but with the maximum set  
at a lower percentage of base salary.
PSP for 2011 financial year 
The PSP awards for the 2010 financial year were based solely  
on Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’). Historically, the Company’s 
executive reward measures have included a significant proportion 
focused on earnings growth and the Committee believes that  
this remains one of the key measures for delivery of long-term 
shareholder value and aligns the interests of management with 
those of shareholders. For this reason, and following shareholder 
consultation, the Committee has decided to re-introduce EPS as a 
second performance measure. The PSP awards for the 2011 
financial year will therefore be based 50% on TSR relative to a 
sector peer group of companies and 50% on cumulative EPS.
The 2011 PSP award structure for the executive directors is shown 
in the table below. 
PSP incentive structure  
  2010 2011
PSP award as % base salary 175% 175%
TSR target relative to  
comparator group 100% of Award 50% of Award
 – Maximum (100% vesting) Upper Quartile Upper Quartile
 – Threshold (25% vesting) Median Median
Cumulative EPS target – 50% of Award
 – Maximum (100% vesting)
 – Threshold (25% vesting)
Similar arrangements will be put in place for the Management 
Board members, but at a lower percentage of base salary.
The size of the awards and proportion vesting at threshold levels 
for both elements of the award are unchanged (25%). 
The Committee consulted with its major shareholders with regard 
to putting in place long-term incentive measures that would last  
a number of cycles and, specifically, the reintroduction of EPS  
as a second performance measure. Following this consultation, 
the Committee will set EPS targets using market consensus 
(reflecting the current point in any cycle) as the starting point  
for the three-year cycle with a range of RPI plus 4% to RPI  
plus 12% for threshold and maximum payment respectively.  
The Committee considers this range to be appropriate over 
several cycles. The Committee will keep the range under  
review to ensure it remains appropriate.

r emuneration report – governance:
REMUNERATION REPORT Performance targets for the TSR component of the award are 
unchanged for the 2011 financial year. However, following the 
acquisition of MPS by Adecco in January 2010, the Committee  
has replaced MPS in the comparator group with CDI Corporation. 
The Committee believes that CDI is an appropriate replacement 
for MPS due to its US listing (which is similar to MPS), size and 
large construction recruitment division.
The intended constituents of the comparator group for the 2011 
awards are shown below: 
Adecco SA
CDI Corporation
Kelly Services Inc 
Manpower Inc 
Michael Page International Plc 
Randstad Holdings NV 
Robert Half International Inc 
Robert Walters Plc 
SThree plc 
USG People NV
The peer group has been chosen to reflect most closely the mix  
of the Company’s business. 
The EPS and TSR components will operate independently. There 
will be no payout for achieving less than threshold performance 
and vesting levels between threshold and maximum performance 
will be calculated on a straight-line basis.
Vesting of the TSR component is subject to satisfactory financial 
performance over the performance period as determined by the 
Committee. 
Pension, benefits and shareholdings 
There has been no change to the policies relating to pensions, 
benefits or shareholdings. 
Shareholding policy 
To ensure that executive directors’ and other senior executives’ 
interests are aligned with those of shareholders over a longer time 
horizon, the Committee require the Chief Executive to build and 
maintain a shareholding in the Company of at least two times 
base salary and other executive directors to build and maintain  
a shareholding of at least one times base salary over a reasonable 
timeframe, which would normally be five years. Other Management 
Board executives are actively encouraged to build a significant 
shareholding in the Company over a similar timeframe. 
Service contracts 
The Company’s policy on service contracts is that executive 
directors’ contracts should be terminable on not more than  
one year’s notice. In the event of early termination of a director’s 
service contract, the Company would be required to pay 
compensation reflecting the salary and benefits to which the 
director would have become entitled under the contract during 
the notice period. Alternatively, the Company may, at its discretion, 
pay a predetermined termination sum in lieu of notice. In the event 
of early termination, the Committee will give careful consideration 
to what compensation should be paid taking into account the 
circumstances and the responsibility of the individual to mitigate loss.

Non-executive directors 
The payment policy for non-executive directors is to pay the 
market rate to secure persons of a suitable calibre for a group  
of this size. The remuneration of the non-executive directors  
is determined by the Board. The responsibility of the role and 
international nature of the Group are fully considered when setting 
the fee levels, along with external benchmarking market data on 
the chairmanship of, and participation in, Board committees. 
The non-executive directors’ fees are non-pensionable and 
non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in any 
incentive plans. The non-executive directors do not have service 
contracts with the Company, but are appointed to the Board 
under letters of appointment for an initial three-year period. They 
are subject to retirement and re-appointment by shareholders 
after their initial period and appointments can be terminated 
immediately by the Company. Letters of appointment are 
available for review from the Company Secretary and a proforma 
letter of appointment can be viewed on the Company’s website, 
haysplc.com. 
Policy on external appointments 
The Company permits its executive directors to hold one external 
non-executive directorship and all fees paid are retained by the 
director. Alistair Cox became a non-executive director of 3i Group 
plc on 1 October 2009. Paul Venables joined Wincanton plc as  
a non-executive director on 2 September 2009. The directors

The graph below shows the value of £100 invested in the 
Company’s shares compared to the FTSE 350 index over a 
five-year period. The graph shows the Total Shareholder Return 
generated by both the movement in share value and the 
reinvestment over the same period of dividend income. The 
Remuneration Committee considers that the FTSE 350 is the 
appropriate index because the Company has been a member  
of this index throughout the period.

of 45% of the bonus earned was deferred on a pre-tax basis and is addressed in the second table opposite. Messrs Cox and Venables elected to defer 25% of the bonus  
on a post-tax basis under the Deferred Annual Bonus plan for a three-year period. Matching shares were awarded in respect of this element, which are subject to  
the satisfaction of performance conditions over a three-year period ending on 30 June 2012 based on earnings per share, international net fees and cash conversion,  
in equal proportions. Dividend equivalent shares will be transferred to the directors in respect of any matching shares that vest. The market price per share on the grant 
date was 107.4 pence. 
3.  Under the May 2007 award, Mr P Venables was invited to defer up to 100% of his bonus for the 2005/06 financial year, after payment of income tax and national 
insurance, into shares subject to a three-year restricted period. The Committee awarded matching shares to Mr Venables, subject to the satisfaction of performance 
conditions over a three-year period ending on 30 June 2009. The number of matching shares was determined by reference to the pre-tax amount of deferred bonus.  
Mr Venables’ matching award partially vested on 1 October 2009 at the rate of 57.4% calculated as 43.2% of the Cumulative EPS performance condition (75% of the 
a w ar d) 	 and 	 100% 	 o f 	 t he 	 In t erna t ional 	 Ne t 	 F ees 	 perf ormanc e 	 c ondi t ion 	 ( 25 % 	 o f 	 t he 	 a w ar d) . 	 T oge t her 	 w i t h 	 t he 	 18 ,051 	 ma t ching 	 shar es, 	 18 , 555 	 def err ed 	 shar es 	 and

4.  Mr P Venables was required to defer a minimum of 25% and could voluntarily defer up to 100% of his pre-tax bonus for the 2006/07 financial year into shares subject to 
a three-year restricted period. The Committee awarded matching shares to Mr Venables, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions over a three-year period. 
Dividend equivalent shares will be transferred to Mr Venables in respect of any matching shares that vest. The market price per share at the award date was 142.0 pence. 
See also Note 5.
5.  Details of shares underpinning matching awards have altered since the 2009 Remuneration Report. On 26 March 2010, the Committee accepted the waiver of certain 
deferred rights (as previously disclosed) and granted vested special awards for no monetary consideration (representing the original awards plus dividend equivalent

A reconciliation between the original awards disclosed in the 2009 Remuneration Report and those stated in this 2010 Remuneration Report is shown opposite.

Note:
1.  The directors were required to defer 70% of their bonuses for the 2009 financial year into shares subject to a three-year restricted period. 45% of the bonus earned 
was deferred on a pre-tax basis and Messrs Cox and Venables were granted a conditional right to receive shares at the end of a three-year period, subject only to 
remaining in employment. The balancing 25% of the bonuses were deferred on a post-tax basis and will potentially attract matching shares and are stated in the previous 
table. Dividend equivalent shares will be transferred to the directors in respect of any shares that vest. The market price per share on the grant date was 106 pence.

Notes:
1.  A Restricted Share Award equivalent to the market value of £600,000 was awarded to Mr A R Cox on joining the Company. Subject to the satisfaction of the 
conditions summarised below, the award vests in three tranches over the first three years of Mr Cox’s employment, starting from 1 July 2007. One sixth of the award 
vests each year subject to continuing employment and one sixth vests each year if the Group PBT growth exceeds RPI + 3% measured from the 30 June 2007 base 
year. On 3 September 2009, the second tranche of shares partially vested and the vested portion was released to Mr Cox. The first criterion (continued employment) 
was met but the second (Group PBT growth) was not. Consequently, only one sixth of the second tranche vested. The market price per share on the grant date was 
160. 2 5 	 penc e 	 and 	 a t 	 the 	 da t e 	 o f 	 vest ing 	 was 	 9 8 . 2 	 penc e.	
2.  On 26 March 2010, Mr Cox waived that element of the final tranche that related to continuing employment (64,516 shares), which was replaced by a vested special 
award over the same number of shares subject to the same restrictions. Mr Cox settled the tax and national insurance due from his own funds calculated by reference 
t o 	 the 	 mark et 	 value 	 o f 	 the 	 shar es 	 on 	 the 	 special 	 a ward 	 da t e 	 o f 	 10 8 . 8 	 penc e.
3.  Includes the 64,516 vested special award shares that remain subject to forfeiture if the continued employment condition is not met (see note 2).
4. In addition, Mr Cox has 64,516 vested special award shares (see notes 2 and 3).

Long-term incentive performance conditions 
Details of the performance conditions for the Company’s active long-term incentive plans are shown in the tables below.
Performance levels between threshold, target (where relevant) and maximum are graduated on a straight-line basis.
Notes:
1.  Cumulative EPS is the consolidated fully-diluted earnings per share of the Company calculated in accordance with IAS 33 for each financial year cumulative over the performance period. 
Goodwill impairments arising from acquisitions prior to 30 June 2006 are excluded from the EPS calculation. Cumulative International Net Fees is the net fees of the Company excluding UK and 
Ireland 	 for 	 each 	 fin ancial 	 y ear 	 cumulativ e 	 o v er 	 the 	 per formance 	 period . 	 In 	 re spec t 	 of 	 O c t ober 	 20 0 8 	 and 	 O c t ober 	 20 09 	 Mat ching 	 A wards 	 only , 	 net 	 fee s 	 at tributable 	 t o 	 Australia 	 and 	 N e w 	 Z ealand	
are also excluded. International net fees arising from any acquisition made from the start of the relevant performance period are excluded from the Cumulative International Net Fees calculation. 
Cumulative Economic Profit is the consolidated profit of the Company after 30% tax but before interest less the weighted average cost of capital multiplied by the average capital employed for 
each financial year cumulative over the performance period. Cumulative Cash Conversion is the operating cash flow of the Company, after deducting net capital expenditure (excluding capital 
expenditure incurred on the Group’s strategic IT projects), stated as a percentage of operating profit before exceptional items, for each financial year cumulative over the performance period. 
The Remuneration Committee may make adjustments to the calculations of Cumulative EPS, Cumulative Economic Profit and Cumulative Cash Conversion, including taking account of unusual 
or non-recurring items that do not reflect underlying performance.
2.  The EPS element is subject to an underpin whereby the EPS element will vest only if the Committee is satisfied that operating profit performance outperforms that of a comparator group of 
companies over the performance period.
3.  For the purpose of ranking the performance of Hays shares against a sector group of comparator companies, TSR for each company is the difference between the average market values  
(in Sterling terms) of a notional shareholding in that company on all dealing days for the three-month periods to 20 June 2009 and 30 June 2012 divided by the average market values  
(in Sterling terms) of a notional shareholding in that company on all dealing days for the three-month period to 30 June 2009. The TSR for Hays shares is ranked against the respective  
TSR performances of Adecco SA, Kelly Services Inc, Manpower Inc, Michael Page International Plc, MPS Group, Inc, Randstad Holdings NV, Robert Half International Inc, Robert Walters Plc, 
SThree plc and USG People NV. Vesting will be subject to satisfactory financial performance over the performance period as determined by the Remuneration Committee.

Share options
The Company operates two executive share option plans, although grants have ceased to be made under both of these plans: the 
Hays plc 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) (which is unapproved for HMRC purposes) and the Hays plc 1996 Company 
Share Option Plan (CSOP) (which is an HMRC approved scheme).
Options cannot be exercised under the ESOS and CSOP unless performance criteria are met. The performance criteria require growth 
in Earnings Per Share (EPS) to have exceeded the growth rate in the RPI by 2% per annum in a three year period prior to exercise.
The following are options over Ordinary shares held by directors during the year ended 30 June 2010:

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of h ays plc
We have audited the Group financial statements of Hays plc  
for the year ended 30 June 2010 which comprises the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement  
of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the 
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated Statement 
of Changes in Equity and the related notes 1 to 33. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation  
is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and  
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and Auditors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement 
on page 55, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they 
give a and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards  
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free  
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates made by the directors;  
and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
•	 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs  
as at 30 June 2010 and of its profit for the year then ended;
•	 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union; and
•	 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of  
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for 
the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the Group financial statements.

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:

we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:

in relation to going concern; and

Financial statements NOTES TO ThE CONSOl IdATEd FINANCIAl S TATEMENTS 
1 general information
Hays plc is a Company incorporated in England and Wales  
and its registered office is 250 Euston Road, London NW1 2AF.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) and International Financial Reporting Interpretation 
Committee interpretations (IFRICs) as adopted by the European 
Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the European Union 
International Accounting Standard (IAS) Regulation.
New standards and interpretations
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on 
the basis of the accounting policies and methods of computation 
applicable for the year ending 30 June 2010. These accounting 
policies are consistent with those applied in the preparation of  
the accounts for the year ended 30 June 2009 with the exception 
of the following new accounting standards, amendments and 
interpretations which were mandatory for accounting periods 
beginning 1 January 2009.
IAS 1 (revised 2007) 
Presentation of 
Financial Statements
IAS 1 (2007) has introduced a number  
of changes in the format and content  
of the financial statements. On adoption 
there were no changes to the disclosure 
previously provided except for  
the following: 
The Statement of Recognised Income 
and Expenditure has been renamed the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
The Statement of Changes in Equity  
has been included. 
A third comparative is to be included 
within the Consolidated Balance Sheet  
if any previously reported information  
is restated or represented. In the current 
year, the adoption of IFRS 8 triggers this 
requirement. The Board of Directors have 
concluded that the addition of the 2008 
comparative information would not 
provide any additional information  
or enhance the overall clarity of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.  
A full explanation of the impact of  
IFRS 8 is provided in note 4.
IFRS 8 
Operating Segments
IFRS 8 is a disclosure Standard that  
has resulted in a review of the Group’s 
reportable segments (see note 4).
IFRS 2 (amendment) 
Share-Based Payment 
– Vesting Conditions 
and Cancellations
The amendments clarify the definition  
of vesting conditions for the purpose  
of IFRS 2, introduce a concept of 
‘non-vesting’ conditions and clarify the 
accounting treatment for cancellations. 
This change has not had a material 
impact on the accounts.
IAS 23 (revised 2007) 
Borrowing Costs
The principal change to the Standard  
was to eliminate the option to expense  
all borrowing costs when incurred.  
This change has had no impact on these 
financial statements because this has 
always been the Group’s policy.
There have been no alterations made to the accounting policies  
as a result of considering all amendments to other IFRS and IFRIC 
amendments and interpretations that became effective during 
the financial year, as these were not material to the Group’s 
operations or were not relevant. 
The Group has not yet adopted certain new standards, 
amendments and interpretations to existing standards, which 
have been published but are only effective for our accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 July 2010 or later periods.  
These new pronouncements are listed below:
Improvements  
to IFRSs 2009
(Effective 1 January 2010)
IFRS 2 (amendment) Group Cash Settled Share-Based 
Payment Transactions  
(effective 1 January 2010)
IAS 32 (amendment) Financial Instrument Presentation – 
clarification of rights issues  
(effective 1 February 2010)
IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with 
Equity Instruments (effective 1 July 2010)
Improvements  
to IFRSs 2010
(Effective 1 July 2010 and 1 January 2011) 
IAS 24 (revised 2009) Related Party Disclosure  
(effective 1 January 2010)
IFRIC 14 (amendment) IAS 19 – The Limit on Defined Benefit 
Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements 
and their Interaction  
(effective 1 January 2011)
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments  
(effective 1 January 2013)
The directors are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption 
of these standards, amendments and interpretations.
The Group’s principal accounting policies adopted in the 
presentation of these financial statements are set out below  
and have been consistently applied to all the periods presented. Di Re cto Rs’ Repo Rt – Business Review Di Re cto Rs’ Repo Rt – Gove Rn ance Remune Rat ion Repo Rt – Gove Rna nce Financial s ta tements Hays plc a nn ual Repo Rt & Fi nancial s ta tements 2010 73
Di Re cto Rs’ Repo Rt – Business Review Financial s ta tements 2 Significant accounting policies
a Basis of preparation
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union 
and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on  
the historical cost basis.
b Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
effect its future development, performance and position are set 
out in the review of the business on pages 2 to 39. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position are 
described in the financial review on pages 28 to 31. In addition, 
notes 19 to 20 of the Consolidated Financial Statements include 
details of the Group’s treasury activities, long-term funding 
arrangements and exposure to financial risk.
The Group has sufficient financial resources which, together with 
internally generated cash flows, will continue to provide sufficient 
sources of liquidity to fund its current operations, including its 
contractual and commercial commitments and any proposed 
dividends, and the Group is well placed to manage its  
business risks. 
After making enquiries, the directors have formed the judgement, 
at the time of approving the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for  
the foreseeable future. For this reason, the directors continue  
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
c Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which power 
to control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated 
from the date on which control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for  
the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. On acquisition  
the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are 
measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess 
of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share 
of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.  
The financial statements consolidate the accounts of Hays plc  
and all of its subsidiary undertakings (‘subsidiaries’). The results 
of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are 
included from the effective date of acquisition or up to the 
effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses  
are eliminated on consolidation.
d Turnover
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for 
goods and services provided in the normal course of business,  
net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Turnover arising from the placement of permanent candidates  
is recognised at the time the candidate commences full-time 
employment. Provision is made for the expected cost of meeting 
obligations where employees do not work for the specified 
contractual period.
Turnover arising from temporary placements is recognised over 
the period that temporary workers are provided. Where the 
Group is acting as a principal, turnover represents the amounts 
billed for the services of the temporary workers, including the 
remuneration costs of the temporary workers. 
Where Hays acts as principal in arrangements that invoice  
on behalf of other recruitment agencies, turnover represents 
amounts invoiced and collected on behalf of other recruitment 
agencies, including arrangements where no commission is 
directly receivable by the Group.
Where the Group is acting as an agent, turnover represents 
commission receivable relating to the supply of temporary  
workers and does not include the remuneration costs of the 
temporary workers. Where the Group receives income in respect 
of payroll processing, only the service fee element of this service 
is recognised as turnover.
e Net fees
Net fees represent turnover less the remuneration costs of 
temporary workers for temporary assignments and remuneration 
of other recruitment agencies. For the placement of permanent 
candidates, net fees are equal to turnover.
f Exceptional items
Exceptional items, as disclosed on the face of the Consolidated 
Income Statement, are items which due to their size and 
non-recurring nature have been classified separately in order  
to draw them to the attention of the reader of the financial 
statements and to show the underlying profits of the Group.
g Foreign currencies
On consolidation, the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities 
of foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the balance sheet 
date. Income and expense items are translated into sterling  
at average rates of exchange for the period. Any exchange 
differences which have arisen from an entity’s investment in  
a foreign subsidiary, including long-term loans, are recognised  
as a separate component of equity and are to be included in  
the Group’s translation reserve.
On disposal of a subsidiary, any amounts transferred to the 
translation reserve are included in the calculation of profit and 
loss on disposal. All other translation differences are dealt with  
in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Goodwill and fair-value adjustments arising on the acquisition of  
a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
entity and translated at the closing rate. 74 Hays plc a nn ual Repo Rt & Fi nancial s ta tements 2010
Financial statements NOTES TO ThE CONSOl IdATEd FINANCIAl S TATEMENTS continued
2 Significant accounting policies continued
h Retirement benefit costs
The expense of defined benefit pension schemes and other 
post-retirement employee benefits is determined using the 
projected-unit credit method and charged to the Consolidated 
Income Statement as an expense, based on actuarial assumptions 
reflecting market conditions at the beginning of the financial  
year. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the  
period in which they occur. Past service costs are recognised 
immediately to the extent that benefits have vested or, if not 
vested, on a straight-line basis over the period until the  
benefits vest.
The Group has chosen under IFRS 1 to recognise in retained 
earnings all cumulative actuarial gains and losses as at 1 July 2004, 
the date of transition to IFRS. The Group has chosen to recognise 
all actuarial gains and losses arising subsequent to 1 July 2004  
in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as 
reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting 
from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the 
present value of available refunds and reductions in future 
contribution to the scheme.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an 
expense as they fall due.
i Share-based payments
The fair value of all share-based remuneration that is assessed 
upon market-based performance criteria is determined at the  
date of grant and recognised as an expense in the Consolidated 
Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, 
taking account of the estimated number of shares that will vest.
The fair value of all share-based remuneration that is assessed 
upon non-market-based performance criteria is determined  
at the date of the grant and recognised as an expense in the 
Consolidated Income Statement over the vesting period, based 
on the number of shares that are expected to vest. The number  
of shares that are expected to vest is adjusted accordingly to  
the satisfaction of the performance criteria at each period end.
The fair values are determined by use of the relevant valuation 
models. All share-based remuneration is equity settled.
j Borrowing costs
Interest costs are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated 
Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred. 
Arrangement fees incurred in respect of borrowings are 
amortised over the term of the agreement.
k Taxation
The tax expense comprises both current and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the  
year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the 
Consolidated Income Statement because it excludes items of 
income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years 
and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. 
The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on all temporary differences, at 
rates that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against 
which to offset the deductible temporary differences.
Temporary differences arise where there is a difference between 
the accounting carrying value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet 
and the amount attributed to that asset or liability for tax 
purposes.
Deferred tax is provided on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries 
and associates, where the Group is unable to control the timing of 
the distribution, and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will reverse in the future.
l Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of 
purchase consideration less the fair value of the identifiable 
tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment 
at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately  
in the profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a business the attributable amount of goodwill  
is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to 
IFRS (1 July 2004) has been retained at the previous UK GAAP 
amounts, subject to being tested for impairment at that date. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 July 1998 was written 
off direct to reserves under UK GAAP. This goodwill has not been 
reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent 
profit or loss on disposal.
m Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are 
stated in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their fair value as at 
the date of acquisition less accumulated amortisation and any 
provision for impairment. The directors review intangible assets 
for indications of impairment annually.
Internally generated intangible assets are stated in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet at the directly attributable cost of 
creation of the asset, less accumulated amortisation. Intangible 
assets are amortised systematically over their estimated useful 
lives up to a maximum of 10 years. Software incorporated into 
major ERP implementations that support the recruitment process 
and financial reporting is amortised over a life of up to seven 
years. Other software is amortised between three and five years. Di Re cto Rs’ Repo Rt – Business Review Di Re cto Rs’ Repo Rt – Gove Rn ance Remune Rat ion Repo Rt – Gove Rna nce Financial s ta tements Hays plc a nn ual Repo Rt & Fi nancial s ta tements 2010 75
n Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost, net of 
depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation  
provided on a straight-line basis over the anticipated useful 
working lives of the assets, after they have been brought into  
use, at the following rates:
Freehold land – No depreciation is provided
Freehold buildings – At rates varying between 2% and 10%
Leasehold properties –  The cost is written off over the 
unexpired term of the lease
Plant and machinery – At rates varying between 5% and 33%
Fixtures and fittings – At rates varying between 10% and 25%
o Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at fair value after appropriate 
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts have been 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement where there  
is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
p Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash-in-hand and current 
balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject  
to insignificant risk of changes in value.
q Trade payables
Trade payables are measured at fair value.
r Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at  
the amount of the proceeds received, net of direct-issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement  
or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an 
accrual basis in profit or loss using the effective interest rate 
method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument 
to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which  
they arise.
s Leases
Leases where a significant portion of risks and rewards of 
ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases by the lessee.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the 
Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over  
the lease term.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an 
operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term.
t Provisions
A provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of a past event for which it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle 
the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. If the 
effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the 
expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects the 
current market assessments of the time value of money and  
the risks specific to the liability.
3  Critical accounting judgements and key sources  
of estimation uncertainty
Retirement benefit obligations
Under IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’, the Group has recognised a 
pension deficit of £61.7 million (2009: £109.2 million). A number 
of assumptions have been made in determining the pension 
deficit and these are described in note 22 of the financial 
statements.
Goodwill impairment
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis. In 
performing these tests, assumptions are made in respect of 
future growth rates and the discount rate to be applied to the 
future cash flows of income-generating units. These assumptions 
are set out in note 14 of the financial statements.
Provisions in respect of disposed businesses
As described in note 23, provisions in respect of disposed 
businesses have been made. In assessing the adequacy of  
these provisions, estimates are made of probable cash outflows  
in the future.
Provisions in respect of recoverability of trade receivables
As described in note 18, provisions for impairment of trade 
receivables have been made. In reviewing the appropriateness  
of these provisions, consideration has been given to the ageing  
of the debt and the potential likelihood of default, taking into 
account current economic conditions. 76 Hays plc a nn ual Repo Rt & Fi nancial s ta tements 2010

4 Segmental information 
Adoption of IFRS 8, Operating Segments
The Group has adopted IFRS 8, Operating Segments, with effect from 1 July 2009. IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified 
on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to 
allocate resources to the segment and to assess their performance.
As a result, the Group continues to split the business into three regions, Asia Pacific, Continental Europe & Rest of World, and  
United Kingdom & Ireland.
The Group’s continuing operations comprise one class of business, that of specialist recruitment.
Net fees and profit from continuing operations
The Group does not split turnover by segment in internal reports, as remuneration of temporary workers and payments to other 
recruitment agencies, where the Group acts as principal, are not considered relevant in allocating resources to segments. The Group’s 
chief operating decision maker instead focuses on net fees. The reconciliation of turnover to net fees can be found in note 6.

The Group does not report items below operating profit by segment in the internal management reporting. The full detail of these 
items can be seen in the Group Consolidated Income Statement on page 68.
There is no material difference between the split of the Group’s turnover by geographic origin and destination.
Net trade debtors
For the purpose of monitoring performance and allocating resources from a balance sheet perspective, the Group’s chief operating 
decision maker only monitors trade debtors net of provisions for impairments on a segment by segment basis. These are monitored on 
a constant currency basis for comparability through the year, these are shown below and reconciled to the totals as shown in note 18.

Major customers
Included in turnover is an amount of approximately £278 million (2009: £28 million) which arose from sales to the Group’s largest 
customer. This revenue is generated within the United Kingdom & Ireland. This is the only customer to exceed 10% of the Group’s 
turnover. However, as this includes a significant element of remuneration of other recruitment agencies, it represents less than 1.5%  
of the Group’s net fees. Di Re cto Rs’ Repo Rt – Business Review Di Re cto Rs’ Repo Rt – Gove Rn ance Remune Rat ion Repo Rt – Gove Rna nce Financial s ta tements Hays plc a nn ual Repo Rt & Fi nancial s ta tements 2010 77
5 Exceptional items
During the year, the Group incurred an exceptional charge of £41.4 million in relation to the following items:
On the 30 September 2009, The Office of Fair Trading (‘OFT’) issued its decision finding that Hays’ Construction & Property business 
in the UK had breached competition law in the period October 2004 to November 2005. Hays has co-operated fully with the OFT  
in its investigation under the leniency regime and has been fined £30.4 million which is currently under appeal. The effect of this fine 
and legal costs associated with the appeal has been recognised in the Income Statement as an exceptional charge of £29.0 million. 
The fine has not yet been paid and a current liability of £30.4 million is held on the Balance Sheet within trade and other payables 
pending the outcome of the appeal.
The Group incurred a non-recurring restructuring cost of £12.4 million which principally relates to back-office staff redundancy  
costs of £7.9 million, onerous property leases of £2.5 million and non-cash fixed asset write down of £2.0 million following the near 
completion of the United Kingdom back-office automation project. The exceptional charge generated a tax credit of £3.5 million.
The cash impact from the exceptional items as at the balance sheet date was £4.1 million with a further £35.3 million cash outflow 
expected in the future, primarily during the financial year to 30 June 2011.
In the prior year, non-recurring net costs of £0.3 million included within operating costs have not been restated (note 6).

The additions of £9.9 million during the year represents an increase in the deferred consideration required in relation to the  
James Harvard acquisition in respect of earn-out payments.
Goodwill arising on business combinations is reviewed and tested on an annual basis or more frequently if there is indication that 
goodwill might be impaired. Goodwill has been tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each cash-generating  
unit (‘CGU’), including goodwill, with the recoverable amount. The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from  
value-in-use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding operating profit, discount rates and growth rates.  
The operating profit is based on the latest one-year forecasts for the CGUs approved by management and management estimates 
discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
CGUs. The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by management and 
extrapolates cash flows in perpetuity based on the long-term growth rates and expected cash conversion rates. The long-term  
growth rates are based on management forecasts, which are consistent with external sources of an average estimated growth rate  
of 3.0% (2009: 3.0%), reflecting long-term wage inflation driving fee growth. The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows  
is 12.0% (2009: 12.0%). In 2009, management used a post-tax discount rate of 9.0%, this translates to a pre-tax rate of 12.0%.
Impairment reviews were performed at the year end by comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the recoverable amount  
of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated. Management determined that there has been no impairment.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing recoverable amounts of goodwill. This has been based on changes in  
key assumptions considered to be possible by management. This included a change in the discount rate of up to 1% and changes  
in long-term growth rate from 0% to 5%.
In the United Kingdom & Ireland group of CGUs, the carrying value in respect of the UK RSG acquisition of £15.3 million is in line with 
its value in use. The sensitivity analysis, based on a 0.5% change in discount rate, equated to a circa £0.9 million change in the value  
in use. A 1% change in growth rate equated to a circa £0.5 million change in the value in use. An increase in discount rate to 13% with 
no growth would lead to a potential impairment of £4.5 million. Management will continue to monitor this acquisition but, based on  
the potential for growth in excess of the estimates being at least as likely as an increase in discount rates, they do not consider 
impairment appropriate.
The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairment would arise under each scenario for any of the other CGUs.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from that 
business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows:

These assets relate to the Group’s projects to transform its software. 
The estimated average useful life of the intangible assets is seven years (2009: five years). The increase in useful life compared to  
last year is due to software incorporated into major ERP implementations which is amortised over a life of up to seven years. Other 
software is amortised between three and five years.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so and they relate to taxes levied  
by the same taxation authority either on the same taxable entity or entities which intend to settle current tax assets or liabilities  
on a net basis.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £33.2 million (2009: £36.1 million) available for offset against future 
profits, of which £6.2 million relates to United Kingdom capital losses, £8.4 million relates to otherwise unrelievable EU losses 
potentially relievable against United Kingdom profits and £18.6 million relates to overseas losses. No deferred tax asset has been 
recognised in respect of such losses (2009: nil). Of these unrecognised tax losses, £0.7 million is due to expire between 2012 and 2018 
and £32.5 million is unlikely to expire in the short-term.
The United Kingdom government has announced that the rate of corporation tax will reduce from 28% to 27% with effect from  
1 April 2011. If this change had been substantively enacted at 30 June 2010, the Group’s deferred tax asset would have been reduced 
by £0.7 million, with £0.6 million charged to equity and £0.1 million charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The Group has no unused tax credits available for offset against future profits (2009: £3.1 million). No deferred tax asset was 
recognised in respect of these credits in the prior year. The reduction compared to last year is due to a change in the United Kingdom 
tax legislation.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries on which deferred tax liabilities have not 
been provided is £2.9 million. The temporary differences at 30 June 2010 are reduced from the previous year as a result of the change 
in United Kingdom tax legislation which largely exempts from United Kingdom tax, overseas dividends received after 1 July 2009.  
The temporary differences at 30 June 2010 represents only the un-remitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance 
of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend with-holding taxes levied by the jurisdictions in 
which these subsidiaries operate.

Credit risk 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of 
allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on 
previous experience, is evidence of a likely reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows. The Group reduces risk through its credit 
control process and by contractual arrangements with other recruitment agencies in situations where the Group invoice on their 
behalf. The Group’s exposure is spread over a large number of customers.
The risk disclosures contained on page 49 within the Directors’ Report form part of these financial statements.

Credit risk
The credit risk on liquid funds is closely monitored and is limited to banks with credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating 
agencies and above a predetermined minimum rating set by Group treasury policy. A credit limit is applied to each bank and deposits 
held are monitored against those limits.

As detailed in note 33, on 1 July 2010 the Group renewed its unsecured revolving credit facility. This new facility expires in January 2014.
Fair values of financial assets and bank loans and overdrafts
The fair value of financial assets and bank loans and overdrafts is not materially different to their book value due to the short-term 
maturity of the instruments, which are based on floating rates.
Committed facilities
The Group had a £460 million unsecured revolving credit facility available which was renewed on 1 July 2010 as detailed in note 33. 
The covenants in the facility as at the balance sheet date required the Group’s interest cover to be at least 4:1 and its leverage ratio  
(net debt to EBITDA) to be no greater than 3:1. The interest rate on the facility was based on a ratchet mechanism with a margin 
payable over LIBOR in the range of 0.375% to 0.525%.
At 30 June 2010, £315.0 million of the committed facility was undrawn.
Capital management
The Board’s current priorities for the Group’s fee cash flow are to fund Group development, maintain the strength of the balance sheet 
and to support a sustainable dividend policy. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from last year in that it manages its 
capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns through the economic cycle.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which is represented by cash and cash equivalents (note 19), the bank loans 
and overdraft (note 20) and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained 
earnings as disclosed in notes 24 to 28.
The Group is not restricted to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Currency exposure
The Group did not have a material Income Statement exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses on monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at 30 June 2010.

22 Retirement benefit obligations
Within the UK, the Group operates one defined contribution scheme and two defined benefit schemes. The majority of overseas 
arrangements are either defined contribution or government-sponsored schemes and these arrangements are not material in the 
context of the Group results.
UK Defined Contribution Scheme
The Hays Stakeholder Pension Plan was established on 1 July 2001. Money purchase benefits are funded by contributions from 
employees and, for eligible employees, from the employer. Employer contributions are in the range of 2% to 18% of pensionable salary 
depending on the level of employee contribution and seniority.
The total cost charged to the Consolidated Income Statement of £2.3 million (2009: £1.4 million) represents employers’ contributions 
payable to the Stakeholder Pension Plan. Contributions of £0.2 million (2009: £0.1 million) were outstanding at the end of the year. 
The assets of the Stakeholder Pension Plan are held separately from those of the Group.
UK Defined Benefit Schemes
(i)  The Hays Pension Scheme, is a defined benefit scheme where the benefits are based on employees’ length of service and final 
pensionable pay. It is a funded approved defined benefit scheme and closed to new members on 1 July 2001. It is funded through  
a legally separate trustee administered fund.
(ii)  The Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme is a supplementary unfunded unapproved retirement benefit scheme for employees 
who were subject to HMRC’s earnings cap on pensionable salary.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the Hays Pension Scheme was performed at 30 June 2009 although this has not yet been 
finalised. A roll forward of the actuarial valuation of the Hays Pension Scheme to 30 June 2010 and a valuation of the Hays 
Supplementary Pension Scheme have been performed by an independent actuary, and employee of Mercer. The key assumptions 
used at 30 June 2010 are listed below.
IAS 19 accounting valuation
Hays plc has applied the accounting requirements of IAS 19 as follows:
•	 scheme assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date;
•	 scheme liabilities are measured using a projected-unit credit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high-quality 
corporate bonds of equivalent term to the liability; and
•	 actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, outside of the Consolidated Income Statement,  
in retained earnings and presented in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The key assumptions are as follows:
       2010 2009
Inflation assumption       3.35% 3.65%
Discount rate       5.43% 6.35%
Rate of increase in salaries      3.60% 3.90%
Rate of increase of pensions in payment and deferment     3.35% 3.65%
Expected long-term rates of return on scheme assets     5.97% 6.46% Di Re cto Rs’ Repo Rt – Business Review Di Re cto Rs’ Repo Rt – Gove Rn ance Remune Rat ion Repo Rt – Gove Rna nce Financial s ta tements Hays plc a nn ual Repo Rt & Fi nancial s ta tements 2010 89
The assumption for the expected long-term returns for scheme assets is a weighted average based on the assumed expected return 
for each asset class and the proportions held of each asset class at the beginning of the year.
The long-term expected rate of return on scheme assets does not affect the level of the obligation but does affect the expected return 
on pension scheme assets within the net finance (charge)/income.
The mortality rates have been calculated using the S1NA generational mortality tables with a medium cohort projection and an underpin 
to future improvements of 1% per annum with age adjustments (minus 0.5 years for male pensioners). This assumes that a 65-year-old 
male current pensioner has a life expectancy of 21.5 years.
The amounts recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for the defined benefit schemes are as follows:
(In £’s million)       2010 2009
Current service cost       (4.1) (4.5)
Expected return on pension scheme assets     21.0 24.8

Net financial charge        (6.7) (2.4)
Total amount charged to the Consolidated Income Statement    (10.8) (6.9)
The actuarial gains and losses have been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as follows:
(In £’s million)       2010 2009
Actuarial gain/(losses) on scheme assets      37.2 (78.2)

Fair value of plan assets at 30 June      378.2 329.9
The change in the deficit is mainly attributable to higher than expected asset returns, the experience gains on the liabilities offset by 
the change in assumptions (to more closely align with the updated actuarial assumptions) and a decrease in net yield (discount rate 
versus inflation rate).
The analysis of the scheme assets and the expected return at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date was as follows:
      2010  2009 
     2010 Expected 2009 Expected 
     Fair value return Fair value return

Other     15.1 0.50% 1.7 0.50%
      378.2 5.97% 329.9 6.46%
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption used in determining the net pension cost for the year to  
June 2010, the Group considered the level of expected returns on risk-free investments (primarily government bonds), the rate  
of return on AA rated corporate bonds, the level of risk premium associated with the other assets classes in which the portfolio is 
invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class at 30 June 2009. The expected return for each asset class was 
then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on asset assumption for the portfolio. 
This resulted in the selection of the 6.46% assumption for the year end 30 June 2010. Di Re cto Rs’ Repo Rt – Business Review Di Re cto Rs’ Repo Rt – Gove Rn ance Remune Rat ion Repo Rt – Gove Rna nce Financial s ta tements Hays plc a nn ual Repo Rt & Fi nancial s ta tements 2010 91

Performance Share Plan (PSP) and Deferred Annual Bonus (DAB)
The PSP is designed to link reward to the key long-term value drivers of the business and to align the interests of the executive 
directors and approximately 350 of the global senior management population with the long-term interests of shareholders.  
PSP awards are discretionary and vesting is dependent on the achievement of performance conditions measured over either  
a three-year period or a one-year period with a two-year holding period.
Only the executive directors and other members of the Management Board participate in the DAB which promotes a stronger  
link between short-term and long-term performance through deferral of annual bonuses into shares for a three-year period. 
Further details of the schemes for the executive directors can be found in the Remuneration Report on pages 62 to 65.

33 Subsequent events
On 1 July 2010, the Group renewed its unsecured revolving credit facility and, in the process, reduced the facility required from  
£460 million to £300 million. The new facility expires in January 2014. The financial covenants under the renewed facility require  
the Group’s interest cover to be at least 4:1 and its leverage ratio (net debt to EBITDA) to be no greater than 2.5:1. The interest rate  
of the facility is based on a ratchet mechanism with a margin payable over LIBOR in the range of 1.75% to 2.25%. 96 Hays plc a nn ual Repo Rt & Fi nancial s ta tements 2010

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of h ays plc
We have audited the parent Company financial statements  
of Hays plc for the year ended 30 June 2010 which comprise  
the Company Balance Sheet and the related notes 1 to 16.  
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in  
their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and  
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and Auditors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement 
on page 55, the directors are responsible for the preparation of  
the parent Company financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit 
the parent Company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free  
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies  
are appropriate to the parent Company’s circumstances and  
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent Company financial statements:
•	 give a true and fair view of the state of the parent Company’s 
affairs as at 30 June 2010; 
•	 have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
•	 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements  
of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
•	 the part of the directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006; and
•	 the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial 
year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the parent Company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
•	 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
•	 the parent Company financial statements and the part of  
the directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not  
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
•	 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
•	 we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements 
of Hays plc for the year ended 30 June 2010.

1 basis of preparation
a Accounting basis
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented 
as required by the Companies Act 2006. They have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention and in accordance with 
applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and Law.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006,  
the Company’s profit and loss account has not been presented.
The Company’s principal accounting policies adopted in the 
presentation of these financial statements are set out below  
and have been consistently applied to all periods presented.
b Cash flow statement and related party disclosures
The results, assets and liabilities of the Company are included  
in the consolidated financial statements of Hays plc, which are 
publicly available. Consequently, the Company has taken 
exemption from preparing a cash flow statement under the terms 
of FRS 1 (revised) ‘Cash Flow Statements’. The Company is also 
exempt under the terms of FRS 8 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ from 
disclosing related party transactions with entities that are part of 
the Group.
c Investments
Shares in subsidiaries are valued at cost less provision for 
impairment. 
d Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost, net of 
depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation  
is provided on a straight-line basis over the anticipated useful 
working lives of the assets, after they have been brought into  
use, at the following rates:
Plant and machinery – At rates varying between 5% and 33%.
Fixture and fittings – At rates varying between 10% and 25%.
e Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided in full on all timing differences which 
result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, 
or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected  
to apply when they crystallise. Timing differences arise from  
the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation 
computations in periods different from those in which they are 
included in financial statements. Deferred tax is not provided on 
unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there  
is no commitment to remit these earnings. Deferred tax assets  
are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than 
not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities 
are not discounted.
f Pension costs
For defined benefit schemes the amounts charged to operating 
profit are the current service costs and gains and losses on 
settlements and curtailments. They are included as part of staff 
costs. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the profit 
and loss account if the benefits have vested. If the benefits have 
not vested immediately, the costs are recognised over the period 
until vesting occurs. The interest cost and the expected return on 
assets are shown as a net amount of other finance costs or credits 
adjacent to interest. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised 
immediately in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains  
and Losses. 
The main defined benefit scheme is funded, with the assets of  
the scheme held separately from those of the Group, in separate 
trustee administered funds. Pension scheme assets are measured 
at fair value and liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using 
the projected unit method and discounted at a rate equivalent  
to the current rate of return on a high-quality corporate bond  
of equivalent currency and term to the scheme liabilities. The 
actuarial valuations are obtained at least triennially and are 
updated at each balance sheet date. The resulting defined benefit 
asset or liability, net of the related deferred tax, is presented 
separately after other net assets on the face of the Company 
Balance Sheet.
g Employee share option schemes
The Company operates a number of employee share option 
schemes. All equity-settled, share-based payments are measured 
at fair value at the date of grant. All equity-settled, share-based 
payment schemes are dealt with in the Balance Sheet by 
including them within total equity shareholders’ interests in 
accordance with FRS 20, Share-based payments.
h Dividends
Dividends are recognised in the period that they are declared  
and approved.
2 Employee information
Details of directors’ emoluments and interests are included in the 
Remuneration Report on pages 62 to 65. Except for the directors, 
there were no employees of the Company in 2010 or 2009.
3 profit for the year
Hays plc has not presented its own profit and loss account and 
related notes as permitted by section 408 of the Companies  
Act 2006. The profit for the financial year dealt with in the 
financial statements of the parent Company is £62.1 million 
(2009: £48.1 million). The Auditor’s remuneration for audit 
services to the Company was £0.3 million (2009: £0.3 million). Di Re cto Rs’ Repo Rt – Business Review Di Re cto Rs’ Repo Rt – Gove Rn ance Remune Rat ion Repo Rt – Gove Rna nce Financial s ta tements Hays plc a nn ual Repo Rt & Fi nancial s ta tements 2010 99

10 Retirement benefit obligations 
The Company is the sponsoring employer for all of the Hays defined benefit pension schemes and recognises the full liability on  
its Balance Sheet. Under FRS 17 the actual cost of providing pensions to the Company is charged to the profit and loss account  
as incurred during the year, net of costs paid by subsidiary companies.
The pension cost charged to the Company’s profit and loss account is £0.5 million (2009: £0.6 million). 
The mortality rates have been calculated using the S1NA generational mortality tables with a medium cohort projection and an 
underpin to future improvements of 1% per annum with age adjustments (minus 0.5 years for male pensioners). This assumes that  
a 65-year-old male current pensioner has a life expectancy of 21.5 years.
The movement in the deficit during the year is analysed below:
(In £’s million)       2010 2009
Deficit in the scheme brought forward      (109.2) (88.1)
Current service cost       (4.1) (4.5)
Contributions       5.5 7.0
Net financial return       (6.7) (2.4)
Actuarial loss       47.4 (21.2)
Deficit in the scheme carried forward      (67.1) (109.2)
Based on actuarial advice, the financial assumptions used in calculating the scheme’s liabilities under FRS 17 are:

Rate of increase in salaries   3.60% 3.90% 3.95% 5.80% 5.40%

Future profile of Hays Pension Scheme
The Hays Pension Scheme was closed to new members with effect from 1 July 2001. The age profile of the active membership will  
rise over time and hence the future service cost (as a percentage of annual salaries) is also likely to rise. The Group has considered  
the impact of the FRS 17 deficit in respect of the Group, its employees and pensioners. In the context of the prudent funding structure 
of the Group, the Group is in a strong position to manage this long-term liability to the satisfaction and benefit of all stakeholders. 
The estimated amounts of deficit repair contributions expected to be paid to the scheme during the current financial year will be  
circa £12 million subject to the finalisation of the triennial actuarial valuation.

Capital gains Tax base cost of h ays Shares 
Following the demerger of DX Services on 1 November 2004,  
the original base cost of your Hays plc shares for Capital Gains Tax 
purposes should be allocated between your Hays plc shares and 
the DX Services plc shares that you received as follows: 
Hays plc shares 89.57%/DX Services plc shares 10.43%. 
For example, suppose you held 100 Hays plc shares for which  
the base cost is £100. Immediately after the demerger, you held 
100 Hays plc shares and 5 DX Services plc shares. The £100 cost 
should be allocated between these shares as follows: 
Hays plc shares 89.57% x £100 = £89.57, or £0.90 per share  
DX Services plc shares 10.43%x £100 = £10.43, or £2.09 per share 
If you are in any doubt about the allocation of the base cost 
between the shares of the two companies, you should consult 
your tax advisor.

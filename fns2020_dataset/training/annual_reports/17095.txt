restaurants 4 Annual Report 2009/10
When I wrote to you at this time last 
year we were all facing a period of 
unprecedented economic turmoil. 
As I said at the time, Whitbread 
had already taken action to prepare 
itself for a downturn and we entered 
2009/10 with a robust balance 
sheet, market-leading brands 
in value for money sectors and 
proven operational expertise. That 
preparation stood us in good stead. 
During 2009/10 Premier Inn took 
action to reinforce its value for 
money credentials and to attract 
more leisure customers against 
the backdrop of a falling hotels 
market. This delivered beneficial 
results, particularly in the second 
half of the year. Our restaurants 
also focused on more value for 
money offers which contributed 
to improved performance. Costa 
had a very successful year with 
strong marketing activity and 
the introduction of new products 
including Flat White coffee.
Whitbread has come through a 
difficult economic period very 
creditably. It is trading well and has 
opportunities for growth, both in the 
UK and internationally. Revenues at 
our Hotels and Restaurants business 
increased by 3.2% ending the year 
on an improving trend. Revenues 
at Costa increased by 23.4% – an 
excellent performance. Premier Inn 
grew, as planned, by over 2,200 rooms 
while also securing land for future 
development. We added five new 
pub restaurants and over 300 new 
coffee shops.
Our increased focus on cash 
management and continuing cost 
reduction programmes were key 
Sir Michael Angus
It is with great sadness that I report that Sir Michael 
Angus, who was a director of Whitbread from 1986 
to 2000 and Chairman for the last eight of those 
years, died on 13 March 2010. Sir Michael was a highly 
respected businessman and his experience in many 
roles, but principally as Chief Executive of Unilever, 
was invaluable to the Company. Having worked with 
Sir Michael as a fellow non-executive director at 
another company I saw at first hand his fast mind 
and quick wit. He will be sorely missed.
Chairman’s statement
Whitbread has come through a difficult economic 
period very creditably. It is trading well and has 
opportunities for growth, both in the UK and 
internationally. 
Anthony Habgood 
Chairman, Whitbread PLC 5
http:/ /annualreport.whitbread.co.uk
to our success in the year and the 
Company has ended the period 
with a positive cash flow of nearly 
£110 million – exceeding our target 
for cash neutrality.
We believe that 2010/11 will 
continue to be a difficult economic 
environment for our customers and 
we will therefore remain focused 
on prudent and tight management. 
Growth remains a priority and, in 
the short term, this will be on a 
measured basis until we see more 
sustained signs of recovery.
Chief Executive succession
On 3 March 2010, we announced that 
Alan Parker has decided to retire on 
25 November 2010, his 64th birthday. 
Alan has made an invaluable 
contribution to the growth and 
development of Whitbread during 
his six years as Chief Executive. 
Under his leadership Whitbread has 
grown to become the UK’s leading 
hospitality company with a strong 
focus on value for money brands.
In anticipation of Alan’s retirement, 
the non-executive directors under 
my chairmanship, began the search 
for his successor. We conducted a 
thorough international search and 
selection process, the details of which 
can be found on page 45, and had a 
number of high quality candidates. 
The result of this process was that 
we decided to appoint Andy Harrison 
to succeed Alan. Andy is currently 
Chief Executive at easyJet PLC, 
which he joined in 2005, having 
previously spent nine years as Chief 
Executive of RAC PLC. He will join 
us on 1 September and take over 
from Alan as Chief Executive in 
late November.
We are delighted with this 
appointment. Andy has 14 years’ 
proven experience as a successful 
leader of two significant consumer-
facing and service oriented public 
listed companies. Most recently, at 
easyJet, he has successfully led and 
profitably internationalised a leading 
value for money brand in a highly 
competitive market. Whitbread has 
opportunities for growth, both in 
the UK and through developing our 
international presence. We believe 
that Andy’s skills and experience 
are ideally suited to lead Whitbread 
and to take advantage of these 
opportunities.
Dividend
The Board recommends a final 
dividend of 28.35p per share, 
making a total dividend for the 
year of 38.00p per share, up by 4%. 
The final dividend will be paid on 
14 July 2010 to shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 
14 May 2010. Once again, a scrip 
dividend alternative will be offered 
and further information on how 
shareholders can elect to participate 
in the scrip dividend scheme are 
available from the registrars or 
on the Company’s website.
Board 
Charles Gurassa stepped down 
from the Board in September 
2009 having served for nine years 
as an independent non-executive 
director and for much of that time 
as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee. I would like to thank 
Charles for his significant input to the 
Board. He was a major contributor 
at an extraordinarily important time 
as Whitbread evolved into a focused 
hotel and restaurant company.
Also in September 2009, Richard 
Baker joined the Board as an 
independent non-executive director. 
Richard was Chief Executive of 
Alliance Boots from 2003 until 2007 
having led the merger of the Boots 
Group and Alliance Unichem in 
2005. Before that time Richard held 
a number of roles, including Chief 
Operating Officer at Asda. He is 
currently Chairman of Virgin Active 
and Groupe Aeroplan Europe as 
well as being an Operating Partner 
of Advent International. We are 
delighted to welcome Richard to 
our Board. His wealth of experience 
in consumer-facing industries, as 
well as at senior Board level, will 
be a great asset to Whitbread.
Our people
Being a truly customer focused 
organisation requires our people 
to make everyday experiences 
feel special to our customers. All 
our employees are extraordinarily 
committed to providing excellent 
service and I would like to thank 
them on behalf of the Board for 
their efforts over the past year.
Anthony Habgood
Chairman
28 April 2010
Andy Harrison, Chief Executive Designate
I am delighted that Andy Harrison 
will be joining us to succeed 
Alan Parker on his retirement 
in November. Andy’s skills and 
experience are ideally suited 
to build on Alan’s successful 
management of the Company 
and to take advantage of our 
growth opportunities. 6 Annual Report 2009/10
Whitbread has performed strongly 
in the most challenging hotel and 
restaurant trading conditions for 
a generation. Underlying profits 
have been increased by virtue of 
outperforming our markets and 
improving operating efficiency. 
We have achieved a significant 
reduction in net debt while, at the 
same time, increasing the number 
of new sites acquired for our future 
development. 
Group underlying profit before tax 
increased by 6.6% to £239.1 million 
(2008/09: £224.4 million), with 
underlying earnings per share 
(diluted) increasing by 6.7% to 
96.7p. We achieved our three stated 
priorities: to outperform the market; 
to reduce operating costs; and to 
achieve cash flow neutrality. 
Group revenue grew year on year 
by 7.5% to £1,435.0 million, driven 
by the growth in the number of 
hotels, restaurants and coffee shops 
despite a modest decline in like for 
like sales of 0.5%. At Premier Inn, 
sales rose 4.7%, with like for like 
sales declining 4.3%. Sales at our 
restaurants rose 1.3%, with like for 
like sales up 1.7%. At Costa, sales 
increased by 23.4%, with like for like 
sales up 5.5%. 
Trading in the first half of the year 
was impacted by the challenging 
operational environment, but this 
improved in the second half. In 
the last quarter of 2009/10 all our 
businesses demonstrated positive 
momentum with Group like for like 
sales growth of 3.1%.
Alan Parker, CBE
 Chief Executive, Whitbread PLC
The fundamentals of 
Whitbread are strong and 
provide a firm foundation 
for sustained profitable 
growth in both the short 
and medium term.
Chief Executive
Whitbread outperformed its markets and 
increased profits in 2009/10, despite the

Business review –  7
http:/ /annualreport.whitbread.co.uk
At the year end, net debt was 
reduced by £109.7 million to £513.4 
million compared to £623.1 million 
last year. 
The Board recommends a final 
dividend payment of 28.35p per 
share, making a total dividend for 
the year of 38.0p per share. The 
final dividend will be paid on 14 July 
2010 to shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 14 May 
2010. A scrip dividend alternative 
will again be offered.
Successfully achieving our three 
key priorities
Whitbread is a focused hospitality 
company with brand leadership in 
attractive, value for money sectors. 
In 2009/10 we set out a clear 
action plan with three priorities 
to manage through the downturn. 
We have successfully achieved all 
these priorities and have become 
a stronger, more competitive and 
efficient business.
1. Outperforming the market
Premier Inn outperformed its 
competitors during 2009/10. Regional 
revpar was down 6.4% during the 
year, compared to a decline of 8.5% in 
the regional budget hotel sector and 
a decline of 9.6% across the whole 
regional hotel market. We set out a 
commercial action plan to reinforce 
our status as the preferred hotel 
brand for corporate travellers and to 
attract more leisure customers. We 
are pleased to report good progress 
on all fronts. 
Our restaurants have continued 
to achieve like for like growth, 
consistently outperforming the 
market. Customers have been 
attracted to the great value for 
money food and drink, offered in 
well-maintained environments.
Costa has seen 32 consecutive 
quarters of like for like sales growth. 
Costa achieved a 59.5% increase in 
pre exceptional operating profit in 
2009/10 and grew like for like sales 
by 5.5%. The key drivers behind this 
outstanding performance are Costa’s 
clear position as the coffee lovers’ 
preferred brand and our continued 
expansion in the UK and overseas. 
2. Reducing operating costs
We have reduced overheads 
by streamlining management, 
improving the efficiency of 
our back-office processes and 
delivering a series of procurement 
initiatives. As we expand our 
outlet numbers, we have been able 
to offer over 1,200 new jobs for 
frontline employees.
3. Achieving cash flow neutrality
We have exceeded our cash 
flow targets by £109.7 million. 
Tight management of working 
capital, lower capital spend and 
rescheduled payments to the 
pension fund have all contributed 
to the improved position. Net 
debt at the year end has therefore 
reduced to £513.4 million (2008/09: 
£623.1 million). The Group’s total 
debt facilities currently stand at 
£1,155 million and provide ample 
headroom for the future. 
 
Looking ahead: building market share 
Growth from a relentless focus on 
our customers 
• Premier Inn – growing like for like 
occupancy back to 80%. 
• Restaurants – driving a value 
strategy to gain volume.
• Costa – market innovation to 
strengthen leading position.
Improving momentum during the year 
was seen from our engines of growth: 
Premier Inn, with its restaurant joint 
site model; and Costa, the great 
food and beverage success story, 
both at home and internationally. 
There are significant further growth 
opportunities across all our brands 
by building brand preference and 
from outlet expansion. We will 
leverage these opportunities using 
a sophisticated approach towards 
understanding our customers. 
In 2009/10 we set out a commercial 
action plan for Hotels and Restaurants, 
to build on our competitive edge for 
the business market and to attract 
more leisure customers. We put 
in place four key levers: focused 
advertising; increased sales activity; 
Premier Offers; and widening 
reservation distribution. This work will 
continue during the course of 2010/11 
as we make an additional £8 million 
marketing investment and realise the 
full benefits of dynamic pricing. 
Our value for money restaurants 
have never been more relevant to 
today’s family dining needs. Our well 
established meal deal offers, such as 
two meals for £9 at Brewers Fayre, 
have achieved significant success and 
now over a quarter of all diners take up 
these attractively priced menu options. 
One of our new 
solus sites on 
Citadel Way in Hull 8 Annual Report 2009/10
At Costa, our fundamental 
proposition is the quality of our hand 
made coffee, served in a welcoming 
environment. A strong driver of 
success was our breakthrough 
marketing campaign derived from 
independent customer research 
showing 7 out of 10 coffee lovers 
preferred Costa’s cappuccino. Costa 
also used its understanding of 
customer preference to introduce 
the new Flat White coffee, which 
has been an excellent contributor to 
incremental sales since its launch in 
January 2010. At the start of the new 
financial year Costa launched a new 
points-based loyalty card which has 
exceeded initial targets.
Expanding our network
We have clear short and medium 
term growth plans:
• Premier Inn to increase room 
numbers in 2010/11 by over 2,500 
rooms (+6%) and target a 32% 
increase to 55,000 rooms in the 
UK by the end of 2014/15, as well 
as international expansion; and
• Costa to increase store numbers 
in 2010/11 by net 250 stores 
(+16%) and target an 88% 
increase to 3,000 stores by 
2014/15, maintaining market 
leadership in the UK and building 
five key overseas businesses; in 
China, India, Russia, the Middle 
East and Central Europe.
We benefit from our robust balance 
sheet and strong freehold asset 
base. We have grown our secured 
future pipeline of hotel sites to 
10,000 rooms by taking advantage 
of the reduced property market 
prices.
This pipeline underpins our stated 
strategy to expand Premier Inn to 
55,000 rooms in the UK by the end 
of 2014. In 2010/11 the target opening 
schedule is 29 new Premier Inns 
(over 2,500 rooms), which include 
ten new restaurants on joint sites. 
Costa is the UK’s largest coffee shop 
brand, and has grown to become 
the second largest international 
coffee shop business with 1,600 
stores worldwide. In the UK, we 
plan to open around 130 stores 
during 2010/11. This growth includes 
opening in new high street locations, 
adding stores in established retail 
outlets, such as our partnership 
with Tesco, and bringing the 
Costa experience to hospitals 
and universities.
Our international business will 
be the focus of the next phase of 
Costa’s growth, boosted by the 
acquisition of Coffeeheaven. This 
transaction completed in the last 
quarter of 2009/10 and added 89 
new stores in the important Central 
European region. Costa plans to 
increase overseas outlet numbers 
by around 120 stores during 2010/11 
in the key target markets of China, 
India, Russia, the Middle East and 
Central Europe.
Good Together corporate 
responsibility programme
Whitbread has always put a high 
value on being a responsible 
business. In January 2010 we 
launched Good Together, the 
umbrella programme for company-
wide initiatives to drive sustainable 
performance and further deepen 
our corporate responsibility. We 
have set targets for CO
2
 reduction, 
sustainable sourcing and waste 
management. We will open the UK’s 
first totally new build green hotel and 
restaurant in the autumn. We have 
also reaffirmed our commitment to 
offer career enhancement to our 
people through apprenticeships and 
professional skills attainment. We 
aim to lead the hospitality sector 
towards a more sustainable way of 
working and create an important 
differentiator, valued by our 
customers, in the future. 
Current trading and outlook
We are confident we have the 
right hospitality brands, positioned 
to offer value for money in 
attractive, underpenetrated and 
growing segments of the market. 
The fundamentals of Whitbread 
are strong and provide a firm 
foundation for sustained profitable 
growth in both the short and 
medium term. This growth will be 
delivered through our expansion 
plans as well as by relentlessly 
focusing on meeting the needs of 
our customers. While the level of 
economic recovery remains unclear, 
the first seven weeks of the financial 
year have started well, with positive 
momentum across the business.
Leading Whitbread
As you know, I announced in March 
this year that I will retire from 
the Company in November 2010. 
When I became Chief Executive of 
Whitbread in June 2004, Whitbread 
was a very different company. We 
had ten businesses, including David 
Lloyd Leisure and a number of 
brands that we didn’t own such as 
T.G.I. Friday’s, Pizza Hut and Marriott.
Our customers can 
kick-start their day 
with one of our 
delicious breakfasts 
made from great 
quality ingredients 9
http:/ /annualreport.whitbread.co.uk
Six years on we are the UK’s 
largest hotel and restaurant group 
focused on our joint site Premier 
Inn and restaurant model and the 
extremely successful Costa brand. 
In 2004 we had 302 budget hotels 
under the Travel Inn name and less 
than 19,000 rooms. Today we have 
over 42,000 rooms in 588 Premier 
Inn hotels. The growth of Costa 
during the last six years has been 
exceptional and the 1,600 stores 
we have today compares to 346 
in 2004. Costa is now the largest 
coffee shop business in the UK and 
the second largest international 
coffee shop business.
Whilst continuing to expand our 
Premier Inn and Costa businesses 
in the UK, we have also started 
to exploit opportunities overseas. 
We now have hotels operating in 
the Middle East and India and Costa 
stores can be found in 24 different 
countries. I am very proud of the 
progress that has been made to 
make the Company what it is today.
I am delighted that we have 
been able to deliver excellent 
results for our shareholders, with 
£2 billion returned to date, whilst 
transforming the Company. This 
would not have been possible 
without the fantastic support of 
Whitbread’s people. It has been a 
privilege to work alongside such 
a committed group of people 
throughout the organisation and 
I’d like to thank all of them for 
their continuing contribution to 
the Company.
When I retire, I will be handing 
over the reins to Andy Harrison. 
I was very pleased when Andy 
accepted the role and I am 
confident that he will be an 
outstanding Chief Executive for 
Whitbread. I would like to take 
this opportunity to wish Andy 
and everyone at Whitbread 
every success for the future. 
In the meantime, I am looking 
forward to the coming six months 
or so and to continuing the 
Whitbread Way Forward.

rooms to over 42,000 rooms (136%) 
demonstrates our commitment to 
this strategy. This is mirrored in the 
growth of Costa from 346 stores to 
1,600 (362%) in the same period. 
This is supported by our financial 
strength and the skills of our 
development and operating teams. 
We have continued to grow in the 
last two years, despite the more 
difficult economic conditions. 
We took the decision to reduce 
the number of hotel rooms being 
opened during the last year while 
we assessed the length and depth 
of the recession and its effect on 
the business. In the meantime we 
have been buying land ready for 
future development and we have a 
secured pipeline of 10,000 rooms. 
There is still room for significant 
growth in the UK for our hotels 
business with our current target 
of 55,000 Premier Inn rooms. This 
is supported by the projected 
growth in the total hotels market 
and our view of the potential of 
the budget hotel sector within that 
market. We have detailed analysis 
of every town in the UK which looks 
at the population in the area and 
the suitability for our brands. This 
analysis has also been carried out for 
our restaurants and coffee shops.
We have assessed overseas markets 
both for our ability to win, together 
with their growth prospects, and 
developed clear plans to work in 
those markets at the appropriate 
time.
In terms of the overseas development 
of our hotels, we will continue to 
concentrate on the Middle East and 
India in order to demonstrate the 
commercial and economic model 
and create value in those territories.
We are more advanced in coffee 
shops where Costa is already 
represented in 24 overseas countries. 
Costa’s international growth has been 
augmented by the Coffeeheaven 
acquisition in Central Europe.
Next year we plan to continue with 
our disciplined growth with 29 new 
hotels (2,500 rooms) and ten new 
pub restaurants. In Costa we plan  
to open 130 new stores in the UK 
and 120 overseas.
We continue to believe that our 
property ownership should be 
predominantly on a freehold basis, 
although it is possible that we may 
selectively use our property as an 
alternative source of funding for 
our pipeline of developments.
At present 84% of our Hotels and 
Restaurants estate is freehold, 
although this mix is changing as 
many of the new sites we have 
acquired are leasehold. During the 
year we undertook a small sale 
and leaseback of five properties 
which was very successful both in 
terms of investor interest and the 
price achieved (an initial yield of 
around 5.5%).
We believe that a key part of 
building and maintaining our 
leadership position, as well as the 
trust and loyalty of our customers, 
is corporate responsibility. For 
this reason we launched our Good 
Together programme in 2009.

our people
Our people are at the heart of our business. 
It is important that we provide them with 
the development opportunities to reach 
their full potential.
There is something very special 
about the people who work 
at Whitbread. We listen to our 
people, because they are best 
placed to understand what it is 
that our customers want. We want 
our people to flourish and it is 
important that we provide them 
with development opportunities so 
that they can reach their potential.
A culture of leadership 
In 2009 we made significant steps to 
define our culture more clearly, with 
a revitalised core purpose and set of 
values – the Whitbread Way Forward. 
This was defined using a series of 
workshops and interviews with a wide 
cross-section of Whitbread people. 
At the same time we refreshed 
the corporate identity to more 
appropriately represent Whitbread. 
A new Leadership Framework, 
which describes the skills 
expected from our leaders, was 
developed during the year. It has 
already become an important 
tool in supporting the process of 
leadership engagement behind 
our goal of customer focus. It 
has reinvigorated the leadership 
development agenda to engage 
our leaders in how we will lead 
the Whitbread Way Forward, and 
achieve stretching personal and 
team development. 
YOUR SAY
In 2009, Whitbread relaunched 
its engagement survey, YOUR SAY 
into the business. It accurately 
measures engagement, in a way 
that is meaningful to every person 
in the organisation and enables 
timely action.
The 2009 survey measured 
engagement through 18 questions, 
and provided a promising start. 
The results can be seen in the 
table below. All parts of the 
business outperformed the 
benchmark UK norm group. 
Following the publication of the 
results, action plans were developed 
and implemented.
2009/10 team engagement scores
Whitbread overall 60%
Whitbread Hotels 
and Restaurants 60%
Costa 61%
UK norm group 54%
In 2010 the survey has been 
expanded to help us understand 
how our teams view our new 
corporate responsibility strategy, 
Good Together, and their experience 
of customer focus in Whitbread.
In the future, employee engagement 
will be reported as part of the 
WINcard, demonstrating our 
genuine commitment to driving 
engagement.
Learning & Development
This year we launched our 
groundbreaking apprenticeship 
programme, which uniquely gives 
all of our team members within 
Whitbread Hotels and Restaurants 
the opportunity to gain a nationally 
recognised qualification in the 
workplace. The programme is a 
real demonstration of our strategic 
approach and commitment to 
having the best skilled team in 
the industry. 
Alongside the suite of vocational 
qualifications we also launched our 
Skills for Life programme, providing 
tutoring and support in the vital life 
areas of literacy and numeracy. To 
date we are proud to announce that 
over 1,400 qualifications have been 
awarded to our team members.
The Government inspectorate, 
Ofsted, has graded the hospitality 
and catering provision that is 
offered to our team members as 
“Outstanding”. Meanwhile the 
Skills for Life programme has 
been awarded the Business in 
the Community “Big Tick”.
We have successfully launched 
into the business a full suite 
of management development 
programmes called Shooting Stars. 
The objective of these programmes 
is to assist all our operational 
managers to develop to the next 
suitable role in their career with us. 
The programmes help us to develop 
people all the way from Hotels 
and Restaurants team member to 
Regional Operations Manager.

http:/ /annualreport.whitbread.co.uk
Over the past 18 months, over 
600 of our people have been, or 
currently are being, developed 
through these programmes. 
Whitbread Hotels and Restaurants 
appoint over 75% of General 
Managers internally.
In Costa we have relaunched our 
in-store induction and training 
processes. As coffee is at the 
heart of Costa’s business, we have 
developed the Barista Maestro 
workshop on coffee-making skills. 
Workshops are held at a number of 
Costa training academies around 
the world.
Costa has also developed the 
Shooting Stars programme. It has 
been operational within the Costa 
business since 2007 and comprises 
core skills development and training 
on management behaviours over a 
six-month period. 
In 2009 the next stage of 
development to enable Costa’s 
assistant managers to become store 
managers was launched. The Rising 
Stars programme follows a similar 
format to Shooting Stars and so far 
over 50% of attendees have been 
placed into a store manager role.

qualifications has opened my 
eyes to the opportunities within

Customer focus
Customer focus is about 
understanding our customers. It is 
about targeting specific customer 
segments and providing the products 
and services that people want at a 
price they are prepared to pay. 
We learn about our customers from 
talking to them directly and from 
listening to our people who serve 
them every day. We also look at our 
competitors to understand what 
they offer to their customers and 
what we might learn from them. 
Once we have that information we 
aim to get as much insight on our 
customers as we can and then use 
that to find ways in which to serve 
them even better.
This is all part of what we call our 
relentless focus on the customer.
Customer segmentation
During 2009/10 we embarked on 
customer segmentation projects 
across Whitbread. The initial phases 
of the segmentation work have 
been completed for Premier Inn and 
Costa, while the project for the pub 
restaurants is in progress. The aim 
was to define customer segments, 
establish the size of the opportunity 
and Whitbread’s share of each 
segment. This deep insight allows 
us to develop strategies to build on 
successes and to win new customers.
In Premier Inn we will give greater 
focus to new parts of the leisure and 
business markets. For example we 
will look at ways of attracting more 
‘retired sightseers’ and ‘short break 
travellers’ to stay with us. In Costa 
we will be looking for ways to meet 
the needs of the different customer 
groups identified – from the ‘grab 
and go commuters’ to those looking 
to spend more time relaxing with 
a coffee. By understanding our 
customers in this way we will be 
able to look after them better than 
ever before.
Committed to listening to customers
We hold regular customer focus 
groups to explore the thoughts and 
feelings of customers. We consider 
customer feedback in all decision 
making.
Premier Inn guest satisfaction 
programme
Key to delivering the Whitbread 
vision of being the most customer-
focused hospitality company in the 
world is ensuring that we accurately 
and robustly measure customer 
feedback. It is important that we 
always focus on what’s important to 
the customer at both a brand and 
outlet level.
The Premier Inn guest satisfaction 
programme e-mails approximately 
1.5 million customers within 24 
hours of their stay to ask them 
for their feedback. We receive 
a massive 500,000 responses 
every year, making the Premier Inn 
guest satisfaction programme one 
of the biggest and most robust 
programmes in Europe.

than anyone else will give us real

Premier Offers – inspired  
by our customers
A clear example of how Whitbread 
has used customer feedback to 
inform strategic decision making 
is ‘Premier Offers’.
Using the Premier Inn guest 
satisfaction survey we conducted 
a major research project to 
understand the needs of leisure 
users and price elasticity.
Since the launch of Premier Offers 
we have seen significant increases 
in weekend occupancy and a huge 
improvement on customer value for 
money scores.
Costa customer satisfaction
Costa uses independent market 
research agency, YouGov, to 
deliver robust feedback from 
our customers. In addition 
Costa obtains insight from key 
competitors in order to provide 
benchmarking data.
Costa has significantly improved its 
customer scores achieving a score 
of 73% for overall satisfaction. The 
results of this study help to inform 
strategic decisions and marketing 
campaigns such as the successful 
‘7 out of 10’ campaign.
Brand standards – 
Hotels and Restaurants 
Whitbread Hotels and Restaurants 
use an independent audit company, 
‘Hospitality Now’, to measure 
compliance to brand standards. 
Every site is audited at least twice 
per year using a 1,000 question audit 
to keep us delivering a consistent 
product to all our customers on 
every visit.
Brand standards – Costa 
Costa uses customer satisfaction 
data to identify what is really 
important to the customer and, 
from this, has developed a robust 
set of standards which can be 
measured to track operational 
performance. This is achieved 
through a mystery customer 
programme which is conducted 
by independent agency, Re Act, 
together with our brand standards 
audit, which is completed by our 
internal team of auditors. Over the 
past year Costa has completed over 
9,000 mystery customer visits and 
brand standards audits, with stores 
receiving a minimum of one visit 
per quarter.

Premier Inn is the leading choice 
brand among business travellers 
and, for the third year running, 
won Best Hotel Group Brand at the 
Business Travel Awards. Business 
guests can save over £33 per 
night compared to 3 and 4 star 
hotels and we attracted over 20 
large corporate customers such as 
E.On, Honda, Lidl and some central 
Government departments to switch 
to Premier Inn during the year. 
Increased sales activity helped to 
grow business accounts with users 
up 13% on last year. Sales grew by 
2.6% to £175.4 million. 
In 2009/10, Premier Inn opened 
2,240 new rooms (UK 1,624 rooms) 
and refurbished over 8,000 rooms. 
At the year end Premier Inn had a 
total of 42,799 rooms in 588 hotels 
(UK 41,720 rooms).  
Eleven new Premier Inns were 
opened in regional locations and 
one new hotel in London, where 
Premier Inn has maintained its 
position as London’s leading 
budget hotel operator. We have 
commenced development of a 
new 267 bedroom budget hotel at 
Stratford, located adjacent to the 
Olympic Stadium, creating some 
90 jobs. 
Premier Inn also announced its 
first purpose built green hotel 
and Beefeater Grill restaurant. 
It represents the latest stage in 
sustainable technology and follows 
our pioneering green hotel pilot 
in Tamworth, Staffordshire, which 
opened its doors to guests in 
December 2008. The 60 bedroom 
Premier Inn at Burgess Hill, due to 
open in autumn 2010, will adopt 
the best performing sustainable 
construction materials to deliver 
70% carbon and 60% water savings.
Our continuous focus on tight cost 
control, through both procurement 
and operating efficiencies, has helped 
underpin our operating margin.
Internationally, we opened three 
new hotels this year across the 
UAE and India. We acquired the 
50.1% stake we did not already own 
in the Indian joint venture with real 
estate developer Emaar-MGF and 
will take forward the development 
of new properties independently.
Our restaurants continued to 
outperform the market as we 
attracted customers looking 
for great value food and drink 
in a comfortable environment. 
We refurbished 95 restaurants, 
spending on average £125,000 
per site, to ensure a quality 
environment with value for money 
at the heart of everything we do. 
Our restaurants increased customer 
recommendation metrics by 5.6%.  
Revenues have increased by 
1.3% to £466.2 million (2008/09: 
£460.1 million). Our restaurants 
achieved consistent like for like 
sales growth of 1.7%, driven by 
increases in average spend and like 
for like covers increase of 1.4%.
In 2009/10 we opened five new 
restaurants. Some 333 of our 373 
strong restaurant portfolio are 
located adjacent to a Premier Inn. 
This joint-site strategy enables 
us to deliver a superior customer 
experience and generate enhanced 
return on capital.

Markets and competition 
Premier Inn’s 42,000 rooms account 
for 6% of the total UK hotel market. 
Today four brands account for 80% 
of the budget sector of the market. 
The sector has strong long-term 
growth prospects with projected 
compound annual growth rate of 
approximately 10% over the next 
ten years. 
The total UK hotel market has an 
annual value of around £10.9 billion, 
of which approximately £1.6 billion 
can be attributed to the budget 
sector. In 2009/10, Premier Inn 
outperformed the budget sector 
in terms of regional RevPAR by
2.1% points.
Whitbread’s pub restaurants 
compete in the total out-of-home 
eating market of £40 billion. 
Whitbread has outperformed the 
pub restaurant sector of the market 
over the last two years in terms 
of like-for-like sales.
 
Our people
We are dependent on our people 
to deliver our brand promises, 
day in and day out. We offer every 
team member the chance to work 
towards NVQs and Skills for Life. 
In 2009 Whitbread achieved 
an ‘Outstanding’ grade for our 
Apprenticeship training programme 
following an inspection by Ofsted. 
This year we will help our people 
gain over 3,000 new qualifications.
We have continued to be recognised 
for quality and value. Premier 
Inn has been named the leading 
economy hotel brand in Europe for 
the second year running. Premier 
Inn also scooped the Business Travel 
Awards Best Hotel Group for the 
third year running.
This is an excellent achievement 
for the Premier Inn brand and is a 
testament to the hard work and 
dedication of our team members.

Corporate responsibility
We promise our guests a good 
night’s sleep. Our people serve 
great value food and drink in clean, 
comfortable and well looked after 
environments. We intend to deliver 
this in a sustainable manner. Key 
areas of progress for the Hotels 
and Restaurants team have been:
• We will open our first 
purpose-built green hotel and 
Beefeater Grill at Burgess Hill, 
in West Sussex. This follows 
Whitbread’s pioneering green 
hotel pilot project in Tamworth, 
Staffordshire. The 60-bedroom 
Premier Inn at Burgess Hill, due to 
open in the autumn of 2010, will 
adopt the best-performing green 
technologies from our test in 
Tamworth, targeting 70% carbon 
and 60% water savings. Adjacent 
to the hotel, we will develop our 
first low-carbon restaurant, a 
220-cover Beefeater Grill; 
• In 2009/10 we rolled out an 
Environment and Energy Guide 
to all outlets. Our teams now 
have information and tools to 
help reduce energy and water 
wastage. Teams at our support 
centres can also see how their 
efforts can make a difference 
with energy monitors located 
in reception areas; 
• We have been working in 
partnership with our waste 
management providers Veolia, 
and with Biogen, towards our 
target of achieving 80% of waste 
diverted from landfill by 2012;
• We are very proud of our 
commitment to the communities 
where we live and work. We 
have raised over £300,000 for 
WaterAid during 2009/10, a 
good start towards our £1 million 
target; and
• We offer development 
opportunities for our team 
members as described on 
pages 12 and 13.
 
Risks and uncertainties
Details of the risks and uncertainties 
for the Group are outlined on pages 
34 and 35. Many of the risks and 
uncertainties at Group level are also 
applicable to Whitbread Hotels and 
Restaurants. 
Risks specific to the hotels and 
restaurants business include:
• the integrity of booking channels 
and other key systems;
• the failure to deliver rooms 
growth profitably; 
• the failure to deliver market 
leading performance;
• the failure to attract and maintain 
high calibre teams;
• the failure of health and safety 
policies and procedures;
• the inability to achieve profitable 
international growth; and
• the potential financial failure of 
a key third party supplier.
Mitigation plans are in place for 
each of the risks and uncertainties 
outlined above and are reviewed 
by the Whitbread Hotels and 
Restaurants Management Board 
on a quarterly basis. The potential 
failure of a key third party supplier 
has been a particular focus during 
the year due to the general 
economic conditions.

23 24 Annual Report 2009/10
2009/10 was an outstanding 
year for Costa. Pre exceptional 
operating profit grew by 59.5% to 
£36.2 million; 312 net new stores 
were acquired or opened; like for 
like sales increased by 5.5%; and 
our international business became 
profitable. 
Costa also made its first acquisition, 
Coffeeheaven, with stores in 
Poland and other Central European 
countries. Costa operates in 25 
countries and is now the number 
two international coffee shop 
operator with 1,600 stores: 1,069 
in the UK; and 531 overseas.
In addition to the 89 Coffeeheaven 
stores acquired at the end of the 
year, Costa opened 223 net new 
units in 2009/10. Of these, 188 were 
in the UK, further demonstrating 
that the brand’s domestic market 
is far from saturated. Sales 
performance improved strongly 
across the year, confirming the 
brand’s resilience, even in a 
recessionary environment.
Our international business became 
profitable in the year, despite 
continued investments in China 
and Russia. This reflected a strong 
contribution from our franchise 
businesses and continued progress 
in the joint ventures. 
 
Costa’s commitment to delivering 
an unbeatable coffee experience 
gained momentum with three 
significant initiatives: 
• Our ‘7 out of 10’ campaign 
emphasised how consumers 
are discerning in their coffee 
choice. The campaign played 
a central role in enhancing like 
for like sales which grew, almost 
entirely, as a consequence of 
more customer visits;
• The addition of Costa’s new Flat 
White coffee added another 
option for coffee lovers, with over 
a million Flat Whites sold since the 
launch at the end of January; and
• Costa launched the sector’s 
first electronic loyalty scheme 
and customer database. The 
Costa Coffee Club card enables

performance during the year.

customers to earn points with 
every purchase at Costa. In the 
first month since its introduction 
on 4 March this year, well over one 
million cards have been used by 
Costa customers.
During 2009/10 Costa demonstrated 
outstanding growth momentum, 
forged even stronger engagement 
with its customers and set the 
platform for growth.
Three key themes
Outstanding, consistent growth 
trends – in both sales and number 
of units;
Strong, customer-driven market 
position – a compelling proposition 
and robust business model; and
Significant future growth potential 
– in the UK and overseas.
Corporate responsibility
The key elements of the Costa 
corporate responsibility agenda are:
• our coffee which will be sourced 
entirely from Rainforest Alliance 
accredited farms;
• our milk which we can trace 
100% to a single UK supplier 
based in the south-west and is 
delivered in lightweight plastic 
pouches, which significantly 
reduce waste; and
• our new, more environmentally-
friendly, takeaway cup.
We are also very proud of the 
Costa Foundation which was set 
up to fund the building of schools 
in coffee-growing regions. More 
details and case studies are on the 
Good Together website (see pages 
30 to 31).

Markets and competition
It is estimated that there are around 
9,400 coffee shops in the UK, with 
4,000 of these being branded coffee 
shops. The growth projection for this 
market is around 8%. Costa is well 
positioned with 1,000 stores and we 
plan to double in size in the UK. This 
is a very competitive market which 
Costa leads in terms of numbers of 
stores, superior coffee and service.
Overseas, Costa is focused on large 
and fast growing regions such as 
China, India, Russia, Central Europe 
and the Middle East, where it sees 
significant potential for the brand.
Our people
The very successful year Costa has 
had reflects the excellent teams in 
its stores. Our very low employee 
turnover is good evidence of the 
strength of those teams which 
is backed up by the training 
academies which focus on the 
importance of coffee making skills.
Risks and uncertainties
Many of the risks and uncertainties 
at Group level are also applicable to 
Costa. Some more specific risks are: 
failure to achieve growth targets; 
failure of a franchise, joint venture 
partner or third party supplier; 
failure of a significant health and 
safety procedure; and interruption 
of production at the Costa roastery.

Results
Last year we introduced an underlying 
profit measure on the face of the 
consolidated income statement. 
The directors believe that this 
measure provides useful information 
for shareholders on the underlying 
trends and performance of the 
Group as it excludes exceptional 
items and the impact of volatile 
financial costs under IAS 19.
Underlying profit for the year is 
£239.1 million, up 6.6% on the prior 
year and underlying diluted earnings 
per share 96.7p (2008/09: 90.7p). 
Total profit for the year is 
£160.0 million which compares 
to £90.3 million last year.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are analysed in 
more detail in note 6. The principal 
items are the final costs of the 
£25 million cost reduction programme 
announced in 2008 amounting to 
£9.9 million, a net impairment charge 
of £1.5 million and a provision of 
£21.2 million for lease reversions offset 
by profits arising from the disposal 
of a number of properties (primarily 
relating to the sale and leaseback 
transaction) announced earlier in 
the year of £14.6 million. The lease 
reversions are largely in respect of 
the expected cost of leases arising 
as a result of the administration of 
First Quench Retailing Limited on 
29 October 2009, a company to 
which the Group had previously 
transferred a significant number of 
leasehold properties. A provision has 
been made for the costs we will incur 
on approximately 130 properties until 
the leases expire or are reassigned. 
Interest
The underlying interest charge is 
£25.7 million, a reduction of 16.0% 
on the previous year, reflecting lower 
interest rates that the Group has 
been charged during the year.
The total pre exceptional interest cost 
amounted to £41.2 million. Included 
within this figure is an IAS 19 pension 
charge of £15.5 million (2008/9 
pension credit of £5.5 million). This 
charge represents the difference 
between the expected return on 
scheme assets and the interest cost 
of the scheme liabilities. In 2010/11 
this is expected to be a pension 
charge of £11.5 million.
Tax 
An underlying tax expense of 
£71.1 million represents an effective 
tax rate of 29.8% on the underlying 
profits, which compares with 
30.3% last year. The year on year 
movement has been predominantly 
Christopher Rogers,  
Finance Director
Business review –  29
http:/ /annualreport.whitbread.co.uk
driven by the impact of the rising 
share price on the tax associated 
with share-based payments.
An exceptional tax credit of 
£16.8 million occurred during the 
year as a result of a reduction of 
the deferred tax liability on rolled 
over gains. 
Earnings per share
Diluted underlying earnings per 
share increased by 6.7% to 96.7p.

Details can be found in note 11.
Dividend
A final dividend of 28.35p will, 
subject to approval at the AGM, be 
paid on 14 July 2010 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of 
business on 14 May 2010. The total 
dividend for the year at 38.0p is up 
by 4.0%. A scrip dividend alternative 
will again be offered.
Net debt and cash flow
During the year there was a 
cash flow inflow of £109.7 million 
reducing year end net debt 
to £513.4 million (2008/09 
£623.1 million). The principal 
movements were:

Net debt cfwd (513.4) (623.1)
The improvement in cash generated 
from operations was as a result 
of increased profitability and an 
£18 million improvement in working 
capital. The disposal proceeds 
relate to a sale and leaseback of five 
properties undertaken in December 
2009, plus proceeds from the sale of 
a number of standalone restaurants.
The weighted average net debt 
in the year was £569.2 million 
compared to £531.0 million last year. 
As at 4 March 2010 the Group had 
committed revolving credit facilities 
of £1,155 million. The facilities reduce 
to £930 million in December 2010, 
£855 million in December 2011 and 
£455 million in December 2012 
with the remaining facility maturing 
in March 2013. In 2010, subject to 
market conditions, we will begin to 
diversify our sources of financing.
The policy of the Board is to 
manage its financial position 
and capital structure in a manner 
which is consistent with Whitbread 
maintaining its investment 
grade status. 
Capital expenditure and 
business acquisitions
Total Group cash capital expenditure 
during the year was £131.7 million 
with Hotels and Restaurants 
spend amounting to £111.6 million, 
Costa £15.2 million and Corporate 
£4.9 million. Capital expenditure 
on the businesses is split between 
acquisition expenditure, which 
includes the acquisition and 
development of properties 
(£65 million) and maintenance 
expenditure (£61 million). In addition 
£38.8 million (net of cash acquired) 
was spent on business acquisitions, 
including the acquisition of 
Coffeeheaven, and £3.2 million 
on international investments. This 
brings the total cash outflow on 
capital expenditure and business 
acquisitions, including the purchase 
of intangible assets, to £173.7 million.
Pensions
As at 4 March 2010 there was 
an IAS 19 pension deficit of 
£434.0 million, (£341.0 million 
after tax) which compares to 
£233.0 million (£167.8 million 
after tax) as at 26 February 2009.
During the year the Group entered 
into a transaction with Whitbread 
Pension Trustees described in further 
detail in note 32.
In summary, the Group contributed 
£102 million to the Pension Fund 
which was then invested by 
Whitbread Pension Trustee into 
a newly formed partnership within 
the Group, Moorgate Scottish 
Limited Partnership (“Moorgate”). 
Moorgate used this investment 
from the Pension Fund together 
with further investments from 
other Whitbread Group companies 
to invest in a second partnership, 
Farringdon Scottish Partnership 
(“Farringdon”) in which another 
Whitbread Group company also 
invested. Farringdon used the funds 
to acquire a number of hotels and 
restaurants from Group subsidiaries 
for around £221 million. These 
properties were leased back to the 
selling subsidiary and continue to be 
operated by that Group company. 
The assets and activities of the 
partnerships will be consolidated 
within the Group accounts of 
Whitbread PLC by virtue of the 
Group’s interest in the controlling 
general partner of Moorgate and 
its interest in Farringdon.
The Pension Fund has received 
benefit through its interest in 
Moorgate as it now holds security 
over property and other assets 
as noted above. In addition, the 
Pension Fund will receive an annual 
payment for the duration of the 
lease arrangements, expected to 
be 15 years, being its share of the 
profits from its interest in Moorgate. 
This arrangement has replaced the 
previous charge over certain assets 
given to the Pension Fund prior to 
entering into the above transaction. 
At the end of these arrangements 
if there is a pension deficit, the 
Pension Fund will receive a cash 
payment of the amount of the deficit 
up to a maximum of £109.95 million.
As a result of the above transaction, 
the Group has received a current 
tax credit of £28.6 million in 
respect of its £102 million funding 
of the Pension Fund. There is a 
corresponding deferred tax charge 
of £28.6 million reflecting the lower 
tax deductions now available in 
future periods from the Group’s 
funding of the deficit position.

We will be opening our first 
purpose-built joint ‘green hotel 
and restaurant’ site at Burgess Hill, 
West Sussex in autumn 2010.
In January 2010, Whitbread 
launched Good Together, an 
umbrella programme to improve 
sustainable performance and 
corporate responsibility. 
Customer research tells us that 
our customers really care about 
environmental and social issues 
even in these times of recession. On 
average, 65% of respondents across 
all our brands rated the issues as 
important. We recognise that we are 
at the start of an exciting journey 
and our ambition is to lead the 
hospitality sector in providing our 
customers with outstanding green 
products and services, without a 
significant price premium attached. 
Good Together strategy
We have focused our efforts on 
six important streams of activity, 
setting targets for achievement 
and behavioural change in each. 
These themes were identified by 
our customers, our teams and 
from market research as those 
that are most material to our 
business. They are: environment; 
employee engagement; sourcing 
of products and services; 
customer engagement; health; and 
community. Delivering against these 
six areas is an important part of 
Whitbread’s strategy.
We believe that Good Together is 
important in making Whitbread a 
business in which people will want 
to work, investors will want to invest 
and customers will be proud to visit 
and come back to again and again.
corporate responsibility
Whitbread has always put a high value on 
being a responsible business. Good Together 
is our way of uniting the power of our people, 
customers and suppliers. 
Business review –  31
http:/ /annualreport.whitbread.co.uk
Targets
We have set important initial targets 
as follows:
•  Reduce CO
2
 emissions from our 
operations by 26% by 2020;
•  Achieve 80% of waste diverted 
from landfill from Whitbread 
Hotels and Restaurants sites by 
February 2012;
•  100% of all Costa coffee 
production to be Rainforest 
Alliance certified by June 2010;
•  Launch a purpose-built ‘green 
hotel and restaurant’ at Burgess 
Hill, West Sussex (to open in 
autumn 2010) – as shown in the 
diagram on page 30;
•  Achieve 3,000 qualifications 
from the Hotels and Restaurants 
apprenticeship scheme and train 
four hundred Costa learners 
by the end of 2011;
•  Raise £1 million for WaterAid 
over two years; and
•  Enable 15,000 children to be 
educated as part of the Costa 
Foundation.
An integrated programme 
We are working to embed 
sustainability into everything we 
do to build even stronger brands, 
inspire and motivate our team 
members, delight our customers and 
ultimately make our business better 
prepared to deliver continued value 
to our shareholders. We know that, 
in an international organisation of 
over 33,000 people, this is a cultural 
and behavioural transition that will 
take time, but we have already taken 
some important steps forward. 
Communication and engagement
In October 2009, we started to 
communicate Good Together. Key 
elements of our communications 
plan included newsletters, intranet 
micro-site, line managers’ support 
packs and a Good Together launch 
week of activity during which team 
members made personal pledges. 
Driving and measuring performance
We have included a fourth 
stakeholder, called Good Together, 
on the WINcard. Now we measure 
and reward our people based partly 
on our success in reducing energy 
consumption.
WaterAid partnership
For team members one of the key 
motivators is their desire to raise 
money for both local and national 
charities. As a hospitality business 
we use a lot of water. We wanted 
to give back to those communities 
that go without the most basic 
requirements of life – safe water and 
sanitation. In June 2009 we joined 
forces with globally recognised 
charity, WaterAid. 
Costa Foundation
In 2006, we launched the Costa 
Foundation. This was the beginning 
of our journey in helping the coffee-
growers by raising money to build 
schools in their communities. 
Developing carbon and water 
efficient buildings
We will deliver carbon efficiency 
by incorporating retrofit measures 
across our estate and by opening 
new sustainable properties. In 2008, 
we built our first carbon and water 
efficient Premier Inn at Tamworth, 
which achieved an 86% reduction 
in carbon emissions and a 66% 
reduction in water usage versus 
a standard hotel of a similar size. 
We are now building a carbon and 
water-efficient hotel and restaurant 
in Burgess Hill which we will open 
in autumn 2010.
Achieving the Carbon Trust 
Standard
In December 2009 we were 
awarded the Carbon Trust Standard. 
This award requires organisations 
to measure, manage and reduce 
their carbon footprint and make 
reductions year on year. Between 
2007 and 2009 Whitbread achieved 
a 4% improvement in carbon 
efficiency, which is equivalent 
to saving 8,562 tonnes of CO
2
,
or taking 2,446 cars off the road.

in our Good Together report at

key performance indicators
We use a balanced scorecard, called the 
WINcard to measure our performance 
against key indicators.
Whitbread in numbers
The WINcard is our unique balanced 
scorecard. It drives high performance 
and maps our progress against the 
Whitbread Way Forward. Every 
leader in the business from the 
management teams in our Costa 
stores, restaurants and Premier 
Inns, to the Chief Executive has a 
WINcard which is relevant to their 
role and level of contribution. All 
team members in Whitbread can 
see their achievements and progress 
on a monthly basis wherever they 
work. The WINcard measures 
our performance around our key 
stakeholders: our customers, our 
people, our shareholders and a more 
recent stakeholder addition, our 
community which is better known 
as our ‘Good Together’ strategy. 
The WINcard aligns our day-to-day 
activities to the overall vision and 
strategy of the Company and helps 
us to measure our progress.
The WINcard has enabled a 
performance culture to thrive across 
all levels of the organisation and 
mobilises our people to act around 
shared goals. The WINcard measures 
are used as key indicators in 
personal development planning, for 
recognising excellent performance, 
in coaching and performance 
management, supporting talent 
management and succession 
planning. It is a core component of 
our incentive framework at all levels.
The WINcard educates, motivates 
and engages our leaders and 
teams across the business to 
focus, prioritise and deliver what
is required to achieve success.
WINcard results in 2009/10
The measures on the WINcard 
were updated in 2009/10 to include 
central costs and cash. The new 
measures replaced ROCE growth 
and brand expansion. These 
changes were made to reflect the 
Group’s new priorities in light of the 
general economic conditions. 
During the year, Whitbread 
achieved an ‘all green’ WINcard 
at Group level. This is an excellent 
result and means that we met or 
exceeded our targets on all key 
measures. Information on our 
achievements during the year and 
on our targets for the year ahead 
are set out in the table opposite. 
In addition, the WINcard results 
for Hotels and Restaurants and 
Costa are set out on pages 20 
and 26 respectively.
Changes for the year ahead
We have given careful consideration 
as to what the appropriate indicators 
should be going forward and to the 
setting of targets for the year ahead. 
A fundamental change of approach 
made following consultation with 
the Remuneration Committee was 
that the WINcard should have a 
longer-term perspective and should 
not be set with just the year ahead 
in mind. As such, provisional targets 
have been established for each 
of the WINcard measures for the 
next five years, with the overriding 
principle being one of continuous 
improvement. The targets for 
2010/11 are simply the first step. 
Targets will still be set annually, but 
with a longer-term perspective.
Health and safety has been a key 
measure on the WINcard since it 
was first established, and continues 
to be so. However, rather than being 
included simply as a bonusable 
measure, health and safety is now 
a hurdle and 20% of the total 
WINcard bonus payable will be lost 
if health and safety targets are not 
met. This further demonstrates the 
importance of health and safety 
to Whitbread and our ongoing 
commitment to looking after the 
welfare of our customers and 
employees.
As detailed on pages 30 and 31 
of this report, we have launched 
Good Together during the year. 
For 2010/11 we have added a new 
measure at Group level of electricity 
and carbon reduction. We have also 
replaced the team turnover measure 
with team engagement, which is 
described in more detail on page 
12. Another new measure is Premier 
Inn market performance, which 
measures Premier Inn’s RevPAR 
against the budget hotel sector.
The WINcard is 
designed to ensure 
that we are meeting 
our objectives to our 
stakeholder groups; 
investors, customers, 
our people; and 
community.

economic conditions.
Improved like for like sales

Both businesses achieved a green rating in 
2009/10. At Group level, the measure is a 
combination of the brand standards scores 
for both Costa and WHR.

businesses.

year, but did not reach the tough target  
and achieved an amber rating. At Group  
level, the combined results produced a  
green rating.
The target in all businesses  
has been increased for  
the year ahead.
People measures

Group risks and uncertainties
We have a clear method of managing key risks 
to the Company.
The Board, as well as the 
Whitbread Hotel and Restaurants 
and Costa management boards, 
regularly review key risks and the 
status of mitigation plans. The 
Audit Committee, on behalf of the 
Board, reviews this process on an 
annual basis with the internal and 
external auditors. This risk analysis 
is used to plan the operational 
audit’s activity and to highlight 
new areas for focus. 
The risks are categorised into the 
following areas:
Health, safety and security
With around nine million 
customers per month and 33,000 
employees it is vital that the 
Company focuses on their well-
being and safety. With this as a 
priority we have a well established 
Safety and Security team that 
works with our businesses to 
implement a rigorous health 
and safety programme. We 
commission CMi, an independent 
company, to carry out audits of all 
our outlets every year to measure 
their performance against set 
critical standards. All employees 
have health and safety on the 
WINcard and this influences the 
level of any bonus received in the 
year. Regular updates are given to 
the management boards and the 
Whitbread PLC Board.
During the year we were aware 
that the threat of a swine flu 
pandemic could severely affect our 
customers and employees. A task 
force was set up to update plans 
for this contingency, to monitor the 
issue within the Company and to 
set up communication channels. 
These plans remain in place in the 
event of any new threat of this kind.
Strategic business risks
All our businesses operate in a 
highly competitive environment 
which is significantly influenced 
by the UK economy.
As has been mentioned earlier in 
the report, the Company reacted 
to the recession by adopting a plan 
to outperform competitors, achieve 
cash neutrality and cut costs. The 
growth programme in the UK 
was slowed but advantage was 
taken of the fall in the property 
market to secure sites for future 
development.
The Company continued to review 
significant economic indicators 
as part of the business plan and 
budgeting process and to reflect 
them as appropriate. 
In terms of competitive activity, 
each of the businesses measures 
its performance against the closest 
competitors and the market as a 
whole. Actions to outperform the 
competition are developed on a 
strategic and tactical basis with 
success being monitored regularly. 
Significant customer research is 
carried out with the Premier Inn 
guest feedback form eliciting 
500,000 responses in the year. 
Each of the businesses carries out 
market research and analysis of 
consumer trends in the UK and 
overseas. This market information 
is reviewed by the Board and the 
management boards.
Financial loss
In a group the size of Whitbread 
there are a number of areas where 
there could be a significant financial 
loss if appropriate controls were 
not in place. Millions of pounds in 
cash are collected and transferred 
between bank accounts. The treasury 
policy sets the level of authority and 
segregation of duties which protect 
against such losses and PwC as 
operational auditor reviews these 
controls each year. The overseas 
businesses also have clear rules and 
policies over the operation of bank 
accounts and the transfer of funds.
Funding
The availability of funds from 
the Company’s banking facilities 
is important for the day to day 
running of the businesses as well as 
its growth. There are regular reviews 
of the level of funds available to the 
Group. Such reviews also check that 
the terms of the loan agreements 
are being complied with. The Board 
approves a funding policy by which 
the level and service of borrowings 
for the Group is set.
Market expectations
It is important that the market 
receives regular and accurate 
information concerning the Company 
and that the external expectations 
for the year are accurate.
There are a number of management 
processes designed to keep track 
of progress against internal targets 
and market expectations. Each part 
of the Group has an agreed budget. 
Monthly management reports are 
produced which are reviewed by 
the management boards, and the 
main Board.
Business review –  35
http:/ /annualreport.whitbread.co.uk
The market is kept informed 
through quarterly trading updates 
and the interim and full year 
financial statements.
Business continuity
It is crucial that we can continue 
to serve our customers with high 
quality products every day of the 
week. Our supply chain for food 
and drink along with key systems 
underlying the businesses are 
critical to that process.
To guard against the risk of failure in 
any of those suppliers or services we 
have developed contingency plans 
including sources of alternative 
supply and back up of information. 
Auditing and monitoring of suppliers 
also protects against this risk. There 
is a robust audit programme for our 
suppliers who have to pass exacting 
food safety and provenance pre-
qualification. Training programmes 
for our employees endeavour to 
ensure that the food and drink 
served is of the appropriate quality.
Counterparty and third party 
contract
The Group is party to a number of 
contracts which are important to 
the businesses. There is a continued 
risk that a counterparty fails to be 
able to fulfil its part of a contract. 
A current risk is the failure of a 
tenant of a lease to which a group 
company was originally a party. 
This could mean that the Group 
becomes liable once more to meet 
the obligations under the lease. 
This risk is carried by all companies 
selling leasehold interests, but is 
highlighted in times of economic 
downturn.
Credit control checks are carried 
out on parties to significant 
contracts along with continued 
auditing and monitoring of such 
contracts. Regular reviews are 
carried out on the potential for 
privity of contract claims and, when 
they are received, all efforts are 
made to lessen the financial liability 
through negotiation with the 
landlord or sale of the lease.
Customers/key relationships
None of the Group’s businesses 
are over-reliant on any particular 
customer or supplier. Key suppliers 
have been identified and mitigation 
plans have been put in place for 
the potential failure of those 
suppliers. Other key relationships 
include those with joint venture 
partners, franchise partners and 
the operators of restaurants on 
co-located sites.
Pensions
The Company has obligations in 
relation to the Whitbread defined 
benefit pensions scheme and any 
valuation deficit that arises. There 
is a clear risk that the deficit will 
increase and therefore involve the 
Company in having to make further 
contributions as part of the funding 
plan required by the Pensions 
Regulator. The scheme is now 
closed to new members and for 
future service to existing members. 
The Board receives regular reports 
from the pension trustee on its 
asset allocation and is consulted 
on changes to investment policy. 
The advisers to the Company work 
with those of the trustee to mitigate 
the risk.
International
As Costa operates in 24 overseas 
territories and Premier Inn is 
now establishing a presence in 
the Middle East and India there 
is a risk of a loss arising from a 
lack of controls. To counter this 
risk, a rigorous approval process 
and controls environment has 
been established and is reviewed 
by the operational audit team. 
Monthly updates are given to the 
management boards.
Reputational risk
A strong corporate reputation 
amongst our stakeholders is 
vital to the long term strength 
and resilience of our brands, our 
ability to attract and retain talent 
and investment, and our license 
to operate in new locations and 
markets. Effective risk management 
contributes to a positive reputation. 
However, we believe that this alone 
is no longer enough. It is important 
to understand and respond to the 
opportunities and risks presented 
by corporate responsibility and 
to engage our investors, our 
people and our customers on key 
sustainability issues. For this reason 
we launched our Good Together 
programme in 2009. To learn more 
about this initiative please visit 
our Good Together Report at 
http:/ /cr.whitbread.co.uk.
The workplace 
environment, 
particularly kitchens, 
can be dangerous 
without proper 
training. Ensuring 
the health and safety 
of our people and 
customers is a 
key priority 36 Annual Report 2009/10

Premier Inn operates one hotel in 
Ireland, one hotel in India and three 
hotels in Dubai via a joint venture.

shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 14 May 2010.

cumulative preference shares of 
1 penny each (representing 0.83% 
of the total share capital) and 
224 million C non-cumulative

Holders of ordinary shares are 
entitled to attend and speak at 
general meetings of the Company, 
to appoint one or more proxies and, 
if they are corporations, corporate

assets of the Company. Holders 
of ordinary shares are entitled 
to receive the Company’s annual

meeting of the Company, every 
holder of ordinary shares present 
in person or by proxy and entitled 
to vote has one vote and on a poll 
every member present in person 
or by proxy and entitled to vote 
has one vote for every ordinary 
share held. Voting rights for any 
ordinary shares held in treasury are 
suspended. None of the ordinary 
shares carry any special rights 
with regard to control of the 
Company. Electronic and paper 
proxy appointments and voting 
instructions must be received by the 
Company’s Registrars not later than

offer himself for reappointment  
by the shareholders.

Articles of Association
Any amendments to the Articles  
of Association of the Company  
may be made in accordance with 
the provisions of the Companies Act 
by way of special resolution.
Powers of the directors
The business of the Company is 
managed by the directors who  
may exercise all the powers of  
the Company, subject to the 
Company’s Memorandum and 
Articles of Association, any  
relevant legislation and any 
directions given by the Company 
by passing a special resolution at 
a general meeting. In particular, 
the directors may exercise all the 
powers of the Company to borrow 
money, issue shares, appoint and

and declare dividends.
Significant agreements
The Company’s facility  
agreements, details of which  
can be found in note 22 to the 
accounts, contain provisions

exercise termination or other  
rights in the event of a change

Contractual arrangements
The Group has contractual 
arrangements with numerous 
third parties in support of its 
business activities, none of 
which are considered individually 
to be essential to its business

considered necessary for an

performance or position of the 
Group’s business to disclose 
information about any of those 
third parties.

Information on the Company’s use 
of financial instruments, financial

Compensation for loss of office
There are no agreements between 
the Company and its directors 
or employees providing for 
compensation for loss of office or 
employment that occurs as a result 
of a takeover bid.
Supplier payment policy
The Company has no trade creditors 
(26 February 2009: nil). The Group 
keeps to the payment terms which 
have been agreed with suppliers. 
Where payment terms have not been 
specifically agreed, it is the Group’s 
policy to settle invoices close to 
the end of the month following the 
month of invoicing. The Group’s 
ability to keep to these terms is 
dependent upon suppliers sending 
accurate and adequately detailed 
invoices to the correct address on a 
timely basis. The Group had 48 days’ 
purchases outstanding at 4 March 
2010 (26 February 2009: 46 days), 
based on the trade creditors at that 
date and purchases made during 
the year.
Major interests
As at 28 April 2010, the Company 
had received formal notification, 
under the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules, of the following 
material holdings in its shares:
Charitable and political donations
No direct charitable donations 
have been made by the Company. 
The Whitbread Charitable Trust 
made donations totaling £41,872 
during the year. Costa Limited, a 
subsidiary of the Company, made a 
direct donation of £176,307 to the 
Costa Foundation. Further details 
about the Costa Foundation can be 
found on page 31. In addition, the 
Company organised and supported 
a number of charitable events and a 
number of its employees carried out 
charitable activities during working 
hours. The value of these activities 
has not been quantified.
The Company has not made any 
political donations during the  
year and intends to continue its 
policy of not doing so for the 
foreseeable future. 
Employment policies
Whitbread has a range of 
employment policies covering such 
issues as diversity, employee well-
being and equal opportunities. 
The Company takes its 
responsibilities to the disabled 
seriously and seeks not to 
discriminate against current or 
prospective employees because 
of any disability. Employees who 
become disabled during their career 
at Whitbread will be retained in 
employment wherever possible  
and given help with rehabilitation  
and training. 
Employee involvement
The importance of good relations 
and communications with 
employees is fundamental to 
the continued success of our 
business. Each of the Group’s 
operating businesses maintains 
employee relations and consults 
employees as appropriate to its 
own particular needs. Regular 
internal communications are made 
to all employees to ensure that 
they are kept well informed of the 
performance of the Group. Further 
information can be found on pages 
12 and 13.

Further details regarding the interests of the directors in the share capital 
of the Company, including with respect to options to acquire ordinary 
shares, are set out in the remuneration report. 42 Annual Report 2009/10
Purchase of own shares
The Company is authorised to 
purchase its own shares in the 
market. Approval to renew this 
authority for a further year will be 
sought from shareholders at the 
2010 AGM. 
The Company did not purchase 
any of its own shares during 
the year. 14.7 million shares 
(representing 7.8% of the total 
called up share capital at the 
beginning of the year) are held as 
treasury shares. This number has 
not changed throughout the year.
Auditor 
Ernst & Young LLP have expressed 
their willingness to continue in 
office as auditor of the Company 
and a resolution proposing their 
reappointment will be put to 
shareholders at the 2010 AGM. After 
proper consideration, the Audit 
Committee is satisfied that the 
Company’s auditor, Ernst & Young 
LLP, continues to be objective and 
independent of the Company. In 
coming to this conclusion, the Audit 
Committee gave full consideration 
to the non-audit work carried out 
by Ernst & Young LLP. 
The Audit Committee has 
considered what work should not 
be carried out by the external 
auditor and have concluded that 
certain services, including internal 
audit, acquisition due diligence and 
IT consulting services, will not be 
carried out by Ernst & Young LLP. 
Disclosure of information to auditor
The directors have taken all 
reasonable steps to make 
themselves aware of relevant 
audit information and to establish 
that the auditor is aware of that 
information. The directors are 
not aware of any relevant audit 
information which has not been 
disclosed to the auditor. 
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, 
together with the factors likely 
to effect its future development, 
performance and position are set 
out in the Business Review on pages 
6 to 35. The financial position of 
the Company, its cash flows, net 
debt and borrowing facilities and 
the maturity of those facilities are 
set out in the Finance Director’s 
report on pages 28 and 29. In 
addition there are further details 
in the financial statements on the 
Group’s financial risk management, 
objectives and policies (note 
25) and details of the financial 
instruments (note 26 and 27). 
The Group has considerable 
financial resources and, as a 
consequence, the directors believe 
that the Group is well placed to 
manage its business risks.
The directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company has 
adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Thus they 
continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM will be held at 2.00pm 
on 22 June 2010 at the Queen 
Elizabeth II Conference Centre, 
Broad Sanctuary, Westminster, 
London SW1P 3EE. The notice of 
meeting is enclosed with this report 
for those shareholders receiving 
hard copy documents, and available 
at www.whitbread.co.uk for those 
who elected to receive documents 
electronically. At the 2010 AGM, all 
voting will be by poll. Electronic 
handsets will be utilised and results 
will be displayed on the screen at 
the meeting.
By order of the Board.

http:/ /annualreport.whitbread.co.uk
At Whitbread, we believe that good 
corporate governance is essential 
protection for our shareholders. 
It is about ensuring that we run 
the Company with integrity and 
transparency. In this report Simon 
Barratt, General Counsel, explains 
how the main and supporting 
principles of the June 2008 
Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance (which is available at 
www.frc.org.uk) are being applied.
Did Whitbread comply with the 
Combined Code?
During the year the Company 
complied with all provisions set out 
in Section 1 of the Combined Code 
with the exception of A.4.1, which 
deals with the membership of the 
Nomination Comittee. The Board 
believes that the membership of 
the Committee was appropriate for 
the activities it carried out during 
the year and detailed information 
on these activities can be found on 
pages 44 and 45.
How did the Board satisfy itself 
of the adequacy of its governance 
procedures?
The General Counsel prepared 
a full report on the Company’s 
governance arrangements, which 
was considered at the January 
Board meeting. In addition, 
the Company takes the view 
that corporate governance is 
not a matter for the Board or 
its committees alone and has 
developed a Code of Conduct for 
employees. This covers dealings 
with customers, suppliers and 
government officials; safeguarding 
the Company’s assets; keeping 
accurate and reliable records; 
and avoiding conflicts of interest. 
Its principal message is that all 
employees must observe a code of 
conduct based on honesty, integrity 
and fair dealing. The code was 
updated during the year. 
Details of how Whitbread has 
applied the main and supporting 
principles of the Combined Code 
with regard to remuneration can be 
found in the Remuneration report 
on page 45. In addition, details of 
the membership and activities 
of the Remuneration Committee 
can be found on page 45.
The Board
Who is on the Board of directors?
The Board currently comprises the 
Chairman, three executive directors 
and five independent non-executive 
directors, one of whom has been 
appointed Senior Independent 
Director. Biographies of each of the 
Directors are set out on pages 36 
and 37 of the Annual Report.
Is there clarity between the roles of 
the Chairman and Chief Executive?
The roles of Chairman and Chief 
Executive are separate, with 
responsibilities clearly divided 
between them.
The Chairman is responsible for:
• running the Board and setting 
its agenda;
• ensuring, through the General 
Counsel, that the members of 
the Board receive accurate, 
timely and clear information 
and that there is a good flow 
of information;
• managing the Board to ensure 
that sufficient time is allowed 
for the discussion of complex 
or contentious issues;
• ensuring that the directors 
continually update their 
knowledge and capabilities;
• ensuring that the members of the 
Board develop an understanding 
of the views of the major 
investors; and
• the annual evaluation of the 
performance of the Board and its 
committees and implementing 
the action required following such 
evaluation.
The Chief Executive is responsible for:
• setting the strategic direction for 
the Company;
• overseeing the day-to-day 
management of the Company;
• the line management of senior 
executives;
• the activities of the Whitbread 
Directors’ Forum – a group of 
the Company’s most senior 
executives; and
• ensuring effective communication 
with shareholders and employees.
How does the Board demonstrate 
independence?
The Board is committed to 
ensuring a majority of directors are 
independent. The non-executive 
directors all act in an independent 
and challenging manner at 
meetings. Additionally, the 
Combined Code lists a number 
of circumstances that might call

the independence of a director into 
question and the Board is satisfied 
that no such circumstances exist for 
any of the Company’s non-executive 
directors. 
How does the Board operate 
and what were its key activities 
during the year?
The Board holds meetings regularly 
and, additionally, for specific 
purposes, as and when required. 
During the year there were 11 
Board meetings. Attendance by 
directors at Board meetings and 
Board committees is set out in 
the table on page 43. Before each 
Board meeting directors are given 
timely and appropriate information, 
including monthly financial and 
trading reports. 
During the year the Board agreed 
the business plans for the Group, 
Hotels and Restuarants and 
Costa, set the budget for the year, 
reviewed the half year and full year 
results, monitored the performance 
of the businesses and approved 
significant transactions such as the 
acquisition of Coffeeheaven. 
How does the Board review 
its performance?
During the year the performance of 
the Board, and individual directors’ 
contributions to the Board, are 
appraised by the Chairman. This 
year each director completed a 
formal questionnaire on the Board’s 
performance and the Chairman met 
or spoke to each director on a one 
to one basis. The performance of 
the Board’s committees was also 
reviewed during the year.
The results of the review were 
discussed by the Board and 
appropriate action plans were 
agreed. There was a consistently 
positive response from directors on 
the effectiveness of the Board and its 
committees. The main themes arising 
from the review were around target 
setting and training. Actions to deal 
with the points raised have been 
implemented.
The performance of the Chairman 
is evaluated during the year by 
the Senior Independent Director 
who reviews the Chairman’s 
performance with each of the 
directors and discusses the results 
with the Chairman.
How are directors kept up to date 
with new developments?
During the year directors attended 
training courses and seminars, or 
received tailored training, on a number 
of relevant issues including: 
• company law;
• pensions; and
• corporate governance.
The Board receives a regular investor 
relations report, which includes share 
price performance, movements in 
institutional holdings and the reaction 
of investors to the communications 
programme.
Internal control
Does the Company maintain 
adequate systems of internal control?
The Board is responsible for the 
Group’s systems of internal control 
and risk management, and for 
reviewing their effectiveness. These 
systems are designed to manage 
rather than eliminate risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives. 
They can only provide reasonable, 
and not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The Board has established an 
ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the 
Group’s significant risks. This process 
was in place throughout the 2009/10 
financial year and up to the date of 
this report. The process is regularly 
reviewed by the Board and accords 
with the internal control guidance 
for directors in the Combined Code. 
A report of the key risks can be 
found on pages 34 and 35. 
Key elements of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control 
system include:
• the formulation, evaluation and 
annual approval by the Board 
of business plans and budgets. 
Actual results are reported 
monthly against budget and the 
previous year’s figures. Key risks 
are identified and action plans 
prepared accordingly;
• the production by each business 
of a risks and controls matrix, 
covering major risks and plans 
which are considered regularly 
by the management boards and 
form the basis of the Group risks 
matrix considered by the Audit 
Committee;
• a regular review by the Board of 
changes in the major risks facing 
the Group and development of 
appropriate action plans;
• the consideration of risks and 
appropriate action plans, when 
appraising and approving all 
major capital and revenue 
projects and change programmes. 
A post completion review of each 
major project is undertaken;
• financial policies, controls and 
procedures manuals, which are 
regularly reviewed and updated;
• the limits of authority, which 
are prescribed for employees. 
Whitbread’s organisational 
structure allows the appropriate 
segregation of tasks;
• the Code of Conduct, which is 
communicated to employees;
• the PwC operational audit team 
activity, which reports on the 
effectiveness of operational and 
financial controls across the Group; 
• the Audit Committee regularly 
reviews the major findings from 
both operational and external 
audit. Further details can be 
found on page 45.
Management and specialists 
within the finance department 
are responsible for ensuring 
the appropriate maintenance of 
financial records and processes that 
ensure all financial information is 
relevant, reliable, in accordance with 
the applicable laws and regulations, 
and distributed both internally 
and externally in a timely manner. 
A review of the consolidation and 
financial statements is completed 
by management to ensure that the 
financial position and results of the 
Group are appropriately reflected. 
All financial information published 
by the Group is subject to the 
approval of the Audit Committee. 
The Board, acting through the 
Audit Committee, has directed the 
work of PwC’s operational audit 
team towards those areas of the 
business that are considered to be 
of the highest risk. The Committee 
approves a rolling audit programme, 
ensuring that all significant areas 
of the business are independently 
reviewed within at least a three year 
period. The programme and findings 
of the reviews are continually 
assessed to ensure they take 
account of the latest information 
and, in particular, the results of the 
annual review of internal controls. 
The effectiveness of the operational 
audit team is reviewed annually by 
the Committee. The Committee 
considers the principal risks 
identified by the risk management 
process which are also considered 
by the main and management 
boards throughout the year. 45

Board committees
What committees does the  
Board have?
The Company has an Audit 
Committee, a Nomination Committee 
and a Remuneration Committee. The 
committees operate within defined 
terms of reference, copies of which 
can be found on the Company’s 
website: www.whitbread.co.uk. The 
Board is satisfied that at least one 
member of the Audit Committee 
has recent and relevant financial 
experience but has determined not 
to identify any individual as having 
such experience.
Audit Committee
Members of Committee:
Simon Melliss (Chairman)
Richard Baker
Wendy Becker
The Audit Committee comprises 
three non-executive directors under 
the chairmanship of Simon Melliss

The Committee generally holds 
three meetings in a year. In 
October and April each year the 
Committee considers the half

respectively. As part of that process 
the management team present 
the statements to the Committee 
with the external auditors (Ernst & 
Young) and operational auditors 
(PwC) present. Ernst & Young

process and the main points of 
discussion that have arisen. PwC 
report on the internal audits carried 
out in the respective periods. 
In March each year the Committee 
considers internal control processes 
including Treasury, Tax and retail 
audit reports along with a Group 
risk analysis.
The terms of reference of the 
external and operational audits are 
considered each year along with 
the effectiveness of the Committee 
itself. The Committee also meets 
with both the external and 
operational auditors without the 
executive team being present.

Richard Baker
Wendy Becker
Philip Clarke
Simon Melliss
Stephen Williams
It was announced in early March 
that Andy Harrison will succeed 
Alan Parker as Chief Executive 
when he retires in November 2010. 
A Committee of the Chairman and 
all the non-executive directors was 
set up to oversee the selection 
process. The recruitment firm, 
Spencer Stuart was appointed 
by the Committee. Following a 
review of their initial report, a list of 
candidates was compiled and
a series of interviews with each 
candidate was held in January 
and February. Psychometric 
assessments were carried out 
and references were taken. At a 
meeting of the Committee on 24 
February 2010, it was unanimously 
agreed that Andy Harrison be 
recommended to the Board for 
the role of Chief Executive. At a 
Board Meeting on 3 March 2010 
the Chairman made a formal 
proposal (which was seconded by 
Alan Parker) that Andy Harrison 
be appointed as Chief Executive 
Designate, joining the Company on 
1 September in that role and then 
as Chief Executive on 25 November 
2010 on Alan Parker’s retirement. 
This proposal was unanimously 
agreed and Andy's appointment 
was publicly announced. 
Nomination Committee – General
Members of Committee:
Anthony Habgood (Chairman)
Simon Mellis
Alan Parker
Stephen Williams
The Nomination Committee 
assesses the level of experience 
and capability of the Board and 
makes recommendations to the 
Board on new appointments. During 
the current year it recommended 
the appointment of Richard Baker 
having appointed an external search 
consultancy. The appointment 
followed the retirement of Charles 
Gurassa. Richard Baker was chosen 
for his wealth of experience in 
customer-facing industries and his 
experience at senior Board level. 46 Annual Report 2009/10
Shareholder relations
Any shareholder may contact the 
Chairman or, if appropriate, the 
Senior Independent Director to 
raise any issue, including those 
relating to strategy and governance. 
Alternatively, shareholders may 
raise any such issues with one or 
all of the non-executive directors 
of the Company. The General 
Counsel can facilitate any such 
communication if requested. 
Recent topics of interest to investors 
have been the performance of 
Premier Inn during the recession 
and its growth in the UK.
How does the Company interact 
with institutional investors?
Institutional shareholders, fund 
managers and analysts are briefed at 
regular meetings and presentations. 
Following the full year and interim 
results in April and October 
respectively, the Chief Executive 
and the Finance Director have 
meetings with institutional investors. 
An Investor Day was held on 28 
January 2010, at which presentations 
were made by the Chief Executive, 
Finance Director and the Managing 
Directors of the businesses. A large 
number of investors attended. The 
Chairman and a non-executive 
director were also present at that 
meeting. The Chairman also had 
meetings with a number of the 
largest shareholders in the Company 
during the year and spoke to them 
following the announcement of 
Andy Harrison's appointment. At 
the annual Board Strategy meeting 
on 17 November 2009, reports were 
presented which described the 
views of major shareholders of the 
Company and its current strategy. It 
is therefore believed that the Board, 
including the Senior Independent 
Director, has an adequate 
understanding of the issues and 
concerns of major shareholders. 
No other meetings have been 
requested by shareholders with the 
Chairman or Senior Independent 
Director. Non-executive directors 
are able to attend these meetings 
and would do so if requested by 
major shareholders.
How does the Company interact 
with private investors?
Annual and interim results 
presentations are webcast live so 
that all shareholders can receive 
the same information at the same 
time. The Company has taken 
advantage of the provisions in the 
Companies Act 2006, which allows 
communication to be made to 
shareholders electronically unless 
they have requested hard copy 
documentation. The Company’s 
website provides comprehensive 
information for private shareholders, 
with the Annual Report and 
Accounts, trading statements, 
interim management statements 
and public announcements all being 
available at www.whitbread.co.uk.
Private shareholders have the 
opportunity to put questions to 
the Board at the Annual General 
Meeting and at all other times 
by emailing or writing to the 
Company. Wherever possible, all 
directors attend the AGM. At the 
2010 AGM, all voting will be by 
poll. Electronic handsets will be 
utilised and results will be displayed 
on the screen at the meeting. In

Introduction from Philip Clarke
The future success of Whitbread 
is dependent on the skills and 
enthusiasm of the people who 
work in our businesses. It is 
important that our employees 
are appropriately incentivised 
and rewarded to continue to 
deliver outstanding service to 
our customers and value to our 
shareholders.
In this report you will find a 
summary of key facts, information 
about our remuneration policy 
and the TSR graph, followed 
by a series of questions and 
answers. The usual tables outlining 
directors’ remuneration, pension 
arrangements and share scheme 
participation are at the back of this 
report. The remuneration report 
will be the subject of a shareholder 
resolution to be proposed at the 
AGM. There are parts of this report 
that have to be audited and these 
are clearly marked as ‘audited 
information’.
There have been no substantive 
changes to the remuneration policy 
for 2009/10. The Remuneration 
Committee will be undertaking a full 
review of the remuneration policy 
during 2010/11. Key points I wish to 
highlight to shareholders are:
• senior executives, including 
the executive directors, did not 
receive any salary increases 
in 2009;
• in light of the economic 
uncertainty the maximum annual 
bonus potential for 2009/10 was 
reduced from the 2008/09 level 
and a wider bonus range was set. 
This principle has been retained 
for 2010/11;
• the increase in profits has resulted 
in good bonuses deservedly being 
awarded, with about two-thirds 
of these bonuses paid in deferred 
shares; and
• the 2007 LTIP award has vested 
at 75.9% of its maximum.

Questions & Answers
In this section, Philip Clarke answers 
questions on how remuneration is 
managed at Whitbread.
Does Whitbread’s Remuneration 
Committee fully meet the 
requirements of the Combined 
Code on Corporate Governance?
Yes, the membership of the 
Committee is compliant with the 
Combined Code.
The Combined Code (which is 
available at www.frc.org.uk) sets 
out the duties and powers which 
companies are expected to delegate 
to their remuneration committees. 
Whitbread’s Committee has terms 
of reference (available at www.
whitbread.co.uk or by requesting 
a copy in writing from the General 
Counsel’s office) which set out 
its duties and powers and these 
terms of reference comply with the 
Combined Code.
The Committee met seven times 
in 2009/10. The attendance 
of individual members of the 
Committee at meetings is shown 
on page 43.
Who provides advice to the 
Committee?
The Committee has appointed 
independent remuneration 
consultants Hewitt New Bridge 
Street and Towers Watson to provide 
external advice. Internal advice is 
received from the Group Human 
Resources Director, Louise Smalley. 
Simon Barratt, General Counsel, acts 
as Secretary to the Committee.
The Whitbread Group receives 
advice on the implementation of 
the Committee’s decisions and 
recommendations from Hewitt 
New Bridge Street, Towers Watson 
and Slaughter and May. Neither 
Hewitt New Bridge Street or Towers 
Watson provide other services to 
the Whitbread Group, although a 
different part of the Hewitt group 
provides services to the trustee 
of the Company’s pension fund. 
Slaughter and May provides legal 
services to the Whitbread Group.
What are the main principles of 
Whitbread’s remuneration policy?
It is important that our senior 
executives have the skills, expertise, 
enthusiasm and drive to achieve the 
Group’s objectives and to enhance 
shareholder value. Our job is to ensure 
that the overall remuneration package 
is sufficiently competitive to attract, 
retain and motivate executives with 
the necessary attributes.
We are determined to ensure 
that the interests of executives 
and shareholders are aligned and 
we recognise the importance of 
having a significant proportion of 
an executive’s remuneration being 
linked to performance as well as the 
importance of the balance between 
short and long-term rewards.
How are base salaries determined?
We review base salaries on an 
annual basis and consider a number 
of factors, including market data 
as well as pay and employment 
conditions across the Group. When 
awarding a base salary increase to 
an executive director, we take into 
account the personal performance 
of the director measured against 
agreed objectives as well as the 
trading circumstances across the 
whole Group. Any salary increases 
take effect from 1 May. In 2009 
we applied a salary freeze and 
have maintained this approach 
for executive directors in 2010. 
The Committee has awarded a 
10% salary increase to Christopher 
Rogers as a market adjustment, 
with effect from 1 May 2010.
Fees for the Chairman and non-
executive directors will remain 
unchanged this year.
Are executives entitled to 
other benefits?
All executives are entitled to life 
assurance and private health cover. 
Non-core benefits, for which cash 
alternatives are available, are family 
health cover and a fully expensed 
company car.
What are the pension arrangements 
for executive directors?
The final salary section of the 
Whitbread Group Pension Fund was 
closed to new entrants, including 
directors, on 31 December 2001. New 
recruits since that date are offered 
the opportunity to participate in the 
defined contribution section of the 
scheme.
Our policy is to pay a Company 
contribution of 25% of salary for 
executive directors, with these 
contributions being increased 
by a further 2.5% of salary after 
each of five and ten years’ service. 
Executives are given the option 
of receiving a monthly amount 
in cash (less an amount equal to 
the employer’s national insurance 
payable on the amount) instead of 
the company pension contribution.
Alan Parker opted out of the final 
salary section of the pension 
scheme on 31 May 2005 and 
receives a cash supplement instead. 
Christopher Rogers and Patrick 
Dempsey participate in the defined 
contribution scheme and receive 
cash or pension contributions in line 
with their selection. Full details of 
the directors’ pension entitlements, 
including cash supplements, can be 
found on page 51.
What is the Directors’ 
Incentive Scheme (DIS)?
The DIS, which was implemented in 
2004/05 and was formerly known 
as the Leadership Group Incentive 
Scheme, is a bonus scheme which 
applies to over 50 executives. The 
scheme is intended to provide a 
clear link between performance 
and reward in order to motivate key 
executives. It promotes alignment 
with shareholders by providing an 
emphasis on equity rewards and 
promotes retention by deferring a 
significant part of the awards.
How does the DIS work?
At the beginning of each financial 
year profit targets are set for the 
Group and its businesses. Depending 
on the performance achieved 
during the year, awards of cash and 
deferred shares may be made at the 
end of the year. The cash element of 
the bonus is payable immediately. 
The deferred shares will normally be 
transferred into the executive’s name 
three years after the award date 
as long as the executive remains 
employed by the Whitbread Group 
during that period. Staggered 
vesting, with one third of the award 
vesting on each of the first, second 
and third anniversaries of grant 
applies to executives who are not 
Executive Committee members.
The threshold, target and stretch 
bonus potential will remain the 
same for the 2010/11 financial 
year, although the level of stretch 
above budget has been marginally 
reduced. The levels of cash and 
deferred shares (expressed as 
percentages of base salaries) that 
can be awarded at different levels of 
performance to executive directors 
are as follows: 49
http:/ /annualreport.whitbread.co.uk
Below threshold Nil
At threshold 2% cash 
4% deferred 
shares
On target 20% cash 
42% deferred 
shares
Stretch or above 53% cash 
(maximum 
payable) 
94% deferred 
shares
Straight lines will operate between 
the above levels of performance. 
Threshold will be the minimum 
target at which awards will be 
earned, targeted level of 
performance will be consistent with 
budgeted performance and stretch 
will be significantly above budget. 
In addition to the profit targets 
explained above, the Group, 
together with each business, has a 
financial target. The failure to meet 
this target would result in the 
reduction of cash and deferred 
shares payable as outlined above 
being reduced by 25%.
In view of the importance of the 
Chief Executive transition process, 
the Committee has set an additional 
range of non-profit targets for Alan 
Parker this year. The maximum 
bonus payable for achieving all 
these targets will be 50% of salary. 
Alan will not be granted an LTIP 
award in 2010.
Targets for future financial years 
will be determined by the 
Committee at, or near to, the 
beginning of each financial year.
The Committee assesses the profit 
results at the end of each financial 
year, as well as the performance 
of each executive director against 
pre-determined targets before 
agreeing the awards, which are then 
independently verified by Hewitt 
New Bridge Street.
Whitbread uses the WINcard to 
manage its businesses, but to what 
extent are executives incentivised 
based on WINcard measures?
Profit growth, a key WINcard 
measure, is the basis for awards 
made under the DIS. Executives 
may also earn a maximum cash 
bonus of 20% of base salary 
for meeting other WINcard 
targets. These targets apply to 
all management throughout the 
Company. They are set at the 
beginning of the financial year 
and, for directors, they are reviewed 
and approved by the Committee 
after the year-end. For the first 
time, in 2010/11, the WINcard 
bonus will be reduced in the event 
that a health and safety hurdle is 
not achieved. Further details on 
the WINcard can be found on 
page 32.
Is the Long Term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP) another incentive scheme?
Yes, although it serves to drive future 
performance and retention rather 
than to reward past performance.
The DIS rewards executives for 
their performance at the end of a 
successful year, with an immediate 
cash bonus and an award of 
deferred shares. Once those 
deferred shares have been awarded, 
they will normally be transferred to 
the executive as long as they remain 
a Whitbread employee.
The LTIP, by contrast, is all about 
the future. It rewards executives 
if earnings and relative total 
shareholder return over a three-year 
period exceed specified hurdles. 
Executive directors will be granted 
awards in 2010/11 as follows:
Christopher Rogers 125%
Patrick Dempsey 100%
Alan Parker 0%
The shares will normally only be 
transferred into the executive’s 
name in the event that the 
executive remains a Whitbread 
employee and that performance 
conditions are met over a three-
year performance period.
How are the LTIP performance 
conditions selected and what 
are they?
The Committee selects conditions 
that it believes will closely align 
the interests of executives to those 
of shareholders.
For awards made in 2010, as 
was the case for grants made in 
2008 and 2009, two performance 
conditions have been selected. 
Each condition will apply to half 
of the awards. The two conditions 
are relative total shareholder return 
(TSR) and earnings per share (EPS) 
growth as shown on page 50.
The measurement of relative TSR 
will compare Whitbread’s TSR 
with that of a comparator group 
of companies over a three-year 
period. For the 2010 awards, this 
is from 5 March 2010 to 1 March 
2013. Averaging will take place 
before the start and end of the 
performance period to reduce the 
impact of short-term share price 
fluctuations. The Committee has 
decided that the most appropriate 
comparator group for 2010 awards 
continues to be the FTSE 51-150 
excluding certain sectors: asset 
managers, consumer finance, equity 
investment instruments, investment 
services, life insurance, non-life 
insurance, mining, oil & gas and 
speciality finance.
Our policy for the EPS targets is 
that there must be real growth of 
4% to 10% per annum from the most 
recent EPS figure at the time of 
grant. Again this is measured over 
three years with the third year’s EPS 
determining the vesting level. For 
the 2009 awards, and as disclosed 
in last year’s remuneration report, 
the Committee had to adapt this 
policy to take account of 2008/09’s 
record EPS figure and the economic 
uncertainty. The EPS and TSR 
targets for the 2009 awards, as well 
as those made in 2006, 2007 and 
2008 are set out in the table on 
page 53.
The TSR calculations are produced 
for the Committee by Hewitt 
New Bridge Street, while the EPS 
calculations are verified by the 
Company’s auditor Ernst & Young 
LLP. The results are considered by 
the Committee before the vesting 
level is confirmed.
Have any LTIP awards vested 
in 2010?
The awards made in 2007 were 
subject to a relative TSR performance 
condition and EPS condition. The EPS 
performance condition was met in full 
and TSR condition was met to 51.8% 
(Whitbread was between the median 
and upper quartile of the FTSE 51-150 
comparator group), resulting in an 
overall vesting level of 75.9%. 50 Annual Report 2009/10
Are executive directors required 
to hold Whitbread shares?
Under our share ownership 
guidelines executive directors 
are required to build and hold a 
shareholding equal to 100% of their 
salary within five years and other 
senior executives 50% of salary.
What will the new Chief Executive 
be paid?
When Andy Harrison joins 
Whitbread in September 2010 
he will receive £700,000 per 
annum together with 25% in lieu 
of pension contribution. He will join 
the Directors’ Incentive Scheme for 
2010/11 on the same basis as the 
other executive directors.
He will be granted shares to the 
value of 175% of salary subject to 
the terms of the LTIP. Provided 
he acquires £1 million worth of 
shares by the end of the financial 
year 2010/11, he will be granted a 
matching award, with vesting three 
years later depending on continued 
service, retention of all of his 
acquired shares and satisfaction of 
performance conditions based on 
the 2010 LTIP award, but with no 
vesting at threshold performance. 
Full details will be disclosed in next 
year’s remuneration report.
The LTIP awards granted in 2010 will vest in three years’ time as follows:
TSR Condition
Position at which the Company is ranked Proportion of award vesting to executive
Upper quartile and above Full vesting of half the award
Between median and upper quartile Pro rata on a straight line between 
quarter and full vesting of half the award
Median (threshold) Quarter of half the award vests
Below Median This half of the award does not vest
EPS Condition
2012/13 EPS: required annual percentage growth 
above Whitbread’s 2009/10 EPS
Proportion of award vesting to executive
RPI +10% or above per annum Full vesting of half the award 
Between RPI +4% and RPI +10% per annum Pro rata on a straight line between 
quarter and full vesting of half the award
RPI +4% per annum (threshold) Quarter of half the award vests
Below RPI +4% per annum This half of the award does not vest 51

Directors’ pension entitlements 
(audited information)
None of the executive directors are 
accruing benefits under any other 
company pension arrangements. No 
elements of the executive directors’ 
pay packages are pensionable 
other than base salaries. Neither 
the Chairman nor any of the non-
executive directors are entitled to 
participate in any of these pension 
arrangements.
Defined Benefit
Alan Parker was the only executive 
director remaining in the defined 
benefit scheme and he elected to 
take his pension on 28 February 
2010 as permitted by the Fund’s 
rules. No discretion was applied 
and he will receive a pension of 
£135,439 p.a. (accumulated accrued 
benefit at 28 February 2009 was 
£128,990). As a result of his decision 
to take the pension, the transfer 
value* as provided for him in the 
Fund is reduced to zero (2008/09: 
£2,945,158).
In respect of his service up to 
31 March 2005 Alan Parker was also 
entitled to a defined benefit pension 
under the Whitbread Group Pension 
Fund. As disclosed in the 2005/06 
annual report (and every report since 
then) in 2005 we decided to end 
future accrual under this pension 
arrangement and crystalised the 
capital sum payable under it. The 
advantages for Whitbread in doing 
this included breaking the link 
between this pension entitlement 
and future salary increases and 
derisking the liability to make cash 
payments in the years following 
Alan’s retirement. Alan’s decision to 
take his pension triggered payment 
of this capital pension payment of 
£5,418,190 in cash from the pension 
scheme to him.
*  Transfer values represent a liability of 
the pension fund, not a sum paid to  
the individual.
Defined Contribution
Christopher Rogers received no 
employer pension contributions into 
the Company’s money purchase 
scheme (28 February 2009: £nil). 
He received a cash supplement of 
£98,670 during the year.
Patrick Dempsey received 
employer contributions of 
£104,666 into the Company’s 
money purchase scheme.

Information on the awards made in 2006 and 2007
The 2006 and 2007 awards were made as part of the Whitbread Leadership Group Incentive Scheme. Executive 
directors were entitled to an award based on 25% of salary at the threshold level of performance, 62.5% at on target 
performance and 125% at stretch performance, with a straight line operating in between. The 2006 award made 
to Christopher Rogers reflected the fact that he was a recent joiner with a low level of equity incentives and was 
not made as part of the Leadership Group Incentive Scheme. The intention was that he should be appropriately 
incentivised to deliver excellent shareholder value. 
Information on awards made in 2008 and 2009
The awards made in 2008 and 2009 were calculated as a percentage of the director’s base salary. In both years Alan

Changes since 4 March 2010
On 19 March 2010, the Remuneration Committee determined that the 2007 LTIP awards had vested at a level of 
75.9% and the vested awards were converted to nil cost options. On 22 March 2010, pursuant to Trading Plans 
entered into by the executive directors prior to the close period, the nil cost options were automatically exercised. 
Alan Parker sold all of the shares at 1511.93p each. Christopher Rogers and Patrick Dempsey sold enough shares to 
settle the income tax and NIC liability and retained the balance. 53

The awards are not subject to performance conditions and will vest in full on the release date subject to the 
director remaining an employee of Whitbread to that date. If the director ceases to be an employee of Whitbread 
prior to the release date by reason of redundancy, retirement, death, injury, ill health, disability or some other 
reason considered to be appropriate by the Remuneration Committee the awards will be released in full. If the 
director ceases to be an employee of Whitbread for any other reason the proportion of award which vests 
depends upon the year in which the award was made and the date the director ceases to be an employee. 
If the director leaves within the first year after an award is made none of the award vests, between the first 
and second anniversary 25% vests and between the second and third anniversary 50% vests. 54 Annual Report 2009/10
Share options 
(audited information)
The Remuneration Committee has no intention of granting any further executive options. Executive directors may 
participate in the Company’s Savings-related Share Option Scheme which is open to all employees on the same terms.
The exercise periods shown below are the normal exercise periods at the date of grant. Actual exercise periods 
are subject to change in accordance with the rules of the schemes when a director ceases to be employed by 
the Company.
At 4 March 2010 the directors held the following share options under the Savings-related Share Option Scheme. 
All of the executive share options held by directors at the beginning of the year were exercised during the year. 
The earliest date on which any of the executive options could have been exercised was June 2005, with the latest 
being May 2015. Savings-related share options have a six-month exercise period.

Statement of directors’ 
responsibilities
The directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance 
with applicable company law 
and those International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the European Union.
Under Company law the directors 
must not approve the Group 
financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they present fairly the 
financial position of the Company 
and of the Group and the results 
and cash flows of the Group for that 
period. In preparing those financial 
statements, the directors are 
required to:
•  select suitable accounting 
policies in accordance with IAS 8: 
Accounting policies, changes in 
accounting estimates and errors 
and then apply them consistently;
•  make judgements and estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent;
•  state that the Group financial 
statements comply with IFRS 
subject to any material departures 
being disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements; 
•  prepare the accounts on a 
going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Group will continue in its business; 
•  present information, including 
accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable 
information; and
•  provide additional disclosures 
when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs is insufficient 
to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on 
the Group’s financial position and 
financial performance.
The directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting 
records, which disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Group 
and enable them to ensure that 
the accounts comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and Article 
4 of the IAS Regulation. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Group and hence, 
taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
Responsibility statement
We confirm on behalf of the Board 
that, to the best of our knowledge:
•  the financial statements, prepared 
in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the EU, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit of the 
Group taken as a whole; and
•  the directors’ report includes a 
fair review of the development 
and performance of the business 
and the position of the Group 
taken as a whole together with a 
description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.
By order of the Board

Independent auditor’s report to 
the members of Whitbread PLC
We have audited the Group financial 
statements of Whitbread PLC for  
the year ended 4 March 2010 
which comprise the Consolidated 
Income Statement, the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive  
Income, the Consolidated  
Statement of Changes in Equity,  
the Consolidated Balance Sheet,  
the Consolidated Cash Flow 
Statement and the related notes  
1 to 34. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied  
in their preparation is applicable  
law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the 
Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 
16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no 
other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept  
or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body,  
for our audit work, for this report,  
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities 
of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the 
directors’ Responsibilities Statement 
set out above, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the 
Group financial statements and for 
being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. Our responsibility is to 
audit the Group financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the 
financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence 
about the amounts and disclosures  
in the financial statements sufficient 
to give reasonable assurance that  
the financial statements are free  
from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes 
an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate 
to the Group’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied  
and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and the overall presentation 
of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial 
statements:
•  give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s affairs as at 4 March 
2010 and of its profit for the year 
then ended;
•  have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union; and
•  have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed 
by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
•  the information given in the directors’ 
Report for the financial year for 
which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the 
Group financial statements; and
•  the information given in the 
Corporate Governance Statement 
set out on pages 43 to 46 in the 
Annual Report and Accounts 
2009/10 with respect to internal 
control and risk management 
systems in relation to financial 
reporting processes is consistent 
with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required 
to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect 
of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we 
are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion:
•  certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or
•  we have not received all the 
information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
•  a Corporate Governance Statement 
has not been prepared by the 
Company.
Under the Listing Rules we are 
required to review:
•  the directors’ statement, set out 
on page 42, in relation to going 
concern; and
•  the part of the Corporate 
Governance Statement on pages 
43 to 46 in the Annual Report and 
Accounts 2009/10 relating to the 
Company’s compliance with the 
nine provisions of the June 2008 
Combined Code specified for  
our review.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the 
parent company financial statements 
of Whitbread PLC for the year ended 
4 March 2010 and on the information 
in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report that is described as having 
been audited.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
At 4 March 2010
1 Authorisation of financial statements 
The consolidated financial statements of Whitbread PLC for the year ended 4 March 2010 were authorised for 
issue by the Board of Directors on 28 April 2010. Whitbread PLC is a public limited company incorporated and fully 
domiciled in England and Wales. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
 
The significant activities of the Group are described in note 4, segment information. 
2 Accounting policies 
Basis of accounting and preparation 
The consolidated financial statements of Whitbread PLC and all its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted for use in the European Union and as applied  
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest 
hundred thousand except when otherwise indicated. The significant accounting policies adopted are set out below.
 
As noted in the policy on non GAAP performance measures below, the definition of underlying profit has been amended.
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are consistent with 
those followed in the preparation of the Group’s annual financial statements for the year ended 26 February 2009, 
except for the adoption of the following new Standards and Interpretations that are applicable for the year ended  
4 March 2010:
 
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment – Vesting Conditions and Cancellations 
The standard has been amended to clarify the definition of vesting conditions and to prescribe the accounting of an 
award that is effectively cancelled because a non-vesting condition is not satisfied. The adoption of this amendment 
did not have any material impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures  
The amended standard requires additional disclosures of fair value measurement and liquidity risk. Fair value 
measurements relating to items recorded at fair value are to be disclosed by source of inputs using a three level fair 
value hierarchy, by class, for all financial instruments recognised at fair value. In addition, a reconciliation between 
the beginning and ending balance for level 3 fair value measurements is now required, as well as significant transfers 
between levels in the fair value hierarchy. The amendments also clarify the requirements for liquidity risk disclosures 
with respect to derivative transactions and assets used for liquidity management. The fair value measurement 
disclosures are presented in note 26. The liquidity risk disclosures are not significantly impacted by the amendments 
and are presented in note 25. As permitted by the amended standard, comparative information for the disclosures 
required by the amendments has not been provided in the first year of implementation.
IFRS 8 Operating Segments 
This standard sets out requirements for disclosure of information about an entity’s operating segments, its products 
and services, the geographical areas in which it operates, and its major customers. The Group determined that the 
operating segments were the same as the business segments previously identified under IAS 14 Segment Reporting. 
Additional disclosures about each of these segments are shown in note 4, including revised comparative information.
 
IAS 1 Revised Presentation of Financial Statements 
The revised standard has required the reconciliation of movements in equity, previously disclosed in the notes, to be 
presented as a primary statement entitled Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. In addition, the Consolidated 
Statement of Recognised Income and Expense has been replaced with the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income. The revised standard requires this statement to present all items of recognised income and expense, either in 
one single statement, or in two linked statements. The Group has elected to present two statements.
IAS 23 Borrowing costs (revised) 
The standard has been revised to require capitalisation of borrowing costs when such costs relate to a qualifying 
asset. The revision to this standard has had no effect on the financial position or performance of the Group as 
borrowing costs have already been capitalised under the previously allowed alternative treatment.
 
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes 
This interpretation requires customer loyalty award points to be accounted for as a separate component of the  
sales transaction in which they are granted. Where award credits are collected on behalf of a third party, they should 
not be disclosed as revenue. The adoption of this amendment did not have any impact on the financial position or 
performance of the Group.
 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of Whitbread PLC and all its subsidiaries, together 
with the Group’s share of the net assets and results of joint ventures and associates incorporated within these 
financial statements using the equity method of accounting. These are adjusted, where appropriate, to conform to 
Group accounting policies. The financial statements of material subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year 
as the parent Company. Annual Report 2009/10 66
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
At 4 March 2010
2 Accounting policies (continued)
Basis of consolidation (continued)
Apart from the acquisition of Whitbread Group PLC by Whitbread PLC in 2000/1, which was accounted for using 
merger accounting, acquisitions by the Group are accounted for under the acquisition method and any goodwill 
arising is capitalised as an intangible asset. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are 
included in the consolidated financial statements from or up to the date that control passes respectively. All intra-
Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are also 
eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Significant accounting policies
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on acquisition is capitalised and represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s 
interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill 
is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may be impaired. On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the 
determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried initially at cost. An intangible asset acquired as part 
of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other 
legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
 
With the exception of overseas trading licences, which are deemed to have an infinite life, intangible assets are 
amortised over periods of up to 15 years. Amortisation is reported within administrative expenses in the income 
statement. The carrying values are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they 
may not be recoverable. 
  
Property, plant and equipment 
Prior to the 1999/2000 financial year, properties were regularly revalued on a cyclical basis. Since this date the 
Group policy has been not to revalue its properties and, while previous valuations have been retained, they have 
not been updated. As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has elected to use the UK GAAP revaluations before the date 
of transition to IFRS as deemed cost at the date of transition. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or 
deemed cost at transition to IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Gross interest costs 
incurred on the financing of qualifying assets are capitalised until the time that the projects are available for use. 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows:
• Freehold land is not depreciated  
• Freehold buildings are depreciated to their estimated residual values over periods up to 50 years  
• Plant and equipment is depreciated over three to 30 years  
 
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. Any impairment in the value of property, 
plant and equipment is charged to the income statement.
 
Profits and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment reflect the difference between net selling price and 
the carrying amount at the date of disposal and are recognised in the income statement.
 
Payments made on entering into or acquiring leaseholds that are accounted for as operating leases represent 
prepaid lease payments. These are amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
 
Impairment 
The Group assesses assets or groups of assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment 
purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows 
of other groups of assets (cash generating units or CGUs). If such indication of impairment exists or when annual 
impairment testing for an asset group is required, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised 
impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the CGU’s recoverable 
amount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the 
estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that 
is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot 
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been 
recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the income statement. After such a reversal, the 
depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s carrying amount, less any residual value, on a 
systematic basis over its remaining useful life.   
67
http:/ /annualreport.whitbread.co.uk
2 Accounting policies (continued)
Impairment (continued) 
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In 
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For 
an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined with 
reference to the CGU to which the asset belongs. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in the 
administrative and distribution line items.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable 
amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of  
any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amounts of other assets in the CGU on a  
pro-rata basis.
 
For the purposes of impairment testing, all centrally held assets are allocated in line with IAS 36 to CGUs based  
on management’s view of the consumption of the asset. Any resulting impairment is recorded against the centrally 
held asset.
Goodwill and intangibles 
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to groups of CGUs at the level management monitor 
goodwill, which is at strategic business unit level. The Group performs an annual review of its goodwill to ensure 
that its carrying amount is not greater than its recoverable amount. In the absence of a comparable recent market 
transaction that demonstrates that the fair value less costs to sell of goodwill and intangible assets exceeds their 
carrying amount, the recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations. An impairment is then made 
to reduce the carrying amount to the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use.
 
Property, plant and equipment 
For the purposes of the impairment review of property, plant and equipment the Group considers CGUs to be each 
trading outlet.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in 
circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
 
Consideration is also given, where appropriate, to the market value of the asset, either from independent sources or 
in conjunction with an accepted industry valuation methodology.
 
Assets held for sale 
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale only if available for immediate sale in their 
present condition and a sale is highly probable and expected to be completed within one year from the date of 
classification. Such assets are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and are  
not depreciated or amortised.
 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is calculated on the basis of first in, first out 
and net realisable value is the estimated selling price less any costs of disposal.
 
Provisions 
Provisions for warranties, onerous contracts and restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a present 
legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be 
required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
 
Provisions are discounted to present value, where the effect is material, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The amortisation of the 
discount is recognised as a finance cost.
Non GAAP performance measure 
In the prior year, the Group introduced an underlying profit measure on the face of the income statement. The 
directors have continued with this measure but refined it so that it now excludes only exceptional items and the 
impact of IAS 19 Income Statement finance charge/credit for pensions.
 
The face of the income statement presents underlying profit before tax and reconciles this to profit before tax as 
required to be presented under the applicable accounting standards. Underlying earnings per share is calculated 
having adjusted profit after tax for the same items, their tax effect and the effect of any exceptional tax items. The 
term underlying profit is not defined under IFRS and may not be comparable with similarly titled profit measures 
reported by other companies. It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measurements of profit. 
The adjustments made to reported profit in the income statement in order to present an underlying performance 
measure include: Annual Report 2009/10 68
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
At 4 March 2010
2 Accounting policies (continued)
Exceptional items 
The Group includes in non GAAP performance measures those items which are exceptional by virtue of their size 
or incidence so as to allow a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group. The Group 
includes the profit or loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, property reversions and impairment in 
exceptional items.
 
IAS 19 Income Statement finance charge/credit for defined benefit pension schemes 
Underlying profit includes the service costs but excludes the volatile finance cost/revenue element of IAS 19.
Taxation 
The tax impact of the above items is also excluded in arriving at underlying earnings. 
Foreign currency translation 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange 
quoted at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of initial transactions.
 
Trading results are translated into the functional currency (generally sterling) at average rates of exchange for the 
year. Day to day transactions in a foreign currency are recorded in the functional currency at an average rate for the 
month in which those transactions take place, which is used as a reasonable approximation to the actual transaction 
rate. Translation differences on monetary items are taken to the income statement except where they are part of a 
net foreign investment hedge, in which case translation differences are reported in other comprehensive income.  
The differences that arise from translating the results of foreign entities at average rates of exchange, and their assets 
and liabilities at closing rates, are also dealt with in a separate component of equity. On disposal of a foreign entity, 
the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the 
income statement. All other currency gains and losses are dealt with in the income statement.
A number of subsidiaries within the Group have a non sterling functional currency. These are translated into sterling in 
the Group accounts. Balance sheet items are translated at the rate applicable at the balance sheet date. Transactions 
reported in the income statement are translated using an average rate for the month in which they occur.
Revenue recognition 
Generally, revenue is the value of goods and services sold to third parties as part of the Group’s trading activities, 
after deducting discounts and sales-based taxes. The following is a description of the composition of revenues of  
the Group:
Rendering of services 
Owned hotel revenue, including the rental of rooms and food and beverage sales from a network of hotels, is 
recognised when rooms are occupied and food and beverages are sold. Revenue from franchise fees received in 
connection with the franchise of the Group’s brand names is recognised when earned.
 
Royalties 
Royalties are recognised as the income is earned.
Sale of goods 
Revenue from the sale of food and beverages is recognised when they are sold.
Finance revenue 
Interest income is recognised as the interest accrues, using the effective interest method. 
Leases 
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified  
as operating leases. Rental payments in respect of operating leases are charged against operating profit on a 
straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Lease incentives are recognised as a reduction of rental costs over  
the lease term.
 
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred, except for gross interest 
costs incurred on the financing of major projects, which are capitalised until the time that the projects are available 
for use.
 
Retirement benefits 
In respect of defined benefit pension schemes, the obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for any unrecognised past service cost, reduced by the fair value 
of the scheme assets. The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation 
method. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.   
69
http:/ /annualreport.whitbread.co.uk
2 Accounting policies (continued)
Retirement benefits (continued) 
For defined benefit plans, the employer’s portion of the past and current service cost is charged to operating profit,  
with the interest cost net of expected return on assets in the plans reported within finance costs. The expected return  
on plan assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of the year of long-term market returns on scheme 
assets, adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions received and benefits paid during the year.
Curtailments and settlements relating to the Group’s defined benefit plan are recognised in the period in which the 
curtailment or settlement occurs.
Payments to defined contribution pension schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. 
Share-based payment transactions  
Certain employees and directors of the Group receive equity-settled remuneration in the form of share-based 
payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares. The cost of 
equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value, determined using a stochastic 
model, at the date at which they are granted. The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a 
corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the 
relevant vesting date. Except for awards subject to market related conditions for vesting, the cumulative expense 
recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which 
the vesting period has expired, and is adjusted to reflect the directors’ best available estimate of the number of 
equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The income statement charge or credit for a period represents the 
movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period. If options are subject to 
market related conditions, awards are not cumulatively adjusted for the likelihood of these targets being met. Instead 
these conditions are included in the fair value of the awards.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any 
expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
 
Tax 
The income tax charge represents both the income tax payable, based on profits for the year, and deferred income tax.
Deferred income tax is recognised in full, using the liability method, in respect of temporary differences between 
the tax base of the Group’s assets and liabilities, and their carrying amounts, that have originated but have not been 
reversed by the balance sheet date. No deferred tax is recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill 
or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of 
the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is recognised in 
respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in associates and interests in joint ventures, 
except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the 
temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against 
which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is 
reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable 
profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when 
the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at 
the balance sheet date.
 
Tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Treasury shares 
Own equity instruments which are held by the Group (treasury shares) are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is 
recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments.
 
Investments in joint ventures and associates 
Joint ventures are established through an interest in a company (a jointly controlled entity).
Investments in joint ventures and associates are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration 
given and including acquisition charges associated with the investment.
 
After initial recognition, investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method. 
Recognition and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities 
The recognition of financial assets and liabilities occurs when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument. The derecognition of financial assets takes place when the Group no longer has the right to cash 
flows, the risks and rewards of ownership, or control of the asset. The derecognition of financial liabilities occurs 
when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

2 Accounting policies (continued)
Financial Assets 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
Some assets held by the Group are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. On initial 
recognition these assets are recognised at fair value. Subsequent measurement is also at fair value with changes 
recognised through finance revenue or costs in the income statement.
 
Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted 
in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit 
and loss or available-for-sale. Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the 
time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and 
receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less any uncollectable amounts. An estimate 
for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off when 
identified.
 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with 
an original maturity of three months or less. For the purpose of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, cash and 
cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group enters into derivative transactions with a view to managing interest risks associated with underlying 
business activities and the financing of those activities. Derivative financial instruments used by the Group are stated 
at fair value on initial recognition and at subsequent balance sheet dates. Cash flow hedges hedge exposure to 
variability in cash flows that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or 
a forecast transaction.
 
Hedge accounting is only used where, at the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation and documentation 
of the hedging relationship, it meets the Group’s risk management objective strategy for undertaking the hedge and 
it is expected to be highly effective.
 
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
The portion of any gains or losses of cash flow hedges, which meet the conditions for hedge accounting and are 
determined to be effective hedges, is recognised directly in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
The gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the income statement. 
 
When a firm commitment that is hedged becomes an asset or a liability recognised on the balance sheet, then, at  
the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised 
in equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or 
liability. For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income 
statement in the same period in which the transaction that results from a firm commitment that is hedged affects  
the income statement.
Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are 
recognised immediately in the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no 
longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point in time, for cash flow hedges, any cumulative gain or loss on 
the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the 
income statement.
Borrowings 
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received net of any directly associated issue 
costs. Borrowings are subsequently recorded at amortised cost, with any difference between the amount initially 
recorded and the redemption value recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
 
Significant accounting judgements and estimates 
Key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation, at the balance sheet date have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year.

The calculation of the Group’s total tax charge necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect 
of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant 
tax authority. The final resolution of certain of these items may give rise to material income statement and/or cash 
flow variances.
 
Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) not effective for the current year and not 
adopted by the Group 
The following standards and interpretations, which have been issued by the IASB and are relevant for the Group, 
become effective after the current year end and have not been early adopted by the Group:
  
IFRS 3 Business Combinations (revised) 
IFRS 3 (revised) introduces significant changes in the accounting for business combinations occurring after this date. 
Changes affect the valuation of non-controlling interest, the accounting for transaction costs, the initial recognition 
and subsequent measurement of a contingent consideration and business combinations achieved in stages. These 
changes will impact the amount of goodwill recognised, the reported results in the period that an acquisition occurs 
and future reported results.
 
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (amended) 
IAS 27 (amended) requires that a change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary (without loss of control) is 
accounted for as a transaction with owners in their capacity as owners. Therefore, such transactions will no 
longer give rise to goodwill, nor will it give rise to a gain or loss. Furthermore, the amended standard changes the 
accounting for losses by the subsidiary as well as the loss of control of a subsidiary.
 
The changes by IFRS 3 (revised) and IAS 27 (amended) will affect future acquisitions or loss of control of subsidiaries 
and transactions with non-controlling interests.

4 Segment information
For management purposes, the Group is organised into two strategic business units (Hotels & Restaurants and 
Costa) based upon their different products and services:
• Hotels & Restaurants provide services in relation to food and accommodation 
•  Costa generates income from the operation of its branded, owned and franchised coffee shops.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable operating segments.   Annual Report 2009/10 72
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
At 4 March 2010
4 Segment information (continued)
Management monitors the operating results of its strategic business units separately for the purpose of making 
decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance. Segment performance is measured based on 
operating profit before exceptional items. Included within the unallocated and elimination columns in the tables 
below are functions managed by a central division (including the costs of running the public company). The 
unallocated assets and liabilities are cash and debt balances (held and controlled by the central treasury function), 
taxation, pensions, certain property, plant and equipment and central working capital balances. Sales to Costa 
franchise partners were previously categorised as unallocated but are now included within Costa (restated for 2009).
Inter-segment revenue is from Costa to the Hotels & Restaurants segment and is eliminated on consolidation. 
Transactions were entered into on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
All activities are continuing.
The following tables present revenue and profit information and certain asset and liability information regarding 
business operating segments for the years ended 4 March 2010 and 26 February 2009.

1.    During the year a net profit of £14.6m was recognised on disposals of property, plant and equipment. In addition, following the entry of First Quench 
Retailing into administration on 29 October 2009, a provision has been raised for a total of 130 properties for which the Group has an obligation. 
2.   Premier Inn rebranding costs in the prior year relate to asset write off and brand relaunch costs.  
3. The pension curtailment credit arose due to the closure of the defined benefit scheme to future accrual on 31 December 2009 (note 32).
4.  In 2007/8, the Group sold its interests in David Lloyd Leisure Limited and TGI Friday’s. Following these disposals it was announced that the Restaurant 
and Hotels divisions would merge and that the shared service teams would be disbanded. This restructuring includes the final costs associated with the 
aligning of IT with the new structures. This then completes the income statement impact of the restructuring programme that was announced in 2007/8.
5.  The interest arising on late payment of an item claimed in a previous year, which is disputed, is included in exceptional interest charges.
6.  Reduction in deferred tax liability on rolled over gains for differences between the tax deductible cost and accounts residual value of the reinvestment assets.
7.  The deferred tax charge in the prior year arose as a result of the enactment by the UK government, in July 2008, of the abolition of Industrial Buildings 
Allowances for hotel buildings. 75

Total deferred tax liabilities released as a result of disposals during the year was £0.1m (2009: £2.6m). 
As a result of the transaction referred to in note 32, a current tax benefit of £28.6m has been obtained in the current 
year. The deferred tax balance associated with the pension deficit has been adjusted to reflect this benefit.
The Group has not provided deferred tax of £1.7m (2009: £1.7m) in respect of the unremitted earnings of overseas 
subsidiaries. Following the enactment of the Finance Act 2009, the Group considers that the receipt of those 
earnings would be exempt from UK tax.
Tax relief on total interest capitalised amounts to £0.1m (2009: £0.8m).
10 Business combinations 
On 18 February 2010 Costa Coffee Limited acquired the entire issued share capital of Coffeeheaven International plc 
for a total cash consideration of £37.2m, equivalent to 24 pence per ordinary share. Coffeeheaven International plc is 
the leading coffee chain in central and eastern Europe, with 89 stores throughout Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Bulgaria and Latvia.  77

In arriving at the fair value of property, plant and equipment an adjustment of £2.3m has been made to impair the 
carrying value of a number of leasehold sites. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of Coffeeheaven International 
plc arises as a result of the expected synergies from the business combination together with the benefits of the 
assembled workforce of the acquired business.
From the date of acquisition, the company acquired contributed £1.0m revenue and no profit to the net profit of 
the Group. If the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the year, the profit for the Group would have been 
decreased by £1.2m and the revenue from continuing operations would have been increased by £22.8m.
On 18 February 2010 Premier Inn India Limited acquired 50.1% of Premier Inn India Private Limited, which it 
previously did not own, for £5.5m in cash.

In arriving at fair value of property, plant and equipment an adjustment of £0.4m has been made to write off costs 
which had been inappropriately capitalised.
No goodwill arose on the original investment in the joint venture.
From the date of acquisition, the company acquired contributed no revenue and a loss of £0.1m to the net profit of 
the Group. If the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the year, the profit for the Group would have been 
decreased by £1.6m and the revenue from continuing operations would have been increased by £0.1m. Annual Report 2009/10 78

11 Earnings per share 
The basic earnings per share figures are calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to ordinary 
shareholders, therefore before minority interests, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during 
the year after deducting treasury shares and shares held by an independently managed employee share ownership 
trust (ESOT).
The diluted earnings per share figures allow for the dilutive effect of the conversion into ordinary shares of the 
weighted average number of options outstanding during the period. Where the share price at the year end is lower 
than the option price the options become anti-dilutive and are excluded from the calculation. The number of such 
options was nil (2009: 694,753).
 
The numbers of shares used for the earnings per share calculations are as follows: 
 2009/10 2008/9
 million million
Basic weighted average number of ordinary shares 174 .3 17 3.8
Effect of dilution – share options 0.4 0.2
Diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares 174 .7 174 .0 
The total number of shares in issue at the year end, as used in the calculation of the basic weighted average number 
of ordinary shares, was 190.6m less 14.7m treasury shares held by Whitbread PLC and 0.5m held by the ESOT (2009: 
189.1m less 14.7m treasury shares held by Whitbread PLC and 0.8m held by the ESOT).

The carrying amount of goodwill at 26 February 2009 relates to Hotels & Restaurants. Additions during the year 
comprise £23.2m arising on the acquisition of Coffeeheaven International plc and £1.6m arising on the acquisition of 
Premier Inn India Private Limited. Of the £24.8m of goodwill relating to additions in the year, £1.6m has been allocated 
for impairment testing purposes to the cash generating unit Hotels & Restaurants, with the remaining £23.2m being 
allocated to the Costa cash generating unit. Both of these cash generating units are also reportable segments and 
represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Annual Report 2009/10 80
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
At 4 March 2010
13 Intangible assets (continued)
IT software has been assessed as having finite lives and will be amortised under the straight-line method over periods 
ranging from three to 10 years from the date it became fully operational. During the prior year the useful economic 
life of elements of the Group’s ERP system was reduced as a result of the reorganisation referred to in note 6. The IT 
software amortisation charge for the year includes an accelerated amortisation charge of £1.4m (2008/9: £4.3m) as 
a result of this revision and is included within exceptional items in both the current and prior years.
Other intangibles 
Other intangibles comprise Costa overseas trading licences and the brand name and franchise fee agreements 
acquired with the Premier Lodge business. 
The trading licences, which have a carrying value of £0.6m (2009: £0.7m), are deemed to have an infinite life as there 
is no time limit associated with them. The brand name and franchise fee agreements are being amortised over their 
estimated useful economic lives of periods up to 15 years.
 
Capital expenditure commitments 
There are no capital expenditure commitments in relation to intangible assets at the year end (2009: £nil).

which no provision has been made 41 .9 54.2
 
In addition to the capital expenditure commitments disclosed above, the Group has also signed agreements 
with certain third parties to develop new trading outlets within the Hotels & Restaurants strategic business unit. 
These developments are dependent on the outcome of future events such as the granting of planning permission, 
and consequently do not represent a binding capital commitment at the year end. The directors consider that 
developments likely to proceed as planned will result in further capital investment of £111.1m over the next five years 
(2009: £41.7m). 
Capitalised interest 
Interest capitalised during the year amounted to £0.5m, using an average rate of 4.4% (2008/9: £3.0m, using an 
average rate of 5.8%). 
Assets held for sale
During the year, certain property assets with a combined net book value of £5.0m (2008/9: £70.0m) were transferred 
to assets held for sale. These property assets were sold during the year, with the exception of three trading sites with  
a combined net book value of £2.3m (2008/9: £nil) which continue to be classified as assets held for sale at the year 
end. An impairment loss of £0.6m (2008/9: £nil) was recognised in the year relating to assets classified as held for sale.
15 Impairment
During the year impairment losses of £11.3m (2008/9: £17.8m) and impairment reversals of £9.8m (2008/9: £1.1m)

The Group considers each trading outlet to be a cash generating unit (CGU) and each CGU is reviewed annually for 
indicators of impairment.
In assessing whether an asset has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU is compared to its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. In the absence of 
any information about the fair value of a CGU, the recoverable amount is deemed to be its value in use. 
 
The Group estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model, which applies a pre-tax discount rate of 10.0% 
(2008/9: 10.0%). The future cash flows are based on assumptions from the business plans and cover a five year 
period. These business plans and forecasts include management’s most recent and cautious view of medium term 
trading prospects. Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using a 2.0% growth rate (2008/9: 2.0%).
The events and circumstances that led to the impairment loss of £11.3m are set out below:
Hotels & Restaurants
The impairment at 25 sites in the strategic business unit was driven by a number of factors
• Changes in the local competitive environment in which the hotels are situated
• Impairment of assets held for sale to their recoverable value
•  High asset prices in the market at the point of acquisition for acquired sites which also anticipated higher growth 
rates at that time than are now expected.
Costa
Nine Costa sites with an established trend of poor performance against the required capital investment have been 
impaired where their expected future cash flows have fallen to such a level that their value in use is below carrying value.
Impairment reversals
Following an improvement in trading performance and an increase in amounts of estimated future cash flows of 
previously impaired sites, reversals of £9.8m have been recognised. Annual Report 2009/10 82
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
At 4 March 2010
15 Impairment (continued) 
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions 
The level of impairment is predominantly dependent upon judgements used in arriving at future growth rates and 
the discount rate applied to cash flow projections. The impact on the impairment charge of applying different 
assumptions to the growth rates used in the five year business plan and in the pre-tax discount rates would be as 
follows:  
  Hotels & Restaurants Costa Total
  £m £m £m
Impairment if business plan growth rates were  reduced by 1% 17 .1 1 .3 18 .4
Impairment if discount rate was increased by 1% 16 .7 1 .3 18 .0
Goodwill 
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to groups of CGUs at strategic business unit level, 
being the level at which management monitor goodwill.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In the absence of a recent market 
transaction the recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations. This is calculated using the five year 
business plans approved by senior management. The key assumptions in these calculations relate to revenue and the 
increase in rooms. The calculation is most sensitive to revenue assumptions, however senior management believe 
that the assumptions used are reasonable. Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using a 2.0% growth rate 
(2008/9: 2.0%). The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 10.0% (2008/9: 10.0%).
The resultant impairment review required no impairment of goodwill allocated to the Hotels & Restaurants CGU.
A review of goodwill created during the year concluded that there is insufficient post acquisition trading history to 
suggest any impairment. Goodwill acquired in 2009/10 as part of the Coffeeheaven International plc acquisition will 
be assessed for impairment as part of the Costa goodwill impairment review in future years.

Maturity analysis is grouped by when the debt is contracted to mature rather than by repricing dates, as allowed 
under IFRS.
The swaps with maturities beyond the life of the current revolving credit facilities (2013) are in place to hedge against 
the core level of debt the Group will hold.
The carrying amount of the Group’s borrowings is denominated in sterling.
At 4 March 2010, the Group had available £626.6m (2009: £489.3m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in 
respect of revolving credit facilities on which all conditions precedent had been met.  86 Annual Report 2009/10

25 Financial risk management objectives and policies 
The Group’s principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, cash and short-term 
deposits. The Group’s financial instrument policies can be found in the accounting policies in note 2. The Board 
agrees policies for managing the risks summarised below:
Interest rate risk  
The Group’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long-term sterling 
debt obligations. Interest rate swaps are used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt. The Group’s 
policy is to fix on a long-term basis between 35% and 65% of projected net interest cost over the next 15 years, which 
is beyond the life of the Group’s existing revolving credit facilities. This policy reduces the Group’s exposure to the 
consequences of interest rate fluctuations. Most of the swaps held at the balance sheet date were entered into in 
January 2007 as part of a long-term fixing strategy. However, following the reduction in debt during the year, at year 
end £400.0m (71.4%) of Group debt was fixed for an average of 4.0 years (2009: £410.0m, 61.0%, for 4.9 years), 
using floating rate borrowings and interest rate swaps. The intention is that the fixed rate debt ratio will reduce 
going forward to come back in line with Group policy. The average rate of interest on this fixed rate debt was 5.6% 
(2008/9: 5.6%).
In accordance with IFRS 7 the Group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are 
affected by changes in interest rates. This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, 
a constant ratio of fixed to floating interest rates, and on the basis of the hedging instruments in place at 4 March 
2010 and 26 February 2009 respectively. Consequently, the analysis relates to the situation at those dates and is not 
representative of the years then ended. The following assumptions were made:
•  balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of 
debt and deposits does not change as interest rates move;
•  gains or losses are recognised in equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies set out in  
note 2; and
• cash flow hedges were effective.
 
Based on the Group’s net debt position at the year end a 1% change in interest rates would affect the Group’s profit 
before tax by approximately £1.2m (2008/9: £2.2m), and equity by approximately £13.8m (2009: £19.6m).
Liquidity risk 
The Group mitigates liquidity risk by managing cash generated by its operations combined with bank borrowings 
and long-term debt. In its funding strategy the Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of 
funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts and bank loans. This strategy includes monitoring the maturity 
of financial liabilities to avoid the risk of a shortage of funds.
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interest-bearing deposit with maturities fixed at no more than 
three months. Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of short-term borrowing on the money markets.
The tables below summarise the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities at 4 March 2010 and 26 February 
2009 based on contractual undiscounted payments, including interest:

25 Financial risk management objectives and policies (continued) 
Credit risk 
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. 
The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables. 
This is minimised by dealing with counterparties with high credit ratings. The amounts included in the balance sheet 
are net of allowances for doubtful debts, which have been estimated by management based on prior experience 
and known factors at the balance sheet date which may indicate that a provision is required. The Group’s maximum 
exposure on its trade and other receivables is the carrying amount as disclosed in note 20.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash 
equivalents, the Group’s exposure arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the 
carrying value of these instruments. The Group seeks to minimise the risk of default in relation to cash and cash 
equivalents by spreading investments across a number of counterparties.
In the event that any of the Group’s banks get into financial difficulties the Group is exposed to the risk of withdrawal 
of currently undrawn committed facilities. This risk is mitigated by the Group having a range of counterparties to its 
facilities and by maintaining headroom.
Foreign currency risk 
Foreign exchange exposure is currently not significant to the Group. Sensitivity analysis has therefore not been 
carried out.
Overseas investments are generally start-up businesses undertaken through joint venture arrangements. The Group 
monitors the growth and risks associated with its overseas operations and will undertake hedging activities as and 
when they are required. 
Capital management 
The Group’s primary objectives in regard to capital management are to ensure that it continues to operate as a going 
concern and has sufficient funds, depending on the economic environment, at its disposal to grow the business for 
the benefit of shareholders.
The Group seeks to maintain a ratio of debt to equity that balances risks and returns and also complies with lending 
covenants. It aims to  maintain sufficient funds for working capital, further investment in order to meet growth 
targets and to ensure that access is available to the capital markets. The Group has adopted a framework to keep 
leverage on a pensions lease adjusted basis at 3.5 times or below.
All of these matters are considered at regular intervals and form part of the business planning and budgeting 
processes. In addition, the Board regularly reviews the Group’s dividend policy and funding strategy.
 
26 Financial instruments 
Fair values 
Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of the Group’s financial instruments. 
The fair value of loan capital and derivative instruments is calculated by discounting all future cash flows by the 
market yield curve at the balance sheet date.

Hierarchical classification of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
IFRS 7 requires that the classification of financial instruments at fair value be determined by reference to the source 
of inputs used to derive the fair value. The classification uses the following three-level hierarchy: 
Level 1 
Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 
Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either 
directly or indirectly. 
Level 3 
Techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on 
observable market data.

During the year ended 4 March 2010 there were no transfers between levels 1, 2 or 3 fair value measurements.
Derivative financial instruments 
Hedges 
Cash flow hedges 
At 4 March 2010 the Group had interest rate swaps in place to swap a notional amount of £400.0m (2009: £410.0m) 
whereby it receives a variable interest rate based on LIBOR on the notional amount and pays fixed rates of between 
5.145% and 5.695% (2009: 5.145% and 5.745%). The swaps are being used to hedge the exposure to changes in 
future cash flows from variable rate debt.
Cash flow hedges are expected to impact on the income statement in line with the liquidity risk table shown in note 25.
The swaps with maturities beyond the life of the current revolving credit facilities (2013) are in place to hedge against 
the core level of debt the Group will hold.
The cash flow hedges were assessed to be highly effective at 4 March 2010 and a net unrealised gain of £3.0m 
(2008/9: net unrealised loss of £29.6m) has been recorded in other comprehensive income. During the year, a loss of 
£15.9m (2008/9: £0.3m) was recycled from equity to the income statement in respect of hedged items affecting the 
net finance charge for the year.

At the 2007 Annual General Meeting, the Company was authorised to purchase up to 19.7m of its own shares on the 
open market. This authorisation was extended at a General Meeting on 27 November 2007 by a further 17.8m shares.
During the year no ordinary shares were acquired (2008/9: 1.6m at a cost of £20.0m). No shares were cancelled in 
the year (2008/9: five million). The remainder are being held in the treasury reserve (note 29).
During the year to 4 March 2010 options over 0.2m ordinary shares, fully paid, were exercised by employees under 
the terms of various share option schemes (2008/9: 0.3m).
On 5 May 2009 the Company announced a scrip alternative to the cash final dividend of 26.90 pence per share, 
resulting in the issue of 674,971 ordinary shares. A scrip alternative was also announced for the 2009/10 9.65 pence 
per share interim dividend. Ordinary shares issued in respect of the interim dividend totalled 298,754. The issue 
of shares in lieu of cash dividends is treated as a bonus issue, with the nominal value of the shares being charged 
against the share premium account.
The total number of shares in issue at the year end used in the calculation of the basic weighted average number of 
ordinary shares was 190.6m, less 14.7m treasury shares held by Whitbread PLC and 0.5m held by the ESOT (2009: 
189.1m, less 14.7m treasury shares held by Whitbread PLC and 0.8m held by the ESOT).

28 Share capital (continued) 
B shareholders are entitled to an annual non-cumulative preference dividend paid in arrears on or around 2 July each 
year on a notional amount of 155 pence per share.
C shareholders are entitled to an annual non-cumulative preference dividend paid in arrears on or around 14 January 
each year on a value of 159 pence per share.
Other than shares issued in the normal course of business as part of the share-based payments schemes and those 
issued in respect of scrip dividends, there have been no transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary 
shares since the reporting date and before the completion of these financial statements.
 
29 Reserves 
Share premium
The share premium reserve is the premium paid on the Company’s 76.80p ordinary shares. The issue of shares in lieu 
of cash dividends is treated as a bonus issue, with the nominal value of the shares being charged against the share 
premium account. During the year, shares with a nominal value of £0.7m were issued in lieu of the 2008/9 final and 
2009/10 interim cash dividends (2008/9: £nil).
Capital redemption reserve
A capital redemption reserve was created on the cancellation of the Group’s B and C preference shares (note 28) and 
also includes the nominal value of cancelled ordinary shares.
Retained earnings
In accordance with IFRS practice, retained earnings include revaluation reserves which are not distributable under 
UK law.
Currency translation reserve
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the 
financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and other foreign currency investments.
Merger reserve 
The merger reserve arose as a consequence of the merger in 2000/1 of Whitbread Group PLC and Whitbread PLC. 
 
Hedging reserve 
This reserve records movements for effective cash flow hedges measured at fair value. 
 
Treasury reserve 
This reserve relates to shares held by an independently managed employee share ownership trust (ESOT) and 
treasury shares held by Whitbread PLC. The shares held by the ESOT were purchased in order to satisfy  
outstanding employee share options and potential awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and other 
incentive schemes.

30 Commitments and contingencies 
Operating lease commitments 
The Group leases various buildings which are used within the Hotels & Restaurants and Costa businesses. The leases 
are non-cancellable operating leases with varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights. The Group also leases 
various plant and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements. 
Contingent rents are the portion of the lease payment that is not fixed in amount but based upon the future amount 
of a factor that changes other than with the passage of time (e.g. percentage of future sales, amount of future use, 
future price indices, future market rates of interest). 
Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 
 2010 2009
 £m £m
Due within one year 93.0 74.6
Due after one year but not more than five years 312 .2 248.3
Due after five years but not more than ten years 266.9 206.9
Due after ten years 957.1 791 .2
1 ,629.2 1 ,321 .0
 
Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases disclosed above includes £84.3m in relation 
to privity contracts. Future lease costs in respect of these privity contracts are included within the onerous contracts 
provision (note 24). Onerous contracts are under constant review and every effort is taken to reduce this obligation.
The weighted average lease life of future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases is 17.3 
years (2009: 18.6 years).
Group companies have sub-let space in certain properties. The future minimum sublease payments expected to be 
received under non-cancellable sublease agreements as at 4 March 2010 are £21.8m (2009: £25.1m).
Contingent liabilities 
There were no material contingent liabilities at 4 March 2010. 
31 Share-based payment plans 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
The LTIP awards shares to directors and senior executives of the Group. Vesting of shares under the scheme will 
depend on continued employment and meeting total shareholder return (TSR) and earnings per share (EPS) 
performance targets over a three year period. Details of the performance targets for the LTIP awards can be seen  
in the Remuneration report on pages 47 to 56.
The awards are settled in equity once exercised.

31 Share-based payment plans (continued) 
Deferred equity awards 
Awards are made under the Whitbread Leadership Group Incentive Scheme implemented during 2004/5. 
The awards are not subject to performance conditions and will vest in full on the release date subject to continued 
employment at that date. If the director ceases to be an employee of Whitbread prior to the release date, normally 
three years after the award, by reason of redundancy, retirement, death, injury, ill health, disability or some other reason 
considered to be appropriate by the Remuneration Committee the awards will be released in full. If employment 
ceases for any other reason the proportion of awards which vests depends upon the year in which the award was 
made and the date that employment ceased. If employment ceases in the first year after an award is made none of 
the award vests, between the first and second anniversary 25% vests and between the second and third anniversary 
50% vests.

Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) 
Annual grants of share options have been discontinued, however options may be granted in exceptional 
circumstances, for example, on a senior recruitment or following an acquisition of a business. No changes will be 
made to options already granted.
An earnings per share based performance condition will apply to any such options, and to the extent that the 
performance is not satisfied after three years, the option shall lapse as there is no opportunity to retest performance. 
This was the case for the options granted in 2004, for which the performance target requires earnings per share 
growth of RPI plus 12% over the three year performance period. For options granted in 2005 the performance target 
requires earnings per share growth of RPI plus 4% per annum over the three consecutive financial years, these have 
now been met. For options granted between June 2000 and June 2003 the performance conditions required the 
Company’s adjusted earnings per share to exceed RPI plus 4% per annum measured over any three consecutive 
years out of the 10 year performance period starting from June 2000 and ending June 2013 depending on when the 
options were granted.

years and they are exercisable at a price of £5.39 (2009: prices between £5.39 and £11.01).
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for ESOS options exercised during the year was £12.99.

granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a stochastic model, taking into account the terms and conditions 
upon which the options were granted.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for employee share scheme options exercised during the

Expected volatility reflects the assumption that historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not 
necessarily be the actual outcome.
The risk-free rate is the rate of interest obtainable from government securities over the expected life of the equity 
incentive.
The expected dividend yield is calculated on the basis of publicly available information at the time of the grant date 
which, in most cases, is the historic dividend yield.
No other features relating to the granting of options were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
At 4 March 2010 there were outstanding options for employees to purchase up to 1.3m (2009: 2.1m) ordinary shares 
of 76.80 pence each between 2010 and 2015 at prices between £5.39 and £14.17 per share (2009: between 2009 
and 2015 at prices between £5.39 and £14.17 per share).
Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT)
The Company funds an ESOT to enable it to acquire and hold shares for the LTIP and executive share option 
schemes. The ESOT held 0.5m shares at 4 March 2010 (2009: 0.8m). All dividends on the shares in the ESOT are 
waived by the Trustee.

2001. Members of the scheme are contracted out of the State Second Pension. A replacement, contracted-in, 
defined contribution arrangement was established as a section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund with effect 
from 1 April 2002. Contributions by both employees and Group companies are held in externally invested trustee-
administered funds.
The Group contributes a specified percentage of earnings for members of the above defined contribution schemes, 
and thereafter has no further obligations in relation to the schemes. The total cost charged to income in relation to 
defined contribution schemes in the year was £2.0m (2008/9: £2.0m).
At the year end, 1,641 employees (2009: 782) were active members of the schemes, which also had 6,769 deferred 
members (2009: 6,747).
Defined benefit schemes
The defined benefit (final salary) section of the principal Group Pension Scheme, the Whitbread Group Pension 
Fund, was closed to new members on 31 December 2001 and to future accrual on 31 December 2009. The scheme 
is funded, and contributions by both employees and Group companies are held in externally invested trustee 
administered funds. Members of the scheme are contracted out of the State Second Pension.
 
At the year end the scheme had no active members (2009: 885), 26,744 deferred pensioners (2009: 27,584) and 
15,998 pensions in payment (2009: 15,645).
A scheme specific actuarial valuation for the purpose of determining the level of cash contributions to be paid 
into the Whitbread Group Pension Fund was undertaken as at 31 March 2008. A deficit recovery plan and some 
protection whilst the scheme remains in deficit have been agreed with the Trustee. The Group will make the following 
payments to the Fund: £55m in each of August 2011, August 2012 and August 2013; £65m in each of August 2014 
and August 2015; £70m in August 2016; £80m in each of August 2017 and August 2018. For the period of the deficit, 
the Group has agreed to give undertakings to the Trustee similar to some of the covenants provided in respect of its 
banking agreements, up to the value of any outstanding recovery plan payments or the remaining deficit, if lower. 
Until the next valuation the Trustee has also been given a promise of participation in increases in ordinary dividends 
where these exceed RPI and the right to consultation before any special distribution can be made.
In addition to the scheduled deficit contribution payments described above, the Pension Scheme will receive a share 
of the income, profits and a variable capital payment from its investment in Moorgate Scottish Limited Partnership, 
which was established by the Group during the year (the share in profits will be accounted for by the Group as 
contributions when paid). The partnership interests in Moorgate SLP are held by the Group, the general partner, and 
by the Pension Scheme following a £102m investment made by the Pension Scheme Trustee during the year. Annual Report 2009/10 96
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
At 4 March 2010
32 Retirement benefits (continued)
Defined benefit schemes (continued) 
Moorgate SLP holds an investment in a further partnership, Farringdon Scottish Partnership, which was also 
established by the Group during the year. Property assets with a market value of £221m have been transferred from 
other Group companies to Farringdon SP and leased back to Whitbread Group PLC and Premier Inn Hotels Limited. 
The Group retains control over these properties, including the flexibility to substitute alternative properties. However, 
the Trustee has first charge over the property portfolio and certain other assets with an aggregate value of £228m. 
The Group retains control over both partnerships, and as such they are fully consolidated in these Group financial 
statements. 
The Pension Scheme is a partner in Moorgate SLP and, as such, is entitled to an annual share of the profits of the 
partnership over the next 15 years. At the end of this period, the partnership capital allocated to the Pension Scheme 
partner will be changed, depending on the funding position of the Scheme at that time, to a value up to £110m.  
At that point, the Group may be required to transfer this amount in cash to the Scheme.
Under IAS 19 the investment held by the Pension Scheme in Moorgate SLP, a consolidated entity, does not represent a 
plan asset for the purposes of the Group’s consolidated financial statements. Accordingly the pension deficit position 
in these Group financial statements does not reflect the £102m investment in Moorgate SLP held by the Pension Scheme. 
The total service cost contributions to the Whitbread Group Pension Fund in 2010/11 are expected to be £nil.
The IAS 19 pension cost relating to the defined benefit section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund is assessed in 
accordance with actuarial advice from Lane Clark & Peacock and Hewitts, using the projected unit credit method.  
As the scheme is now closed to future accrual, there will be no service cost in the future.
The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in updating the most recent valuation carried 
out as at 31 March 2008 of the UK schemes to 4 March 2010 for IAS 19 purposes were:
 At At
 4 March 26 February
 2010 2009
Rate of increase in salaries n/a
1
 4.10%
Pre April 2006 rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions  3.30% 3.00 %
Post April 2006 rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions  2.20% 2.10%
Discount rate  5.60% 6.60%
Inflation assumption  3.50% 3.10%
1.  The Whitbread Group Pension Fund was closed to future accrual on 31 December 2009. From this point active members’ benefits only 
increase in line with inflation.
 
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements. 
The assumptions are that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 20.6 years (2009: 20.4) if 
they are male and for a further 23.1 years (2009: 23.0) if they are female. For a member who retires in 2030 at age 
65, the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 22.5 years (2009: 22.4) after retirement if they are 
male and for a further 24.9 years (2009: 24.8) after retirement if they are female.
The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. 
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent 
with widely accepted capital market principles. The assumed long-term rate of return on each asset class is set out 
within this note. The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for 
each actual asset allocation for the Fund at 4 March 2010 (rounded to the nearest 0.1% per annum). 97

The main valuation assumptions were that the return on investments would be 3.3% (2009: 3.6%) per annum  
above inflation. 
The amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of defined benefit schemes are as follows:

Fair value of scheme assets 1 ,281 .0 1 ,107.0

During the year the accounting deficit increased from £233.0m at 26 February 2009 to £434.0m at 4 March 2010. 
The main contributors to the increase were the change to the rate of interest used to discount the liabilities from 6.6% 
to 5.6% and the change to the rate of assumed inflation underlying the liabilities from 3.05% to 3.50%. Both of these 
were offset by the actual return on assets over the year being higher than that needed to keep pace with the interest 
on liabilities.

Directors’ responsibility for the Company financial 
statements/audit report
Statement of directors’ 
responsibilities
The directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the 
directors have elected to prepare the 
financial statements in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and 
applicable law). 
Under Company law the directors 
must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Company 
and of the profit or loss of the 
Company for that period. In preparing 
those financial statements, the 
directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
•  make judgements and estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent;
•  state whether applicable UK 
accounting standards have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
•  prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show 
and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and hence  
for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.

the members of Whitbread PLC
We have audited the parent 
company financial statements of 
Whitbread PLC for the year ended

reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice). 
This report is made solely to the 
company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 
16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the 
company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no 
other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept 
or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the 
company’s members as a body, for 
our audit work, for this report, or  
for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities 
of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the 
Directors’ Responsibilities Statement 
set out above, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation  
of the parent company financial 
statements and for being satisfied  
that they give a true and fair view.  
Our responsibility is to audit the 
parent company financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the 
financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence 
about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient 
to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are 
free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the parent company’s 
circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates 
made by the directors; and the 
overall presentation of the  
financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent company 
financial statements:
•  give a true and fair view of the  
state of the company’s affairs as  
at 4 March 2010;
•  have been properly prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practices; and
•  have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed 
by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
•  the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and 
•  the information given in the 
Directors’ Report for the financial 
year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is 
consistent with the parent company 
financial statements.
Matters on which we are required 
to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect 
of the following matters where the 
Companies Act 2006 requires us to 
report to you if, in our opinion:
•  adequate accounting records 
have not been kept by the parent 
company; or
•  the parent company financial 
statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to 
be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and 
returns: or
•  certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or
•  we have not received all the 
information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on 
the Group financial statements of 
Whitbread PLC for the year ended  
4 March 2010.

were as follows:
‘A’ limited voting shares of 25p 
each 103.75p
‘B’ limited shares of 25p each 
103.75p
Whitbread has had discussions with 
the Inland Revenue (now HMRC)
concerning the capital gains tax 
cost of Whitbread shares following 
the reduction of capital on 10 May 
2001. It is confirmed that the market 
value of each Whitbread share on 
10 May 2001 for these purposes 
was 606.5p and the market value 
of each Fairbar share was 230p.
For the purposes of calculating UK 
tax on chargeable gains which may 
arise on a disposal of shares in the 
Company, subsequent alterations 
to the Company’s capital should 
be taken into account. In particular, 
the special dividend and share 
consolidation in May 2005, the 
share consolidation and B share 
issue effected in June 2006 and 
the share consolidation and C share 
issue in January 2007 should be 
considered in accordance with the 
information provided in the related 
shareholder circulars. Further 
information on capital gains tax 
allocations in relation to the B and 
C share issues can be found in the

I am pleased to report that the Smiths News 
Group continued to deliver strong results. 
Earnings are up for the fourth consecutive 
year, with profit increases achieved by all 
the divisions in the current financial year. 
Our strategy of diversifying into carefully 
chosen markets has supported growth, 
facilitated new opportunity and positioned 
the Group to make further progress. 
The front section of this report includes 
details of our financial and strategic 
performance from which it is clear that the 
Group continues to make good progress 
towards its medium-term targets. This year, 
29% (FY2012: 24%) of our profit will derive 
from activities outside of newspaper and 
magazine wholesaling and we continue to 
work towards our target of 50% by 2016.
In what remains a challenging wider 
economy, it is ever more important to 
differentiate our offer. The Group’s key 
businesses are all leading businesses in 
their field and acknowledged experts with 
reputations for market leading service and 
cost-effective solutions. Our approach 
has been to invest and build on these 
qualities, focusing on those markets and 
sub-sectors in which our specialist skills 
can add value for customers and suppliers.
Smiths News remains the largest contributor 
to Group revenues and profit. The renewal 
this year of a number of major contracts 
provides an enviable degree of stability. 
This provides us with confidence that, 
by driving process efficiencies, we can 
broadly offset the long-term trend of 
declining sales. In addition, we will explore 
opportunities for growth through additional 
services and incremental contract wins, 
leveraging our core capabilities and assets. 
The books market is increasingly complex 
and traditional distribution models are 
changing. Under our ownership, Bertrams 
has become a multi-channel business, 
with strength in a range of specialist 
sectors and an increasing international 
reach. The Group’s acquisitions and 
investments have positioned Bertrams 
as a leading academic supplier across 
Europe. The continued growth of our digital 
platform and the early success of our 
joint venture with Wordery demonstrates 
how a changing market can provide 
opportunity for those prepared to invest.
We remain pleased with the performance 
of The Consortium since acquisition 
in April 2012. The Education and Care 
markets are forecast to continue growing in 
response to well documented demographic 
and policy trends. The increasing 
independence of schools, particularly 
the increase in ‘academy status’ schools, 
and the renewed focus on value in the 
public sector will add momentum to the 
underlying opportunity for further growth.
Turning to financial performance, underlying 
profit before tax is up 11.6% to £53.0m and 
underlying earnings per share increased 
12.6% to 22.4p. Free cash flow increased 
to £32.6m (FY2012: £27.2m). The Board 
is committed to maintaining strong 
returns to shareholders and, given our 
confidence in the future prospects for the 
Group, a final dividend of 6.3p per share 
has been proposed, making a full year 
dividend of 9.3p, up 8.1% on last year. 
I am conscious that this progress is 
ultimately due to the efforts and dedication 
of all of our colleagues throughout the 
Group. It is their capacity to embrace 
change while delivering excellence every 
day that is the foundation of our success. 
I would like to thank them for their 
dedication, and acknowledge the role of 
Mark Cashmore and his Executive Team in 
providing clear leadership across the Group.
Thanks also go to my colleagues on the 
Board for their support and challenge 
throughout the year. As described in the 
Corporate Governance section on page 36, 
we have carefully reviewed the role and 
effectiveness of the Board and I am pleased 
to report that we believe that the Board 
continues to work diligently and effectively.
In summary, the Group has delivered 
another strong performance, augmenting 
its track record of growth and strategic 
progress in a challenging environment. 
I can confirm that the Board remains 
fully focused on the strategies that are 
outlined in this report and look forward 
to reporting on future success.

We continue to make good 
progress against our 
medium‑term strategic 
objectives. Group performance 
benefited from both organic 
growth and the full year impact 
of acquisitions. We have grown 
Group revenue 0.4% and 
increased profit by 11.6%.
How have we 
performed? 09 Smiths News PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Overview
The Group as a whole has performed 
well, with financial and strategic progress 
across all divisions. We remain on track 
with our stated strategy of achieving 50% of 
profit from activities outside of newspaper 
and magazine wholesaling by 2016.
Smiths News increased operating profit 
by 2.5% to £40.0m. In what are challenging 
and mature markets, this is a particularly 
pleasing performance. Our track record of 
delivering sustainable operating efficiencies 
continues, with £8.7m annualised savings 
achieved through a combination of network 
restructuring and continual re-engineering 
of operating processes. We have now 
contracted 53% of revenues through to at 
least 2019, giving a high degree of certainty 
that will support and sustain future profits.
Bertrams increased operating 
profit by 6.1% to £7.2m. Highlights 
of the year include the acquisition of 
Erasmus, a specialist distributor based 
in The Netherlands; the acquisition of a 
range of academic supply contracts from 
Blackwell’s; and the launch of Wordery, 
an online book offer to consumers. The 
Group’s continued investments has ensured 
Bertrams now supplies a diverse range 
of sectors including UK trade, public and 
academic libraries, international markets, 
digital content to academic customers 
and trading direct to consumers. It is this 
range of channels which gives the division 
both resilience and future opportunity. 
The Consortium increased pro forma 
operating profit by 15.3% to £7.4m. 
In our first full year of ownership The 
Consortium has demonstrated its excellent 
fit and contribution to the Group. The 
Education and Care markets have strong 
underlying growth fundamentals and with 
the Group’s support The Consortium is 
well placed to increase profitability and 
market share. This year’s strategic priority 
has been the integration of West Mercia 
Supplies (acquired by The Consortium 
in April 2012) into one organisation, with 
consequent improvements in customer 
service and underlying efficiency. In 
addition we have invested in renewing 
websites, customer relationship software 
that will target and drive sales effort, 
and increased telesales resource. 
In October 2013, Glenn Leech took over 
from Melanie Teal as managing director. 
We now have a new and ambitious 
senior team at The Consortium, fully 
focused on growing the business 
and meeting our strategic targets. 
Media increased operating profit by 
11.1% to £2.0m. The division continues 
to pursue a strategy of winning print media 
contracts, improving operating efficiency 
and widening its provision of digital 
content. In April 2013, the Group sold the 
small marketing and fulfilment company, 
Marketlink Marketing Communications 
Limited (‘MMC’), concluding that its 
activities were not core to our strategy.
Group Chief Executive’s review
How have we performed?
‘We have delivered another 
strong financial performance 
with underlying PBT up 11.6% 
to £53.0m and EPS up 12.6% 
to 22.4p.’
It is pleasing to report another year of 
progress for the Group. Underlying profit 
before tax is up 11.6% with profit growth 
reflecting the strong market positions of 
all of our businesses in what remains a 
challenging economic environment. 
This was our fourth consecutive year 
of earnings growth and we remain on 
track with our strategy to develop the 
Group as a leading specialist distributor 
across a range of market sectors. Free 
cash flow of £32.6m has grown by 19.8% 
supporting an 8.1% increase in the full 
year dividend to 9.3p (FY2012: 8.6p). 10 Smiths News PLC

How have we performed? Group Chief Executive’s review continued
Strategy
Our Group strategy is clear – we aim 
to be a leading specialist distributor 
in each of our chosen markets. To 
achieve this, we will deliver outstanding 
customer service, backed by unmatched 
efficiency and industry leading systems. 
It is this combination of service, expertise 
and ongoing investment that makes 
us the partner of choice in each of 
our supply chains, adding value to 
both suppliers and customers.
The Group’s foundations and heritage lie in 
the newspaper and magazine industry, and 
it is no coincidence that we are the largest 
and most successful news wholesaler in 
the UK, with a world class operation and 
reputation for excellence. We remain fully 
committed to this sector and believe current 
profit can be broadly maintained through 
continued efficiencies and the development 
of complementary revenue streams.
Recent diversification into the Books, 
Education and Care markets has 
strengthened the Group, giving more 
balance to our revenues and lessening 
dependency on a single sector. We are 
targeting 50% of profit to come from 
activities outside of newspaper and 
magazine wholesaling by 2016. This will be 
achieved by a combination of organic sales 
growth and further acquisitions that build 
our scale, efficiency and customer base.
The Group has a vital role to play in 
providing the environment, investment and 
resources to ensure all of our divisions 
prosper. Many of our skills, competencies 
and systems are transferable across the 
Group’s divisions, allowing us to share 
best practice and leverage our people 
and technology. We are passionate about 
continual improvement and building strong 
relationships that cement our role as the 
essential partner in our supply chains.
Strategic goals 
The Group is confident of further progress, 
growing profits, increasing cash flow and 
delivering on our strategic objectives. 
A detailed review of the progress and 
future plans for each of the divisions is 
set out on pages 18 to 25 of this report.
Corporate responsibility
As a PLC we recognise our responsibility 
to the environment, industry best practice, 
customers, staff and the wider communities 
we serve. The Group has a programme of 
initiatives which build on a solid foundation 
of responsible best practice across 
the workplace and in our markets.
I am especially pleased to see further 
progress on our carbon reduction initiatives 
and the widening of our community 
programme to include partnerships 
with two literacy focused charities.
Details of our corporate responsibility 
programme and its progress this year are 
set out in pages 26 to 31 of this report.
Outlook
The Group has started the new financial year 
positively and in line with our expectations. 
Our medium-term outlook remains strong 
and we are focused on growing profits, 
generating significant levels of free cash 
and maintaining a progressive dividend 
policy. We remain committed to our 
previously stated aim of 50% of Group 
profits generated from outside of newspaper 
and magazine wholesaling by 2016.
Mark Cashmore
Group Chief Executive
‘We remain focused on 
achieving 50% of profits 
from activities outside of 
newspaper and magazine 
wholesaling by 2016, and 
believe our ability to generate 
significant free cash will 
support a progressive 
dividend policy.’ 13 Smiths News PLC

Group’s performance, indicate that there is 
substantial headroom within these bank facilities 
and the Group will continue to operate well 
within the covenants attaching to those facilities.
 – Despite the uncertain economic environment, 
the directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Thus the Group continues to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing its 
consolidated financial statements.

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Overview
Smiths News continues to deliver a 
market leading performance with a 
combination of profit growth, sustainable 
efficiencies and contract wins that will 
help underpin profitability into the future.
Underlying operating profit of £40.0m is 
up 2.5% on the previous year (FY2012: 
£39.0m). New revenues from incremental 
contract wins have boosted total sales. 
Markets 
The newspaper and magazine market 
is large and mature. Sales have been in 
gradual decline for many years with price 
increases and new launches helping to 
offset volume reductions in established 
titles. These trends continued in FY2013 
with newspaper sales performing more 
strongly than magazines helped by price 
increases. Magazines continue to be 
more challenging, negatively impacted 
by title closures and price discounting, 
particularly in the TV listings sector.
Taking the market as a whole, the 
underlying sales of core newspapers 
and magazines were down 4.6%, within 
the range of our medium-term strategic 
forecast which anticipates a decline 
of 3% to 5% per annum. Importantly, 
Smiths News outperformed the like-
for-like market trends with overall sales 
down by 2.6% due to revenues from 
national and regional contract gains.
Strategy
Smiths News’ strategy is well 
understood and supported by our key 
partners across the supply chain. 
Our aim is to secure long-term contracts 
by offering an unmatched combination 
of service and efficiency. The relative 
predictability of revenues from these 
contracts allows us to plan investments 
and seek sustainable operating efficiencies, 
helping to offset the gradual sales 
decline and broadly maintain core profit 
in what is recognised to be a mature 
market sector. In addition, we will explore 
opportunities to leverage our network 
and commercial relationships to diversify 
into new products and services.
Progress
Further contract renewals we concluded 
during the year with major publishers 
mean that £800m of annualised 
revenues have been secured until 
at least 2019. This equates to 53% 
of our current annualised sales.
Sustainable efficiencies amounting to 
£8.7m p.a. were achieved from a variety 
of initiatives to reduce costs across the 
network. The business remains on track 
to achieve savings of £20m in the current 
3-year efficiency programme by 2015. 
Consolidating the network into fewer 
but larger depots is an ongoing process 
and a highlight this year included the 
creation of a West-Midlands super-hub 
at Birmingham which now serves over 
4,000 customers. The progress with 
securing contracts gives us greater line 
of sight of our future requirements as 
we continually assess opportunities in 
response to the market changes.
The SAP enterprise system, which 
underpins both our operation and support 
services, was upgraded in 2013. The 
upgrade was delivered on time and without 
interruption to service and will help to 
maintain our position as the market leading 
provider for both publishers and retailers.
Independently conducted surveys 
continue to rank Smiths News as the 
clear market leader for service. Providing 
a high-quality service is core to our 
strategy: it builds trust with commercial 
partners, whilst reducing costs by 
minimising waste and rectification costs. 
Our investigations into the potential for 
additional products and services have 
seen a range of trials this year. It is early 
days but we will continue to explore 
opportunities to complement the core offer. 
Future plans
Looking ahead, we recognise the challenges 
of operating in a mature market and 
continue to plan on the basis of a gradual 
reduction in core sales. We believe the 
market will remain large and relatively stable 
into the foreseeable future, with opportunity 
to win incremental business as the remaining 
national and regional contracts arise.
Our core strategy remains unchanged – 
to efficiently serve our existing contracts 
and secure further contracts through a 
combination of leading service, unmatched 
efficiency and continual improvement in 
productivity. We will invest in the network 
and systems to deliver further savings 
and plan to continue our investigations 
into new products and services that 
will help diversify our revenues.

Moving with 
the times
When Smiths News needed to upgrade its 
SAP Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) 
software, Head of Business Systems 
Andrew Caple knew it would be a long  
and complex project. 
‘SAP ERP software underpins every area of 
our business,’ he said, ‘making it absolutely 
critical to the smooth-running of Smiths 
News. With this in mind, we needed to 
manage the transition of 1,395 users to a 
new platform as seamlessly as possible.’
This was successfully achieved, ahead of 
deadline and on budget. The result is an 
ERP package that is better suited to Smiths 
News’ current and future business 
operations, and will be supported by  
SAP until at least 2020. 
‘The SAP upgrade is in line with our 
business strategy’ Caple asserted.  
‘By putting it in place, we are prepared  
for the future.’ 20 Smiths News PLC

Bertrams now has a diverse business and its broad sales mix is an 
ongoing strength. It now supplies the public and private sectors, high 
street and internet fulfilment, UK and international, print and digital and 
direct to consumer in 95 countries. 21 Smiths News PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Overview
Bertrams has performed well in a market 
that continues to feel the effects of the wider 
economy as evidenced by the UK trade retail 
market and is further impacted by changes 
in technology and consumer buying habits. 
Nevertheless, sales of the division rose by 
7.8% and underlying operating profit was 
up 6.1% to £7.2m (FY2012: £6.8m), with 
strong performance from international 
sales, direct to consumer sales and our 
digital service to academic customers. 
Bertrams is now a multi-channel, 
international distributor with a portfolio of 
interests which include sales to UK trade 
retailers, international markets and academic 
and public libraries. The business also 
provides internet fulfilment services, has 
a leading digital portal for universities and 
colleges, and recently launched a ‘direct 
to consumer’ online offer. This year’s 
progress demonstrates our strength in the 
growing and emerging sectors of the books 
market, helping to balance the gradual 
decline in some more traditional channels 
such as the high street retail sector.
Markets 
The consumer books market is in a period 
of transition, affected by the emergence 
of ebooks and a shift from the high street 
to internet retailers. Bertrams continues 
to respond to these developments, 
outperforming industry trends with an 
increase in UK wholesale sales of 2.2% 
compared to decline in the total UK books 
consumer market of 6.0%. This, the fourth 
consecutive year of progress, reflects 
our strength in growing sectors, such as 
serving internet retailers and the launch of 
Wordery, a 51% owned subsidiary which 
sells books online directly to consumers.
The opportunity for Bertrams to grow 
in international markets continues 
and performance has been assisted 
by acquisitions that support our 
academic offers and customer base. 
International sales are up by 30.2% and 
now represent 26.2% of total sales.
UK public and academic libraries have 
been more challenging with pressure on 
funding. DawsonEra, our digital books 
portal for university and college libraries, 
continues to make excellent progress with 
further sales growth this year of 38.0%. 
Trading 
Overall, sales are up 7.8%, with performance 
varying considerably by sector and reflecting 
the differing dynamics of each marketplace. 
UK wholesale continues to experience 
a shift from high street to internet 
retailers. Bertrams has responded with a 
sophisticated fulfilment offer which supports 
leading internet customers, including 
Amazon, Tesco, WH Smith, Sainsbury’s, 
Waterstones and, more recently, Wordery. 
Operationally, in response to growing 
demand for fulfilment services, we 
have recently installed new pack-line 
technology that will materially increase 
our productivity and speed of dispatch 
for online sales and bespoke orders.
Almost one third of Bertrams’ sales 
are now made to academic customers 
in the UK and internationally. A major 
contract renewal this year was the joint 
national tender to the Consortium of UK 
Universities, whilst international sales 
benefited from the acquisition of Erasmus 
and a range of customer contracts 
from Blackwell’s. Our digital portal for 
universities, DawsonEra, complements 
our supply of printed books and gives 
competitive advantage by providing a 
‘one-stop-shop’ solution for customers.
The launch of Wordery is a milestone in 
our multi-channel strategy. Wordery is a 
joint venture selling direct to consumers 
and using our Norwich distribution hub to 
support an online proposal that combines 
great customer experience with competitive 
pricing. Launched in October 2012, Wordery 
quickly became established as a leading 
marketplace trader, and in September 
2013, Wordery.com was launched. We are 
excited by the prospects for Wordery and 
will be investing to support further growth.
Future plans
We aim to make Bertrams a world 
class book distributor, with a range of 
services that are unmatched by our 
direct competitors. The books market is 
large and variable in its make-up: we will 
focus investment on those sectors and 
opportunities in which we can grow profit, 
pursuing a balanced portfolio of sales 
across a range of market segments. 
Digital books have been disruptive to 
traditional high street sales, but they 
offer opportunity as well as challenge, 
and we have ambitious plans for our 
DawsonEra system. We will invest to 
enhance its range, functionality and 
foreign language capability, aiming to be 
the market leading eBooks platform for 
universities and institutions across Europe.

Wordery’s 
satisfied 
customers
Since launching in October 2012, Wordery 
has established itself as one of the UK’s 
most popular booksellers. 
 
The Company is a joint venture between 
Bertrams and Wordery’s founders, led by 
managing director Will Jones. It combines 
the distribution expertise of Bertrams with 
the retail savvy of Wordery’s team, and 
the result is proving very popular with 
book lovers. 
Until recently, Wordery has operated as a 
marketplace seller on sites like eBay and 
Amazon. Its customer feedback is 
consistently excellent, and it was listed as 
a top-rated seller on eBay within months 
of opening. 
As the second phase of its launch, 
Wordery is launching a direct-to-
consumer website that it hopes will 
capitalise on its popularity with customers. 
Wordery.com went live in September 
2013, and will provide a further platform 
for the Company’s sales operation.  22 Smiths News PLC

• High market share
• Medium market share
• Low market share 23 Smiths News PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Overview
In our first full year of ownership, The 
Consortium has been fully integrated into the 
Group and is benefiting from investments 
in marketing, operational process and 
people. Total like-for-like sales were up by 
2.6%, with solid growth across the core 
segments of education, care and early 
years, which were collectively up 3.1%. 
Underlying operating profit of £7.4m was 
up 15.3% on the pro forma prior year.
Markets
The Education and Care markets 
continue to show strong fundamentals 
for growth, supported by demographic 
trends that predict a steady increase in 
schools, nurseries and care homes. 
Education sales increased 2.4% on a 
like-for-like basis, and the quality of our 
sales (through a combination of mix and 
promotion) has improved gross margin. 
In the short term, individual school 
budgets remain challenged by reductions 
to public spending and there has been 
some disruption resulting from the move 
of many schools to ‘academy’ status. 
We have felt some impact of this over 
the year but the longer-term opportunity 
in our core markets remains positive. 
Our Early Years and Care businesses 
have performed well, reflecting the 
underlying strength of these markets. 
Sales to Early Years were up by 4.3% 
and to Care homes by 10.4%. 
A year of progress
Our priority this year was to complete 
the integration of The Consortium into 
the Group, supporting its goal of winning 
market share and increasing the amount 
spent by individual customers.
In April 2012, The Consortium had acquired 
West Mercia Supplies, a former public 
sector purchasing organisation based in 
Shrewsbury. We have made good progress 
on the journey to create one organisation 
and sharing services and technology to 
optimise efficiency. The new customer 
catalogues have significantly reduced 
the number of stock lines by removing 
unnecessary variations and managing a 
core range across both customer bases.
Our multi-channel strategy recognises that 
customers need a buying process that 
is simple and flexible. With over 40,000 
product lines, our expertise in selection 
and presentation is essential to make the 
customer experience as easy as possible. 
We have invested in new websites that 
improve searching, browsing and ordering 
and are committed to continually improving 
the online offer. This year’s printed 
catalogues were the biggest and brightest 
ever, giving customers clear choices 
of budget, value and premium lines. 
From a sales perspective, our strategy is 
focused on increasing ‘share of wallet’, 
driving profitable sales and winning new 
customers. Much of the education sector 
still uses catalogue and telephone ordering 
but we expect this gradually to shift to 
more flexible online systems and we need 
to help our customers with this journey. 
So we are investing in new websites that 
improve our product information and make 
ordering easier, and have augmented our 
service with further telesales capability 
and a customer relationship management 
system to drive our field-sales efforts.
Operationally, we have made progress in the 
efficiency of our warehouses by working to 
reduce the number of duplicated stock lines 
and ensuring improved stock availability 
at peak periods. We offer customers a 
highly flexible delivery service including 
standard and premium delivery options.
A passion for service and attention to 
detail of customer care is a defining 
characteristic of The Consortium. We are 
constantly assessing our offer, making 
sure we have the most comprehensive 
range of products and the simplest 
ordering process, backed by a ‘no-quibble 
guarantee’ of satisfaction. We were 
pleased in November 2012 to be named 
as Education Investor’s Product Supplier 
of the Year, in recognition of our range of 
services and reputation in the marketplace. 
Future plans
In October 2013, Glenn Leech, previously 
Group HR director, succeeded Melanie 
Teal as managing director, completing our 
succession planning from the previous 
leadership team. The new senior team 
is focused on maximising opportunities 
for growth in our key markets. 
Our growth plans focus on increasing 
the order values from existing customers 
as well as winning new ones. We plan 
to offer the best and most flexible 
combination of product choice, value 
and delivery, backed by our market 
expertise and leading customer service. 
Further investments are planned in 
marketing and customer services and 
our customer relationship management 
system will target efforts at the most 
profitable opportunities. Ongoing 
review of the operational process will 
drive efficiency across the division. 
 
We aim to grow in our core markets but 
remain alert to opportunities to supply 
into profitable niche opportunities.

Call to action
Every business stands or falls on the quality 
of its sales operation. And while the field 
sales team at The Consortium is one of the 
best in the market, its members simply 
don’t have the capacity to visit every single 
customer in person. 
That’s why the Company has set up a 
telesales division, working from its offices 
in Shrewsbury. The 10-strong team is 
divided into business sectors – early  
years, care, and education – and also 
helps alert customers about special  
offers and campaigns. 
As a result of the initiative, The Consortium 
can reach an extra half a million prospects 
per year. As Sales Director Matt Palmer 
explained, ‘This gives the Consortium and 
West Mercia Supplies every chance of 
interacting with hard-to-reach customers, 
and growing revenue in the years to come.’ 24 Smiths News PLC

airline and rail customers including British Airways, Eurostar, 
Cathay Pacific, Delta, United Airlines and RyanAir. 25 Smiths News PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Overview
The Media division made good progress 
with profit increasing to £2.0m, up 11.1% as 
a result of new contract wins, operational 
efficiencies and a more focused strategy.
DMD provides print and electronic media to 
the travel market. With its largest operations 
based in the UK, DMD works with partners 
throughout the world to supply content to 
over 80 airlines into more than 50 countries 
and is also the exclusive supplier of 
newspapers and magazines to Eurostar.
In addition to its core operation of supplying 
printed newspapers and magazines, 
DMD continues, through its joint venture 
with Bluebox Avionics Ltd, to develop a 
digital offer including the supply of iPads 
to airlines, the provision of inflight content 
for these and a media portal for in-transit 
customers currently on trial with Eurostar.
A year of progress
The supply of media to airlines is 
contract based, so winning and retaining 
long-term customers is essential to a 
successful business model. Our strategy 
is to provide an unmatched service 
and value, thereby retaining our key 
customers and selectively infilling with new 
customers, targeting those routes and 
locations in which we already operate. 
In February 2013, DMD was appointed 
the exclusive international supplier of 
newspapers and magazines to the 
world’s biggest passenger carrier, United 
Airlines. This is a significant contract 
adding scale to our operation and helping 
to underpin international operations for 
three years. Other contract highlights 
included an agreement with Trinity Mirror 
to distribute more than one million copies 
a year to Stansted and Luton airports.
Operationally, the UK warehouse operations 
of DMD are now managed by Smiths 
News on an outsourced basis. Airport 
security is a paramount consideration and 
DMD is the only focused specialist with 
Department for Transport accreditation. 
We have centralised the majority of the 
international administration into the UK 
head office at Langley, facilitating savings 
but also giving us greater control of 
supplies and allocation. This year the 
business was accredited by the Audit 
Bureau of Circulations, a move that will 
help strengthen publisher relationships 
and should improve underlying demand 
from publishers for airline sales. 
The digital side of the division is managed 
through a joint venture with Bluebox 
Avionics. We are now supplying over 8,000 
iPads worldwide, boosted by a recent 
contract to supply 1,500 units to Hawaiian 
Airlines, our first entry into the US market. 
Other contract gains this year include supply 
to Aeromexico, Primera, and Jetairfly. 
Disposal of MMC
In April, we took the decision to dispose 
of Marketlink Marketing Communications 
Limited (‘MMC’), the division’s small 
marketing fulfilment and merchandising 
arm. MMC was a legacy from the Group’s 
acquisition of Dawson Holdings PLC with 
minimal synergy to other activities in the 
division or the wider Group. After careful 
review we concluded the business was 
not complementary to our strategy. 
Future plans
We aim to increase sales and profitability 
of DMD, with a focus on winning business 
in those areas where we already operate, 
while improving the productivity of existing 
operations. Our priorities are to:
 – Win further contracts to supply printed 
media, targeting those routes with 
greatest overlap to current operations, and 
specific locations of international growth.
 – Enhance our digital services by 
developing offers for both the premium 
and economy digital travel market.
 – Improve further the quality of our logistics 
operation and back office functions, 
reducing costs, improving standards 
and ensuring we deliver demonstrably 
better service than competitors.

Helping the 
Mirror take 
flight
Most publishers would be delighted to 
reach an extra 30,000 readers as a 
result of distributing complementary 
newspapers in airports. That’s exactly 
what Trinity Mirror has achieved, thanks 
to Dawson Media Direct. 
The Daily Mirror is now distributed free of 
charge at Stansted and Luton airports, 
where the majority of passengers fall 
firmly within its target demographic. 
Dawson Media Direct installed 
dispensing machines in the airport 
departure lounges, at a point where 
travellers are unable to purchase a 
newspaper from any other outlet. As a 
consequence, the Mirror’s readership 
has grown substantially at these 
locations, helping to swell its ABC 
figures and attract new readers. 
As well as bringing in extra revenue for 
Dawson Media Direct, the deal helps 
raise awareness throughout the industry 
about the value of the Company’s 
services in growing circulation and 
reaching new markets. 26 Smiths News PLC

Corporate responsibility report
What is our approach to corporate responsibility?
We’re committed to acting responsibly towards our 
people, the environment, and the communities in which 
our businesses operate. We also help the industries we 
work in to develop and share best practice so that we 
can all play our part in acting responsibly.
Workplace: creating the 
best possible working 
environment
We work hard to develop our people, 
providing them with every opportunity to 
achieve their goals. Our Talent Strategy gives 
staff throughout the Group an opportunity 
to identify and pursue progression routes, 
while our engagement surveys ensure 
that the workforce has a clear line of 
communication with the management team. 
Our Human Resources policies are 
reviewed at least annually, ensuring they 
are consistent with legal requirements 
and best practice. We communicate 
changes to managers and employees 
across the Group so that they have 
the most up-to-date information about 
the policies that affect them.
Marketplace: driving 
industry best practice
The breadth of our distribution networks 
is an important means of discharging 
our duties to the markets we serve. For 
example, Smiths News ensures that a 
diverse range of print media is available even 
in the country’s remotest places, while The 
Consortium provides schools, care homes 
and early years providers across the UK 
with the right equipment for their needs.
The extent of our reach means we 
have a responsibility to be transparent, 
and to ensure the highest standards in 
our supply chain. We thus work with 
industry associations to develop codes 
of practice that safeguard the interests 
of suppliers, retailers and consumers, as 
well as helping to identify and implement 
appropriate governance and regulatory 
procedures in our key markets. 
A key focus for this year has been 
redevelopment of the News Industry Charter. 
The Group played an active role in this 
process, and the Charter was relaunched 
in March 2013, following a review by the 
Independent Chairman, Michel Woodman. 
Environment: treading 
more lightly on our planet
Across the Group, we work hard to 
minimise energy consumption and 
reduce our carbon emissions. 
Our efforts have contributed to a carbon 
reduction performance, of 4% in FY2013. 
This follows a reduction of 4% in the 
previous year, and 8% in FY2011.
In 2013 we were ranked in the top 5% of 
companies in the Government’s Carbon 
Reduction Commitment (CRC) scheme – 
a noteworthy achievement in light of our 
large-scale operation and dependence 
on traditional methods of transport. 
Accreditation by the Carbon Trust plays 
an important role in signposting our 
environmental commitments. Not only 
does it alert staff to the importance 
of acting responsibly in relation to the 
environment, but it also serves as an 
objective assessment of our credentials 
in this area. We have a programme of 
activity and initiatives across the Group 
aimed at reducing our impact on the 
environment. In addition to periodic 
review of these by the Group Executive 
and Board, they are captured and 
monitored as part of our data and evidence 
submission to the Carbon Trust.
We were therefore pleased to be 
successfully reaccredited for the Carbon 
Trust Standard in September 2012. Our 
next evaluation will be in February 2014, 
giving us every incentive to continue 
striving for the highest standards of 
environmental care across the Group.

policies, please visit www.smithsnews.co.uk
 
‘We work hard to develop our 
people, providing them with 
every opportunity to achieve 
their goals.’
We set ourselves annual goals in four 
key areas: workplace, marketplace, 
environment and community. 
The Board and Group Executive take a 
hands-on role in measuring performance in 
Corporate Responsibility. They set annual 
performance targets in our four focal areas, 
and the Corporate Responsibility Committee 
oversees progress towards achieving them. 
The Corporate Responsibility Committee 
reports to the Group Executive at least 
twice per year and the Board annually. 
In addition, a report on health and safety 
is provided to the Group Executive on 
a monthly basis and considered at the 
following Board meeting; further reports on 
environmental emissions and monitoring, 
and others matters of importance in 
Community, Marketplace and Workplace, 
are provided to the Group Executive and 
Board, as necessary throughout the year. 28 Smiths News PLC
our way of giving something back to society, 
and sharing the fruits of our success as 
widely as possible. We will continue to find 
ways of doing this that inspire our staff to 
give time and money in the service of others.
 
Health & Safety
The Group aspires to maintain the 
highest standards of health & safety, so 
as to protect our employees, customers, 
contractors, and members of the public. 
Following last year’s appointment of 
a Group Head of Health and Safety, 
the Group Executive and Board have 
adopted a strategy to deliver a step 
change in our health & safety culture, 
performance and practice by 2015. 
The introduction of a Group-wide risk 
management and compliance tool 
(‘Safeguard’) will help us to improve 
further our monitoring and management 
of health & safety incidents, as well as 
audits, risk assessments, and associated 
remedial or preventative actions.
A summary report of Group health & 
safety performance is provided to the 
Group Executive each month, and the 
Audit Committee and Board conduct 
regular reviews of incidents, trends and 
overall performance. The result is a clear 
focus on health & safety throughout 
the Group, providing a firm base from 
which to achieve our improvement 
targets over the coming years.

Community: giving back 
to society
The Group interacts with a vast number 
of communities throughout the UK, 
and we are dedicated to enhancing 
life for the people in them. That is why 
we encourage and empower our staff 
to contribute to the wider society.
We have continued to develop our 
community programme so that its focus 
on fundraising is augmented by greater 
voluntaryism and hands-on involvement 
by our staff in charitable works.
Our Community Link-Up initiative empowers 
staff at every level of the Group to give time 
to worthy causes. We encourage staff to 
identify their own commitments, which 
range from helping with local youth groups 
to visiting elderly people in care homes, or 
raising money for charitable organisations.
This year the Group has sponsored two 
literacy schemes, run in partnership with 
the Bath Rugby Foundation and the 
National Literacy Trust. Each programme 
encourages young people to read more 
widely, helping to develop their literacy skills 
and encouraging a love of books. We free 
up staff to give time to volunteer on these 
programmes, so they can deliver training 
events in schools and libraries alongside 
specialists from the two schemes. 
Ultimately, the focus of our charity work is on 
the people who benefit from our efforts. It is

Responsibility  
in action
Supporting 
children with 
literacy
Literacy plays an important role and is a 
common theme across our Group. This 
year we’ve invested in two programmes that 
encourage and help children improve their 
literacy skills as well as providing employees 
with the opportunities to volunteer.
Bertrams has partnered with the National 
Literacy Trust to deliver The Young 
Readers Programme in Norwich-based 
schools. The programme encourages 
children to read for enjoyment, as well 
as teaching them important skills. 
The Consortium and Smiths News have 
been working closely with the Bath Rugby 
Foundation to deliver a new and exciting 
literacy programme called Stickability. 
Based on a sticker reward system, the 
programme helps children aged 9 to 10 
develop their literary ability and confidence, 
this scheme provides classroom based 
activity as well as a physical element.
Vicky Heslop, Education Manager 
at Bath Rugby, says ‘Stickability 
has been a huge success so far, it’s 
had such a positive impact on the 
children we have worked with.’ 29 Smiths News PLC

Group football tournament
It’s all about 
‘Linking-Up’
Our Community Programme has grown 
substantially over the last few years and 
this year we launched Community Link-Up, 
a new initiative that combined fundraising, 
volunteering and staff Linking-Up – in 
their workplace or in their community. 
Staff feedback told us that we needed to 
provide employees with fun ways to do this, 
so this year Jonathan Bunting, Managing 
Director at Smiths News, hosted the 
company’s first ever football tournament. 
The event involved teams from across the 
Group, it gave staff an opportunity to meet 
their colleagues from other locations.
Meeting global 
standards
An endorsement of our ongoing work in 
Corporate Responsibility comes in the form 
of our inclusion in the FTSE4Good index.
This equity index series is designed to 
facilitate investment in companies that 
meet globally recognised Corporate 
Responsibility standards. After a 
recent process of reassessment, 
the Group’s ongoing inclusion in this 
index was confirmed, evidencing our 
adherence to stringent environmental, 
social and governance criteria.
Another initiative was the introduction of 
Link-Up fortnight, which gave employees 
the opportunity to ‘Link-Up’ in their 
working environment no matter where 
they work or which part of the Group 
they work in. We encouraged staff to 
organise events that enabled staff to get 
to know each other better as well as better 
understand what other departments do.
Another first, this year’s bike ride hit 
foreign soil as staff cycled from Paris 
to Swindon for charity. The bike ride 
was a great success, with cyclists from 
across the Group and of varying abilities 
raising over £20,000 for charity. 30 Smiths News PLC
What is our approach to corporate responsibility?
Putting people first
Across the Group, we know that our 
people are our greatest asset. Without 
their effort and commitment, we would 
not be able to deliver market‑ leading 
service in our chosen markets. 
We work hard to develop our team, giving 
them every opportunity to shine. We 
identify those with potential, and help 
them to grow with the business. That 
way, all of our personnel are given every 
chance to develop their career in a way 
that stimulates and inspires them. 
We also recognise the value of appointing 
from outside the Group, drawing in people 
who offer a fresh perspective on our way 
of working. Our recruitment practices 
therefore look to attract the very best talent 
from other industries and organisations, 
as well as considering internal applicants. 
As a result, we have a broad range of 
experience at Board and Group Executive 
level, and throughout the Group. 
Our policy is to create a culture throughout 
the Group that is free from discrimination 
and harassment and we will not permit 
or tolerate discrimination in any form. 
Proper consideration is given to applicants 
for employment from disabled people. 
Should an employee become disabled 
when working for the Group, efforts 
are made to continue their employment 
and provide retraining if necessary.
Nurturing talent
Our Talent Strategy operates at every level 
of the Group. Its origins lie in developing 
our most promising people so that they 
can one day occupy the most senior 
positions in our businesses. We are 
proud that many of our senior vacancies 
are filled by internal candidates.
The benefits of such an approach are that 
we retain good quality people, by giving 
them encouragement and opportunities 
to take on more responsibility. In 
consequence, they develop unparalleled 
expertise in their chosen markets, as well 
as a deep understanding of our culture.
Developing talent is by no means focused 
just on executives. Our goal is a fully 
inclusive programme, tailored to the needs 
of staff at every level. We continue to make 
good progress in pursuing this objective. 
A space to learn
This year saw the launch of ‘My 
Learning Space’ – our online learning 
portal where staff can access a variety 
of development materials, as well as 
booking onto courses and completing 
compulsory training in Health & Safety. 
The merit of the system is that it can be 
accessed around the clock, and enables 
staff to design their own training and ensures 
any compulsory training is completed and 
can be monitored. With a 24-hour operation 
across parts of the Group, including many 
staff working at night, the system will greatly 
increase access to training opportunities.
As well as providing a valuable repository 
of training materials, ‘My Learning Space’ 
will help to engender a habit of self-
directed learning. Augmented by training 
courses and qualifications for staff in their 
particular fields of interest, it provides a 
holistic approach to nurturing our people, 
and making the most of their abilities. 
Graduates and apprentices
Alongside the development opportunities 
we provide for all staff, we also operate 
targeted schemes for personnel.
For graduates, we offer an 18-month 
programme that exposes candidates 
to a wide variety of our business 
activities. This continues to prove 
successful in attracting and retaining 
high-calibre people of great potential. 
Our award-winning apprenticeship 
programme also helps us to develop 
the skills of our workforce. This is 
available not just to school-leavers, but 
to any employee who wishes to study 
for a qualification while working. 
We also offer Modern Apprenticeships 
in a variety of business areas such as IT, 
administration and personnel management. 
Staff engagement
Our ‘Team Talk’ engagement survey 
is reviewed on an ongoing basis to 
ensure it delivers the most insightful 
responses. It involves staff in direct 
feedback about the Group’s work and 
results in bespoke action plans that are 
fully owned by the Group Executive.
The response rate for ‘Team Talk’ is 
more than 80%. The positive feedback 
received has prompted us to participate 
on a Group-wide basis in the Best 
Companies Survey in the autumn of 2013. 
The Consortium is already involved in this 
initiative, and recorded its best ever result 
this year and was once again identified 
as ‘One to Watch’ in the rankings. 
We encourage staff interest and 
involvement in the performance of the 
Company. Supporting this goal, we have a 
comprehensive communication programme, 
including monthly newsletters, regular 
updates, briefings on business performance, 
and bespoke materials for other matters 
that affect staff, such as pensions, speak-
up policies, sharesave schemes, etc. 
To encourage and ensure two-way 
communication we consult with staff 
and their representatives, both directly 
and through the Employee Forum. 
Staff can also raise questions through 
a confidential email channel and a well-
publicised confidential ‘speak up’ line is 
available for staff to raise any concerns.  31 Smiths News PLC

Auto-
enrolment 
goes live
The government’s auto‑ enrolment pension programme 
was launched in July 2013, 
and we developed a 
communications campaign 
to disseminate the change 
throughout the workforce. This 
relied on a series of simple, 
impactful messages that were 
issued via a range of media 
to embed understanding 
among our employees at an 
early stage in the process. 
Our strategy was successful in 
raising awareness of pensions, 
and alerting staff across the 
Group to their entitlements 
under the new scheme.  32 Smiths News PLC

Group Executive
Corporate governance 35 Smiths News PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
With this in mind, we are committed to conducting business 
professionally, fairly and with honesty and integrity. These are 
messages which are reinforced and resonate throughout the Group 
and have put the Group in good stead and, this year, we have 
continued to focus on promoting good corporate governance and 
careful stewardship, underpinned by rigorous risk management 
processes to support the effective implementation of our strategy. 
During the year, as part of our health and safety strategy, we further 
developed systems and practices which both encourage a safe 
working culture but also focus attention on common causes of 
incidents and serious injury. As a result of these developments,  
we have seen significant reductions in incidents and related serious 
injuries year-on-year. Indeed, this year we have seen a reduction  
in reportable injuries resulting in over 3 days absence from work  
of 20%.
As a result of the Group’s international expansion in recent years, 
we have welcomed colleagues from many overseas jurisdictions. 
One consequence of this expansion has been the Board’s desire to 
ensure that our governance systems and practices are replicated 
internationally. I am pleased to report that the Group is making good 
progress in this respect and that international governance is at the 
forefront of each business division’s executive team. 
During February and March this year, the Audit Committee 
undertook a full review and competitive tender of external audit 
services and, after careful consideration, recommended the 
reappointment of Deloitte LLP. The Board is pleased with the 
outcome and remains confident that Deloitte’s commitment  
to improving the quality of the audit, fiercely retaining their 
independence and a strengthened client service team will  
enhance the effectiveness of the audit process.
The need for diversity on boards and in senior management  
is clearly on governance agendas at the moment. The Board 
recognises the benefits of diversity and seeks to recruit the 
best-qualified candidates to provide the support and expertise to 
implement the Group’s long-term strategy. Diversity in all its forms, 
be it gender, skill set, cultural background, disability or ethnicity  
is paramount in the Group’s succession planning and, as 
opportunities arise, we will continue to seek candidates who  
help us meet these criteria.
In September 2012, the Financial Reporting Council issued a revised 
UK Corporate Governance Code, effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 October 2012, and revised guidance for 
Audit Committees. In preparing the Corporate Governance report, 
Audit Committee Report and Nominations Committee Report, as a 
move towards full compliance next year, we have chosen to adopt 
early certain disclosures required by the revised Code. Similarly, you 
will see that in the Remuneration Report we have chosen to adopt 
early certain aspects of the new directors’ remuneration reporting 
regulations, which came into force on 1 October 2013 and are 
effective for accounting periods ending on or after 
30 September 2013. 
Finally, further to embed our core values, principles and ethics 
across the Group, we provided all employees with a ‘How We Work’ 
brochure setting out the values and standards expected of them in 
their day-to-day activities. I am sure that this and all of the other 
initiatives we have put in place during the year will further strengthen 
our position as a trusted and respected partner to the suppliers and 
customers with whom we do business and to you, our 
shareholders.

Statement of compliance with the Code
Throughout the year ended 31 August 2013, the Company has 
applied the main principles of and complied with the provisions of 
the Code, which is publicly available at www.frc.org.uk. This report, 
together with the Audit Committee Report on pages 40 and 41, the 
Nominations Committee Report on page 42 and the Remuneration 
Report on pages 43 to 56, describe how the Company has applied 
the main principles of the Code during the year.
Governance framework 
The Group operates within a clear governance framework, which is 
outlined in the diagram below and set out in this report. The Group’s 
risk management framework is described in the risk management 
section on page 38.
The Board
Board composition
On 16 October 2013, the Board comprised the Chairman, three 
executive directors and three independent non-executive directors. 
Short biographies of each of the directors, which illustrate their 
range of experience and qualifications, are set out on pages 32  
and 33. 
There is a clear division of responsibility at the head of the 
Company; Dennis Millard (Chairman) being responsible for running 
the Board and Mark Cashmore (Group Chief Executive) being 
responsible for managing the Group’s businesses and implementing 
Group strategy. The division of responsibilities between the 
Chairman and Group Chief Executive has been set out in writing 
and agreed by the Board. The Board considers that it is of an 
appropriate size to oversee the Group’s businesses, with a structure 
that ensures that no individual or group dominates the decision-
making process.
Dennis Millard, who was non-executive Deputy Chairman until his 
appointment as Chairman on 6 February 2008, met the 
independence criteria set out in the Code on appointment as 
Chairman. Andrew Brent, Anthony Cann and John Worby (Senior 
Independent Director), who served as non-executive directors 
throughout the year and up to the date of this report, meet the 
independence criteria set out in the Code. 
The Chairman’s other directorships are described in his biographical 
details set out on page 32. Between 18 July 2012 and 
21 November 2012 he acted as Interim Executive Chairman of 
Halfords Group plc, whilst Halfords undertook the search for a new 
chief executive. The Board believes that his chairmanship of the 
Company was not adversely affected during this period and is 
satisfied that all of the non-executive directors have sufficient time 
available to be effective members of the Board. 
The Board’s role
The Board is responsible for the overall strategy and performance  
of the Group, and had eight scheduled meetings and one additional 
meeting during the year. It manages the Company through a formal 
schedule of matters reserved for its decision. Such matters include:
 – overall strategic direction and management of the Group, 
including acquisitions and disposals; 
 – approval of long-term objectives and commercial strategy; 
 – approval of the annual operating and capital expenditure budgets;
 – approval of major capital expenditure;
 – approval of material agreements and non-recurring projects;
 – changes relating to the Company’s capital structure; 
 – approval of the accounts;
 – dividend and treasury policies; 
 – control, audit and risk management; 
 – remuneration of directors and senior managers; and 
 – corporate responsibility.
 
Directors
In preparation for Board meetings, information is received by the 
Board in a timely manner and of a quality sufficient for the Board to 
take decisions. 
Corporate governance
Smiths News PLC is committed to achieving and 
maintaining the highest standards of corporate 
governance. The principal governance rules applying 
to UK companies listed on the London Stock 
Exchange, for accounting periods beginning on or 
after 29 June 2010 and before 1 October 2012, are 
contained in the UK Corporate Governance Code  
2010 (the ‘Code’). 37 Smiths News PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
All new directors receive induction training on joining the Board, 
which is tailored to meet the needs of the individual. The induction 
programme is supplemented by ongoing training and development, 
the need for which is regularly assessed by the Board. Resources 
available to the directors include:
 – membership of the Deloitte Academy, a training and guidance 
resource for boards and directors;
 – a programme of head office and business visits;
 – separate presentations by business and functional teams;
 – annual reviews with the Chairman to identify any training and 
development needs;
 – advice and regular updates from the Company Secretary on 
governance, legislative changes affecting the business and their 
duties as a director; and
 – access to independent professional advice at the Company’s 
expense.
The Company’s Articles of Association (the ‘Articles’) require that 
directors offer themselves for re-election every three years and that 
new directors appointed by the Board offer themselves for election 
at the next Annual General Meeting following their appointment. 
However, the Board has agreed that all directors will stand for 
re-election at the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) on 
23 January 2014. This practice was introduced in 2011 and accords 
with the Code (notwithstanding that the Company, which is a 
‘smaller company’ for the purposes of the Code, is not formally 
required to re-elect all directors on an annual basis).
The Board considers that each of the non-executive directors 
contributes external expertise and experience in areas of 
importance to the Group, and in so doing makes an effective and 
valuable contribution to the Board. 
Details of the directors’ service contracts, remuneration, options to 
subscribe for shares in the Company, policy on shareholdings in the 
Company and interests of the directors and their immediate families 
in the share capital of the Company are shown in the Remuneration 
Report on pages 43 to 56.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
The Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must avoid 
situations where he can have a direct or indirect interest that 
conflicts or might conflict with the interests of the Company 
(‘situational conflicts’). The Company’s Articles contain provisions 
that allow the Board to consider and, if it sees fit, to authorise 
situational conflicts.
The Board confirms that such powers have been operated 
effectively and that a formal system for directors to declare their 
interests and for the independent directors to authorise situational 
conflicts continues to be in place. Any authorisations given are 
recorded in the Board minutes and in a register of directors’ 
conflicts which is reviewed annually by the Board.
Board committees
The Board delegates specific responsibilities to its Audit, 
Nominations and Remuneration Committees, each with its own 
formal terms of reference which are reviewed annually and then 
referred to the Board for approval.
Details of the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committees, 
including their role and responsibilities, can be found in the Audit 
Committee Report on pages 40 to 41, the Nominations Committee 
Report on page 42 and the Remuneration Report on pages 43 
to 56. 
The terms of reference for each of the committees are available  
on the Company’s website, www.smithsnews.co.uk, and from the 
Company Secretary on request.

1 There was one additional Board meeting, held by telephone conference call, during 
the year. With the exception of Andrew Brent, all of the directors were in attendance 
on that call.
  
The Board has met twice since 31 August 2013 and both meetings 
were attended by all of the directors. In addition, the Audit 
Committee has met once and the Remuneration Committee has 
met twice since 31 August 2013. 
Evaluation of the Board and its committees
The Board has a formal process for evaluating its performance,  
the performance of its committees and of individual directors. As 
reported in last year’s Annual Report and Accounts, an external 
review of the Board’s performance was conducted by OE Cam 
in 2012.
This year the process took place between July and September and 
consisted of: each director completing an extensive questionnaire 
covering Board and committee procedures and effectiveness and 
individual contributions to Board and committee meetings; a 
one-to-one discussion between the Chairman and each director to 
discuss their contribution and performance during the year and 
training needs, if any; and a meeting of the non-executive directors 
led by the Senior Independent Director to discuss the Chairman’s 
performance and provide feedback. 
The responses to the questionnaire were considered by the Board 
at its September meeting. The evaluation confirmed the conclusion 
drawn from the previous external evaluation that the Board operated 
effectively, robustly and with mutual respect. There were a number 
of actions that were agreed to ensure that the Board, its committees 
and individual directors continue to work effectively, including 
increasing the use of executive summaries to facilitate the most 
efficient use of the Board’s time, and continuing to devote the 
principle part of the Board’s time to strategic imperatives and 
business performance.
 
Internal control and risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for the Company’s system of 
internal control including risk management and for reviewing its 
effectiveness throughout the Group. Such a system is designed to 
manage or mitigate rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 38 Smiths News PLC

Risk management
The Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing significant business risks faced by the 
Company, including those risks relating to social, environmental and 
ethical matters. This process was in place throughout the year 
under review and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report 
and accords with the revised guidance on internal control published 
in October 2005 (the ‘Turnbull Guidance’). The Audit Committee has 
kept under review the effectiveness of the Company’s risk 
management and internal control systems and has reported 
regularly to the Board.
Risk management framework
The Group’s risk management framework is outlined in the  
diagram below.
Risk management process
The key features of the risk management process are as follows:
 – there is an Internal Risk Committee in each business which is 
responsible for monitoring the nature and extent of the risks 
across the business;
 – each business conducts half yearly risk assessments based on 
identified business objectives which are reviewed and agreed by 
its executive management. Risks are categorised into strategic, 
operational, financial and compliance and are evaluated in 
respect of their potential impact and likelihood. These risk 
assessments are reviewed and updated quarterly by its Internal 
Risk Committee and are reported to and reviewed by the 
executive management and the Audit Committee; and 
 – the results of these business risk assessments contribute to the 
development of the risk based annual internal audit plan. Audit 
reports in relation to the areas reviewed are reported to the 
respective Internal Risk Committees and the Audit Committee.
As part of Business Planning, the Board undertook a detailed review 
of its risk appetite in a number of key areas and discussed these at 
its July Board meeting. The results of the review will support decision 
making in the 2013/14 financial year and the Board will continue to 
review its risk appetite annually in light of changes to the economic 
environment, strategic progress and business performance. 
Internal control
The Company has an established framework of internal controls 
covering both financial and non-financial controls, the effectiveness 
of which is regularly reviewed by the Audit Committee on behalf of 
the Board. 
The Board is responsible for: the overall strategic direction and 
management of the Group, including acquisitions and disposals; 
approving long-term objectives and commercial strategy; approving 
the annual operating and capital expenditure budgets; approving 
major capital expenditure; approving material agreements and 
non-recurring projects; changes relating to the Company’s capital 
structure; approving the accounts; dividend and treasury policies; 
control, audit and risk management; remuneration of directors and 
senior managers; and corporate responsibility. 
The Approvals Committee, which comprises the Group Chief 
Executive and Chief Financial Officer, and for commercial 
transactions the relevant member of the executive management, is 
authorised by the Board to approve routine matters within agreed 
financial limits. 
The Board has established an organisational structure with clearly 
defined reporting lines and controls at all levels of management 
across the Group, identifying transactions requiring approval by the 
Board or by the Approvals Committee. The Audit Committee assists 
the Board in the discharge of its duties regarding the Group’s 
financial statements, accounting policies and the maintenance  
of proper systems of risk management and internal control. 
The system of financial control also includes:
 – a comprehensive system of budgeting and planning together  
with monitoring and reporting the performance of the Group’s 
businesses to the Board. Monthly results are reported against 
budget and prior year, and forecasts for the current financial year 
are regularly revised in the light of actual performance. These 
cover profits, cash flows, capital expenditure and balance sheets;
 – a full appraisal of all major investment projects;
 – key controls over major business risks including reviews against 
performance indicators and exception reporting; 
 – monthly reporting of treasury activities and risks, for review by 
senior executives; and
 – annual reports covering treasury policy, pensions and insurance, 
for review by the Board or Audit Committee.
Additional non-financial controls include:
 – key performance indicators to monitor customer service levels in 
each business, with summary level results reported to the Board 
monthly; 
 – independent customer satisfaction surveys;
 – independent employee relations surveys;
 – a corporate responsibility programme which addresses the 
impact of the Company’s activities on the environment, 
workplace, marketplace and community; 
 – a Corporate Responsibility Committee which is responsible for 
reviewing delivery against corporate responsibility objectives, with 
annual updates provided to the Board;
 – an Environmental Policy, which is reviewed annually by the Board;
 – an Anti-Corruption Policy, which is reviewed annually by  
the Board;
 – a Health and Safety Policy, which is reviewed annually by  
the Board; 
Corporate governance continued 39 Smiths News PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
 – Health and Safety Risk Management teams, working with the 
businesses to assess health and safety risks and introduce 
systems to mitigate them. Details of major business incidents  
are reported to the Internal Risk Committees and the Audit 
Committee, and all notified accidents are investigated;
 – reports of the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous 
Occurrence Regulations provided to the Board on a regular basis;
 – a commitment by the Company to ensure that its personnel meet 
high standards of integrity and competence. The Company’s 
systems cover recruitment, training and development of 
personnel, and the communication of Company policies and 
procedures throughout the organisation;
 – business recovery plans to enable each of the Group’s 
businesses to continue with minimum disruption to customers  
in the event of a disaster. These plans are reviewed by the 
respective business Internal Risk Committee and the  
Audit Committee;
 – an IT Security Policy to protect the Company, its employees and 
affiliates from illegal or damaging actions by third parties;
 – a Code of Business Conduct which takes into account the 
interests of all stakeholders;
 – a Public Interest Disclosure Policy and associated whistleblowing 
speak up line whereby employees can report in confidence 
incidences of suspected fraud; and 
 – a Data Protection Policy setting strict guidelines for the use  
of confidential customer and supplier data.
The Internal Audit team assists in maintaining adequate financial 
controls by reviewing the design and operating effectiveness of core 
financial processes and controls as part of the internal audit plan 
approved by the Audit Committee annually. 
Internal Audit meets annually with senior executives from each of  
the Group’s businesses in order to co-ordinate formal certifications 
from management of the effectiveness of internal controls. These 
certificates are submitted to the respective Internal Risk Committees. 
In turn, the Internal Risk Committees provide a certificate to the Audit 
Committee in order to assist the Board with conducting its annual 
review of the effectiveness of internal controls in compliance with  
the Turnbull Guidance.
The Audit Committee has carried out a review of the effectiveness of 
the Company’s systems of risk management and internal control 
during the year. This assessment considered all significant aspects 
of risk management and internal control arising during the period 
covered by this report including the work of internal audit. During the 
course of this review, the Audit Committee has not identified nor 
been advised of any failings or weaknesses which it has determined 
to be significant. 
 
Relations with shareholders
The Board is responsible for and recognises the importance of 
communicating with the Company’s shareholders to ensure that 
both strategy and performance are understood. This is achieved 
principally through the Company’s website, www.smithsnews.co.uk, 
and the AGM. The website provides a range of information about 
the Company, including Annual Reports, results announcements 
and presentations, AGM information, share price data, the 
Company’s financial calendar and regulatory news releases.
Following the announcement of the Company’s full year and interim 
results, formal presentations are made to institutional shareholders 
by the Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer covering a 
range of key issues affecting the Company’s performance. The 
presentations are available to view on the Company’s website at 
www.smithsnews.co.uk. 
All shareholders have the opportunity to ask questions at the AGM, 
which is normally attended by all of the directors. The notice of the 
AGM is sent to shareholders at least 20 working days before the 
meeting and includes notice of the availability of the Annual Report 
and Accounts on the Company’s website. At the AGM, separate 
resolutions are proposed on each separate issue and shareholders 
vote on each resolution by way of a poll (rather than on a show of 
hands). This ensures that the final result is more democratic as  
the proxy votes are added to the votes of shareholders present,  
who vote all their shares (rather than one vote per shareholder). 
Proxy Forms allow shareholders to vote for or against, or to  
withhold their vote on each resolution, and the results of the poll  
are announced to the London Stock Exchange and published  
on the Company’s website.
The Board as a whole is kept fully informed of the views and 
concerns of major shareholders. The Group Chief Executive and 
Chief Financial Officer update the Board following meetings with 
major shareholders whilst independent feedback from shareholders 
is provided to the Board by the Company’s advisers and brokers. 
The Chairman met with certain major shareholders during the year 
and both he and the Senior Independent Director make themselves 
available to attend meetings with major shareholders.

The Audit Committee is chaired by John Worby. All the members of 
the Audit Committee are independent non-executive directors, with 
the exception of Dennis Millard, who is Chairman of the Board. As 
permitted by the UK Corporate Governance Code (as the Company 
is outside of the FTSE 350), Dennis Millard is a member of the 
Committee. In the light of his extensive financial experience, the 
Board believes that he makes a valuable contribution to the 
Committee and do not consider that his independence presents  
any issue or concern. 
John Worby, who is a member of the Financial Reporting Review 
Panel, and until March of this year was the Group Finance Director 
of Genus plc, is considered by the Board to have recent and 
relevant experience to chair the Committee. Each of the other 
members of the Committee has extensive business experience.
Role and responsibilities
The role and responsibilities of the Committee are set out in its 
terms of reference, which are available on the Company’s website, 
www.smithsnews.co.uk, and from the Company Secretary on 
request. The terms of reference, which address all matters set out  
in Disclosure and Transparency Rule 7.1 and the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, are reviewed annually by the Committee and 
then referred to the Board for approval. The principal responsibilities 
of the Committee are: 
 – monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial statements and 
any other announcements relating to the Group’s financial 
performance and reviewing significant financial reporting issues 
and judgements contained therein;
 – reviewing the content of the Annual Report and Accounts and 
advising the Board whether, taken as a whole, it is fair, balanced

shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy;
 – keeping under review the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
control and risk management systems; 
 – monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
audit function in the context of the Group’s overall risk 
management system;
 – considering and making recommendations to the Board as to the 
appointment, reappointment or removal of the external auditor 
and the approval of their remuneration and terms of engagement;
 – assessing the external auditor’s independence and objectivity and 
the effectiveness of the audit process, taking into consideration 
relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements;
 – reviewing the policy on the engagement of the external auditor to 
supply non-audit services, taking into account relevant 
professional and regulatory guidance and monitoring compliance; 
 – ensuring the Company maintains suitable arrangements for 
employees to raise matters of concern in confidence 
(‘whistleblowing’); and
 – reviewing the Group’s systems and controls for the prevention  
of bribery.
The Audit Committee is required to report its findings to the Board, 
identifying any matters in respect of which it considers that action  
or improvement is needed, and make recommendations as to the 
steps to be taken.
Meetings
The Committee met four times during the year to consider an 
agenda planned around the Group’s financial calendar. All 
Committee members were in attendance at each of the meetings.
At the invitation of the Committee, the Group Chief Executive, Chief 
Financial Officer, Managing Director Smiths News, Group Head of 
Internal Audit and representatives of the external auditor attend its 
meetings. Other members of the executive management teams 
attend meetings from time to time to present reports specific  
to their areas of responsibility.
The Committee met twice with the external auditor without 
management present and held a separate private meeting with  
the Group Head of Internal Audit.
The Committee has met once since 31 August 2013. 
Activities during the year
Detailed below is an overview of the key areas considered by the 
Committee during the year ended 31 August 2013 and up to the 
date of this report.
Financial reporting
During the year the Committee reviewed reports from the Chief 
Financial Officer and the external auditor on matters of significance 
in relation to the financial statements for the half year and the full 
year to 31 August 2013; this included consideration of the key 
estimates and judgements made in preparing the financial 
statements. It also reviewed the content of the Interim Financial 
Report for the half year to 28 February 2013 and the Annual Report 
and Accounts for the year to 31 August 2013 to ensure that it 
provided the necessary information to provide shareholders with  
a fair and balanced assessment of the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
Details of the significant issues/key judgements considered by  
the Committee in relation to the 2013 financial statements are  
as follows:
Going concern – A review of the Group’s bank facilities, profit and 
cash forecasts to confirm it can operate within the level of its current 
financing for the foreseeable future.
 
Business combinations and goodwill – The carrying value of 
acquisitions including whether there has been any impairment 
based on a review annually or whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. In addition, consideration was given to the accounting 
for deferred consideration relating to the Consortium acquisition.
 
Property contracts – Management’s estimation of the exposure to 
operating and contingent leases and whether the provisions held 
are reasonable in the circumstances.
 
Taxation – That the Group has adequately provided for known tax 
risks (both UK and overseas) based upon the best estimate of the 
economic outflow.
 
Audit Committee report 41 Smiths News PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Retirement benefit obligation – That the Group recognises and 
discloses its retirement benefit obligation in accordance with the 
measurement and presentational requirement of IAS 19 and 
IFRIC 14. Particular consideration was given to the accounting for 
commitments under the schedule of contributions agreed with the 
trustees of the pension scheme as discussed in Notes 6 and 34 to 
the Accounts.
Inventories and Trade Receivables – That the carrying value and 
management estimates of inventories and receivables across 
individual Group businesses are stated at appropriate value and 
provisions are sufficient.
Non-recurring and other items – The appropriateness of the 
classification of items separately disclosed as non-recurring and 
other items.
 
Internal control and risk management
The Audit Committee is responsible for keeping under review the 
effectiveness of the Company’s risk management and internal 
control systems. During the year, the Committee reviewed the key 
risks facing the Group, including risk maps and various legal and 
regulatory risk reports. It also considered reports from the Head of 
Internal Audit on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
controls.
As a result of this work, the Committee reported to the Board that it 
was not aware of any significant deficiencies or material weakness 
in the Company’s systems of internal control.
During the year the Committee also received and reviewed reports 
on the Company’s treasury, taxation and insurance activities and 
related policies.
External auditor
Under its terms of reference, the Committee is responsible for 
assessing the scope, fee, objectivity and effectiveness of external 
audits, and for making a recommendation to the Board regarding 
the appointment, reappointment or removal of the external auditor 
on an annual basis.
Deloitte LLP’s (‘Deloitte’) original term of engagement is regarded as 
having commenced on 31 August 2006, being the date of demerger 
of old WH Smith PLC and, in line with professional standards, it has 
a policy of rotating partners every five years.
To assess the effectiveness of the external auditor, each member  
of the Committee and the Chief Financial Officer completed an 
extensive questionnaire covering matters such as the external 
auditor’s processes for internal review of accounting judgements, 
including understanding of the key issues; the delivery and 
execution of the audit plan; and the robustness and perceptiveness 
of the external auditor. Areas for improvement were identified and 
communicated to Deloitte for action. 
As signalled in last year’s Annual Report and Accounts, a tender for 
external audit services was held during the year. Three audit firms 
were invited to tender, including the current incumbent, Deloitte.  
A panel, including the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the 
Chief Financial Officer, considered a written submission and oral 
presentation from each of the firms, as a result of which the  
Audit Committee recommended to the Board the reappointment  
of Deloitte. 
The Committee has a formal policy on the Company’s relationship 
with the external auditor, which includes financial approval limits for 
non-audit services and restrictions on the nature of work that can 
be performed to ensure that the external auditor’s objectivity  
is not impaired. The prior approval of the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee is required if the cost of non-audit work is likely to 
exceed £20,000 per annum. Deloitte are retained as the Company’s 
independent remuneration adviser and during the year also 
provided separate advice on the Group’s digital strategy project  
(as noted in last year’s Annual Report) and on European wide cash 
pooling. The Committee is satisfied that Deloitte has adequate 
safeguards in place, including separate engagement teams led by 
separate engagement partners, to ensure that its independence is 
not impaired. The fees paid to Deloitte during the year in respect of 
audit and non-audit services are shown in Note 3 to the Accounts.
The Committee is satisfied that Deloitte continue to provide an 
effective audit service and has recommended to the Board that  
they be reappointed. Accordingly, a resolution to reappoint Deloitte 
will be put to shareholders at the AGM. 
 
Internal audit function
The Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the 
effectiveness of the internal audit function in the context of the 
Group’s overall risk management system. The Company’s Head  
of Internal Audit is responsible for the overall management of  
internal audit.
 
In fulfilling its responsibilities, the Committee has reviewed the 
following in the period:
 – the scope, resource and activities of the internal audit function;
 – Internal Audit’s plans and its achievement of the planned activity;
 – a summary of the reports on the results of individual audit 
reviews, significant findings, management action plans, and 
timeliness of resolution; and
 – the performance of the internal auditors.
Whistleblowing and fraud
During the year the Committee reviewed the arrangements by  
which incidences of suspected fraud or other malpractices can be 
reported. The Group operates a telephone hotline whereby 
employees can report in confidence suspected incidences of fraud 
or non-compliance with Group policies and practices. All such 
incidences are investigated by Internal Audit and/or management 
and reported to the respective business’s Internal Risk Committee 
and the Audit Committee. On completion of an investigation findings 
are reported to the appropriate Internal Risk Committee and the 
Audit Committee. 
Overview
In carrying out the activities outlined above, the Committee has 
acted in accordance with its terms of reference. It has also ensured 
the independence and objectivity of the external auditor, and has 
assisted the Board in its review of the Annual Report and Accounts 
2013, including the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal 
control and risk management.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee will be available at the AGM 
to answer any questions about the work of the Committee.

(in March 2013).
In addition, the Committee is scheduled to meet in December 2013 
(postponed from September 2013 due to the appointment of the 
new Group Human Resources Director) to consider the following:
 – review Board and Group Executive succession plans;
 – review the Group’s diversity policy; 
 – review its own effectiveness; 
 – review the outcome and expressions of opinion from the recent 
Board evaluation in relation to non-executive director succession 
planning and the skills, expertise and knowledge which might 
enhance the Board’s performance; and
 – review and approve its terms of reference.
 There were no new appointments to the Board during the year.
Diversity
The Board considers itself diverse in terms of the background, skills 
and experience each director brings to the Board.
The Nominations Committee recognises the benefits to the Group 
of diversity and, in accordance with its terms of reference, when 
considering any new appointment to the Board, will evaluate the 
balance of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity, including 
gender on the Board, and, in the light of this evaluation prepare a 
description of the role and capabilities required for a particular 
appointment. When making an appointment, the Board prefers to 
select the best-qualified candidate to provide it with the support and 
expertise required to implement the Group’s long-term strategy, 
rather than to fulfil any fixed quota.
The Company has reviewed diversity in the context of gender, 
ethnicity and disability across all businesses in the Group and was 
pleased to note that:
 – there is 25% female representation on the Group Executive Board;
 – excluding those Managing Directors who are also members of the 
Group Executive Board, there is 50% female representation on 
the Smiths News Executive Board and 20% female representation 
across all of the Group’s executive boards; and
 – across the Group, female representation in management roles is 
31%, which is in line with the Group’s total population, where 
females represent 36% of all employees. This compares very 
favourably with the logistics industry average, where less than 
10% of managerial roles are held by women.

Nominations Committee report 43 Smiths News PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Dear Shareholder
During the year, we undertook a comprehensive review of our 
executive remuneration arrangements, consulted with our major 
shareholders and investor representative bodies and, in the light  
of those consultations, implemented a number of changes. The 
context, rationale and details of those changes are set out below. 
Context and rationale for changes
During the last year, the Committee felt it was necessary to 
undertake a full review since it is over six years after our demerger 
and the executives’ packages were still largely reflective of when 
Smiths News was a division of WH Smith PLC with a single 
business, not a listed company with several businesses. We wanted 
to assess market competitiveness and align with best practice,  
in light of the significant change in the complexity and size of  
the Group.
The review and shareholder consultation resulted in a number of 
changes to the package, which was prepared and should be 
considered with the following context in mind: 
 – Strong performance. Performance over the period from 
demerger to date has been strong. In particular, over the last  
year: underlying profit before tax is up to £53m; EPS is up to 
22.4p; and our market capitalisation has increased significantly  
to over £340m.
 – Exceptional leadership. Smiths News is a high-performing 
organisation and has a high-performing team of individuals 
leading it. We want to retain that leadership through the next 
phase of Smiths News’ growth. It should be noted that, apart 
from a change of Finance Director three years ago, following 
retirement of the previous incumbent and the addition of the head 
of The Consortium business, the entire executive team have 
remained committed and loyal to the Company throughout. This 
has been a major factor in the success of the business and one 
we are keen to perpetuate. 
 – Changing shape of the business. There has, since demerger, 
been a significant change in the complexity and size of the Group. 
Although we have made changes since the demerger, these have 
largely been to bring arrangements more in line with the market, 
rather than bring them up to the levels that we think are 
appropriate for the business now. 
 – Appropriate, responsible and balanced approach to pay. 
As a result of the review, the Committee felt some areas of the 
packages were generous, but in other areas, they were not 
adequately rewarding or incentivising, nor retentive enough. In 
terms of overall positioning on pay, the changes would bring our 
executive directors to around market median. Furthermore, we 
would not envisage making any further significant adjustments 
over the next couple of years.
 – Shareholder consultation. We consulted widely with 
shareholders on the changes and were pleased with the measure 
of support received. All supported many of the changes and 
some were fully supportive of all the changes. We listened to  
all the feedback and addressed specific concerns raised, by 
implementing phased salary increases and reinforcing our 
shareholding requirements. 
Changes to executive remuneration
In light of the background and rationale above, we are increasing 
executive salaries (on a phased basis), to bring them to broadly 
market competitive levels. However, they will still be below a number 
of our competitors (some of which are significantly smaller than 
Smiths News). At the same time, we are proposing a number of 
other changes (including reducing pension benefits significantly),  
as set out below:
 – Increase in executive director salaries phased in over two 
years (
2
/3rds in the first year and 
1
/3rd in the second year) 
but balanced by a significant reduction in Company 
pension benefits (all taken in the first year). 
•	 Group Chief Executive salary increases from £329,500 to 
£420,000 (+27%) but with Company pension benefits reduced 
from 30% to 20%, so the overall net increase is +17.7%.
•	 Chief Financial Officer salary increases from £237,500 to 
£280,000 (+17.9%) but with Company pension benefits reduced 
from 25% to 20%, so the overall net increase is +13.1%.
•	 Smiths News Managing Director salary increases from 
£250,000 to £280,000 (+12%) but with Company pension 
benefits reduced from 25% to 20%, so the overall net increase 
is +7.5%. 
 – Decrease pension benefits (30%/25% to 20% of salary). 
Following the market review, the Committee felt it appropriate to 
bring pension benefits more in line with the market. This has 
resulted in a reduction to 20% of salary for all executive directors 
(from 30% of salary for the Group Chief Executive and from 25% 
of salary for the other executive directors).

 – Increase in deferral into shares (33% to 50%). To increase 
retention and alignment with shareholders, half of any bonus 
(currently a third) will now be deferred into shares for two years.
 – No change in maximum incentive opportunities. This 
remains at 100% of salary for our annual incentive and 100%  
of salary for long-term incentives, for all executive directors. 
Although this is less than in some comparable companies and  
we might like to have increased this for the long-term incentive  
to increase the incentivisation and shareholder alignment, these 
levels seem to be generally in line with companies of similar 
market capitalisation.
 – Long-term incentive measurement. At present, the long-term 
incentive is split between the Economic Profit Plan and the 
Long-term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) (which has EPS targets). We 
considered changing these but concluded they were appropriate.
 – Removal of liquidated damages provision under change of 
control for Group Chief Executive. The Committee believes 
that any question of compensation should be decided upon at the 
appropriate time rather than in advance so that the principle of 
mitigation is applied in the particular circumstances. This was the 
only provision across all of our executive directors’ service 
contracts which was not in line with that philosophy and best 
practice, and we addressed this by removing the clause.
 – Introduction of best practice features. This includes 
clawback provisions across our annual bonus plan, economic 
profit plan and LTIP, already introduced in the last financial year. It 
is also proposed to introduce dividend equivalents, further to align 
with shareholders’ interests (see page 53 for further details and 
also Resolution 14 of our AGM Notice).
 – Reinforcement of shareholding guidelines. In line with best 
practice and in the absence of special circumstances, executive 
directors are required to build up shareholdings of ordinary 
shares, over a period of 5 years since we introduced the policy or 
appointment, to at least 1.5 times salary with restrictions on sales 
of shares until the level is reached. 
Remuneration report continued
The Committee believes these changes represent an appropriate, 
reasonable and balanced approach to executive remuneration. We 
believe that they are in the in best interests of the Company, and will 
contribute towards successful execution of the business strategy 
and shareholder value.
Executive remuneration for FY2013/14
Following the review outlined above, the Committee does not 
expect to make significant changes to the executive remuneration 
arrangements in the coming year. Currently, the only change 
expected will be the second phase of the salary increases, which 
will be effective as from January 2014. 
The following table provides an executive summary of the executive 
remuneration arrangements expected to apply for Executive 
Directors for the financial year ending 31 August 2014:

New reporting regulations
The Committee welcomes the introduction of revised reporting 
regulations. These will be adopted, in full, as required, for the 
2013/14 Remuneration Report. Although not required for this year 
because our year end is 31 August, the Committee has nevertheless 
adopted some elements early in this year’s report as a matter of 
best practice. 
Concluding remarks
The Committee takes an active interest in and welcomes 
shareholders’ views. We also pay close attention to the voting on 
the Remuneration Report and hope to receive your support at the 
forthcoming AGM. 
Anthony Cann 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 45 Smiths News PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Introduction
This report has been prepared on behalf of the Board by the 
Remuneration Committee, in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006, Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-
sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
2008 and the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
As mentioned in the Chairman’s Annual Statement, the Committee 
has chosen to adopt early certain aspects of the revised directors’ 
remuneration reporting regulations (which came into force on 
1 October 2013 and are effective for accounting periods ending  
on or after 30 September 2013) in this year’s report. The report is 
therefore divided into three sections, an Annual Statement by the 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, an Annual Report on 
Remuneration, which sets out what has been paid and awarded or 
vested during the year, and Directors’ Remuneration Policy, which 
sets out our future remuneration policy. As the auditors are required 
to give an opinion on whether certain parts of the report have been 
prepared in accordance with the accounting regulations, the report 
is also divided into audited and unaudited information. 
Shareholders will be asked to approve the report, by way of a single 
advisory vote, at the AGM on 23 January 2014 
Annual report on remuneration – unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Anthony Cann and its 
other members throughout the year were Andrew Brent, Dennis 
Millard and John Worby. Anthony Cann, Andrew Brent and John 
Worby are all independent non-executive directors and Dennis 
Millard was independent on appointment as Chairman. The 
Committee met seven times during the year and each meeting  
was attended by all Committee members. 
The Committee’s terms of reference, which are available on the 
Company’s website and from the Company Secretary on request, 
set out the responsibilities of the Committee which include:
 – determining and agreeing with the Board the broad policy for the 
remuneration of the Chairman, executive directors and certain 
other senior executives;
 – reviewing the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of the 
remuneration policy;
 – reviewing the policy for any performance related pay schemes 
operated for those below executive management level and 
approving total annual payments made under all performance 
related pay schemes;
 – reviewing the design of all short and long-term incentive plans for 
approval by the Board and, where required, by shareholders;
 – determining the policy for the grant of share incentives to 
executive directors and senior executives, setting appropriate 
performance targets and approving the quantum of grants and 
vesting schedules; 
 – ensuring that contractual terms on termination, and any payments 
made, are fair to the individual and the Company, that failure is not 
rewarded and that the duty to mitigate loss is fully recognised; and
 – determining the total individual remuneration package of each 
executive director and other senior executives including bonuses 
and share incentives.
During the year the Committee received external advice and 
services from its independent adviser, Deloitte LLP (‘Deloitte’). 
Deloitte also provided audit services to the Company and separate 
advice on the Group’s digital strategy project and on European wide 
cash pooling. The Committee is satisfied that Deloitte has adequate 
safeguards in place, including separate engagement teams led by 
separate engagement partners, to ensure that its independence is 
not impaired. Glenn Leech, who was Group Human Resources 
Director until 5 August 2013, also materially assisted the Committee 
in carrying out its duties, except in relation to his own remuneration. 46 Smiths News PLC

Directors’ Remuneration Policy – unaudited information
The Company’s remuneration policy is designed to support the delivery of the Group’s strategy by ensuring that a strong link between 
performance and reward is maintained.
The aims of the policy are to:
 – encourage a performance-based culture, by ensuring that a significant proportion of total remuneration is variable and aligned to delivery 
of the Group’s key strategic objectives;
 – attract and retain high calibre executive directors and senior managers with the necessary skills to deliver the Group’s strategy;
 – align the interests of executive directors and senior managers with those of shareholders by incentivising management to deliver the 
Group’s strategy and thereby deliver growing and sustainable shareholder returns; and
 – ensure that remuneration arrangements support the sustainable delivery of performance and do not inadvertently encourage undue  
risk taking.
 
In forming this policy the Committee has adopted the principles set out in Section D of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The policy is implemented by:
 – paying base salaries that take into account a range of factors, including the size and scope of the individual’s responsibilities and 
prevailing market rates for similar positions in companies of similar size and complexity;
 – enabling executives to enhance earnings by meeting and exceeding challenging short-term and longer-term targets, which support 
Company strategy and shareholder interests;
 – requiring executives to build up and maintain significant shareholdings in the Company; and
 – including malus and clawback provisions, as appropriate, in the Annual Bonus Plan, Economic Profit Plan (‘EPP’) and LTIP.
In line with the Association of British Insurers’ Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee will ensure that the 
incentive structure for executive directors and senior management will not raise environmental, social or governance (‘ESG’) risks by 
inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour. More generally, with regard to the overall remuneration structure, there is no restriction  
on the Committee which prevents it from taking into account corporate governance on ESG matters. 
For the year under review, the overall maximum incentive opportunity for each of the executive directors was 200% of base salary. This 
comprised an annual bonus opportunity of 100% of salary, an economic profit bonus opportunity of 50% of salary and an LTIP opportunity 
of 50% of salary. This will remain the same for FY2013/14. 
As explained in the Annual Statement at the beginning of this report, as part of the review of executive directors’ remuneration carried out 
during the year, it has been decided to increase the proportion of the annual bonus paid in the form of deferred shares from 33% to 50%.
The Annual Bonus Plan, EPP and LTIP are described in more detail on pages 52 to 54. 52 Smiths News PLC

Fixed and variable remuneration FY2013/14
The charts below show the expected relative value at target and maximum performance levels of the fixed and variable (performance-
related) elements of the executive directors’ remuneration package for the financial year ending 31 August 2014. 
Salary and benefits
The salaries of executive directors are reviewed annually in December, with any new salaries normally taking effect from 1 January.  
When conducting any review, the Committee takes into account a range of factors including the Group’s performance, changing size and 
complexity, market conditions, the prevailing market rates for similar positions in a comparable group of companies, the responsibilities, 
individual performance and experience of each executive director and the level of salary increases awarded to employees throughout  
the Group. 
Following the comprehensive review of executive remuneration arrangements carried out during the year, a number of changes were 
implemented. They included a phased increase in salaries over two years balanced by a significant reduction in pension benefits (taken 
over one year). The context and rationale for these changes is set out in the Annual Statement at the beginning of this report. The following 
salaries are applicable from 1 January 2013 and from 1 January 2014;
Executive director 1 September 2012 Effective from 1 January 2013 Effective from 1 January 2014
Mark Cashmore £329,500 £390,000 (+18.4%) £420,000 (+7.7%) 
Nick Gresham £237,500 £267,500 (+12.6%) £280,000 (+4.7%)
Jonathan Bunting £250,000 £270,000 (+8.0%) £280,000 (+3.7%)
Executive directors also receive taxable benefits including the provision of a company car and private medical insurance.
The fees paid to non-executive directors are determined by the Chairman and the executive members of the Board and take into account 
the required time commitment and the fee payments for non-executive directors of similar organisations. Current policy is to pay non-
executive directors a basic fee of £35,000 p.a. plus £5,000 p.a. for chairing a Board committee. There were no changes to the fees paid  
to non-executive directors during the year under review. Non-executive directors do not participate in any bonus or share schemes.
Annual Bonus Plan 
For the year under review, the level of bonus paid is dependent on the achievement of a Group underlying profit before tax target (70%)  
and on personal performance (30%), set at the beginning of the financial year. Target level is based on the achievement of stretching 
performance; maximum level requires performance significantly beyond market expectations. For Jonathan Bunting, who has divisional 
responsibility for Smiths News, personal performance takes account of the performance against budget of Smiths News.
 
Each executive director had the opportunity to receive an annual bonus up to a maximum of 100% of base salary (42.5% at target level), 
one third of which is payable in the form of shares, the receipt of which is deferred for two years (see Deferred Bonus Plan below). 
As a result of exceeding the target Group profit before tax of £51.6m and personal performance, Mark Cashmore’s annual bonus for  
the year under review is £261,534, representing 67.1% of salary, Nick Gresham’s annual bonus for the year under review is £192,761, 
representing 72.1% of salary and Jonathan Bunting’s annual bonus for the year under review is £194,562, representing 72.1% of salary.  
Of these bonuses, two thirds will be paid in cash in November 2013 and one third will be paid in the form of shares.
For FY2013/14, for Mark Cashmore and Nick Gresham, the level of bonus paid is dependent on the achievement of a Group underlying 
profit before tax target (70%), strategic targets (15%) and personal performance (15%). For Jonathan Bunting, the level of bonus paid is 
dependent on the achievement of a Group underlying profit before tax target (35%), a Smiths News profit before tax target (35%), strategic 
targets (15%) and personal performance (15%). The maximum annual bonus opportunity will remain the same, however, the proportion  
of bonus paid in the form of deferred shares will increase from 33% to 50%.

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
In the event of a material misstatement of the financial results, the Committee reserves the right to take such action as it reasonably 
considers appropriate to put the Company and participants in substantially the same overall financial position as they would have been  
had the misstatement not occurred. 
Economic Profit Plan 
Under this plan, which was introduced in 2008, executive directors and key senior executives may receive each year a cash payment and/
or be granted a share award under the terms of the Deferred Bonus Plan, based on the value of an economic profit pool (the ‘Pool’). The 
value of the Pool is determined by the economic profit (calculated as profit after tax less the cost of capital employed) created in each 
financial year, the percentage of economic profit paid into the Pool each year being determined by the achievement of economic profit 
targets set annually based on the business plan, with 2.5% of economic profit being paid into the Pool for achievement of the minimum 
economic profit target, 5% of economic profit being paid into the Pool for achievement of the target economic profit and 7.5% of economic 
profit being paid into the Pool for achievement of the maximum economic profit target. One third of the Pool is then distributed to 
participants each year (allocated in the proportion of each participant’s base salary to the participants’ total base salaries) and two thirds is 
carried forward to form part of the Pool for the following year. The main objectives of the plan are to retain key executives and to incentivise 
the executive management team to generate profits over and above the Group’s cost of capital. The Committee may at any time amend or 
terminate the plan and, in the event of a material misstatement of the financial results, may within a period of one year require participants 
to reimburse to the Company part or all of any payments received. 
For the year under review, each of the executive directors was able to receive an allocation of up to 50% of base salary. It is current policy 
that half of the annual payout is in cash and half is in the form of shares, the receipt of which is deferred for two years (see Deferred Bonus 
Plan below). However, the Committee reserves the right to change these proportions for future years in light of the circumstances prevailing 
at the time.
 
The economic profit generated in the year to 31 August 2013 resulted in a contribution to the Pool of £932,880, bringing the total value  
of the Pool to £1,953,102. In respect of the year ended 31 August 2013, of this Pool, Mark Cashmore will receive £169,294, representing 
43.4% of base salary, Nick Gresham will receive £117,872, representing 44.1% of base salary and Jonathan Bunting will receive £120,542, 
representing 44.6% of base salary. Of these payouts, half will be paid in cash in November 2013 and half will be paid in the form of shares 
under the terms of the Deferred Bonus Plan.
Deferred Bonus Plan
Under this plan, executive directors and key senior executives may be granted each year share awards (in the form of nil cost options) 
representing a proportion of the bonuses earned under the Annual Bonus Plan and/or Economic Profit Plan. The awards are normally 
exercisable after a holding period of two years, subject to continued employment. The Committee may at any time amend the plan. 
Following the review of executive remuneration arrangements carried out during the year, for awards granted from FY2013/14, it is 
proposed to provide for dividend equivalents further to strengthen alignment with shareholders’ interests. For the avoidance of doubt, the 
operation of dividend equivalents will be in line with best practice. Hence an amount equal to dividends paid during the holding period will 
be paid retrospectively at the end of the holding period, either in cash or in shares, but only on the number of shares that ultimately vest. 
No dividends will be accrued on any part of an award that lapses.
As described under Annual Bonus Plan and Economic Profit Plan, for performance in the year under review, Mark Cashmore, Nick 
Gresham and Jonathan Bunting will be granted share awards under this plan with market values at the date of grant of £87,178, £64,254 
and £64,854 respectively in connection with the Annual Bonus Plan and £84,647, £58,936 and £60,271 respectively in connection with  
the Economic Profit Plan. These awards will be granted in November 2013.
Long-term incentives
Smiths News LTIP
Under this plan, executive directors and key senior executives may be awarded each year conditional entitlements to ordinary shares in the 
Company (in the form of nil cost options) or, in order to retain flexibility and at the Company’s discretion, a cash sum linked to the value of  
a notional award of shares up to a value of 200% of base salary. Current policy is to grant awards up to a maximum of 50% of base salary.
The Committee may at any time amend (subject to the approval of shareholders if the proposed amendments are to the advantage of 
existing or new participants) or terminate the plan. In the event of a material misstatement of the financial results or the gross misconduct  
of an award holder, the Committee may prior to the issue or transfer of shares reduce, cancel or impose further conditions on an award,  
or after the issue or transfer of shares may take such action as it considers appropriate to put the Company and the awardholder in 
substantially the same overall financial position as they would have been in if the circumstances had occurred before the issue or  
transfer of shares. 
Following the review of executive remuneration arrangements carried out during the year, for awards granted from FY2013/14, it is 
proposed, subject to shareholder approval at the AGM in January 2014, to provide for dividend equivalents further to strengthen alignment 
with shareholders’ interests. The operation of dividend equivalents will be in line with best practice, hence an amount equal to dividends 
paid during the performance period will be paid retrospectively at the end of the performance period, either in cash or in shares, but only 
on the number of shares that ultimately vest. No dividends will be accrued on any part of an award that lapses.

Corporate governance
In the year under review, each executive director received an award to the value of 50% of base salary. This will remain the same for awards 
to be granted in November 2013. 
The vesting of awards is subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition, which is determined by the Remuneration Committee  
at the time of grant. The Committee believes that for executive directors and senior executives EPS is the most appropriate measure  
of the Company’s performance. 
For awards granted on 26 November 2009, 11 August 2011, 17 November 2011 and 15 November 2012, the performance condition is 
based on the Company’s aggregate EPS over the three years ended 31 August 2012, three years ended 31 August 2013, three years 
ending 31 August 2014 and three years ending 31 August 2015 respectively (the ‘Performance Period’), as set out in the following table.

1 Owing to the Company being in a prohibited period while negotiating the acquisition of Dawson Holdings PLC, and subsequently awaiting HMRC guidance on the operation  
of the Disguised Remuneration legislation enacted on 19 July 2011, the 2010 awards, which would normally have been granted in November 2010, were not granted until 
11 August 2011.
For the purposes of the above targets, EPS is determined by reference to basic earnings per share, as defined by IAS 33, before  
non-recurring items and their associated tax impact, adjusted by the Committee as considered appropriate to ensure consistency.
Measured on the basis described above, aggregate EPS over the three years ended 31 August 2012 is 50p, and resulted in 100% of the 
awards granted on 26 November 2009 being exercisable from 16 October 2012.
Aggregate EPS over the three years ended 31 August 2013 is 57.8p, and has resulted in 100% of the awards granted on 11 August 2011 
being exercisable from 16 October 2013.
Smith News share option schemes
The Company operates two types of share option scheme:
a) an Executive Share Option Scheme which is used to grant options to executives up to an annual limit of 200% of base salary. Options 
granted in November 2008 are only exercisable if the Company’s underlying profit before tax for the year ended 31 August 2011 exceeds 
£30m. As the Company’s underlying profit before tax for the year ended 31 August 2011 is £38.6m, these options became exercisable 
from 27 November 2011. Options granted in November 2009 are only exercisable if the Company’s underlying profit before tax for the 
year ended 31 August 2012 exceeds £30.5m. As the Company’s underlying profit before tax for the year ended 31 August 2012 is 
£47.5m, these options became exercisable from 26 November 2012. Options granted in June 2011 are only exercisable if the Company’s 
underlying profit before tax for the year ended 31 August 2013 exceeds £35m. As the Company’s underlying profit before tax for the year 
ended 31 August 2013 is £53m, these options will be exercisable from 15 June 2014. Options granted in November 2011 will only be 
exercisable if the Company’s underlying profit before tax for the year ending 31 August 2014 exceeds £38.6m and options granted 
in November 2012 will only be exercisable if the Company’s underlying profit before tax for the year ending 31 August 2015 exceeds 
£47.5m. The Committee will conduct its annual review of the performance condition prior to the grant of options in November 2013.  
The executive directors did not participate in this Scheme in the financial year ended 31 August 2013 and will not participate in the 
current financial year; and
b) an HM Revenue and Customs Approved Save-As-You-Earn share option scheme (the ‘Sharesave Scheme’). The Sharesave Scheme  
is open to all employees who have completed one year’s service and who enter an approved savings contract for a term of three years. 
The maximum amount which can be saved is £250 per month, the total savings at the end of the term being used to purchase shares  
at 80% of their market value at the start of the savings contract. In common with most schemes of this type, there are no performance 
conditions applicable to options granted under the Sharesave Scheme.

WH Smith Executive Share Option Scheme 1999 (pre-demerger)
For options granted in 2004 and 2005, prior to the demerger of WH Smith Retail on 31 August 2006, the performance condition is based 
on the Company’s adjusted EPS growth over a fixed three-year period, the proportion of options that become exercisable increasing on  
a straight-line basis from 40% for growth of RPI plus 9% to 100% for growth of RPI plus 15%.
For those options granted in November 2004, adjusted EPS growth exceeded RPI plus 15% over the three-year period ended 
31 August 2007 and, as such, these options became exercisable in full on 3 November 2007.
For those options granted in November 2005, adjusted EPS growth exceeded RPI plus 15% over the three-year period ended 
31 August 2008 and, as such, these options became exercisable in full on 2 November 2008.
Personal shareholdings
The Company’s shareholding guidelines were introduced in January 2009 and, following the review of remuneration arrangements carried 
out during the year, now require executive directors to build up over a period of five years and then maintain a target holding of ordinary 
shares of 150% of salary (previously 100% of salary) and other members of the executive management team to build up over a period of 
five years and then maintain a target holding of 100% of salary (previously 75% of salary) and until that level is reached, except for payment 
of tax arising on the exercise of awards and other exceptional circumstances, they will not be allowed to sell shares beyond 25% of shares 
vesting under share incentive arrangements.
In exceptional circumstances, executive directors may seek permission from the Remuneration Committee temporarily to go below their 
target holding. During the year Jonathan Bunting was given permission by the Remuneration Committee to sell his holding of 180,174 
shares in order to part-fund his relocation on the understanding that he would build up a holding of 100% of salary as soon as possible  
and a holding of 150% of salary by June 2018.
Contracts of service
The contract dates and notice periods for each executive director are as follows:
Date of contract Notice period by Company Notice period by director
Jonathan Bunting 1 April 2010 One year Nine months
Mark Cashmore 5 September 2013 One year Nine months
Nick Gresham 23 August 2010 One year Nine months
It is the Company’s policy to enter into contracts of employment with executive directors which may be terminated at any time by the 
Company upon twelve months’ notice and upon nine months’ notice by the executive director. The Committee believes that any question 
of compensation should be decided upon at the appropriate time rather than in advance so that the principle of mitigation is applied in the 
particular circumstances.
As part of the review of executive directors’ remuneration carried out during the year, the liquidated damages provision on a change of 
control in the service contract of Mark Cashmore has been removed.
 
The Chairman and other non-executive directors, who have letters of appointment, are appointed for an initial term of three years, which 
may be terminated at any time upon three months’ written notice on either side, and are subject to review thereafter. The letters of 
appointment of the non-executive directors are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office during normal business hours 
and at the AGM. 
Smiths News Employee Benefit Trust
The Smiths News Employee Benefit Trust is used to facilitate the acquisition of ordinary shares in the Company for the purpose of satisfying 
awards and options granted under the Company’s executive share schemes. The Trust is a discretionary trust, the sole beneficiaries being 
employees (including executive directors) and former employees of the Company. The Trust waives its right to vote and to dividends on  
the shares that it holds. The Trustee is Computershare Trustees (Jersey) Limited, an independent professional trustee company based  
in Jersey.
The number of shares held in the Smiths News Employee Benefit Trust at 31 August 2013 was 1,070,854. The accounting treatment  
is shown in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity on page 64.  56 Smiths News PLC
Corporate governance
Dilution limits
Share awards and executive share options are satisfied using market purchase shares. The Company’s share plans comply with 
recommended guidelines on dilution limits and the Company has always operated within these limits.
Pensions
For the year under review, the Company operated two defined contribution pension schemes, the money purchase section of the 
WH Smith Pension Trust, for those employees who were active members of the defined benefit section of the WH Smith Pension Trust on 
1 May 2007 and the WH Smith Retirement Savings Plan. The Company ceased service accruals for active members of the defined benefit 
pension scheme on 1 May 2007. 
Jonathan Bunting participates in the money purchase section of the WH Smith Pension Trust. The other executive directors participate  
in the Smiths News section of the WH Smith Retirement Savings Plan. Under these plans an executive director may contribute up to  
an amount equivalent to 5% of salary which is then matched by the Company. In addition, a salary supplement, in respect of pension 
entitlement, is also payable which may be taken as an additional pension contribution or as an addition to basic pay. On 1 January 2013, 
Mark Cashmore’s salary supplement was reduced from 25% of salary to 15% of salary and Jonathan Bunting’s and Nick Gresham’s salary 
supplement was reduced from 20% of salary to 15% of salary.
External appointments
It is the Company’s policy to allow each executive director to accept one non-executive directorship of a publicly quoted company provided 
that it is not a chairmanship of a FTSE 100 company and it does not conflict with the interests of the Company. Executive directors may 
retain the fee for such an appointment. The executive directors do not currently hold any non-executive directorships.
Consultation with shareholders and investor representative bodies 
It is the Company’s policy to consult with major shareholders and investor representative bodies, and to carefully consider any feedback 
received, prior to making significant changes to executive remuneration arrangements.
In accordance with the revised directors’ remuneration reporting regulations, the Company’s remuneration policy, to be set out in the 
prescribed format in next year’s Annual Report, will be the subject of a binding vote at the AGM to be held in January 2015.

This final dividend, together with the interim dividend of 3.0p per 
ordinary share paid on 12 July 2013, makes a total dividend of  
9.3p per ordinary share for the year ended 31 August 2013  
(FY2012: 8.6p).
Share capital
The Company’s issued share capital as at 31 August 2013

the Company, to appoint one or more proxies (or if they are 
corporations to appoint corporate representatives) and exercise 
voting rights, to receive a dividend subject to the deduction of any 
sums due from the holder of ordinary shares to the Company on 
account of calls or otherwise, and on a liquidation may share in the 
assets of the Company. There are no restrictions on the transfer

shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of 
ordinary shares or that may result in restrictions on voting rights.
The Trustee of the Smiths News Employee Benefit Trust holds 
ordinary shares of the Company on behalf of the beneficiaries of the 
Trust, who are the employees and former employees of the Group.  
If any offer is made to the holders of ordinary shares to acquire their

offer it thinks fair. The Trustee waives its right to vote and to 
dividends on the shares that it holds.

shareholders at the AGM in 2014 to renew the authority for a  
further year.

Corporate governance
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the directors are required  
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by 
the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have 
elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable 
law). Under company law the directors must not approve the 
accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Company for that period. 
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the directors 
are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 – make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 – state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
 – prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
 – properly select and apply accounting policies;
 – present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
 – provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
 – make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may  
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 – the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant 
financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
 – the management report, which is incorporated into the directors’ 
report, includes a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face.

Directors’ responsibilities statement
The directors are responsible for preparing the  
Annual Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 61 Smiths News PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2013

PLC for the year ended 31 August 2013 which comprise Group 
Income Statement, the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
the Group Balance Sheet, the Group Statement of Changes in 
Equity, the Group Cash Flow Statement and the related notes 1 to 
34. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the company and the company’s members  
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions  
we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the group 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true  
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the group financial statements in accordance with applicable  
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).  
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify 
any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or 
materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the group financial statements:
 – give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as  
at 31 August 2013 and of its profit for the year then ended;
 – have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs  
as adopted by the European Union; and
 – have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of  
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB
As explained in note 1 to the group financial statements, the group 
in addition to complying with its legal obligation to apply IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union, has also applied IFRSs as issued 
by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’).
In our opinion the group financial statements comply with IFRSs  
as issued by the IASB.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies  
Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the 
financial year for which the group financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters  
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
 – certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law  
are not made; or
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 – the directors’ statement, contained within the Directors’ Report,  
in relation to going concern;
 – the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and
 – certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board  
on directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial 
statements of Smiths News PLC for the year ended 31 August 2013 
and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is 
described as having been audited.

Notes to the Accounts
1. Accounting policies
(a) Basis of consolidation
Smiths News PLC (‘the Company’) is a company incorporated in the UK under Companies Act 2006. The Group accounts for the year 
ended 31 August 2013 comprise the Company and, its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’) and the Group’s interests in jointly 
controlled entities and associates. Subsidiary undertakings acquired during the period are included in the Group accounts from the date  
of acquisition. All significant subsidiary accounts are made up to 31 August and are included in the Group accounts. Further to the IAS 
Regulation (EC 1606/2002) the Group accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union (‘adopted IFRS’) with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS. The Company accounts continue to be prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (‘UK GAAP’) 
and details of the Company accounts, notes to the accounts and principal accounting policies are set out on pages 103 to 106.
The accounts were authorised for issue by the directors on 16 October 2013.
(b) Basis of preparation
Accounting basis of preparation
The accounts are prepared on the historical cost basis except certain financial instruments detailed below and are presented in Pound 
Sterling and rounded to £0.1m, except where otherwise indicated. Certain figures in this document may not tally exactly due to rounding.
The Group accounts have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted for use by the European Union.
Intra-group balances and unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in 
preparing Group accounts. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with the jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the 
Group’s interest in the entities. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains.
Going concern
As detailed in Note 20, at the year end the Group had committed bank facilities in place of £142m, plus additional flexibility to secure further 
borrowings on Group assets of up to £35m. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonable potential variations in 
trading performance and the Group’s negative working capital position, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of 
its current financing for the foreseeable future.
Despite the uncertain economic environment the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its 
consolidated financial statements.
Business combinations and goodwill
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The cost of an acquisition is measured at the 
fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued, liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Acquisition related costs 
are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Any deferred or contingent purchase consideration is recognised at fair value over the period of 
entitlement. If the contingent purchase consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for in equity. 
Any deferred or contingent payment deemed to be remuneration as opposed to purchase consideration in nature is recognised in profit  
or loss as incurred, and excluded from the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured, initially, at their fair values at the acquisition date, 
irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. The non-controlling interest is measured, initially, at the non-controlling interest’s 
proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. 
Goodwill arising on all acquisitions is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses. The carrying value is reviewed annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Intangible assets arising under a business combination (acquired intangibles) are capitalised at fair value as determined at the date of 
exchange and are stated at fair value less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation of acquired intangibles is 
charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives as follows:
 – Customer relationships – 2.5 to 11 years
 – Trade name – 5 to 10 years
 – Software and development costs – 3 to 7 years
Computer software and internally generated development costs which are not integral to the related hardware are capitalised separately  
as an intangible asset and stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Assets held under finance leases are amortised over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over 
the term of the relevant lease. All intangible assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’ when 
there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 67 Smiths News PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
1. Accounting policies continued
(b) Restatement of retirement benefit obligation
During the year the Group reconsidered its accounting for deficit contributions of pension schemes and has amended its accounting to 
recognise future agreed deficit contributions as an IFRIC 14 liability on the balance sheet. Accordingly in the FY2013 financial statements, 
we have recognised the present value of the schedule of contributions as a liability of £20.3m and a resulting tax asset of £4.3m on our 
balance sheet at 31 August 2013. We have also restated our prior year financial statements recognising a liability of £34.0m and resulting 
deferred tax asset of £8.2m at 31 August 2012 and £36.3m liability and deferred tax asset of £9.1m as at 31 August 2011.
There is no impact on earnings, cash flows (including tax payments) or covenants. The impact of the restatement as at 31 August 2011  
is shown in Note 34.
(c) Estimates and judgements
The preparation of accounts requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of 
accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The significant judgements made in the accounts for the year ended 31 August 2013 are:
Retirement benefit obligation
The Group recognises and discloses its retirement benefit obligation in accordance with the measurement and presentational requirement 
of IAS 19 ‘Retirement Benefit Obligations’. The calculations include a number of judgements and estimations in respect of the expected 
rate of return on assets, the discount rate, inflation assumptions, the rate of increase in salaries and life expectancy, amongst others. 
Changes in these assumptions can have a significant effect on the value of the retirement benefit obligation. Management make these 
judgements in consultation with an independent actuary.
In order to substantially reduce the volatility in the underlying investment performance and reduce the risk of a significant increase in the 
obligation, the Pension Trust Trustee has adopted a Liability Driven Investment policy. This is discussed in more detail in Note 6.
Impairment of Goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which goodwill has been 
allocated. The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash generating unit 
and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. No impairment loss was recognised as the present value of the goodwill 
was greater than the carrying amount that was held on the balance sheet. Details of the value in use calculation are provided in Note 11b.
Valuation of acquired intangibles
The valuation of acquired intangibles requires an estimation of value based on discounted future cash flows. The cash flows modelled 
represent the stand alone business acquired and do not include any synergies that may be available to the Group. The discount rate used 
is specific to each class of asset and specific to each acquisition.
Returns reserve
The Group makes provisions against the sales and cost of sales on the supply of newspapers and magazines on a sale or return basis. 
The provision is calculated in accordance with historical experience.
Onerous property contracts
Property provisions require an estimate to be made of the net present value of the future costs of vacant and sublet properties. The 
calculation includes estimates of future cost involved, including management’s estimate of the long-term letting potential of the properties. 
Potential liabilities could crystallise in respect of previous assignments of leases where the liability could revert to the Group if the lessee 
defaulted. Pursuant to the terms of the Demerger Agreement any such contingent liability in respect of assignment prior to the demerger 
which becomes an actual liability will be apportioned between Smiths News PLC and WH Smith PLC in the ratio 35:65 (provided that the 
actual liability of Smiths News PLC in any 12 month period does not exceed £5m). The exposure to leases is reviewed on a regular basis 
and provisions are made when management estimate that it is probable that economic outflow will result.
Taxation judgements
The Group provides for known tax risks (both UK and overseas) based upon the best estimate of the economic outflow. 68 Smiths News PLC

Notes to the Accounts continued
1. Accounting policies continued
(d) Adjusted measures
The Group uses certain measures for internal reporting purposes and employee incentive arrangements. The terms ‘net debt’, ’free cash 
flow’, ‘underlying profit’, ‘EBITDA’ and ‘non-recurring and other items’ are not defined terms under IFRS and may not be comparable with 
similar measures disclosed by other companies.
The following are the key non-IFRS measures identified by the Group:
Underlying profit
Profit before non-recurring and other items.
Non-recurring and other items
Non-recurring and other items are material items of income or expense and include certain M&A related or business restructuring costs 
relating to strategy changes which are not normal operating costs of the underlying business. They are disclosed and described separately 
in the accounts where it is necessary to do so to provide further understanding of the financial performance of the Group.
Free cash flow
Free cash flow is calculated as Group underlying operating profit adjusted for depreciation, amortisation, movements in working capital, 
capital expenditure, net interest, tax and cash pension funding and excludes non-recurring items, dividends, new finance lease, share 
purchases and any acquisition related costs.
EBITDA
EBITDA is calculated as operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and non-recurring items.
In line with loan agreements EBITDA used for covenant calculations is calculated as operating profit before depreciation, amortisation, 
non-recurring items and share-based payments charge but after adjusting for the last 12 months of profits for any acquisitions or disposals 
made in the year.
Net debt
Net debt is calculated as total debt less cash and cash equivalents. Total debt includes loans and borrowings, overdrafts and obligations 
under finance leases.
(e) Revenue
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed. Revenue represents the amounts receivable 
for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, returns, VAT and other sales related taxes.
(f) Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after charging restructuring costs and after the share of results of associates but before investment income and 
finance costs.
(g) Taxation
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is the expected tax payable based on the 
taxable profit for the year, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and any adjustment to tax payable  
in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is 
calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred 
tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profits will be available against which these temporary differences can be utilised.
(h) Dividends
Interim and final dividends are recorded in the financial statements in the period in which they are paid.
(i) Capitalisation of internally generated development costs
Expenditure on developed software is capitalised when the Group is able to demonstrate all of the following: the technical feasibility of the 
resulting asset; the ability (and intention) to complete the development and use it; how the asset will generate probable future economic 
benefits; and the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the asset during its development. Management estimates the 
future sales and long-term operating margins of the asset. 69 Smiths News PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
1. Accounting policies continued
(j) Jointly controlled entities and associates
The Group Accounts include the Group’s share of the total recognised gains and losses in its joint controlled entities and associates on an 
equity accounted basis.
Investments in jointly controlled entities and associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost adjusted by post-acquisition changes  
in the Group’s share of the net assets of the jointly controlled entities and associates, less any impairment losses. The carrying values of 
investments in jointly controlled entities and associates include acquired goodwill. Losses in a jointly controlled entity or associate in excess 
of the Group’s interest in the jointly controlled entity or associate are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or 
constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the jointly controlled entity or associate.
(k) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses. No 
depreciation has been charged on freehold land. Other assets are depreciated, to a residual value, on a straight-line over their estimated 
useful lives, as follows:
 – Freehold and long-term leasehold properties – over 20 years
 – Short-term leasehold properties – shorter of the lease period and the estimated remaining economic life
 – Fixtures and fittings – 3 to 15 years
 – Equipment – 5 to 12 years
 – Computer equipment – up to 5 years
 – Vehicles – up to 5 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, 
over the term of the relevant lease. All property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment  
of Assets’ when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
(l) Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Property, plant and equipment held under finance leases is capitalised in the 
balance sheet at the lower of cost or present value of the minimum lease payments and is depreciated over its useful life. The capital 
elements of future obligations under leases are included as liabilities in the balance sheet. Lease payments are apportioned between 
finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of return on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The benefits of rent free periods 
and similar incentives are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the full lease term.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains  
or losses reported in the income statement.
(m) Inventories
Inventories comprise goods held for resale and are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Inventories are valued using a 
weighted average cost method. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have 
been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
(n) Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their fair value. They are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement when there  
is evidence that the asset is impaired.
(o) Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate 
method.
(p) Treasury
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity  
of three months or less.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments 
issued are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 70 Smiths News PLC
Financial statements
Notes to the Accounts continued
1. Accounting policies continued
Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value (being proceeds received, net of direct issue costs), and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. Finance charges, including premiums payable on 
settlement or redemptions and direct issue costs are accounted for on an accruals basis and taken to the income statement using the 
effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying value of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period  
in which they arise.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to interest rate movements. The Group does not hold derivative 
financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative is entered into and are subsequently 
re-measured at fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated  
as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedging instrument, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative 
financial instrument is recognised directly in equity. The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income 
statement. When the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability the associated 
cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and included in the initial cost of the non-financial asset or liability. When the forecast 
transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or liability, the associated cumulative gain or loss that was 
recognised directly in equity is reclassified into the income statement in the same period during which the asset acquired or liability 
assumed affects the income statement. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments, where they are not designated  
as hedging instruments, are recognised in the income statement as operating costs.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for  
hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the 
forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity 
is transferred to the net income or expense for the year.
Foreign currencies
Financial statements of foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition of a foreign entity are 
treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The 
revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the period where this rate approximates to the foreign 
exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Net investment in foreign operations
Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations, and of related qualifying hedges are taken directly to equity.  
They are recycled into the income statement upon disposal.
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign 
exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured 
in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the 
fair value was determined.
(q) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that 
an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and if this amount is capable of being reliably estimated. If such an 
obligation is not capable of being reliably estimated, no provision is recognised and the item is disclosed as a contingent liability where 
material. Where the effect is material, the provision is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows. 71 Smiths News PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
1. Accounting policies continued
(r) Retirement benefit costs
The Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes for the benefit of its employees. Payments to the Group’s schemes, are 
recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred. The Group operates three defined benefit pension schemes. The two 
largest schemes, The WH Smith Pension Trust and The Consortium Care Scheme are closed to further accrual. The charge to the Group 
of providing benefits for these two schemes is determined by the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial calculations being carried 
out at the balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income. The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value  
of the defined benefit obligation adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
The WH Smith Pension Trust is closed to further accrual and given the LDI policy adopted by the Pension Trustee, the present value  
of the economic benefits of the IAS 19 surplus in the pension scheme of £53.2m (FY2012: £40.3m) available on a reduction of future 
contributions is £nil (FY2012: £nil). The Group recognises an onerous liability for the future agreed deficit contributions, a liability of  
£20.3m (FY2012: £34.0m).
A Prudential Platinum scheme for the benefit of the ex WMS employees has been put in place, the costs of providing the benefits are taken 
to the income statement.
(s) Employee Benefit Trust
Smiths News Employee Benefit Trust
The shares held by the Smiths News Employee Benefit Trust are valued at the historical cost of the shares acquired. This value is deducted 
in arriving at shareholders’ funds and presented as another reserve in line with IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’.
(t) Share schemes
Share-based payments
The Group operates several share-based payment schemes, the largest of which are the Sharesave Scheme, the Executive Share Option 
Plan, the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and the Deferred Bonus Plan. Details of these are provided in the Remuneration report.
Equity-settled share-based schemes are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value is expensed with a corresponding 
increase in equity on a straight-line basis over the period during which employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair 
values are calculated using an appropriate option pricing model. The income statement charge is then adjusted to reflect expected and 
actual levels of vesting based on non-market performance related criteria.
Administrative expenses and distribution and marketing expenses include the cost of the share-based payment schemes.
(u) Changes in accounting policies
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations that are potentially relevant to the 
Group and which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet 
been adopted by the EU).
 – Amendments to IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’
 – IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments Classification and measurement’ – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015
 – IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes – Limited Scope Amendment’
 – IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’
 – IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’
 – IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interest in Other Entities’
 – IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’

Financial statements
Notes to the Accounts continued
1. Accounting policies continued
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the 
financial statements of the Group, except for the following IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, which will introduce a number of changes in the 
presentation of financial instruments, IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ which will impact the measurement of fair value of certain assets 
and liabilities, IAS 1 ‘Amendments to presentation of Other Comprehensive Income’ which will impact the presentation of financial 
statements. This will impact the presentation of various items within the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income by requiring the 
separation of items that will later be reclassified through the Consolidated Income Statement from those that will never pass through the 
Consolidated Income Statement.
IAS 19 (as revised in June 2011) ‘Employee Benefits’ will be adopted by the Group for the financial year commencing 1 September 2013 
The interest cost and expected return on defined-benefit pension scheme assets used in the previous version of IAS 19 are replaced with  
a ‘net interest’ amount, which is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. Furthermore, IAS 19 
(revised) also introduces more extensive disclosures in the presentation of the defined benefit cost, including the separate disclosure  
of the scheme’s administrative expenses.
If IAS 19 (revised) had been applied to these financial statements, the profit for the year would have been approximately £2.5m lower.  
Its adoption for the year to 31 August 2014 is expected to reduce the profit similarly by approximately £2.5m. To aid comparison,  
in the 31 August 2014 Financial Statements, the 31 August 2013 comparatives will be restated as if IAS 19 (revised) had applied.
2. Segmental analysis
In accordance with IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, Group management has identified its operating segments. The performance of these

During the year the Group commissioned an extension of the digital strategy review of the books market to consider technology and 
market entry strategies. After careful consideration of proposals from a number of providers the Board appointed a Deloitte digital strategy 
team based on market understanding, service and price.
As signalled in last year’s Annual Report and Accounts the Board held a tender for the provision of external audit services during the year. 
Three audit firms were invited to tender, including the incumbent Deloitte LLP. A panel including the Chairman of the Audit Committee, the 
Chief Financial Officer and other senior members of the finance function considered a written submission and oral presentation from each 
of the firms. As a result the Audit Committee recommended to the Board the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP.

The Group incurred a total of £9.8m in non-recurring and other costs, after tax. This comprises:
Integration costs
Integration costs of £1.1m have been incurred, including £0.6m relating to the integration of West Mercia Supplies into The Consortium,  
and £0.4m has been incurred in developing the digital and international strategy in Bertrams which has been invested to roll out the digital 
platform into European markets.
Network reorganisation costs
Network reorganisation costs of £3.3m have been incurred to achieve the current network restructuring programme which is designed to

profit performance. Acquisition and new venture set up costs in respect of Erasmus, selected contracts from Blackwell Books Limited and 
Bertrams direct to consumer proposition were £0.5m.
Amortisation of acquired intangibles
Amortisation of acquired intangibles of £2.8m have been incurred relating to acquisitions amortised over their expected economic lives for

6. Retirement benefit obligation
Defined benefit pension schemes
The Group operates three defined benefit schemes, of which the WH Smith Pension Trust (the ‘Pension Trust’) represents over 96% of the 
total obligation at 31 August 2013. As part of the acquisition of The Consortium, the Group acquired the assets and liabilities in respect of 
two other defined benefit schemes (the ‘Consortium CARE’ and ‘Platinum’ schemes).

The primary defined benefit pension scheme (the Smiths News section of the WH Smith Pension Trust) has an IAS 19 surplus of £53.2m at 
31 August 2013 (FY2012: £40.3m surplus) which the Group does not recognise in the accounts as the investment policy being used means 
that the amount available on a reduction of future contributions is expected to be £nil (FY2012: £nil). The valuation of the defined benefit 
schemes for the IAS 19 disclosures have been carried out by independent qualified actuaries based on updating the most recent funding 
valuations of the respective schemes, adjusted as appropriate for membership experience and changes in the actuarial assumptions.
The actuarial valuation for funding purposes produces a scheme deficit due to different assumptions and calculation methodologies used 
compared to those under IAS 19, most notably the use of a discount rate that reflects the actual investment strategy, rather than corporate 
bond yields as required under IAS 19.
During the period the triennial actuarial valuation of the Smiths News section of the WH Smith Pension Trust, effective 31 March 2012 was 
agreed at £33.0m. The deficit in the scheme was £23.0m when last estimated at 19 June 2013, reduced from £50.0m at the last valuation 
date of March 2009. The next valuation date for the scheme will be 31 March 2015.
As a result of the reduced actuarial deficit, the Group has agreed a revised schedule of contributions of £4.1m per annum, reduced from 
£5.8m per annum, through to March 2019. The Group has amended its accounting for such contributions to now recognise the present 
value of the agreed contributions as a pension liability of £20.3m (FY2012 previously reported: £nil, FY2012 restated: £34.0m). Further 
details of this change, which has no impact on earnings, cash flow or covenants, are set out in Note 34.
The Group will adopt IAS 19 (Revised) in its financial year ending 31 August 2014. This will involve a change in accounting policy to reflect 
pension interest in the income statement to be calculated on the net balance sheet position at the beginning of the period. We estimate the 
resulting non-cash pension charge to be approximately £1.0m in the year ending 31 August 2014. The comparatives for the year ending 
31 August 2013 will be restated to also reflect a non-cash charge of £1.0m following this required change in accounting policy (compared 
to a £1.5m non-cash credit shown under the current policy, see Note 7).
Other defined benefit schemes
For the Consortium CARE and Platinum schemes, the Group contributed £0.3m in 2013. The next funding valuation of the Consortium 
CARE scheme is due on 31 December 2013. The results of the Platinum scheme’s 31 December 2012 funding valuation are not yet 
finalised.

and total return swap contracts and £116m in a fund comprising a range of assets from government bonds to hedge funds that targets a return above LIBOR.
2 The equity option portfolio represents a notional upside exposure to equities of around £140m.
The actual return on scheme assets during FY2013 was a gain of £45.5m (FY2012: a gain of £53.8m). The expected rate of return on these 
investments, calculated as a weighted average of the expected return on the individual asset classes was 4.3% p.a. at 31 August 2013 
(3.7% p.a. at 31 August 2012).

(b) Goodwill and intangibles by segment and CGU
Goodwill of £4.1m and acquired intangibles totalling £5.1m arose from the acquisition of the business and assets of Bertrams on 
20 March 2009 have been allocated to the Book wholesaling cash generating unit (‘CGU’).
The acquisition of Dawson Holdings PLC on 23 August 2011, resulted in goodwill of £18.1m and acquired intangibles of £7.8m. These have 
been allocated to the two remaining CGU’s identified at the time of the acquisition; Dawson Books and Media Direct.
On the acquisition of Hedgelane Limited on 24 April 2012, the Group recognised goodwill of £20.9m and acquired intangibles of £10.4m 
which have been allocated to the Education and Care cash generating unit.
The acquisition of 100% of the issued share capital of Houtschild Internationale Boekhandel B.V. on 13 June 2012 produced a further 
£0.3m of goodwill.
During the year the acquisition of Erasmus on 21 January 2013 generated £0.8m of goodwill and £0.3m of acquired intangible assets.  
The acquisition of certain Blackwell’s contracts on 16 April 2013 generated £2.0m of acquired intangibles.
Goodwill is not amortised, but tested annually for impairment with the recoverable amount being determined from value in use calculations. 
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are determined from the value in use calculations. The Group prepares cash flow 
forecasts derived from the most recent budgets and forecasts for the following 3 years as approved by the Board and extrapolates these 
cash flows on an estimated growth rate of 1% into perpetuity. The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows ranges from 13.9% to 
14.2%, being the Group’s risk adjusted pre-tax WACC, specific for each cash generating unit. Pre-tax discount rates are derived from the 
Group’s post-tax WACC of 9% risk adjusted by 2%. The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the discount rate and growth rates 
used. Management believes that no reasonable potential change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value to 
exceed its recoverable amount.

12. Acquisitions
FY2013
Acquisitions made during the year contributed £7.4m to the Group’s revenue and £0.3m to the Group’s operating profit before intangible 
amortisation and acquisition related costs.
The estimated contributions of acquired businesses to the results of the Group, as if the acquisitions had been made at the beginning of 
the year, are as follows:
£m
Revenue 12.4
Operating profit before intangible amortisation and acquisition related costs 0.5
The net cash outflow in respect of acquisitions in the year comprised:
£m
Cash consideration (3.2)
Cash acquired 0.7
Cash payments to former vendors for excess cash (0.3)
Net cash outflow in respect of acquisitions (2.8)
Acquisition related costs – current year acquisitions (0.3)
Acquisition related costs – deferred consideration relating to The Consortium acquisition made in April 2012 (2.0)
Total net cash outflow in respect of acquisitions (5.1)
Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The Group undertakes a process to identify the fair values  
of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, including the separate identification of intangible assets in accordance with IFRS 3 
‘Business Combinations’. Until this assessment is complete, the allocation period remains open up to the end of the financial year following 
the relevant acquisition date. At 31 August 2013, the allocation period for all acquisitions completed since 1 September 2012 remained 
open and accordingly the fair values presented are provisional.
During the year, the Group completed the following acquisitions which have been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3  
Business Combinations.
Erasmus
On 21 January 2013, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Erasmus Antiquariaat en Boekhandel B.V. (‘Erasmus’) via 
Dawson Books Ltd, a subsidiary of Bertram Trading Ltd.
Erasmus, based in the Netherlands, is a leading supplier of high quality books and journals into both academic libraries and Government 
Institutions mainly across Northern Europe. The acquisition provides additional scale, infrastructure and expertise as well as greater access 
to key customers and geographies which is consistent with our stated international expansion strategy and will further facilitate Dawson’s 
digital expansion outside of the UK.
The consideration was £1.2m and net cash received was £0.4m. The provisional fair value of net assets acquired totalled £0.1m.  
Acquired net assets comprised £0.2m of inventories, £2.0m of trade and other receivables, £0.7m of gross cash and £2.8m of trade  
and other payables.
The acquired trade and other receivables fair value of £2.0m had a gross contracted value of £2.1m, the best estimate at the acquisition 
date of the contractual cash flows not to be collected is £0.1m.
The acquisition gives rise to acquired intangibles of £0.3m and £0.8m of goodwill relating to future opportunities in the provision of 
academic book wholesaling. None of the provisional goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. 83 Smiths News PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
12. Acquisitions continued
FY2012
On 23 April 2012, Smiths News Holdings Limited acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Hedgelane Limited. Hedgelane Limited’s 
main trading subsidiary, the Consortium for Purchasing and Distribution Limited (‘The Consortium’) is a leading independent distributor of 
consumable products to the education sector and an emerging participant in the care sector. The fair values were finalised during FY2013 
and the resultant effect of the acquisition on the Group’s assets and liabilities is as follows:

The Consortium contributed £63.8m to revenue and £7.4m to the Group’s underlying operating profit before intangible amortisation and 
acquisition related costs in the year.
IFRS 3 requires that any payments that are contingent on future employment be charged to the income statement. £6m of deferred 
consideration is contingent on profit targets, £4m of which is contingent on the continued employment of the former owners of Hedgelane 
Limited. This comprises:
 – £2m in cash being the fair value of deferred consideration payable conditional on the financial performance and on contract of 
employment in the 5 month period from 24 April 2012 to 30 September 2012;
 – £2m of deferred share capital issuable conditional on the financial performance and continued employment in the 17 month period  
from 24 April 2012 to 30 September 2013; and
 – £2m of deferred share capital issuable conditional on continued employment in the 17 month period from 24 April 2012 to 
30 September 2013.
During the period the Group has incurred £3.2m of deferred consideration expense within non-recurring and other items on the income 
statement including £2.0m of cash paid to the vendor. A further £0.2m of expense is expected to be incurred in FY2014 being the final 
proportion of the deferred consideration.
13. Disposals
On 1 May 2013, the Group disposed of 100% of the share capital in Dawson Marketing Services Limited and its trading subsidiary 
Marketlink Marketing Communications Limited (‘MMC’) for £0.3m. Due to the nature and size of the business disposed investment,  
it has not been separately disclosed as a discontinued operation as defined by IFRS 5.
MMC contributed £3.9m to revenue and £0.1m to the Group’s operating profit in the year. 84 Smiths News PLC

Trade receivables
Total trade receivables net of allowances for doubtful debts held by the Group at 31 August 2013 amounted to £106.9m (FY2012: £97.8m), 
comprising the amounts presented above.
The average credit period taken on sale of goods is 19 days (FY2012: 23 days). Trade receivables are generally non-interest bearing. The 
Group has provided fully for all receivables over 90 days for independent customers as historical experience is such that receivables past 
due beyond 90 days are generally not recoverable. For larger multiple customers the Group provides for receivables on an individual 
customer basis based on circumstances known at that time and the likelihood of recovery.
Included in the outstanding trade receivables balance are debtors with an overdue amount of £9.5m (FY2012: £6.1m) that the Group has 
not provided for as these amounts are still considered recoverable and fall outside our pre-determined provisioning policy.

of these were £29.0m (FY2012: £30.3m); and
 – A further three (FY2012: three) customers had individual balances that represented more than 5% of the total trade receivables balance.

less. The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
Included within cash is £nil of restricted cash (FY2012: £0.4m).
The asset backed facility is secured by a floating charge over certain of the Group’s trade receivables.
Available Group bank facilities are outlined in Note 20. At 31 August 2013, the Group had £70.2m (FY2012: £76.9m) of undrawn committed 
borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedents had been met.
20. Financial instruments
Treasury policy
The Group operates a centralised treasury function to manage the Group’s funding requirements and financial risks in line with the Board 
approved treasury policies and procedures and their delegated authorities. Treasury’s role is to ensure that appropriate financing is 
available for running the businesses of the Group on a day to day basis, allowing for investments and acquisitions whilst minimising interest 
cost. No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken. Dealings are restricted to those banks with suitable credit ratings and 
counterparty risk and credit exposure is monitored frequently.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return 
to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which 
includes the borrowings, cash and cash equivalents as disclosed in Note 19 and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, 
comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
The gearing ratio based on market capitalisation at the year end is as follows:
£m Note 2013 2012
Net borrowings 19 96.7 98.0
Market Capitalisation 346.0 212.2
Net debt to equity ratio 27.9% 46.2%
Liquidity risk
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities and by monitoring forecast and actual cash 
flows. The facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk are as follows:
As at 31 August 2013, the Group had £177m committed bank facilities in place (FY2012: £180m). This reduced to £174m 
in September 2013 following a £3m scheduled debt repayment.
Bank facilities now comprise:
 – a £34m syndicated term loan with a further £4m repayable in September 2014 and the balance repayable in November 2014;
 – a £95m syndicated revolving credit facility which is also repayable in November 2014;
 – a £10m bilateral revolving credit facility entered into in July 2012 and repayable in August 2014;
 – a committed asset backed facility of up to £15m, secured against the debtors of Bertrams, repayable in November 2014; and
 – a committed asset backed facility of up to £20m, secured against the debtors of Smiths News, is repayable in November 2014. 88 Smiths News PLC

At 31 August 2013, the Group had available £70.2m (FY2012: £76.9m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities. There were no breaches 
of loan agreements during either the current or prior years.
As the Group is cash generative its liquidity risk is considered low. The Group’s cash generation allows it to meet all loan commitments as 
they fall due as well as sustain a negative working capital position.
The Group invests significant resources in the forecasting and management of its cash flows. This is critical given a routine cash cycle that 
results in significant predictable swings within each month of around £50m.
The following is an analysis of the undiscounted contractual cash flows payable under financial liabilities and derivatives. The undiscounted 
cash flows will differ from both the carrying value and fair value. Floating rate interest is estimated using the prevailing rate at the balance 
sheet date.

Counterparty risk
Dealings are restricted to those banks with suitable credit ratings and counterparty risk and credit exposure is monitored.
Foreign currency risk
 – The Group does not hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the income statement. The majority of the Group’s 
transactions are however carried out on the functional currencies of its operations, and so transactional exposure is limited.
 – The majority of the Group’s net assets are held in Sterling, with only £3.1m (FY2012: £2.5m) of net assets held in overseas currencies. 
Translation exposure arises on the retranslation of overseas subsidiaries profits and net assets into Sterling for financial reporting 
purposes and is not seen as significant.
 – Note 19 denotes borrowings by currency.
 – There are no material currency exposures to disclose.
Interest rate risk
The Group regularly monitors its exposure to interest rate risk. The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate 
movements on its bank borrowings. The Group avoids the use of derivatives or other financial instruments in circumstances when the 
outcome would effectively be largely dependent upon speculation on future rate movements. As at 31 August 2013, 100% of the Group’s 
borrowings were at fixed rates.
It is, and has been throughout the period of review, the Group’s policy that no trading in derivative financial instruments shall be undertaken. 89 Smiths News PLC

Hedge accounting
There are £60m of interest rate hedges in place until November 2014 and a further £60m in place until November 2017 contracted at an 
average effective rate of 3.5%.
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts 
calculated on agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the cash flow exposures on the issued 
variable rate debt held. The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is based on the market values of equivalent instruments  
at the balance sheet date, and is disclosed below. The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the 
financial year.
The following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding as at the 
reporting date:
Average contract  
fixed interest rate Notional principal amount Fair value

Outstanding receive floating, pay fixed contracts
Less than 1 year 1.6% 2.2% £120.0m £60.0m (£0.8m) (£1.0m)
2 to 5 years 1.0% 2.2% £120.0m £60.0m £0.4m (£1.3m)
The interest rate swaps are settled on a monthly basis. The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is 1 month LIBOR. The Group settles  
the difference between fixed and floating interest rates on a net basis. All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating rate interest 
amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting 
from variable interest rates on borrowings. The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the 
amount deferred in equity is recognised in the income statement over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt impact  
the income statement.
All derivative financial instruments are classified as level 2 based upon the degree to which the fair value movements are observable. Level 
2 fair value measurements are defined as those derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly (prices from third parties) or indirectly (derived from third party prices).

being recognised in finance costs with the remainder of the mark to market valuations being recognised in reserves. 90 Smiths News PLC

Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative 
instruments at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities the analysis assumes the amount of liability outstanding at the balance 
sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
If interest rates had been 0.5% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit and equity for the year ended 
31 August 2013 would decrease/increase by £0.4m (FY2012: £0.4m).
Credit risk
The Group considers its exposure to credit risk at 31 August 2013 to be as follows:
£m 2013 2012
Bank deposits 10.1 5.1
Trade receivables 106.9 97.8

Group policy is to acquire certain of its fixtures and equipment under finance leases. The average lease term is 3.5 years. Interest rates are 
fixed at the contract date. All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental 
payments.
The fair value of the Group’s lease obligations approximates their carrying amount.

The Company has capital losses carried forward of £23.9m (FY2012: £23.9m). Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect  
of the capital losses carried forward due to the uncertainty of their utilisation.
During the year the Group reconsidered its accounting for deficit contributions of pension schemes and has amended its accounting to 
recognise future agreed deficit contributions as an IFRIC 14 liability on the balance sheet. Accordingly in the 2013 financial statements,  
we have recognised the present value of the schedule of contributions as a liability of £20.3m and a resulting tax asset of £4.3m on our 
balance sheet at 31 August 2013. We have also restated our prior year financial statements recognising a liability of £34.0m and resulting 
deferred tax asset of £8.2m at 31 August 2012 and £36.3m liability and deferred tax asset of £9.1m as at 31 August 2011.
Other includes derivative financial instruments. Further details are provided in Note 20.
The Finance Act 2013, which provides for a reductions in the main rate of corporation tax from 23% to 21% effective from 1 April 2014 and 
to 20% effective from 1 April 2015, was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. These rate reductions have been reflected in the calculation 
of deferred tax at the balance sheet date. 92 Smiths News PLC

Reorganisation provisions include amounts for programmes, primarily redundancy costs, that have been announced prior to the year end 
where not all of the costs have been incurred.
Insurance provisions represent the expected future costs of employer’s liability, public liability and motor accident claims.
The property provision represents the estimated future cost of the Group’s onerous and reversionary leases in non-trading properties 
based on known and estimated rental sub-leases. This provision has been discounted at 8%, and this discount will be unwound over the 
life of the leases. The provision is expected to be utilised over the period to 2019, when all of the leases that have been provided against  
will have expired.
Deferred consideration relates to amounts provided in relation to the acquisition of Hedgelane Ltd on 23 April 2012, the cost is contingent 
upon future employment and is being recognised in line with the relevant time periods, see Note 12 for further details. 93 Smiths News PLC

Other potential liabilities that could crystallise are in respect of previous assignments of leases where the liability could revert to the Group  
if the lessee defaulted. Pursuant to the terms of the Demerger Agreement, any such contingent liability in respect of assignment prior  
to demerger, which becomes an actual liability, will be apportioned between Smiths News PLC and WH Smith PLC in the ratio 35:65 
(provided that the actual liability of Smiths News PLC in any 12 month period does not exceed £5m). The Company’s share of these leases 
has an estimated future cumulative gross rental commitment at 31 August 2013 of £8.4m (FY2012: £10.9m). This excludes the reversionary 
lease provision included within property provisions in Note 24.

The Group operates the following share incentive schemes:
Sharesave Scheme
Under the terms of the Smiths News Sharesave Scheme, the Board may grant options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company to 
eligible employees who enter into an HM Revenue & Customs approved Save-As-You-Earn (‘SAYE’) savings contract for a term of three or 
five years. Options are granted at a 20% discount to the market price of the shares on the day preceding the date of offer and are normally 
exercisable for a period of six months after completion of the SAYE contract.
Executive share option schemes (‘ESOS’)
Under the terms of the Smiths News Executive Share Option Scheme, the Board may grant options to purchase ordinary shares in the 
Company to executives up to an annual limit of 200% of base salary. The exercise of options is conditional on the achievement of a three 
year performance target, which is determined by the Remuneration Committee at the time of grant. Provided that the target is met, options 
are normally exercisable until the day preceding the 10th anniversary of the date of grant. As a result of the demerger of the WH Smith 
Retail business on 31 August 2006 all outstanding options under the unapproved part of the WH Smith Executive Share Option Scheme 
1999 were exchanged for new options over the Company’s shares.
Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
Under the terms of the Smiths News LTIP, executive directors and key senior executives may be awarded each year conditional 
entitlements to ordinary shares in the Company (in the form of nil cost options) or, in order to retain flexibility and at the Company’s 
discretion, a cash sum linked to the value of a notional award of shares up to a value of 200% of base salary. The vesting of awards is 
subject to the satisfaction of a three-year performance condition, which is determined by the Remuneration Committee at the time of grant. 
Subject to the satisfaction of the performance condition, awards are normally exercisable until the 10th anniversary of the date of grant. 97 Smiths News PLC

Deferred Bonus Plan (‘DBP’)
Under the terms of the Smiths News Deferred Bonus Plan, executive directors and key senior executives may be granted each year share 
awards (in the form of nil cost options) dependent on the achievement of the Annual Bonus Plan and Economic Profit Plan performance 
targets. Awards are normally exercisable after two years subject to continued employment.

34. Restatement of retirement benefit obligation
During the year the Group reconsidered its accounting for deficit contributions of pension schemes and has amended its accounting to 
recognise future agreed deficit contributions as an IFRIC 14 liability on the balance sheet. Accordingly in the 2013 financial statements, we 
have recognised the present value of the schedule of contributions as a liability of £20.3m and a resulting tax asset of £4.3m on our 
balance sheet at 31 August 2013. We have also restated our prior year financial statements recognising a liability of £34.0m and resulting 
deferred tax asset of £8.2m at 31 August 2012 and £36.3m liability and deferred tax asset of £9.1m as at 31 August 2011. There is no 
impact on net funds, cash flows (including tax payments) or covenants.
The impact on the Group’s statement of other comprehensive income for the year ended 31 August 2012 was as follows:

Financial statements
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Smiths 
News PLC for the year ended 31 August 2013 which comprise 
Parent Company Balance Sheet, the Parent Company 
Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders’ Funds and the related 
notes 1 to 7. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the company’s members , as a body,  
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the 
opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent 
company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give  
a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the parent company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the 
financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements.  
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
 – give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 
31 August 2013 and of its profit for the year then ended; and
 – have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and have been 
prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 
2006
In our opinion:
 – the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
 – the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year 
for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the parent company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where 
the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our 
opinion:
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
 – the parent company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 – certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law  
are not made; or
 – we have not received all the information and explanations  
we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements  
of Smiths News PLC for the year ended 31 August 2013.

Warning to shareholders (‘boiler room’ scams)
In recent years we have become aware of investors who have 
received unsolicited calls or correspondence, in some cases 
purporting to have been issued by us, concerning investment 
matters. These typically make claims of highly profitable 
opportunities in UK or US investments which turn out to be 
worthless or simply do not exist. These approaches are usually 
made by unauthorised companies and individuals and are 
commonly known as ‘boiler room’ scams. Investors are advised  
to be wary of any unsolicited advice or offers to buy shares.  
If it sounds too good to be true, it often is.
See the Financial Conduct Authority website www.fca.org.uk/
consumers/scams for more detailed information about this or  
similar activity.
Details of any share dealing facilities that the Company endorses  
will be included in Company mailings.
